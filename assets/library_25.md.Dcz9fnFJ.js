In the sequel to HONOR'S DESTINY we find out what happened to Cai McIntyre's daughter that was stolen from the hospital as a baby. Cai who is following leads to the whereabouts of her now nine year old daughter crashes her car during a hurricane into a parked car owned by a widower, Christopher St. Clair. Chris and his daughter, Melana are preparing to evacuate their home when the crash happens and a stunned and bleeding Cai collapses in front of Chris' daughter, Melana after saying the name Ashanti, which was her baby's name.Unable to leave they take refuge in the house to wait out the storm but when Cai awakens she has amnesia and don't know why she was there or where she got the bruises or cut that was on her arm. Chris figures that someone is after Cai and feels the need to protect her until they find out what is going on. A bond forms between the three, Chris, Cai and Melana.A great story with a twist at the end I didn't even think about.Can't wait until the third story in this trilogy of the McIntyre sisters. Great job Ms. Greggs. Buy the book and if you haven't already get Honor's Destiny too."},{"Title":"Sweetest Taboo (Arabesque)","review":"Cai is lady on a mission. Her daughter was taken from her when she was only a baby and as a result Cai has made it her life's work to find missing children, never giving up hope of finding her own sweet baby girl. Her search takes her to Biloxi, Mississippi where she collapses after receiving a head injury into the arms of Captain Christopher St. Clair. What happens from there is an emotional roller coaster ride for not only Chris but also his daughter Melana who has no idea that she may share a connection to Cai.Chris is immediately drawn to the beautiful Cai. Problem is she doesn't remember who she is and Chris is still emotionally tied to his dead wife Kimmie. Still he can't keep his distance from this damaged lady. When people start showing up after the hurricane looking for Cai, Chris's first instinct is to lie about her whereabouts. Cai's in danger and this officer and gentleman wants to keep her safe. But, when Cai sets off on her own Chris realizes that his feelings for Cai are getting stronger. But what will happen when secrets are revealed and memories return. Will Chris be able to keep Cai safe and will they be able to find out who wants to hurt Cai and why?This was a reasonably good read. What kept it from being great was the rather disjointed growth between Chris and Cai. It was start, stop start again which lead the reader to wonder exactly where the attraction was. The fact that Cai admitted to loving Chris before she even got her memory back was a tad unrealistic. Still this story was entertaining and the character of Melana was sweet and truly added depth to this read that at times seemed one-dimensional.Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"Title":"Sweetest Taboo (Arabesque)","review":"I will say that this book has a prequel, i believe it's called Destiny.

But I was disappointed in the \\"Northern California\\" edition. I know, it's a guide to \\"best\\" places and as such will probably lean heavily toward the pricier establishments. And Northern California tends to be a pricey place. But while most of the other \\"Best Places\\" books include a wide range of places, from great ethnic hole-in-the-wall eateries to five-star dining experiences, this particular volume just piles on the five-star recommendations. You'll be hard pressed to find, for example, a basic breakfast hangout, a good sandwich joint, and ESPECIALLY a lodging [for a reasonable price]. If all I want to do is patronize the trendiest and priciest, what do I need a guidebook for? Anyone can find the chic places; a guidebook should help a visitor nose out the less-discovered treasures. Also, the oh-so-trendy, oh-so-chic, been-there-done-that-seen-it-all-eaten-it-all tone of the writing gets a little wearing after awhile.

The restaurants descriptions are detailed and you really have a feeling for how the place is (ambiance and atmosphere) and what their food will taste like. Only the most exquisite restaurants and inns are listed and these are the places that always demand top dollars.This would make an awesome guide for newlyweds or the special-occasion traveler but not for your average monthly outing."},{"Title":"Best Places Northern California: Restaurants, Lodgings, Touring","review":"Top restaurants and lodgings throughout Northern California are rated and reviewed and range from lodgings and restaurants to tourist opportunities.

It is insightful and gives you a better understanding of what the apostles probably actually believed, instead of relying on today's various interpretations of church teachings. It also helps you decide which early manuscripts you might want to rely on, whether it be Textus Receptus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandria, Septuagint, Masoretic Text, etc, in that these early views of these writers will let you understand if a variance in these texts may be accurate or not, in a general sense, not a specific sense. It is not an easy read, and you won't get the above understanding unless you have some basic knowledge in undergraduate Bible School training."},{"Title":"The last of the Fathers: Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and the encyclical letter, Doctor Mellifluus (A Harvest/HBJ book)","review":"Late in his life, in May of 1953, Pope Pius XXII published this brief yet comprehensive examination of the Cistercian Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, entitling his encyclical The Mellifluous Doctor, underlining the placing this influential saint among the Doctors of the Church and the last of the early Church Fathers.With the delay of its complete publication in English, fellow Cistercian Father Thomas Merton received happily the task of writing a biographical and bibliographical introduction, which was published in 1954 after passing not only the Censor Librorum John M. A. Fearns, S.T.D., and receiving the Imprimatur of the great Francis Cardinal Spellman of New York (not Kentucky), but also having passing his own Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance's Censor Librorum, in Rome, and recieving the Imprimi Potest from the head of his Order, in Rome, Fr. Gabriel Sortais, about whom you may study more inDom Gabriel Sortais: An Amazing Abbot in Turbulent Times (Monastic Wisdom Series)by Solesmes's excellent and scholarly Fr. Guy Oury, OSB, in any unusual cross-Order celebration and appreciation. Fr. Sortais in fact contributes an opening word to this present book, as well as the Order's Cardinal Protector and Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide (Propagation of the Faith) Peter, Cardinal Fumasino-Biondi, who writes:\\"Into a world where fear and distrust run as a seemingly overpowering force, where men seek to rely on force and human strategy, our Holy Father, Pius XII, has injected once more the Christian call to hope and trust and reliance on divine love and strategy ( . . .) The teachings of Saint Bernard can be a beacon leading us, one and all, to love, for we were made to love, not to fear. 'God is love,' yesterday, today and forever.\\"No more welcome words may we hear today, except the long war is over.Thus, as was typical and necessary for the great American monk Father Merton's works, this treatise bears a double Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat.I came to this work as a result of reading the intriguing selection of correspondence exchanged between Father Merton and the Benedictine authority on monasticism Father Jean LeClercq, published asSurvival or Prophecy?: The Letters of Thomas Merton and Jean LeClercq. Dom LeClercq at that time was also writing about Saint Bernard, and is in fact poignantly cited in this present work by Father Merton. It is exciting to read their correspondence and realize the behind the scenes difficulties in, among other things, researching and producing this book.An interesting conundrum regarding the disclaimer which accompanies this double Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat, which declare the book free of doctrinal and moral error. If the disclaimer states the well-trained individuals involved in granting the here four official stamps of approval are not thereby implied in agreeing with its contents, does that not place them in danger of being supposed of being in agreement with moral and doctrinal error, and then what does that do to their official status?In any case Father Merton writes, free of doctrinal and moral error, an excellent and brief biography of great insight into this Saint and his theology, followed by an examination of his writings, many of which are recently available throughHoney and Salt: Selected Spiritual Writings of Bernard of ClairvauxandBernard of Clairvaux: Selected Works (Classics of Western Spirituality). Father Merton then, after frequent reference to the encyclical at hand, provides externsive notes and background upon its contents and writing.Father Merton in his Preface defines a \\"papal encyclical (as) . . .always a concise and fully authoritative summary of the teaching accepted and approved by the Church on a given subject. Doctor Mellifluous tells us what Saint Bernard means to the Church (p. 10).\\" Please notice the primacy of the Church as a whole in this: it is not a summary of the Pope's own opinions and feelings, but a summary of what is accepted by the Church as whole on any given subject. This is wherein the authority lies; it represents the thinking of the Church as a whole, not any individual member of that Church. The Pope here summarizes what \\"Bernard means to the Church.\\"Saint Bernard lived in the early eleventh century, upon the cusp of the Patristic and the modern eras of our ecclesiology. He thus \\"struck an altogether new note of hope and encouragement in medieval spirituality, and it is no exagerration to attribute to him the current of sweetness and joy that was to become in Francis of Assisi 'a stream of the river making the city of God joyful' (Psalm 45:5). (p. 11)\\"Father Merton concludes this Preface by stating this encyclical arrrives at a timely moment: \\"It seems fitting that it should now receive a wide dissemination, for nothing could be more timely than its timeless appeal for a return to genuine Christian charity, nourished by bearing fruit not so much in material works as in the true love for other men. (p. 14)\\"Father Merton has an interesting and timely study of Saint Bernard on the earliest Crusades, which he refused to support at the request of the Frankish King: \\"He formally refuses, adding that he will only undertake the task if commanded by the Pope (p. 39).\\" When the King goes over his head to the Pope, and the Pope gives this command, Saint Bernard's writings in this regard remain well within the limits of obedience to the Pope. He tries to propose military action as an effort to preserve the order established by God, and as Father Merton well points out: \\"The difficulty comes, of course, in determining just what political set-up, if any, represents the order established by God (p.41)\\"As Merton also demonstrates points out, those thus commissioned for this Crusade remained as vile and self-interested as ever, and the entire enterprise failed as a religious mission which it never was. Merton in fact has the best study on this aspect of Saint Bernard available. Merton continues that Saint Bernard \\"ought to have read the translation of the Koran which Peter the Venerable sent him, from Cluny, to study and to refute. Beranrd seems to have felt no need to know or to understand anything about Islam: as if knowing the Mohammedans to be 'pagans' were to know quite enough. But let us remember that Bernard belongs to the twelfth century, not to the twentieth (p.42).\\" as if in the twentieth century age of reason and enlightenment and logic, we would have studied before going to total war. Such niceties apparently are no longer found necessary in the twenty-first century. SeeThe Assault on Reason.This theme re-emerges in Father Merton's examination of Saint Bernard's De laude novae militiae, about the Knights Templar, in which Bernard writes: \\"Quis igitur finis fructusve saecularis hujus, non dico militiae sed malitiae, si et occisor letaliter peccat at occisus aeternaliter perit? (p.56).\\" In English more or less I roughly translate: So what purpose is the fruit of their secular warfare, not by militia but by the malicious, if the killer mortally sins and the killed perishes forever?Bernard's solution is for the Knights Templar to live like Cistercians in Palestine, an admirable and saintly enterprise which unfortunately did not come about.Most interesting to me of all these mainly untranslated minor works of Saint Bernard of course is his life of Saint Malachy, missioner monk from Ireland who died at Clairvaux in 1148. I hope to find many of these writings, but that's the way it goes. This all began with a short reference in the correspondence of Merton and LeClercq, and the whole mystical universe of Saint Bernard opens before me. I most wish to read his treatise on the Love of God. and De COnsideratione.Merton completes this section on Saint Bernard's Writings by examining the theme of freedom: \\"we fulfill the end for which we were created when by conformity to Christ we fully realize our own identity by becoming perfectly free and therefore by loving God without limit (p. 63)\\" Merton finds a \\"characteristic emphasis on fredom and charity\\" and defines \\"Bernard (as) a builder, a man at once of liberty and of order, a man who builds individual liberties into a universal order, that all may be more perfectly free (p. 67)\\" May our Church, universal and Catholic once more know this freedom.In fact, in an earlier section discussing Bernard's writings on the relationship between the Cistercians and the Benedictines, Father Merton sums them up in this way: \\"Bernard is not propagandizing his own Order, but defending the unity of the Church: and her unity demands variety. To compel all monks ot follow the same observance would be un-Catholic (p.54).\\" May we see the true and multi-faceted nature of Our Holy Mother Church with the same charity, compassion, acceptance and love today as did Saint Bernard. Saint Bernard, pray for us now and forever.Amen."},{"Title":"The Five Books of the Histories and The Life of St. William (Oxford Medieval Texts)","review":"This book is ungodly expensive, but so are most books in the Oxford Medieval Texts Series. It contains two works by the eleventh-century historian Rodulfus Glaber (sometimes called Ralph Glaber, sometimes Raoul Glaber). The first is his more important _Five Books of Histories_, which covers important events in the tenth and eleventh centuries from the viewpoint of a monk who had access to some good libraries and to some powerful people.Those who are not scholars should not be put off by seeing the Latin text on each left hand page and the English on the right. The book makes accessible and pleasurable reading for history buffs. Glaber's stories are entertaining, poignant, and often insightful; they give a taste of what the world looked like to a person with very different cultural presuppositions than ours. He tells stories of kings, peasants, knights, miracles, monks, demons, famines, divine vengeance, and the eleventh-century Peace of God movement. A history buff will find this book interesting and engaging, and will find the translation to be smooth and fluid. The book also contains a translation of his life of St. William, abbot of Cluny, a less important text historically but full, likewise, of great stories.But this is, after all, a scholarly edition. I wish France would arrange with Oxford to print a cheap paperback version with just the English translation and an introduction for non-specialists. I would use it in my medieval history courses without pause.For scholars: France's critical edition of the Latin is excellent, and is now the standard critical edition, as well it should be. The notes to the text are helpful and suggestive. The critical apparatus is complete, and his discussion of MS variants often helpful. The translation is a little free at points, but it is well worth the readability it gives. For most scholarly purposes it is reliable, but for close textual work it is preferable to use the Latin and draw one's own conclusions about the particularities of France's (and in the case of the _Vita Willellmi_, his colleagues') translations.P.

Imagine a world of plug-and-play networked devices, which can be installed and seamlessly integrated with your LAN simply by connecting them to your network. A laptop on-the-go can just plug in to an unfamiliar network, and access the printer or Internet proxy server, without the need to install any drivers. Mixing Unix and Wintel devices? Not a worry. Jini promises to let them talk to each other.That's the vision behind Jini. But that vision goes much further. Not only can hardware devices talk to one another, but also software services. In a Jini world, you won't care whether how a device works, or whether it is software or hardware based. An Internet based fax service will act as a fax, as will a hardware device. You'll just look for a fax service, without worrying how the service is implemented. Of course, someone needs to write the software that will power Jini services. That's where The Jini Specification comes in.The book is divided into two main sections, an overview and the specification for Jini. The overview provides an easily accessible overview of what Jini is, how it works, and what it can achieve. There are also several examples of Jini services and clients, to give you some practical experience with building Jini software applications.From there, the book dives headfirst into the actual specification. The first part of the book is good for managers, and software developers alike. The coverage of the specification, however, is designed as a reference for developers as they construct Jini software. This is where many readers could become lost, unless they are already using Jini in action. The first part of the book is a guide to Jini, the second intended only as a reference during development. Finally, a glossary of Jini terms and an essay on distributed computing is included, along with the full source code from the overview.The Jini Specification is a must-have for anyone considering Jini development. It provides an excellent guide to Jini technology for those considering designing Jini-based systems, and a comprehensive printed reference for those who will implement them. -- David Reilly, for the Java Coffee Break"},{"Title":"The Jini(TM) Specification (The Jini(TM) Technology Series)","review":"As a young engineer I can feel the energy that surrounds Jini technology.

In the sections that have real code examples, it would be helpful to have a snippet of UML describing the section of Jini critical to that example, for instance.Furthermore, in the earlier sections of the book, the overview, the authors use what I call &quot;system collaboration diagrams&quot;, even better would be when they are explaining code snippets to highlight in their system collaboration diagrams what part of the system they are showing an example of.I guess I just found the explaination of the examples lacking. The examples themselves are excerpted, making them hard to follow. For instance, it is confusing to see an ordinary method being called (from within an excerpt) with no class or object qualified before it. Is it in the superclass? In the implementation? If in the superclass, how far up? This is especially difficult when referring to the DEM of Java, which sometimes seems counterintuitive to beginners.My rule of thumb is one should never look at a piece of code and get &quot;nervous&quot; about what a symbol or method is supposed to be doing there."},{"Title":"The Jini(TM) Specification (The Jini(TM) Technology Series)","review":"This book deals with a complicated subject in an intelligent and well organized manner.

Bhikkhu Bodhi is a Brooklyn-born monk in the Theravada tradition who has translated the Nikaya suttas. These \\"longer,\\" \\"medium-length,\\" \\"grouped\\" and \\"numbered\\" collections in the Pali dialect closer to what the Buddha had used when he orally transmitted the dharma are as far back as we can go when trying to find the \\"original\\" sayings that summed up and expanded the many teachings of the founder over four decades of preaching.These can be famously repetitive, astringent. This comes from their oral nature, as this aids memory and invokes its own state of reception. These formulae for repetition and recursion remain here, but modified in the middle of repeated paragraphs so the first and the last are kept full but not the intervening. It's a fair compromise for the reader, and it allows more selections to be included in this generous, sober, stolid, if sometimes daunting, collection.Bodhi here compiles highlights from the Nikayas. He tends towards conservative interpretations, as a monk himself seeking the early texts to put in Theravada context. He orders them into what makes sense for a student needing a way in to the vast corpus of suttas. It starts with the human condition before the teaching is heard, then moves step-by-step along as the Buddha arrives, so to speak, and the dharma unfolds and grows in complexity as the hearer advances along the path to awakening. Bodhi arranges substantial sections of the suttas so a reader can get a sense of the core teachings. He prefaces each thematic or cognitively arranged chapter with a detailed introduction and follows with endnotes. This leaves the texts themselves to be faced apart from an orientation or commentary.Now, unlike the shorter collections of equal value, Rupert Gethin's \\"Sayings of the Buddha\\" let alone Glenn Wallis' \\"Basic Teachings of the Buddha,\\" (both reviewed by me before I read this anthology--I'd sample these before taking on Bodhi's bigger book), Bodhi does adhere to a conventional, more obedient stance regarding the dharma. That is, as a monk, he's grounded in elucidating this dharma as not a scholarly enterprise or a linguistic exercise or a philosophical confrontation. Rather, he mixes a more devotional approach that assumes the dharma's truth-claims while inviting a reader to understand the original suttas in light of later monastic commentaries and interpretations. Wallis eschews this approach and Gethin minimizes it; Bodhi as a monk embraces the suttas within a larger framework of those Theravadin monks who have pored over the Pali texts and come to their own conclusions, as his predecessors and masters within the South Asian community. I admit I lean more towards those who challenge the texts rather than bow to them, but that may be my nature! One can't fault Bodhi for a more \\"literal' stance towards the canon, but this needs mention. He does peer beyond from the Pali to later commentaries to tackle textual cruxes and obscure passages.Wallis and Gethin have based some of their work on Bodhi's even if they differ from some of his choices for translation; Bodhi has pioneered anthologies aimed at a wider Western audience than professors or linguists, and for this, the affordable and handsomely designed book (as with many from Wisdom Publications) fills a space on a short shelf. Endnotes, a brief glossary, charts of where the texts fit into the canon, and a full index with italicized Pali and Sanskrit terms enhance its use. As I consult this more as a researcher than an insider, my judgment of it is aimed at a similar reader. (Many of the previous reviewers have reacted to this book with bursts of heartfelt praise; I wanted to provide rather a sense of how it compares and contrasts with other popular press Nikaya collections.)"},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Buddha's words make you self-aware and enable you to break away from human condition.

This book is a wonderful introduction to the general themes and ideas in that canon. It includes bits of texts (as well as many complete suttas) from all five Nikayas, along with helpful introductory essays and valuable notes. This book is a wonderful introduction to \\"Hinayana\\" Buddhism, which is all too often portrayed as an obsolete, simple-minded form of Buddhism best ignored in favor of Mahayana or Vajrayana systems. This book shows, for example, that the idea of the Bodhisattva was not an invention of Mahayanins and that lovingkindness is at least as important in Hinayana as in Mahayana (see, e.g., the \\"cow's udder\\" reading from the Anguttara Nikaya on pp. 178-79).

The book was the catalyst to my beginning and understanding of how to be happy in most every facet of my life. This book is great because it groups the Buddha's teachings from several scriptures into focused subjects and helps to summarize them when they become repetitive for the purpose of the oral transmission in which they were first passed down.This book was a fist step to changing my life forever and I hope you find within it the joy that I have. I am forever grateful."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"This is the most recent of several Pali-only anthologies of Buddhist texts I've read, the other two being Word of the Buddha and Path To Deliverance, both by the famous German monk Nyanatiloka. (The latter is especially good.) This one is easily the most comprehensive.For those of you who find the suttas tough going on account of their lack of thematic organization, this book will be a godsend. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains in the introduction, the idea for it had its genesis in a series of lectures he gave on the Majjhima Nikaya. His goal therein was to arrange materials from simplest to most profound, giving a progressive, graded course of theoretical and practical instruction. He then decided to turn that approach to the Sutta Pitaka as a whole. The result is the present work.The specifics of this structure are as follows, where each number refers to a part of the book:1.The Buddha's description of the human condition2.The nature of the Buddha and his attainment3.How to approach the Dhamma4.How the Dhamma contributes to happiness in this life5.How it can contribute to happiness in future rebirths6.The Dhamma on why renunciation is the safest course to take (the perils of samsara)7.The nature of the path to liberation8.How to master the mind9.The nature of transcendent wisdom10.Stages of realizationEach of these sections is prefaced with a substantial introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi, and some of these are surprisingly good. (I have often felt a little sour toward BB's writing because he is such a slave to the Commentaries and tends to express himself with a slightly stilted, pompous air.) I was especially impressed by his introduction to part 3 (\\"Approaching the Dhamma\\"), which is, in effect, an essay on the place and nature of faith (saddha) in the Buddha's teaching. I think anyone, no matter how knowledgeable, can benefit from these pages (81ff). It is especially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.So who would benefit most from this book? I think beginning students would especially be served by it, or at least those who have until now subsisted mainly on a diet of secondary texts and haven't yet plunged into the jungle of the suttas. This book is excellent for providing an orientation, and if read two or three times so that one really becomes familiar with the passages contained therein, when the passages are finally encountered in their full form it should prove very rewarding. But then, anyone who wants a refresher, or a different manner of presentation from, say, the four noble truths and the three-fold training (sila, samadhi, pa&ntilde;&ntilde;'), will also benefit."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"no exaggeration. i wasted YEARS on other new forms of buddhism: vajrayana developed up to 1,200 years after buddhas death, zen developed up to 900 years after buddhas death, and others (pure land doesn't even count as it's not about awakening, but going to a very late invented buddhist realm AFTER death based on faith in a very late invented \\"amitabha buddha\\"). do these other forms work? not for me! maybe they do for others. but the bottom line is that the original teachings are just that: the original. they are laid out in a step by step frame to lead one to awakening. bodhi has compiled many here to make them very simple and straightforward (otherwise one must read hundreds of pages to get the step by step feel as they are recorded in massive volumes, very spread out. totally worth it though, i have all of his translations). whereas zen is totally reliant on teachings of individual zen masters and the same goes for vajrayana (ie. the practice is not recorded in full in their respective scriptures for said schools). if you try to just read all the mahayana scriptures (all written after the original scriptures were recorded) without reading any works by teachers of those sects or having an actual teacher, you will be lost in a mass of contradictions and confusion.for example if you read the lankavatara sutra you will learn vague ideas about meditating, then read the infinite life sutras and you will think you should be praying to amitabha, then read vajrayana stuff and you will think you should be praying to tibetan gods, practicing dream yoga, and spinning prayer wheels. the original teachings are reliant on THE BUDDHA'S teachings which are internally consistent and not confusing. they are about morality, meditation to still and gladden the mind (culminating in equanimity and higher states), and finally reflection on reality in order to see through it's constructs. they do not teach any other practices or worship of any \\"buddhas\\" or \\"gods\\", and there is no conflict from one sutta (sanskrit: sutra) to another. sounds like the right choice to me!i didn't even know this was the original teachings. this is a collection of texts from the oldest known record of the buddha's teachings (other than the agamas which are preserved in chinese and are of numerous schools and therefore less consistent, some as old as this, some newer, some of unknown origin, and so on), without these, there would be no buddhism. this is from the pali canon or pali tipitaka from the oldest surviving school the theravada.years and years i spent practicing versions of buddhism with little fruit.then i discovered the original and had rapid progress. it's a tried and true system. i have seen through reality on multiple occasions now.this book is indispensable. with this and some supplementary commentaries and maybe some web reading on jhana practice and insight reflection one could easily start to have great progress.final note: if you dedicate your life to some other tradition under a competent teacher, you MIGHT have some success. like go ordain in a zen monastery or at the very least spend a LOT of time with a zen teacher. i really don't know and i don't want to totally knock other traditions as supposedly they work if you take it that far. but if you are practicing mostly alone like most westerners, go with the original works by the buddha himself and commentaries and supplementary teachings on those works.this isn't just me talking either, 99% of zen and vajrayana teachers will tell you that you MUST have a teacher to progress. most theravada will say the same, but using the scriptures as your teacher is a viable and realistic option as long as you are diligent! whereas you cannot simply read mahayana/vajrayana scriptures and walk away with any kind of consistent or complete practice methodology."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Essential to anyone looking for the core of the Buddha's teaching, which are of course his words.

At times the subject matter of the text makes you realise how long ago the Buddha lived but the core teachings are almost always relevant today and there is an authenticity about this work that keeps one's understanding of Dharma grounded. This is the real deal. This book along with a good translation of the Dhammapada really does feel like the closest thing a Dharma follower can get to the Bible. I really feel this is an essential addition to any collection of Dharma books. Just a warning though - the final chapters were really dry (for me) and probably too deep for me to really grasp (I am not a hard core practitioner). This is not the kind of book you read on the bus/train."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Researchers believe that \\"The Buddha\\" ( a term meaning \\"The Awakened One\\" ) was an actual man named Siddhartha Gautama that lived in India over 2,600 years ago.His teachings were passed down for several centuries after his death via an oral tradition until they were written down on collections of palm leaves. These are stored in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon, the texts of the oldest surviving form of Buddhism known as Theravada. The Sutta Pitaka consists of 5 \\"Nikayas\\" or books/collections.These collection are thousands of pages long, contain much repetitive content and have only been translated into English as of the 19th century. Translations into English are still being perfected as ancient Pali and modern English are extremely different languages.In other words, the reader who wants to read the Buddhist message for him/herself has the daunting task of combing through several large, expensive, repetitious volumes of translations that may not be clear to a modern reader.\\"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon\\" is an anthology of the Buddha's teachings compiled by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Bhikkhu Bodhi was born in New York City in 1944 as Jeffrey Block. He is an American Theravada Buddhist monk. Bhikkhu Bodhi has translated large portions of the Pali Canon himself and is a native English speaker.His goal in compiling his anthology is to make the Buddha's message more accessible to the ordinary person and to encourage the ordinary person to read the Pali Canon themselves.To this end, he has chosen what he thinks are the most essential of the Buddha's discourses. Bhikkhu Bodhi has also put these suttas ( discourses from the Buddha ) into a logical order by subject in his anthology -- something which doesn't exist in the Pali Canon, which is a scattered, repetitious collection of separate talks.Bhikkhu Bodhi further aids the reader by reducing the repetition of phrases in the translations ( left over from the oral tradition ) and Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces each section with some extremely helpful essays on the suttas that follow.The result is an easy to understand, scholarly anthology that gives the reader a sense of what can be found in the Sutta Pitaka in regards to the essentials of the Buddha's message - without having to make the larger investment of going through the significantly more voluminous, repetitious and expensive English translations of these collections.This book will likely not be enjoyable to people whose exposure to Buddhism has been a mixture of inspirational poetry, psychological analysis and elements borrowed from other spiritual traditions.People who are uncomfortable reading text that is more \\"religious\\" will find those elements in this collection.Bhikkhu Bodhi has striven to given an honest snap shot of what someone can expect to find in translations of the Pali Canon. That snap shot includes the presence of preternatural beings, mythical realms and what is commonly known in the West as \\"reincarnation\\". If you have limited tolerance for reading such things, this book isn't for you.This book can also be dry in many sections. It isn't a book that can be read, or understood by reading through it in many large chunks while laying on a couch after a taxing day. My recommendation would be to read it a tiny bit of time, sitting up and during your best hours to get the most out of it.I was surprised to see that a copies of the \\"The Peg\\" (Ani Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XX.7), \\"The Unconjecturable\\" (Acintita Sutta, Anguttara Nikaya IV.77) and \\"To Sivaka\\" (Moliyasivaka Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XXXVI.21) suttas (discourses from the Buddha ) were not included in this anthology.These suttas state that the Buddha knew his teachings would get distorted over time, that theBuddha believed that ordinary people could not explain the details of their current situation by tracing their karma ( kamma ) and that not all situations a person encounters in their lives are the result of karma. These are extremely important ideas and it is a bit strange that they are not included in an anthology of essential teachings attributed to the Buddha himself.As stated previously, a big problem for those seeking to understand Buddhism directly from the original texts is that these texts haven't been translated very well into English. English and Pali are just very different languages. The modern world is also very different from the ancient world from where the texts came.Given that Bhikkhu Bodhi is an American and a native English speaker I had different expectations for these translations than what I read.As an example, throughout the anthology the root causes of \\"suffering\\" are listed as being \\"greed, hatred and delusion\\". The terms in quotes are not the only possible English translations. The English translations are technically correct, but I believe the terms used hold extreme connotations to the contemporary English speaker which rob the Buddhist message of its meaning and relevance to contemporary life.Many people interpret \\"suffering\\" as agony, \\"greed\\" as extreme desire, \\"hatred\\" as an extremely strong emotion and \\"delusion\\" as close to being insane. Other translators have stated that the Pali word \\"dukha\\", commonly translated as \\"suffering\\" really refers to any dissatisfactory feeling from a vague sense of things not being the best as they could be on one end, to flat out agony on the other end.So, an alternate translation like this one is possible:\\"The root cause of feelings of unhappiness, distress or suffering come from desire, aversion or being ignorant to the nature of life.\\"To me, that speaks to me much more as a modern person and seems relevant to many more of my experiences than:\\"The roots of suffering are greed, hatred and delusion\\".The alternative translation doesn't come off as a recycled puritanism of which I want no part of as a secular person.There are a number of other examples of alternative translations like this one.I'm not a scholar of any kind and Bhikkhu Bodhi is. As an expert who has devoted his life to Buddhism I wouldn't be surprised to learn Bhikkhu Bodhi is correct in his translation choices.I'm just saying my preference would have been for the other choices and I think that will be true for many people interested in this book.I believe this book to be a first of its kind in what does and how well it does it. I heartily encourage anyone with an interest in Buddhism to endure the shortcomings of the book. Read it in little bits every day, read the whole thing and talk to people about it. Such an investment will keep coming back to you for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"A good and structured pattern of the buddha's essential teachings, that would lead the reader to get more and more interested in this philosophy. A book to have in your personal library if personal development is a priority."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Even a casual student of literature and philosophy would find the text of the Pali Canon striking. Here is the original form of the parable regarding the blind men who encounter the different parts of an elephant and form widely divergent and strongly held opinions on what an elephant is like. I've heard this parable told in many contexts for all my life but never realized that Buddha was the first to use it 2500 years ago.Many other images will grab the mind as one pages through this wonderful translation. On one page, Buddha grabs a handful of leaves and asks his listeners which was more numerous, the leaves in his hand or the leaves still on the trees in the surrounding grove. When they gave the obvious answer, he tells them that the leaves overhead are like the knowledge that Buddha knows, but the leaves in his hand are like the knowledge that Buddha is teaching, because he is only teaching what is relevant and beneficial for the spiritual life and what will lead directly to Enlightenment. On the facing page, the reader will find an equally striking metaphor of a steep precipice used to show the pitfalls of a life lived without spiritual reflection or striving towards enlightenment. I love the way the translator includes a chart of such striking images in the back of the book so that it is easy to look these up again.The translator has tried to be faithful and accurate to the text, sometimes with no regard for the music of the language when read aloud. When dealing with something like this, I will vote for clear English over beautiful English! The scholarly merits of this work is enhanced by an excellent organization of the material and by the notes that precede each chapter. I frequently found myself reading the chapters, than turning back to the notes for a more complete understanding of what I was reading. The passages of poetry do, by and large, succeed as poetry in English which is a notable accomplishment of translation in and of itself.A translator faces many difficulties especially when trying to translate a traditional text into a modern language and context. The translator discusses some of these in his General Introduction and it is important that the reader not skip this in a big hurry to get to the text itself. The main thing that the reader must understand is how the translator deals with the frequent repetitive sections in which the same thing may be said five times over. Here the first and last sections are given in full and the repeating sections are represented by \\"...\\". This can take a little getting used to but I found this to be a good method. It was better practice to mentally put in what was taken out rather than to be mentally skipping multiple lines.I would recommend this book to persons of a philosophical mind set in general or to English-speaking seekers of Enlightenment in particular. This is a book that repays those who spend time with it. I have had it only since September 2009 and as I write this review in December of the same year I note that my copy already has many dog-ears and double dog-ears where I have folded down a page so as to be able to easily revisit a passage.

As a fledgling Theravadan, the earliest Pali suttas are important to me. As Bhante Punna (Pittsburgh Buddhist Center) and I discussed yesterday, this anthology of the Buddha's seminal teachings is the foundation on which all of Buddhism was built.If you are wondering what all the hype is about regarding Buddha, it's in this book. Everything from an objective account of his birth, to his incredible life as a world redeemer, to his teachings regarding meditation, to what people were discussing about him in the years after his death. You can read this book and hang in any conversation about Buddhism. If you are already a practitioner, this is your foundation right here, whether you practice Mahayana or Theravada.Enjoy this book. If you have any questions about further readings feel free to email me. I wish you happiness and well-being."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Very enjoyable book to read thank you.

But then he started to try to sell the belief that Buddhism is atheistic in nature.Now I know that many atheists actually do Buddhist practices like meditation, deep inner reflection, and trying to concur desires but the truth is Buddhism is not atheistic the texts constantly talk about janas and jans i think that's how it was said. but the point is they constantly talk of Indian gods and yes they are Indian you can tell by the way they talk. Also no Atman or Atman doesn't really matter because life force is life force and though it may be different when you get down to it it is bastically a soul, and I know plenty of you will argue about that with me but I have read up on pretty much the majority of all the beliefs in all the religions and yes life force is the same as soul. I mean if Buddhism didn't believe in a soul to some point it would not need all this life force crap eighter.I would suggest to all people looking in to this spiritually to look up Jainism there is a lot of misconceptions about Jainism but I found it to be a much less contradicting belief."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"A great book! Bhikkhu Bodhi has taken his vast lifetime of experience of translating the Theravada Buddhist texts and complied the most salient sections straight from the most original Pali sources.I've spent a lot of time with the Pali texts and if I had this selection years ago it would have saved me a lot of work. It's such a good reference.The oldest and most original Buddhist texts are in Pali. These are older than Zen, and older the Tibetan texts. Both Zen and Tibetan texts are outstanding, but the texts in Pali are the oldest and hence the source of the others.If this doesn't become the Bible for Buddhists I don't know what will."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Regardless of your school of Buddhism or direction of interest in the study of Buddhism, this amazing work will surely be recognized as a standard reference.

It is perfect for any night stand, classroom, casual reading or serious practice."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"The actual book itself is beautifully bound and very usable as a daily spiritual reading. Of course the content has historical and spiritual significance for scholars, practitioners, and anyone interested in expanding their spiritual quest. Bhikku Bodhi's immense work gives Buddha to English-speaking readers. The themes form an organizational structure that enhances the experience. Readers unfamiliar with the foundations of Buddhism would still benefit from the spirit of the teachings and may be inspired to learn more. H.H. the Dalai Lama's introduction helps readers understand the basis for the work. Even after 2500 years, the words still apply."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"I had been attracted to the pali canon for some time, but where do you start? This book will give you a very good impression of what 'the word of the buddha' is. It contains translations of a broad selection of the original texts, while the introduction and commentary are truly helpful for putting it all in perspective. For me, this anthology proved to be the entrance gate to a wealth of texts that I would probably not have started to read without this wonderful book."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"This is an amazing work of easily accessible wisdom. That's not to say it's simplistic or easily understood in its entirety. Bhikkhu Bodhi has created a very well translated, and perhaps even more importantly, a very well organized collection of the Buddha's teachings. Separated into sections that are not found in the original sources, this book is organized to cover teachings and ideas concerning a related topic or theme (such as the human condition). This organization was very helpful for me and probably will be to others: it accommodates a very western, modern approach such as we might find in a \\"self-help\\" book and yet the sections are composed of unassuming, ancient wisdom from the Buddha himself.On that note, the Buddha's teachings were passed down orally and written later, the Pali Canon being one of the earliest recordings. Therefore, the teachings collected here are perhaps closest to the Buddha's own words (as the title suggests) and also subject to the repetition found in oral traditions. Bodhi has in many cases cut or condensed these repetitions to make it easier to read - this can be either very helpful (when large blocks are repeated and we may find such extensive repetition confusing or distracting) or disruptive when the repetition is shorter (and the repetition could help reinforce an important message). Whichever way you may feel in coming across these passages, Bodhi makes his changes obvious and explains his methodology in the introduction so the reader understands what he is doing and exactly where he is doing it.Bodhi begins each section with insightful introductions that explain the context of the included readings and provides some insight into their meaning and interpretation. His introductions are usually several pages, and I appreciated them as about the perfect length in each instance. While not critical to understand the Buddha's teaching they provide a nice element to the overall organization of the work along with a more academic analysis of the teachings.The topics covered in this work are core elements of Buddhist theology and it is both an excellent source for someone new to Buddhism or a longtime practitioner. While Buddhism is a unique religion, the teachings can be interpreted in different ways, and so I highly recommend this work to those of different religions since the wisdom this book contains can be highly informative and helpful even to adamant Christians, Muslims, atheists and so many more."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"In the Buddha's Words (IBW) is worthy of all the superlative accolades offered up by reviewers here, but...Let's keep in mind that Buddhism means one with an awakened mind, or awakening the mind; and reading all the books in the world on the Buddha's teachings is not going to awaken one's mind. Meditation is the key, and one can awaken the mind through meditation without cracking the cover of a single book.On meditation, IBW devotes two short sections to this most important discipline. They are immensely valuable in that they link meditation to attitudes that all beings should enjoy lasting happiness and the causes of happiness, that they be liberated from discomfort and the causes of discomfort; that they never be separated from happiness that is free from sorrow; and that they rest in equanimity free from attachment and sorrow. (Practitioners will recognize the four immeasurables.)This is all excellent, but if one really wants to understand awakening the mind, a meditation practice is needed. IBW is an excellent complement to even a beginning meditation practice.Meditating first, reading second, is counter to the vast majority of how Americans especially would like to approach awakening the mind. Those wishing to test the waters with their toes tend to request recommendations on books to read. Instead, they should be asking for instruction for meditation, and by the bye, what should I read to supplement my meditation. IBW, in my estimation, would make an excellent complement because it offers a thoughtful sampling of many core teachings directly from the Buddha, but also stripped of much of the repetition associated with what were originally oral teachings, which tend to incorporate much repetition.For practitioners of all the various schools of Buddhism, IBW offers a wide ranging anthology of teachings on karma, impermanence, how to approach the teachings, and how to liberate one's mind. IBW's conciseness is of great value as an alternative to searching through more complete translations of the various Pali texts. But IBW is a complement, not a substitute, for such searching. For instance, the Pali texts have much more to offer on the critical subject of meditation than IBW offers.For lay people, beginners, and other tire kickers, IBW offers a direct exposure to core teachings of the Buddha. The teachings here both introduce and increase exposure to important teachings, which in turn can enhance one's meditation.But make no mistake about it. IBW, nor any other text, is a substitute for meditating. Awakening the mind is based on a disciplined exploration of one's experience based on meditation. IBW is an excellent complement to that practice and can improve it...immeasurably."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Clear, concise, insightful and to the point - I feel that this is the best anthology translation of the Pali Canon I have read.

I would recommend this book to a learned sage as well as a beginner...."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Thank you to Bhikku Bodhi for his tremendous effort. If you are a serious practitioner, especially a lone practitioner as I am, this book is invaluable for making available the undiluted teachings of the Buddha himself. Most of the books in my Buddhist library have been helpful to some extent or other but most are explanations of the teachings, i.e. the Buddha's words once-removed. I rank very highly What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula. This book is much more extensive. It is also more accessible than The Middle Length Discourses (trans. Bhiddhu Nanamoli and Bhiddhu Bodhi) because it is organized into general topics, such as \\"The Human Condition\\" and \\"Mastering the Mind.\\" Highly recommended as a life reference."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"This book is written in clear and understandable English. It gives very understandable explanations of all major Buddhist Dhamma teachings while avoiding all the mythology that entered Buddhism in the later centuries. This summary of the Pali Canon is very close to the original Buddha of history. You will find how to over come greed, hatred, and delusion by over coming clinging and the false view of self. It has the greatest explanation of the Noble Eightfold path I have ever read. The Four Noble truths are the main theme of these scriptures. If you have already read the Dhammapada and have some understanding of Buddhism then buy this for the advanced learning. However this book is not for beginners and non-Buddhists may not be able to grasp it. Bhikkhu Boddhi has written wonderful introductions to each section that really prepare you to receive the teachings. 5 Stars, thank you Bhikkhu."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"It seems there are many books telling us how the Budda would date, eat, work...etc. These books may be helpful, but why not get as close to the original sources as possible? Unfortunately the Suttas (or sutras...the collected rememberances of the Buddas talks) can be overwhelming for many of us because of their vast number, the repetitive language, the obscure references, and they are not anthologized in a helpful way. In this book you have exerpts of the most foundational suttas. They are presented in chapters related by topic and each chapter has a wonderful introduction. The structure is oriented towards practice - ethical training, meditation, and wisdom. If you are looking for a book that is beyond a basic introduction and can be a touchstone for your own development - this could be a book you could work with for years to come. I can't recommend it highly enough"},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"I own many of the longer and complete translations of the Pali Canon available now and have spent years studying and teaching, to the best of my ability, the contents and character of each. What I find most useful about Bhikkhu Bohdi's anthology is it's concise and focused selection of Suttas and the logic of the overall outline, making it an extremely useful learning tool of the heart of Buddhism. Also, I took an extended trip recently and this was the only book of scripture I took along. It's physical size combined with the translations themselves and Bhikkhu Bodhi's erudite and clear commentary made this a wonderful traveling companion. If your Buddhist library can hold only one book, I highly recommend this volume."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"After having read a few books on buddhism, which caused some confusion around what Buddhist (would) say, what they believe and what Buddha actually said, I found this book fundamental. I was alway afraid of the long long sutras - and I almost gave up reading the original words of Buddha. Now I think there is no better introduction to Buddhism than the real source. After this, explanations and summaries of buddhism are easier to grasp and judge. But I needed a good introduction to it. It was this book.I particularly liked the sensible 'shortenings', i.e. when repetitions are omitted. It might be strange for the first time, but you soon get used to it and it makes sense. It is a thick book anyway with many essential areas of what Buddha said to the lay people and to monks and to this own disciples. A wonderful compilation."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Anybody interested in pursuing an understanding of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings can tell you how overwhelming it can be to try to sift through the religious texts. First of all, the Pali canon is quite huge, such that it would take a lifetime to read and absorb it all, and the printed versions of it (in Pali, there is still no complete English translation) are anywhere from 35 to 58 volumes. From this vast ocean of scripture Bhikkhu Bodhi effectively organizes it into chapters based on major points of doctrine. Each chapter has a few pages of Bhikkhu Bodhi's own interpretation and explanation, but the bulk of the book is devoted to the scripture. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to better understand Buddhism (including Mahayana Buddhism). As for those who are as intensely interested in Theravada Buddhism as I am, I would say that this book, along with a good translation of the Dhammapada, is essential."},{"Title":"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"An excellent overview of the sutras (suttas in Pali) which gives more than an excellent introduction to the entire tipitaka of the Pali scriptures.

It is in this little book.There is no Pureland, no Zen, no Tantra, no Yoga, no mudra, no medicine wheels, no ritual, no esoteric transmission, no gurus, no deity yoga, no bardo, no Dalai Lama, no phowa, no koans, etc.There are the 4 noble truths, the 3 facts of existence, the 8 noble path.

What is the right view that you should hold in dealing with the wealth acquired?This is the million dollars question and of course many enthusiastic people would shower you lots of unsolicited advice.Beware! Beware!Their intentions are good but the advices may not necessarily correct and accurate if you examine them closely.So, what did the Buddha say about the million dollars question?It is fortunate that now we can refer to the wonderful book entitled \\"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Cannon\\", compiled by highly respected America born Bhikkhu Bodhi. This book collects many important teachings by the Buddha. In essence, this book is for anyone who wishes to gain benefits by practicing Dhamma that leads to happy present life, happy future life and the ultimate good.From time to time, the past and living masters always caution the believers not to get trapped in the big palace of Buddhist suttas or sutras in Sanskrit. This book provides an invaluable map to those who wish to find the way out in this majestic palace. Whatever level of spiritual goal you have in mind, you can rely on this map to reach your destination.Surprisingly, many other advices of similar nature can be found. For example, how to be united in future lives for husband and wife who are deeply in love, how to repay one's parent etc. In my opinion, this book has convincingly dispelled the common wrongly held belief that Buddha only teaches the Dhamma for the people who renounce. As shown in this book, many of Buddha's teachings are for those who still stuck in the routine of worldly life!For those who do not have to worry about the million dollars question and wonder why this book is special, perhaps you can listen to what H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has said in the forward:\\"What I find especially encouraging about this book is that it shows so clearly how much fundamentally all schools of Buddhism have in common. I congratulate Bikkhu Bodhi for the careful work of compilation and translation\\"What about the answer to the million dollars question mentioned earlier?The answer can be found in Pg 126-127 under the heading \\"The Proper use of Wealth\\". Let's preview the details of the first out of the four sound advices given:\\"With the wealth thus gained he makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness; he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes his wife and children, his slaves, workers and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes friends and colleagues happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the first case of wealth gone to good use, fruitfully applied and used for a worthy cause\\"How amazing! Not only the servants, even the slaves are supposed to be included for sharing. Remember, these words were spoken twenty five hundreds years ago.Of course, after earning a million, you might want more. The answer can be found in the fourth advice.I strongly encourage you to find out straight from the mouth of the Buddha!About the reviewer:Benjamin F C TENG PhD, was born in Singapore.

This book, in part, convinced me that these teachings can be verified. I had been a pretty big atheist before reading this, and I had been searching for a good philosophy that could represent me. You see, humanism is not a complete or systemic philosophical world-view, and attempts at such just seem to fail. I found Buddhism to be the end result of the humanist's endeavor, in part thanks to this book.Now before an atheist reading this review gets annoyed, my becoming Buddhist was probably not the intent of the editor, Bhikkhu Bodhi. The western world has more of a new age view of Buddhism, an unfortunate thing, and this monk has done a wonderful job at exposing it to our culture.My only complaint would be that it could be coupled with some graduated meditation training. I am currently working through \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" for learning Vipassana(Insight) Meditation, and purchased \\"Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English\\", which I believe covers Samatha(Calm Abiding) Meditation. There is another book on the four sumpreme abodes called \\"Loving-Kindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness\\", which aims to train Loving-Kindness, Compassion, Altruistic Joy, and Equanimity in us. I think these four books are all a westerner needs for the basics. Of course, feel free to read any book around, if the joy of learning is abound.

I have not studied the Pali Canon extensively enough to know what should go into an anthology and what shouldn't. That's why I count on the author to have done that for me. Because I am lazy, and I got other things going on.I mean seriously, If I studied Buddhism to the extent that I know I should, I would be in a monastery (preferably the Bodhinyana Monastery in Australia). But I don't, and thus I leave the deliverance of the Buddha's message in the hands of people who, I hope, know what they're doing.The anthology is set up in a way that seems to have an appropriate progression of ideas. Which, as I understand it, is not how the texts were originally written, or spoken. It is nice to have that sort of analytical cohesion.I did not expect so much dialogue, though, I must admit.I expected it to be more like the Dhammapada in matter of fact style, almost poetry.but it is not. It is a lot of some dude asking Siddhartha questions, and Siddhartha answering them in the long drawn out, repetitive way that only the Buddha can.I like it. It is a good book.

The book begins with the vision of the photographer. The entire first section is devoted to presenting outstanding images by great photographers and explaining why they are great. The book does not begin as most do with the question of what camera to buy. It places its emphasis on creating great images, which IMHO is exactly right. The camera does not create the pictures. The vision of the photographer does. The book then goes on to explain the technical aspects of the craft (cameras, lenses, film etc.) in simple, clear and well written prose with good photos. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Photography","review":"As a lover of photography, I've never gone wrong with this book. Whether you're a beginner who wants to learn the basics, or a serious shutterbug who's in need of the occasional reference, this one has to be in your Library. Best of all, \\"The Joy of Photography\\" is not a book that demands to be understood on its own terms. It's as thorough, informative and technically detailed as you need it to be, or light enough to jump around to get whatever you want from it. However you may want to use this book, it's a valuable resource."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Photography","review":"I have advanced beyond this book, but it was a very integral part in my learning of photography. It is a great resource to use while learning the basics, to be able to question how to shoot a particular subject and so forth. Also deals with the basics of film, camera, lens etc. although I find it quite outdated (as this has progressed so rapidly over the years)."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Photography","review":"I read this book when it first came out.

It is ideal for beginners, as the language is not overly technical without explanations, and the photographs are amazing."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Photography","review":"The J of P has great referencing for beginner's, intermediates, or those who take shooting casually and need to brush up occasionally. The comprehensive index makes it easy to find information on a technical topic, or matter of technique. Simple explanations, examples, and common-sense tips will help your pictures mean more to you. This will also help you \\"see what you saw and felt when you took that shot.\\" One can learn from the endless pointers on techniques, equipment, methods, and manual settings for the best results, as well as some philosophical insights into what different types of photography is intended to bring about.There is good referencing and historical notes on photography as well. Where did the photography term \\"candid\\" come from? Erich Salomon, an early photojournalist, who so enthusiastically wanted to capture the true and natural human condition, he hid his cameras in hollowed-out books. The authors note quite correctly, that keeping a low-profile, shooting frequently and rapidly, brings the best chances of getting a successful candid--because very few shots actually will capture those moments that typify everyday life.Some photo history tid-bits mention for example, that in 1878 Eadweard Muybridge won a famous bet. He wanted to prove that all four of a trotting horse's hooves are off the ground at one time. His picture proved him right.Some photographers' works and their techniques explained in the the J of P include: Annie Leibovitz, Joyce Tenneson, and one of my favorites for unique shots of natural wonder and travel photography, Galen Rowell. The chronology of photojournalism, pioneered by Dorothea Lange, is also covered.The authors note that as you take more pictures of what feels good and right to you, you will start to develop your own unique style that is yours. It's a style that you and others will be able to recognize. Photos, are a part of you: your likes, perceptions, and beliefs about what is worth immortalizing. This takes place on a subconscious level as well as a cognizant one. You can't always quantify it; that's the beauty of it.Digital is steadily making it's way to dominate photography. But still, For the 35 mm this book contains hundreds of tips, techniques and practical advice, expressed plainly, that will make all the difference in your photos. From the serious minded to the casual shooter, to someone who pops off their point and shoot. We all wants the photos to represent what we felt when you snapped the shot."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Photography","review":"Photography today is forever chinging with the advent of everything digital. But to create good images you still need knowledtge that comes from experience, questions and most of all BOOKS. The \\"Joy of Photography\\" books are two of the best books I have in my own library for aspiring photographers. The text is easy to read and not too technical as to scare anyone off as a beginner. The book explains shutter speeds and 'F' stops and what changing them does. There is a lot to know in photography if you have the passion to do so.. This book touches as many subjects and accompany the text with a multitude of beautiful pictures giving you ideas on creating your own..I bought the first edition when it first came out and recently loaned it to a friend who I sold a Pentax SLR to and I have since bought this revised copy.

Things have changed since then, especially technology. Nothing referencing digital. If digital is your thing, find another book."},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"The use of terminology in this book is so inconsistent, it is all over the map! Example, in chapter 3, &quot;server&quot; sometimes refers to a daemon, sometimes to a machine, sometimes both usages in the same sentence. Similar crimes are committed with the words &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;local&quot;, and several others. I'm no neophyte at client/server networking, but I couldn't make head or tail of some whole paragraphs.Contradictory information is presented. In one section we are told that only the server machine needs a daemon, yet elsewhere (e.g. Fig 1.2) we see a daemon on both client and server.The writing is highly repetitive. Example: Chapter 2 explains over and over again how the server daemon spawns a child process. Once is enough! Get on with it.The book digresses from the topic on strange tangents. The whole digression in Chapter 1 about hosts.equiv/.rhosts misconfiguration leads nowhere. After an 8 page digession, we learn that this has nothing to do with ssh, and is not a problem ssh addresses.This book lacks the essential structure that would guide the user through the learning process: Starting with an overview, describing the functionality in broad strokes, then filling in details in later chapters. At the point where I gave up about halfway through, it had still not yet given a good synopsis of WHAT SSH IS. By that point, the reader should have been told in broad terms the main functionality, the security philosophy, where and how keys are generated, stored, and communicated, the roles that the public and private keys play, what criteria are used for authentication, etc.Finally, this is a book that has not targeted a particular audience. Is it for beginners? Then define your terminology and apply it consistently. For experts? Then cut the senseless elementary material, and all its tiresome repetition. Is it a reference book? Then trim the fat and organize it by functionality. Is it a tutorial? Then structure it top-down.I want my fourty bucks back!"},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"Because English isn't my mother language, it's not easy for me to come up with forty synonimes for bad, but they would all be deserved.The author clearly doesn't know the difference between server and client,or between parent and child process for that matter. I know this is hard to believe, but the author clearly doesn't have a clue what a socket is (the server listens for sockets, the client sends sockets &lt;sic&gt;).10 pages of ./configure output just to get the pages filled are a waste of paper, but at least don't contain to many errors.The name McGraw-Hill on the cover doesn't seem to guarantee any quality any longer.I'm sorry I saw the first review too late."},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"I disagree with the three people previous to me who reviewed this book. I found it to be a great beginner's reference for compiling, installing and configuring Secure Shell (SSH), as well as learning some of the additional tricks it can do.I have been using SSH for about two years, on AIX and Solaris. I learned a lot from Chapters 8 &amp; 9 about using SSH through firewalls as a sort of &quot;poor man's&quot; VPN. The book also spells out the difference between the 1.5 and 2.0 protocols.UNIX System Administrators with little or no knowledge of SSH will find this to be an excellent, step-by-step guide. Experienced users may learn something they didn't know. There are some minor errors, but overall they have no impact on the usefulness of the book.Developers who are looking for tips on modifying, enhancing or otherwise hacking SSH code will not find much here to help them.A book like this is long overdue and I'm glad somebody finally wrote it."},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"This is rotten book. Anyone who can figure out how to install by following instructions in the INSTALL file, has nothing to learn from this book.I would love to see a book that deals with ssh on the same level API level that Apache and BIND have been dealt with, or even an advanced configuration guide. This book does not even make a nod in the direction of either of those goals."},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewers; this is a very useful book. In style it reads like a software manual--but don't take me wrong! I mean that the author provides lots of details, exactly the sort of information I was looking for before installing the program. I felt that the author's walkthrough of the &quot;configure&quot; process, which another reviewer criticized as unnecessary, was nicely annotated and gave an excellent feel for the process of installing SSH. I'll admit that a lot of people have seen &quot;configure&quot; do its stuff a thousand times before and can skip this section. For relatively inexperienced sysadmins, however, this kind of detail is reassuring and valuable.The author writes as a person who understands the operation of the programs in detail; sometimes you get little tidbits that seem oddly out of place in a user's guide (such as the discussion of child process forking in Chapter 3, which seemed to have offended one reviewer so badly), but which I thought were clearly explained. I didn't notice any technical errors in the author's explanation of clients, servers, and daemons, and I write code like this for a living. It's a good explanation, probably lots more detail than most people ever wanted to know, and it might be better relegated to an appendix, but there's nothing wrong with it, and I enjoyed it. Lighten up, people; if you don't care about the details, then skip it. (Note to the author: if you ever decide to write a book on client/server programming, call me!)It's true that you can find a lot of the same information in scattered FAQs and mailing list archives on the net. But I've seen a growing number of HOW-TO's and web pages out there, set up by pioneers who struggled with earlier versions of SSH; after finally getting it to work, they wanted to spare others the pain they encountered while at the same time saying, &quot;Look! I got it to work!&quot; This book brings a lot of useful information together in one place. For the next edition, more details on Windows NT clients would be appreciated, but for Unix, this is THE book for ssh right now.&quot;I want my fourty (sic) dollars back,&quot; is a terribly devastating (and very funny!) review, but I don't think it's deserved. I almost didn't buy this book for a long time, after reading the early, poor reviews. I'm mad at myself now for not buying it sooner--it's a good book and doesn't deserve the poor press.This is the only book available on SSH right now; it's right up to date, and it's well-written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Unix Secure Shell (McGraw-Hill Tools Series)","review":"I bought the book after meeting Ms. Carasik at the RSA conference last March. It is useful as a high level overview, but one cannot trust the details. In some places, the author appears to simply make stuff up. For example, on p118, the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable is correctly defined but is also claimed to be related to the SOCKS network proxy. On p243, it is suggested that the reader use &quot;something like Perl or a shell script&quot; to generate the random number needed for setting up X authentication. I had to search the Web to find a one-line perl expression to do this, and then I had to refer to volume 8 of my O'Reilly X set to figure out how X authentication really works. Very disappointing!If I were in the market for a Secure Shell book today, I'd wait for the new one coming from O'Reilly.

Sure there are some things I felt out of place (the server discussion in chapter 3 I felt could have come later). I thought the book to be useful overall. The discussion on configure/make/make install; while mundane to an experienced admin, would be invaluable for a novice. I felt that this book has value as a reference in SSH. The only suggestion I have is that a more thorough explanation of authenticating with public keys would have been helpful. In site of that, I believe this will be an excellent book with a few minor tweaks in a second edition. I am sure Ms. Carasik is reading these comments and taking them into consideration. The previous reviews of one star are a bit harsh. The comments about HOWTOs and man pages by previous reviewers are not necessary. If you look hard enough you can find all you need to do anything in man pages and HOWTOs.

The topics seem familiar, but they never feel tired. The three main roads of the plot - the author's attempts to become pregnant, her father's journal as a merchant marine, and the author dealing with her father's death - are laced together like one of those old Ivy-League footballs from when helmets were soft.

It is a delicious kind of memoir/ narrative of the author's thoughts about her father's recent death, and her current inability to become pregnant in New York City. The prose is very sparse and the book is only 101 pages even with an afterword, but it's well worth it. A good read for anyone who likes Eggers/ McSweeney's stuff, or who is dealing with the death of a parent or becoming a mother."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"I just finished Amy Fusselman's book and loved it! Every page was full of humanity and great heart.I very much related to her story on a personal level. The mix of Life and death is ironic.

I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"I am unable to like Amy Fusselman. It would seem I'm a minority as 'Pharmacist's Mate' is a best seller, however, I am prepared to take the risk. From the beginning the book is lacking in emotional maturity. Instead the reader is drawn into an inconclusive angst that suggests the beginnings of a severe psychological disorder on the part of the author.We all have father's. Eventually they die. There is a tendencey to golorify the dead in our bereavement to levels of greatness the breaved one could never have achieved in life. Am I to feel empathy for a man who had a penchant for guns (a fixation that is never really explained) and who dies in relative peace, granted anonmity, surrounded by his loved ones? He leaves behind of course a daughter, who's sole purpose it seems is to procreate his and her own, insignificant myth.It is a little banal. The language unchallenging. I wish I could say more. I can't."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"At least it was only 86 pages long. I think most people will like this because they can associate with it. However, having lost a father and being able to know what the author is going through does not a good book make. This is boring and while there are some interesting insights she tries to be too clever, for example the numbering switch in the middle. This book defines smug, she thinks she is better read than the reader and wants to show it off. But it is an arrogant smugness, an undeserved confidence."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"This book is not without its strengths. The selections from the author's father's journal are interesting. And I do not discount the personal experiences described, either the father's death, or the author's fertility treatments. The problem is that, as written, there is only enough real material for a long magazine article. The rest consists largely of references to what the author is eating, wearing, or listening to on the radio. It is difficult to imagine what, if anything, has been excised. In one excruciatingly cloying passage, the author repeatedly refers to herself in the third person as 'the possibly pregnant person.' I am an enthusiastic reader of McSweeney's, and wanted to like this, but could not. That said, Ms. Fusselman has a good grasp of language, and may have a better book ahead of her."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"After reading a review in a Columbus Paper, I decided to go read the book,only to find that the review had been more entertaining than the book. The book reads like Dave Eggers on Mountain Dew, who sounds like David Foster Wallace writing about personal things in a postmodern fashion, which robs those said things of any nobility, and crowns them with a commercial vitality.The commercialization of the death of loved ones, and Other Forms of Personal Misery made Public, seem to be staples at McSweeneys Press. I have learned this, and now, for enjoyment I shall run into brick walls instead of buying into the hype."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"I never write these reviews, but I just read the one about how Amy Fusselman was commercializing her grief, and I was sickened. That reviewer is obviously confused. Why would that reviewer read and review a memoir if he has a problem with memoirs?! Moreover, if he's got a problem with people writing about their lives, then he better throw out about 80% of the world's literature. Further, what does &quot;Dave Eggers on Mountain Dew&quot; mean? That would imply that Fusselman's book is hypercaffeinated, when it's just the opposite. My guess is that the reviewer didn't read Fusselman's book, or Eggers's, or Wallace's, for that matter, and he's upset that McSweeney's didn't take HIS book to publish. Anyhoo, The Pharmacist's Mate is brilliant, understated, profound, perfectly written and deeply moving. It takes courage and a huge heart to write candidly about actual life, and this is what Fusselman has done. Long live the Literature of the Truth."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"It is very difficult to talk about tiny things and at the same time talk about immense things, but this writer seems to do it naturally, and the result is a beautiful, interwoven story, filled with sweet, serious, funny observations about her immediate situation, her place in larger situations, and the places of others in both her life and their own. With an amazingly light touch, things that seem to be very different and simple are shown to be connected and extraordinary. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"In his essay \\"On Writing,\\" Raymond Carver gave a great bit of advice: No tricks. In true Carver fashion, he'd pared this down from Geoffrey Wolff's edict, No cheap tricks. Carver's skeletal prose is largely out of fashion now, which is sort of a shame, because Amy Fuesselman's The Pharmacist's Mate proves that honest, bare bones writing is still capable of tremendous power.The Pharmacist's Mate is a brief, though not slight, meditation on death, birth, family and music. I found the parts about music particularly interesting, with Fusselman veering as she does between the visceral powers of sea shanties, AC/DC's \\"Hell's Bells,\\" and \\"Row Row Row Your Boat.\\" In Fusselman's world, music is one of our most mysterious properties. It takes up space, fills whole stadiums, whips up emotion and inspires devotion, yet it remains invisible, something that can't be touched.Of course, death is just as intangible. But rather than fill space, it sucks people into it. \\"After (my dad) died,\\" Fusselman writes, \\"I saw that people and space are permeable to each other in a way that people and people are not. I saw that space is like water. People can go inside it.\\" And we are there with her, with her family, around her father's deathbed when he finally slips into the space between them.But this book isn't merely about his dying. He is alive in these pages, too, in the form of journal entries from his days in the Merchant Marine. These are the most priceless sections of the book. They speak in the voice of a young man learning about the world (literally). He shoots sea gulls with a pea shooter, practices using a sextant and treats his shipmates for shock and VD. My favorite line (written after some of the crew on his ship leaves): \\"I sure hated to see Freddy Hoeske go, for he was my best buddy.\\"The Pharmacist's Mate defies easy categorization, but I guess you could call it a memoir. It succeeds, though, where other contemporary memoirs fail (or worse, become a big boring mess of solipsism and self-pity) because it reflects something larger than the interests of the author. (For a touchstone example of this, see Martin Amis's Experience, which is very, very great.) It does this, in part, because the writing is lean and disciplined. That's the quality that I admire most."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"A very short memoir concerning the author's attempts at artificial insemination and her grief over her father's death, interspersed with entries from her father's WWII-era journals of his days in the Merchant Marine.

My soul was pierced with Amy Fusselman's recounting of her father's death, interwoven with his own words and her own very present 21st century uphill battle to become pregnant. The eternal cycle of life and death theme was not lost on me, but, I think what shattered me most was the theme and feeling of loss that pervades this book. What do we do with loss? How can we possibly accept it? Can we control it? The author tries to do this and she can't. We must accept it, in all its forms and trundle on . . . humorously, persistently, searching . . . which is the only thing we all can do."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"Kudos! to Amy Fusselman on her first book, The Pharmacist's Mate. A delicate and filling fare, this book is not only about events: trying to conceive, mourning the loss of a parent, discovering and uncovering.

She is dazzling in the cloak she wears, which is her art, her life. Upon meeting her, I immediately wished that I could spend hours with her, drinking coffee, eating sweets, and being swept up in her magic, her art, her life. Anyone who reads The Pharmacist's Mate will want to meet Ms. Fusselman, and talk with her about her observations, which I pray will continue to permeate her future writing efforts. The Pharmacist's Mate was such an enjoyable and effortless read, and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Fusselman's fragrantly seasoned words."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"Please, oh please, oh please, young postmodern writers of today, stop using gimmicks!

It's not that I object to references to the everyday, but the goldfish, the AC/DC, the calling up the ultrasound company schtick, it just seems so tired and overdone. Douglas Coupland was cloying even back with Generation X, and here it's the same thing more than a decade later. McSweeney-type writers seem so nervous about sounding earnest that they thwart their own voices, which might otherwise be strong and affecting. It's like second-rate Don DeLillo. Please, oh please, oh please, just write good stories with strong characters who navigate contemporary society without having to make a Seinfeld-like quip about everything."},{"Title":"The Pharmacist's Mate","review":"I am a big fan of McSweeney's Books and have been reading the Quarterly Concern for awhile as well as many of their book offerings. Generally, I enjoy these books, but occasionally, I don't connect with them; The Pharmacist's Mate is one such book that I just couldn't connect with. Yes, it is well written; yes, the author has something to say...just no to me. Even though I have lost a father, I don't struggle with the meaning of that loss; and, since I don't strive to procreate, the struggle to conceive a child is lost on me.That said, I must admit that it is a very well written book; I especially liked the WWII era journal entries of the narrator's father's time in the Merchant Marines; they were an interesting window into that life.So, I would give this book FIVE stars if it spoke to me, but I only give it three because it was a bit of a lost effort on me. In the end, I would recommend this to anyone, because I think most people will find something where I did not.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Making Love: A Novel","review":"In Jean-Phillippe Toussaint's world, the details matter. The author of _Monsieur_ as well as _The Bathroom_, Toussaint excels when cleverly describing situations in agonizing detail, with all the skill of an artful rendering or a classic oil painting. There are no whirlwhinds of action, barroom brawls or car chases. The action in _Making Love_ occurs in scenes involving dropped umbrellas, inconvenient faxes, and missed taxis. A couple has drifted apart, and their relationship will apparently end in Japan. An ultramodern Tokyo provides the sterile spaces against which the drama is played out. The narrator carries a bottle of hydrochloric acid with him at all times. What will he do? Will he toss it in the face of a stranger? His girlfriend? The female protagonist, a prickly conundrum, cries and sulks. As their worlds seem to crumble around them, the couple tumbles through a landscape of outer calm and inner turmoil. As the reader comes to finish the novel, he realizes that Toussaint has made himself a hero of sorts, simply through the molding of his bleakly wonderful creation.What a marvelous novel. While _Making Love_ has none of the humor of _The Bathroom_ or _Monsieur_ (both are recommended), it remains a worthwhile read for Toussaint's gifted description of lives coming apart."},{"Title":"Healing with the power of your mind","review":"Being-just Being-is the goal here. The music is soothing, cyclical, and supporting. Bussolino brings a skillful voice, affirmative and understanding, to her relaxation exercises picturing a beach and its surroundings. The point is to release all that conditioning that forms our superficial joys and our ephimeral depressions. Hurt and fear are lifted from the body: &quot;Observe the sadness lifting up and evaporating. You are no longer sad.&quot; Eyes closed, body relaxed: &quot;Feel relaxed and revitalized...Youe heart is stronger, your lungs regenerated.&quot; The music flows in a digital cadence and is created and produced by Rizwan Ahmad: &quot;These compositions were channeled through my spirit guides. I thank them and thank YOU.&quot; For long periods of time, there is nothing but the music to create spiritual waves of floating, guiding us with words past our inhibitions into the free space of creative evocation. Then, there are the brief silences, the white space between words and the music, that form a background that is Truth. We are That. And this discerning grid of words and music focuses our rational minds so that our souls can Be. Being is the alpha and omega of this remarkable tape of profound empathy, offered with lucid and concrete guidance."},{"Title":"Healing with the power of your mind","review":"These easy to follow tapes are perfect for those who are new to meditation.

This is a wonderful beginner's meditation set that also offers great basic techniques for the seasoned user."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"DARK OF THE MOON takes place in the Appalachian Mountains. It is a play about a witch boy named John who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Barbara Allen. John has a conjur woman turn him into a human. The only condition of the spell is that Barbara must remain faithful to John for one full year after they are married. If Barbara is not faithful, then John will turn back into a witch boy.The play is beautifully written and allows actors a wonderful opportunity to use the Appalachian dialect. At times, the words of the characters become poetry in motion. Nevertheless, DARK OF THE MOON is not a very uplifting play. Yes, it deals with prejudice and loss and hypocrisy; but because of the way the play is written these issues have no purpose and give the play no meaning. Therefore, though the play maybe poetry in motion, it has no soul."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"This is a passionate yet tender look at love. The story of the Witch Boy (John) who gives up his magic for the love of Barbara Allen, and the consequences, points up predjudice and fear of the unknown. The play is well written for the characters and has many opportunites for cameo roles in the casting. It is an ideal play for small theatres to consider producing. There is a wonderful use of appalchian dialect in the characters and ample chance to add ballads and rousing dance to make it a musical as well. The Opera version doesn't yet do it justice. I have had the joy of doing several productions of this work (one with Mr. Richardson) and feel it is a great piece to represent American theatre."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"This is one of the lost treasures of the American Theater. Once one of the most produced plays by high schools and colleges it has lost stature and is only produced occasionally. The reasons for this are a mystery to me.As an actor's exercise it offers performers (particularly young ones) a chance to stretch and discover different cultural types.Based on the ballad \\"Barbara Allen\\" the play about a love affair and marriage between a Witchboy and a beautiful young woman is highly theatrical and filled with a mystical and earthy quality. Appalachian characters and traditional mountain songs add to the color and whimsical nature of the story."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"excellent playabout legend of Barbara Allen and witchboy. would make a great movie. love the story. dramatic and engrossingly hot."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"I've seen this piece performed and just reading the script made it seem so full of possibilities.

I would love to be a part of this play."},{"Title":"Dark of the Moon","review":"It all started in the mountains. John the witch boy climbs up conjur mountain.

When John come into town durning a dance he finds his Barbra and her date Marvin, the town stud, he desides that he will cut in. Marvin doesn't like that too much, but john still has a little of dark power inside of him... While performing cut from this play, the charater loss all sense of acting and truely became there parts.

I played the part of Conjur Man in the play."},{"Title":"Seaplanes","review":"A true \\"coffee table\\" book, this large format volume features a lot of big color photos and text which is best described as a colloquial history. The book is well laid out and very attractively typeset, and includes an index and a short but interesting list of on-line seaplane references sources. The text is rather lightweight, but contains some interesting anecdotes, including three crewman reminiscences in separate inset boxes. Several quirks show up in the narrative: all Empire \`boats are called \\"Canopus\\", designer Dr Richard Vogt ends up as \\"Ingemar\\", the Hughes \\"Spruce Goose\\" is rather overexposed, and Langley's Aerodrome is described as \\"well designed and constructed\\". The black and whites are all sepia tinted, an unnecessary affectation which always annoys me. Almost half of the photographs are color shots; this means that many of the seaplanes depicted were recently flying. Quite a number of these are lightplanes, while a few more are restored \\"warbirds\\". Unfortunately, the restorations (and some paintings) are generally not noted as such in the captions, which themselves are the weakest feature of this title. The captioning is short and superficial, and often at odds with the text. For instance, the Do 18 is said to have been designed to fulfill the same patrol mission as the PBY, although the body text correctly notes its origin as a transoceanic mailplane. A very interesting photo of a Mariner resting on a vertical flotation base (sort of a mini \\"Texas Tower\\") results in a comment about deteriorating flying characteristics, when it's clear the contraption was never meant to fly. A misplaced Kingfisher shows up where a Curtiss CS should be, Solents are identified as Empires, the DH 60M is dubbed D 460M, etc. It's best to sit back, relax and enjoy this book for its handsome layout and big, clear pictures, overlooking its quaint misconceptions and outright errors. Look elsewhere for hard historical, technical, and detail data about seaplanes."},{"Title":"Seaplanes","review":"I love seaplanes so I like any and all books thereon. This book was obviously produced as a coffee table or picture book. It successfully meets the implied goals of this project. The photographs are excellent and mostly in color. A very nice selection of aircraft are presented. This type book usually does not offer itself as a detailed history and this book certainly is not that. Ironically, I would rather have the book in a smaller format making it easier to read and study. The best part is that the book is now available at very low prices. At this level it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Integrating Corba and Com Applications","review":"This is a disappointing book. It represents a very bigoted view of the world of distributed objects. The authors are CORBA zealots, and spend more time sniping at COM than conveying insight into the problems faced by programmers in the real world who have to make real systems talk to each other. Only near the end of the book does it even consider the possibility that you might want to call COM server objects from a CORBA client. But, OMG's CORBA interworking specs are very well written and handle the material much better. Download the CORBA/IIOP 2.2 Specification at the OMG web site."},{"Title":"Integrating Corba and Com Applications","review":"The book is ok, but it doesn't leave you with enough information to sit down and write code with a COM/CORBA bridge. The other poster that said this book is biased to IONA's COMet product is incorrect though - I don't think COMet is even mentioned in the text, which is a shame, since COMet is the most popular COM/CORBA bridge around."},{"Title":"Integrating Corba and Com Applications","review":"I bought the book and read it twice and found it was not what I expected.

The new book is great if all you need to do is get around a single town, as it's laid out in alphabetical order with a town to each page. Having the street index on the same page is handy too. But the pages don't relate to one another and if you're going from one town to the next or, heaven forbid, traveling across a few towns, the map is pretty useless. The older edition had the towns laid out like a giant cut-up map, with legends on the top, sides and bottom of the page telling you which map it connected to. The maps were sequential and opposing pages were a single map. The new book is a good reference for single towns, but to travel around in Eastern Mass you're still going to need an old fold out map."},{"Title":"Metro Boston Eastern Massachusetts Street Atlas (Metro Boston Eastern Massachusetts Street Atlas, 4th Ed) (Official Arrow Street Atlas)","review":"This is a handy map of the Metro Boston area.

This book and CD-ROM is now a crucial resource in our small corporate lab which tests and monitors routers and DSL network devices, such as DSLAMs.Particularly cool tools I didn't previously know about are:- ethereal : GUI-based sniffer (captures and decodes network protocol traffic over ethernet)- MRTG tool : monitor and graph network traffic from SNMP networking devices, such as routers, switches and DSLAMs (web output)- tkined : GUI-based full featured network monitoring program. Can dynamically discover network devices. Has a network topology diagramming tool.- tkmib : GUI-based MIB browser (GUI front end to Linux SNMP tools)The explanations and reference material for SNMP flavors and MIBs is the first really practical, *clearly explained* and complete-enough-for-our-needs guide to these areas that I've seen yet. Finally I feel confident in being able to test the MIBs in the DSL device we are adding features to (we have no SNMP experts in our group).The MRTG tool has saved us from having to develop a program to collect and report router statistics.The CD-ROM contains the collection of valuable tools, which saves time over finding them online and downloading them."},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux Network Management Tools (CD-ROM included)","review":"Red Hat Linux Network Management Tools is practical.

The defense-oriented experience of the authors is clear in this introduction. The third paragraph includes the most obtuse introduction to Mandatory Access Control that I've ever read. The distinction between DAC and MAC is a crucial concept towards understanding the limitations of DAC, which is what virtually all commercial products support, but unfortunately, this explanation would be incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't already understand the difference.The subsequent section &quot;Why DAC is not enough&quot; is somewhat better, but it still misses one of the fundamental problems with DAC-that of authorized users explicitly making data available to people who aren't authorized to have it. While MAC can indeed prevent the Trojan horse attacks described in this book from succeeding, it is misleading to give the impression that Trojan horses are the only way to defeat DAC.The section on MLS architectures is short, but useful in understanding multi-tier e-commerce architectures. Beyond that, the book becomes too technical for me, which is what I expected. Given that the authors have such a narrow vision of the field of security-that of the military and intelligence agencies with unlimited budges and insanely sensitive data-it isn't surprising that they lack a useful perspective from a business point of view.The era of Multi-Level Secure systems is pretty much over, having been so complex that even the intelligence agencies avoided them like the plague. No commercial Unix vendors are currently selling an MLS platform, and if the database vendors mentioned in this book are still selling such products, they certainly are being quiet about it. MLS databases are basically a giant intellectual puzzle, and for those who are interested in this type of intellectual puzzle, there is some value here seeing obscure ways in which a complex system can inadvertently leak data, and clever work arounds to plug these theoretical holes. In the early 90s, a great deal of research was being conducted in this area both in North America and Europe. Today, there is virtually no work being done on this area (outside of the author's university), and it isn't the trendy place for PHd candidates in Computer Science to make their reputation.This book is of some value to those who are deep into the functioning of highly-secure software (although I could suggest some other areas of research that would be of greater use to humanity). It is of no benefit to the casual reader, or even the CISSP candidate. If you are just looking to learn about the concept of multi-level security, which is an important concept for the security professional to understand, a more cogent explanation can be found in the still-useful text &quot;Computer Security Basics&quot; by Deborah Russell, and G. T. Gangemi.This book is at least 9 years too late."},{"Title":"MOUS PowerPoint 2000 Exam Prep","review":"I found the work-through of the book very helpful.

It's a profession that has a bit of an establishment atmosphere to it where entry to various levels is granted in secret. And it's often hard to understand where to start. Infosec Career Hacking attempts to demystify this process and show you not only generic strategies for employment, but ones specific to the information security field.The book focuses on career development, not on how to be a hacker or a professional hacker. It's full of some useful information about building a successful career, much of which applies to any technical field. It also focuses mostly on being in the infosec service business, not in product development or, to a large degree, operations. Keep that in mind when you think about buying it. While most of what you'll learn is generic technical career advice, some of it is focused.The first part of the book is especially useful, and I think provides most of the value that's not available elsewhere. Things that are covered may seem like basics that people should have just picked up, but it's hard to know what you're supposed to know when you change environments, let alone see it all together in one place. I find this section to be especially useful and reasonably well written.Chapter 1 opens up with a basic orientation of the infosec landscape, including the types of companies and organizations you may want to look at working with, the types of work and positions you see typically, and what kinds of skills you'll need to consider get the interview, let alone the job. Chapter 2 is much like a hacking book in that you're encouraged to perform some scout work on your potential places of employment. Good advice, and it's nice to see it demonstrated. Chapter 3 talks about getting experience and getting your feet wet in the infosec world. Things like conferences, local groups and meetings, and even security clearances are covered. A nice overview, but a it shallow in places, too. Chapter 4 focuses on the resume and the interview, the kinds of things that normally jump to mind when you think about career hacking. A decent overview, and good things to learn.Part 2 focuses on technical parts. These chapters, I felt, were a bit thin on value and attempted to provide too much coverage but without the depth. What I felt this part of the book was trying to do was to be a quick overview of what you should know if you want a career in information security without any of the work it takes. Because this is such a broad amount of material, and the book only spends about 180 pages on it, the coverage isn't deep. Instead, the cursory coverage is a detriment to the book's value.Chapter 5 is where I found the most material to complain about. This chapter is titled, 'The Laws of Security', and can be used for your benefit or your downfall. In the right hands, where the nuances that come from actually encountering these challenges in the wild and discovering the reasoning behind them, you can display wisdom. In the wrong hands, where you can't successfully defend a challenge to these axioms, at best you'll appear to be someone who parrots security luminaries, and at worst you'll look like an uninformed buffoon. If you decide to accept conclusions without understanding the reasoning behind them, you're asking for it.Chapter 6 talks about building a home lab of machines for attack. I felt this chapter devoted too much time to drooling over gear and not enough time discussing more equipment and more valuable gear. Large classes of lab resources, including enterprise applications, networking gear, and even commercial security software was left out. The disclosure debate was reasonably well handled in chapter 7, discussing the various ways that people have established this process. What's missing here is how to actually find where to send the report to and how to ensure it's been acted upon. And finally, a nice, succinct and reasonably comprehensive (if a little too short at times) classification of vulnerabilities and attacks fills chapter 8.Part 3, 'On the Job', is for when you finally have the position and now you want to keep your job, advance your career, and improve your skills. Unfortunately, this section feels a bit undeveloped in too many places. There's a lot to cover, but the chapters here lack any significant depth to them, and it doesn't feel like they really deliver as strongly as they could.This section opens with an approach to your career much like an intruder would take to advancing their compromise. Chapter 9 covers how to perform scouting of your new environment, how to get through meetings without messing up, landing your own projects and succeeding with basic project management. Thinking about striking out on your own? That's natural, and the next few chapters will help with that. Chapter 10 is a short list of ideas on how you can use your new knowledge and skills to benefit others, which can help you build a name for yourself and maybe even clients. Chapter 11 looks like it's trying to encourage you to become a local leader of information security knowledge, using that information specifically for incident response. In a crisis, everyone loves a hero, so why can't that be you? And finally, the book closes with a chapter on how to start looking at being an independent consultant. It's been said that you'll never succeed working for someone else, so why not work for yourself? This chapter introduces you to some of the possibilities here, along with some of the considerations. Overall, these chapters have some clear value to them, but because they try and cover so much, they feel underdeveloped and fail to really deliver a strong benefit to the reader.One of my big concerns when I began reading this book was that it would encourage you to simply become another script kiddy type consultant, capable of downloading a few tools and use old hat techniques to deliver sub-par results. That's a crowded marketplace already, so I didn't want to see anyone encourage that. Instead, it tries to impart valuable career skills. My big complaint is that it tries to do so much that it can't possibly succeed in all of them. It does a decent job, but in some places it definitely lacks the solid landing to make it stick. Overall, though, this uncommon book is a nice twist on the old career guides, tuned for the information security market."},{"Title":"InfoSec Career Hacking: Sell Your Skillz, Not Your Soul","review":"Do you desire a job in Information Security?

It's a collection of contributions by various authors, three of which were previously published. The main text never states the goal of the text, so I turned to the description on the back cover: \\"A technical guide to landing (and keeping) a job in the information security field... If you want to refine those skills to land a top InfoSec job and employer-funded trip to Vegas next year, you've come to the right place.\\" It sounds like ICH wants to be a sort of employment guide for \\"hackers,\\" but it ends up as a muddle of some useful original material and recycled chapters from older Syngress titles.On the plus side, there is some good advice in ICH. The first four chapters (Part I) do contain some helpful suggestions for people who have no clue regarding the information security profession. Unfortunately, much of this material is found within poorly presented sections, and next to filler-oriented lists and questionable screen shots. For example, do we need a full listing of the DoD Rainbow Series (pp 7-9), 2004 FISMA grades (p 30), Google search results (p 35, 36, 65), SecurityFocus mailing lists (p 61), USA, Monster, and other job search results (pp 69, 70, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102), and so on? I thought the sample resume on pp 95-6 was poor -- and this is supposed to help people be hired!With Part II, ICH gets worse. Ch 5 begins with \\"The Laws of Security,\\" which seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the book. The reason is simple: this is a recycled chapter which appeared in two other Syngress books -- 2002's Hack Proofing Your Network, 2nd Ed (HPYN2E), and 2003's Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box. I though Ch 6, describing home lab components, was one of the better (if not best) chapters in ICH. The author stayed on target and delivered useful guidance on selecting equipment for a home lab. Ch 7 is a disaster like Ch 5. \\"Vulnerability Disclosure\\" is a reprint of a chapter from 2004's Cyber Adversary Characterization. And Ch 8? Another reprint, this time from Ch 3 of HPYN2E.Part III resumes new material, but these chapters aren't worth reading. I got the impression that the authors thought they needed to be \\"technical,\\" so they threw in short discussions of network architecture, incident response, intrusion detection, and other topics. I didn't waste time on these chapters, and neither should you.Syngress publishes many great security books, and I've reviewed several recently; see Phishing Exposed or Software Piracy Exposed. If Syngress wants ICH to return in a second edition, they should bring in an editor who cuts out the three recycled chapters, the worthless screen shots, and other fluff, and directs the authors to deliver useful material."},{"Title":"InfoSec Career Hacking: Sell Your Skillz, Not Your Soul","review":"Although the background feel of this book is to help those who are/were hackers (possibly in the illegal sense of the term) be able to apply their skills legitimately, those with any kind of information technology background can greatly benefit. From the start, the authors delve right into getting the reader thinking about getting a job in the recently exploding information security field. They apply proper mindset as to what the reader should consider, how they should approach tactical job searches, prepare resumes and gather intelligence on obtaining their first infosec job (NOTE: NOT their DREAM infosec job; its geared at getting you your first job and they are very clear about this.).Overall, the information was presented in a highly positive and informative mannerand the book is a quick read with plenty of helpful advice.

At times you think some of the authors must have missed a memo or two, and writing for a different book. This could be the fault of the publisher or editor. Take some of the pictures in Chapter 6 for example, I could barely tell that they were computers, let alone their brand or models. These blurry pictures are next to worthless in the book. The publisher could do better in the QA department.Speaking of Chapter 6 - \\"Creating an Attach Lab\\". I had such high hope for this chapter. Unfortunately, all I got was a history lesson of hardware platforms, and all the different Sun SPARC chips and versions of operating systems. Its nice to have all these hardware to play with, some dating back 10-20 years ago - but it is unrealistic and I am not sure of the real value of it.Ch.7 - Vulnerability Disclosure is probably the worst ch. of the book. It misses the target audience completely. The discussion of the different types of \\"model\\" is compeletly out of place. You can find better resources on the Net.Links at the end of chapters are quite valuable though, hence the 2 stars."},{"Title":"InfoSec Career Hacking: Sell Your Skillz, Not Your Soul","review":"If you are looking to get into security as a career, read InfoSec Career Hacking. Good book!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. A book that discusses the aspects of each of the congregations in the US or world is a great reference tool in understanding what others believe. Is this book the one to choose for that purpose? First, I will discuss its contents, pros and cons before giving my final opinion.Rhodes' book begins with a very short history of the church (4 pages). He then defines 'denomination,' 'protestant' and gives a description of how to use the book.The books covers the following churches:AdventistsBaptistsBrethrenCatholicChristianCongregationalEpiscopalian and AnglicanFriends (Quaker)Fundamentalist and BibleHolinessLutheranMennoniteMethodistOrthodoxPentecostalPresbyterianReformedWith each congregation, Rhodes begins with a date of origin for the church, census of members and number of congregations. He then describes their beliefs and gives a chart of fast facts for the church. There are several added \\"fast fact\\" charts that detail theologies such as Calvinist and Arminian. Each congregation gets 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pages (except the Roman Catholic Church where 10 pages are written.) Some congregations have a robust history leading into discussion of the divisions within, such as the Orthodox church.Pros:--A large swath of churches is covered.--A good index aids in finding churches. For instance, I wanted to find out what the Nazarene church was like, and the index pointed me to the Holiness section, which I was not aware they were part of.--There is an index of persons that helps in determining which authors are from which church.--Rhodes speaks from an unbiased viewpoint. One could not tell he is conservative dispensational Protestant from this writing.Cons:--Rhodes left out a couple of churches I have wanted to learn about in my town, namely Unitarian. Granted, many do not consider the Unitarian church to be strictly Christian, but it is a prominent congregation that would be helpful to have in the book.--The book is VERY vague about church beliefs. Many of the churches described deny the inerrancy of Scripture, but that can not be determined by the wording used, as the writing makes little distinction between those that call the Scriptures inerrant and those that do not. One must read between the lines or have some knowledge of the church to discern Rhodes' writing. Views of Scripture is only one of the vagueries, but is the most prominent.--The book does NOT discuss the issues that set the churches apart. Worship is spoken about, again, in vague terms. Is Christ present in the Eucharist of the Lutheran churches? One cannot tell from this book. (Some Lutheran churches do teach this and some don't.) Which churches put high focus on speaking in tongues? One cannot tell from this book.My greatest critique is vagueness. Granted, Rhodes could not have been very specific without relying on some theological bias. But, more specifics could be told. From this book, it is very hard to tell why there are divisions. What divides the American Baptists from the Southern Baptists? Episcopalian from Anglican? Greek Orthodox from Orthodox Church in America? Volumes could be written, but little of it could be found out in this writing.Is this book the one to choose for the purpose of understanding other congregations? I have to give a resounding no. The breadth of this book is a blessing and a curse. He doesn't leave many out, but the book would have to be much longer to give any insight into the differences between the congregations discussed."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"Being a retired Congregational (UCC) minister the first thing I took a look at, in a Christian bookstore, was Rhodes' account of the people later to be known as the Pilgrims who traveled to these shore on the Mayflower. I was very surprised to read that they were led here by their pastor, John Robinson. In fact, John Robinson stayed behind in Leiden, Holland and died there in 1625. His wife who succeeded him once made plans to travel to America but for reasons unknown canceled them. As the assembly which had met at the \\"green gate\\" dwindled, she later joined the Dutch Church.John Robinson is rememberd for having said, \\"God hath yet more truth to bring forth from His holy word.\\"Unfortunately, Rhodes doesn't seem as scholarly as others who have written about denominations, such as Mead, Hill and Atwood in the Handbook of Denominations, which is what I reccommend."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"I found this book to be interesting in many parts, but fairly redundant and often too vague to be as helpful as it could be.The church history is interesting, and it is valuable to realize where all of the Christian denominations fit in the family tree. I also felt it is structured as a nice reference, so one could easily find a specific denomination.However, after a while, all of the theology started to seem to be the same--rather than highlighting the differences, he regurgitates the statements of each denomination in slightly different words for each one. Rather than reiterating the slightly different verbiage for each denomination regarding each major point, it woudl have been helpful to have a basic template with such things as inerrancy of scripture, belief in the Trinity, belief in the human and divine natures of Christ etc--and then have Yes/No or comments on how a specific denomination differs in one particular area. A chart comparing denominations would have been helpfu.I also found it frustrating that not much was said about worship style or structure of church services. While the cover of the book talks about it being handy for someone looking for a new church (or something like that), some things like liturgical worship style (yes/no, or shades of grey) or style of prayer (formal, thees and thous--or informal, \\"we just\\"...), or type of music (traditional hymns, organ music vs contemporary worship). Only a few churches who were considered very unique--ie, all singing a capella--were described in detail.I did find the \\"fast facts\\" interesting, although not always handily placed--definitions of 'millenial' beliefs were way after the first mention. And the comparision between Armenian and Calvinistic beliefs was interesting, but left out other perspectives which are neither of the 2.All in all, this is a decent book, a decent place to start learning about different denominations. I do wish it had more meat to it, and less redundency; more structure and focus on comparison/contrast and less regurgitation of what ever is on the church website."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"Ron Rhodes does not seem to possess the scholarship and background knowledge needed to produce an accurate guide to the Christian denominations in North America.

One despairs of an author of a \\"complete guide\\" who can write concerning the First Vatican Council (1869/70):\\"More than 800 Roman Catholic priests (sic) from around the world attended.\\" Forty years ago a Jesuit priest, the late Father John Hardon, S.J., published \\"The Protestant Churches of America\\", a work of such impartial, objective, and deep scholarship that it was set as a textbook in many Protestant seminaries.

Ron Rhodes does an excellent job in giving the history of the church and how it grew from a universal catholic church (catholic with a small c), to the Reformation, to today's denominations.The one thing that strikes me in reading Dr. Rhode's book is that all branches of Christianity agree on the essentials of the faith. Yes, they are disagreements on the non-essentials (the reason for all the denominations), but in essentials we have unity.One distinctive characteristic of the book is that Mr. Rhodes only includes true Christian denominations. You will notice that he excludes the likes of Oneness Pentecostals, Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses. In other books on Christian denominations you will see these cultic groups included.One critique I have of the book is that Mr. Rhodes seems to present the pre-mill dispensational rapture view as if it were the one true view. You will notice how he lists this view several times and lets it stand alone, as compared to placing it alongside other views in a chart (e.g. partial preterism, or progressive dispensationalism, which are never even mentioned in his book).Overall though this is a must book for those who love the history of the church!Patrick Foss"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"i skipped many parts of this because every single subdivision of each denomination seemed winded. the main outline's very good and worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"This book is a little old now but gives a great synopsis of each denomination.

It is less useful in describing the larger, older, \\"mainline\\" denominations which these protest denominations regard as \\"liberal.\\" Despite other reviews to the contrary, I thought the author's conservative bias was pretty evident. He cannot be expected in a very brief description to go into nuances of history, but he makes many factual errors which will be obvious to the well informed and misleading to a casual reader.Anyone interested in the subject will be better served by Mead, Hill, and Atwood's Handbook of Denominations in the United States."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations: Understanding the History, Beliefs, and Differences","review":"This book was never intended to be a Theology lesson on every church out there. It is a well organized topically given exercise of who the Christian Churches are. Frome whom were they spawned?

Perhaps if Mr. Rhodes wishes to make use of some literary criticism whereby some here have chosen to pass on him and maybe in his next version of this book he may choose to give a broader depiction with a better Prologue and Commentary area. But a book about Denominations is just that. A book that tells us as factually as can be sought out through preserved data of who, what and where these churches have come from and what do they believe.

All German agents who were sent to Great Britain were captured; they either worked for the British Secret Service or were executed. This activity involved the cooperation of many branches of government (p.viii). This cooperation was the one essential condition for success. The examples given by this book could be a manual of operations. Page xii gives the purposes of the Twenty Committee. Other books were written before, but this is the best document on the system. This book was published to offset the bad publicity suffered in the fifties and sixties (p.xvi).Page 49 says the German spies dropped by parachute were \\"an easy prey\\", and could not make radio contact \\"because of defects in the instruments themselves\\". I think this implies the British had a mole in the Abwehr who cleverly sabotaged their radios.One of the reasons for this system was \\"to get evidence of enemy plans and intentions from the questions asked by them\\" (p.58). Chapter 5 gives many examples, such as the American Questionnaire which asked detailed questions about Hawaii and Pearl Harbor in August 1941 (p.80). Page 85 tells of Plan Midas, a successful money laundering operation where Nazi money paid for British counter-espionage! Chapter 8 notes that sending information back to Germany via double agents meant that the enemy would not send in other agents (p.108).Deception was best assured by preventing dangerous information from being passed on, not by passing misinformation (p.110). They passed on facts which lead the enemy to deduce false intentions. Page 116 tells of the German agent who stayed in Lisbon and created stories of his visits to England. \\"Since he always reported what the the Germans expected to hear, and since many of his guesses were startlingly near to the truth, he was more and more readily believed.\\" In April 1942 agent TRICYCLE was to report on American research into the atomic bomb (p.176). 1942 marked a change: Germany now sought information on British offensives, not defenses. In 1943 the policy of the XX Committee was to reduce the forces on the Russian front. Page 138 tells of METEOR, the German triple agent. By 1944 the sole interest was the grand deception for the Normandy invasion. To make the date of attack appear later, to indicate the wrong location of the attack, and to suggest the attack was just a feint. The reports on the V-1 flying bomb were used to make them fall short of the target (p.179).Why did the Germans fail and the British succeed? He says it was the personal integrity of the British. German blunders were due to Abwehr officials profiting from their agent, and could not honestly judge the agent's work. Another is the fact that espionage in wartime is difficult and usually unprofitable; counterespionage is comparatively easy and yields satisfactory results (pp.187-190). Since espionage and counterespionage deal with different sides of the same problems, they should be as united as possible. At least activities should be on records accessible to each other. (This book necessarily lacks all mention of British spying in Germany.)"},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"This book addresses issue of differing views of future events (end times) with the readability of a typical high school book. Dr. Benware manages to be thorough while at the same time to keep moving.He begins with a basic review of the principles of interpretation and why people's views differ. (If you have always assumed that scriptures are difficult to understand, otherwise there wouldn't be such varied opinions, this section will be very valuable to you. Scriptures are not so difficult to interpret; it is simply that each person approaches scripture with a particular set of rules for interpretation. Different rules give different results.)Next he goes through all the major issues of end-time prophecy, presenting each significant view of the issue. For each view, he presents the arguments for it, and why others reject such an argument. While he treats each view evenly, he makes no pretense of hiding his own opinion. This frankness allows the reader to understand clearly what is being said without needing to wonder about hidden agendas. It seems to me that he is fair in his assesments, but I admit to being of the same school in terms of rules for interpretation.(Dr. Benware approaches scripture assuming that it says exactly what it means. This literal approach permits figures of speech when obvious and allegories where indicated. However, if the plain sense of a passage makes sense, then the approach is not to seek some mystical meaning instead of what it plainly says. The first section of the book gives the clearest explanation I've ever read of how the allegorical approach to scriptural interpretation developed from an effort to reconcile Biblical teaching to Greek Gnosticism. This section alone is worth the price of the book, without consideration of end-times prophecies.)"},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"\\"Understanding End Times Prophecy\\" is an overview that requires no prior knowledge yet is not dumbed down, since theological terms are not avoided, just explained. This book does more than lay out the usual amillenial-postmillenial-premillenial viewpoints; it goes deeper to first address the underlying theologies from which the differing endtimes interpretations arise, explaining the significance and present relevance of the different covenants God made with the nation of Israel. I very much appreciated that since how one views the covenants greatly affects worldview, the Church, Israel, and endtimes prophecy. The rapture, tribulation, and millenium are discussed as expected for this type of book, but Benware goes the extra mile in mentioning more recent rapture view variations. There's an interesting final section, \\"Understanding the Future of the Individual\\" that gets into death theories and the eternal state. I recommend this book for accessibility and breadth, but for more focused depth on the timing of the rapture, birth pangs, Day of the Lord, consider checking out \\"Maranatha\\" by Renald Showers, also a dispensationalist."},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"Writer is a dispensational pretrib author and so he definitely bends his thoughts in that direction.

This book provides a solid overview of the pretrib/dispensational view of the events surrounding the Tribulation while bringing a good deal of background material in. The author divides his material into five parts, starting with an examination of how we should read prophecy in the Scriptures, then an overview of the various major views of Bible prophecy, then outlining future events based on a pretribulational/dispensational view, and finally examining the future of individuals within this prophectic system. Finally, there is an appendix of overviews of several specific passages important to understanding prophecy.The first stand Dr. Benware takes in his book is that prophecy should be read literally.\\"Prophecies that have been fulfilled completely have been fulfilled literally, and that gives us confidence to expect that those prophetic utterances that are not yet fulfilled (or completely fulfilled) will also end up being fulfilled literally. We believe that Jesus Christ will literally return to this earth and reign at His second coming because He literally came to this earth the first time, being born of the virgin Mary at Bethlehem. -Kindle Locations 551-554\\"This is the classic argument for reading prophecy in a literal way --a line of reasoning that's difficult for those who believe most prophecy should be spiritualized to provide an answer for. There's not as much dealing with hermeneutics as I might like in this section, but the overview is good, and well argued. Following this discussing, Dr. Benware takes on the Abarahamic, Davidic, and New Covenants, and their relation to the prophetic literature. This is a topic that's often addressed, and therefore this material is useful.The next section provides overviews for each of the major prophetic systems commonly held within the Christian church today, including amillennialism, postmillennialism, and preterism. Each system is carefully explained and critiqued. There are several sections here of interest that step outside the bounds of the section itself, including a discussion of Covenant Theology, and it's impact on eschatological belief, and a discussion about the term, \\"The Kingdom of God.\\" Next the author provides an overview of coming prophetic events from a pretrib/dispensational point of view. In this section he deals with the mid-tribulational and partial rapture positions, as well.Finally, Dr. Benware discusses the state of an individual after death and before the resurrection, and then the state of individuals after the Millennial reign of Christ on the Earth. The one disappointing section here deals with the Millennial sacrifices described by Ezekiel --the author holds that these are simply memorials, but sacrifices have never been memorials in the Scriptures. A more solid view of the meaning and purpose of these sacrifices would have added greatly to this section.If you're trying to sort out the different views, and better understand the predispensational/pretribulational view, this is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"Have conflicting interpretations of Bible prophecy left you confused about God's plan for your future? Read this book and you will become convinced that Paul Benware's pretribulational, premillennial, dispensational exposition of the Scriptures best explains what is ahead for mankind.Benware, a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, bases his teachings on a literal (grammatical-historical) interpretation of Bible Scriptures. This view leaves room for the interpretation of some words and phrases as being symbolic or figurative, but it insists that the Bible means what it says unless allegorical meanings are obviously intended. (The \\"Beast,\\" for example, symbolizes the Antichrist, but \\"one thousand years\\" means one thousand years.) Most conservative, evangelical Christians, including those in most mainstream denominations, accept this view of Bible prophecy. I believe that you will accept it too, if you ask God's Spirit to guide and illuminate your studies.Edwin Scroggins is the author ofBible Prophecy in a Nutshell: A Mini-Survey of God's Great Plan of the Ages"},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"A quick and easy run down of the basics of Eschatology.

However, it misrepresents Covenant theology.

However, reading further I discovered the authors merely reiterate the same old information; although they did it very well and at a level which is easily understood, I think that is commendable.I know God did not give the Revelation to John as a cruel joke to humanity, something we could never possibly hope to understand correctly. The authors do explain that God is perfect and so His word is perfect, therefore, if there are inconsistencies in teaching it must be human beings who make the errors because God does not make mistakes. It was refreshing to hear it from that perspective because then at least I have hope there is an answer to this current enigma in God's word."},{"Title":"Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach","review":"This book is going back to Amazon.

Twenty years later he finds himself, now the director of the VA's Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service, as a US team member re-establishing contact with Vietnam to determine their humanitarian needs. Downs faces his own prejudices and memories as he deals with his former enemies, and walks a political tightrope as the US tries to extend aid to Vietnam, without making it appear as though the US was trading aid for missing American soldier remains. Downs also examines his own preoccupation with his service in Vietnam, asserting, &quot;Once a man has contributed his blood and his honor to a country, he is always a part of what it becomes.&quot; His own veteran friends question his actions in &quot;helping the enemy.&quot;Downs' descriptions of life in late 1980's northern Vietnam are well-written and informative, as is his verbal portrait of his North Vietnamese counterpart, Dr. Bui Tung.A deeper book examining how the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong soldiers fought the war, written by former US soldiers who go through their own feelings of &quot;dealing with the enemy,&quot; is _ Inside the Vc and the Nva: The Real Story of North Vietnam's Armed Force_ by Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg."},{"Title":"No Longer Enemies, Not Yet Friends: An American Soldier Returns to Vietnam","review":"No Longer Enemies,Not Yet Fiends is the story of Down's dual journeys: as an official for reapproachment between two adversaries;and his own internal journey from hatred and suspicion to a large understanding of commonality of human suffering.In his book the author has more than anyone else,tried to convince himself,as to why a soldier who has lost his arm in war against Vietnam be there to help the same."},{"Title":"No Longer Enemies, Not Yet Friends: An American Soldier Returns to Vietnam","review":"After reading an excerpt from \\"The Killing Zone\\" I really wanted to like this book.

There is an abundance of information located between the covers that will augment the comprehension the reader has about the Windows operating system as a whole. Many of the things that are in this book are available in other locations, such as MSDN and other articles available for free; however having a concentrated reference is very convenient.Chapter 1-2: These chapters include a basic introduction to the way the Windows shell functions, and the various portions of the shell. It also introduces the Windows Application Programming Interface (API).Chapter 3-6: Esposito explains how to work with files, including special folders, using the shell API functions SHFileOperation() and SHFileGetInfo(). Manipulating files, gathering information, and browsing for folders, it is all included. Certain Windows tasks such as working with shortcuts are explained programmatically.Chapter 7-8: Chapter 7 introduces the concept of \`invading' the shell using hooks and COM objects: using shell events or events within other processes to trigger your own events. Chapter 8 explains how to spawn processes programmatically.Chapter 9-10: The first topic discussed deals with Windows icons, and then \`invading' the Windows taskbar. This example can be used to take over any other process. Areas of the shell that are supposedly not very well known are covered; the recycling bin, formatting drives, etc.Chapter 11-13: The Windows shell, \`explorer.exe' is investigated. The author describes to the reader how explorer works, both the default actions taken and how to invoke certain behavior using the command line. Benefits and differences between using rundll() and rundll32.exe are covered; complete with examples of how to use them. Esposito spends a lot of time on scripting, first offering examples of scriptable shell objects then covering how to use the Windows Scripting Host, (WSH).Chapter 14-16: Further levels of shell integration are presented as a conclusion to the book. Creating your own document types as well as many other features, like drag-and-drop support, give applications a native appearance in the shell. By creating new namespaces, the Windows operating system becomes even more customizable."},{"Title":"Visual C++ Windows Shell Programming","review":"I am a semi-advanced self taught C++ programmer. I use Borland's C++ Builder programming IDE. I found this book to be extremely valuable. It has provided me with more information on the pride and pitfalls of Windows 98/NT's shell implementation and API than I would've imagined. This is not a beginner's book. It won't hold your hand to get you through it's content. You will need a firm grasp of the Windows messaging system. Knowledge of and experience with the Win32 API is also important. While I am weak on COM technology (does it really provide things that can't be done in simpler ways, or are we just stuck with it?) I found that I could understand what was going on by (loosely) relating the COM objects and namespace extensions to C++ classes. This book does contain some typos and mistakes. You will have to know enough to spot them or else spend time on the author's erratta web page (haven't been there yet myself). This leads me to believe that the source code download isn't comprised of exactly the same code that's in the book. All in all, I truly wish I'd have found this book sooner. It could've saved me a great deal of time searching through many different resources for the answers to some of my recently overcome programming frustrations.

It's the only book that I found that has a complete chapter dedicated to this rather niche topic. Obviously the book also spends a great deal of time covering the larger scope of shell programming. All in all, I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about shell programming, and personally, I consider it mandatory reading for anyone who is planning on developing a name space extension.

This was a valuable blog-lesson for me: ask and you shall (sometimes) receive.I'm happy to report that the book is a complete success.This book is a collection of essays divided into two parts: Science and Perspectives. The Science half of the book is written by scientists well-known to life extension enthusiasts: Aubrey de Grey, Michael West, Robert Freitas, Ray Kurzweil, and Marvin Minsky to name a few.These authors work in different fields but share a vision of a future where degenerative aging is a choice - and a rather unpopular choice. For most of these scientists, it\`s not so much a question of \\"if,\\" but \\"when:\\"We can no longer pretend that we know so little about how to cure aging that the timing of this advance will be determined overwhelmingly by future serendipitous discoveries: we are in the home straight already.-Aubrey de GreyWhile I found the \\"Perspectives\\" half of the book a little slower going, ultimately it may prove to be more important than the first half.While the authors of the Science section outline potential paths to the goal, the Perspective authors ask whether the goal is worthy. Will we be plagued by overpopulation or lethargy if death is removed from the picture?The objections [to eternal youth] can be divided into two different categories: practical and philosophical. Practical worries might include: the population problem, the problem of scarce resources and environmental pollution, eternal youth that is only available to the wealthy, the accumulation of too much wealth and power by an elite group of immortals...A philosophical objection to life extension is the worry that the longer we lived, the less we would value our time. After all, a basic economic principle is that the value of a resource tends to increase the more scarce it is. Would we somehow value each moment less if we lived longer? Another worry that people may have is that a desire for life extension is somehow selfish. Perhaps budding immortals would become really self-centered and narcissistic?-Marc GeddesTo its credit the Immortality Institute allowed debate on these issues. Several of the Perspective essayists are quite critical of the goal of life extension.But if the authors of the Science portion the book are correct that radical life extension is coming, any philosophical arguments against life extension will ring hollow when it arrives. The Perspectives section is of greater value when it debates how to adapt our society to life extension, rather than whether we should pursue it.The publication of this book is certainly a landmark for the Immortality Institute. The Institute should be proud of this accomplishment. More importantly, this book is a milestone in the quest for life extension. The depth of the bench here, the willingness of respected scientists to contribute to such a book, is an important development.These contributors and others that follow can now investigate the possibility of radical life extension without the fear of being thought unserious. This alone could make all the difference.(...)"},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"The first part of this book provides a good introduction to the medical arguments that provide hope that within a few decades everyone will be able to achieve the health needed to have a life expectancy of a millennium or more. It's less technical than I would like, but probably provides good enough references to enable the serious reader to find the more rigorous arguments that lead to these summaries.In spite of the \\"Infinite Lifespans\\" in the subtitle, the book makes little attempt to ask whether we can avoid problems such as war, the heat death of the universe, etc.The book is well organized for a collection of articles by 18 different authors.The quality of the book goes downhill near the middle about where it switches to philosophical questions. Most of the arguments against really long lifespans that it attempts to refute are too superficial to deserve more than a few pages of rebuttal. I wish I had a quick way of determining whether there are better objections to long lifespans that the book failed to deal with.Some specific complaints:Max More correctly points out that people who use population concerns as a rationalization have given little thought to the relative importance of birth rates. But his claim that lifespan has no effect on population growth is almost as thoughtless. For birthrates less than 2 per couple, the difference between a fixed lifespan and an infinite lifespan is the difference between exponential decline and exponential growth. Whatever we assume about lifespans, achieving desirable and sustainable population growth rates seems like a nontrivial problem.Marvin Minsky says \\"There is no sign that we are getting smarter\\" over the past two thousand years. If the Flynn Effect isn't such a sign, it's hard to imagine what would be needed to qualify as a sign. (His chapter was written in 1994, so it may just be more out of date than the rest of the book)."},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"This book is amazing.

Most people will dissent upon review of that previous statement, but it is not ineffable, so allow me to elucidate further. In life man has only the ancient scriptures and modern manifestations defining the abilities of the gods. Since those articles were scribed by our hands and elicited through our interpretation of life, it is facile to see that in reality we have no competition for what is a god. Our ascension to those constitutions is inevitable, be it by evolution or assisted biological manipulation or merging with our mechanical technology. Over the coarse of the next fifty years, human potential is vividly confined only by a mathematical equation that will allow us to be capable of abilities limited to the gods in the pages of our ancient and present day literature. For one to retort what I profess is only failing to realize the extrovert and analog powers/abilities/technologies we have already achieved: audible language, written language, mechanical technologies (cell phones, television, vehicles, manufacturing facilities, computers, automobiles, spaces shuttles, boats, planes, trains, etc.), artillery (guns, missiles, etc.), atomic bomb, genetic manipulation, terraforming, atmospheric manipulation, the social MACHINE (this nativity is what has been/will be conducive for all of the former and latter abilities), etc. Unfortunately, what evokes lamentation for me is that there are few who realize the level of profundity and exponential acuity those endeavors required/will require for fruition. So, I will not concede that my perspective is equivocal. We have commandeered evolution and we will have the capitol on the sub-atomic/nanotechnologies that will allow us to alter the very fabric of nature. Is that not what the masses assumes that a god does?In the initial chapter of the book, on page 9, The Immortality Institutes admonishes, \\"This is not a strict division, as scientific possibilities are the starting point for all philosophy, and, in turn, the scientists in this book are not blind of the philosophical implications of their work.\\" These words are far too humble for the level of formidability that the ensuing pages draw forth. But, since this is a philosophical manifesto, do not the most salutary predications for politics, spirituality, economics, medicine, invention, etc. come from the elicitations of our society's philosophers? It is those who dare to extrapolate beyond conventional and archaic thought that challenges the elasticity of the human mind and the potential for what it can perceive. With the integration of our virtual foresights, these ideologies become of conventional conception and bears an endeavor by the very professionals who once gave those theoretical possibilities derision.In truth, this manifesto redefines immortality in ways that I had not even fathomed. A myriad of possibilities for immortality are offered in this book utilizing certain technologies that we harbor and those which have a conception that is imminent, or on the linearity of theoretical possibility. These technologies range from nanotechnology, atomic technology, genetic manipulation, concrescence with computers/chips, downloading and mapping the firing of neurons and synapses, immortal biological cells (which exist), cryonics (as a vessel for time travel and preservation), brain transplant into a more ameliorated biological or mechanical machine, nanobots that replace the lungs and heart, creating an imaged computer program of your neural networks to theoretically simulate you, etc. The possibilities are nearly limitless to obtain an extension of our biological life and defer senescence. Amazingly enough, it is intriguing to see how many of these technologies already exist, but due to laws against human experimentation they cannot be implemented. The key to understanding this piece of literature is that the predication is merely biological immortality, meaning you will not die or age due to senescence, but you would still be prone to death by accident, murder or disease.I hope that one, for the closed minded individual, would be able to keep an open mind about this read. The writers are not proletariats of society, they are degreed doctorates of multifarious disciplines, so that should aid one in understanding that this is a trek that is not limited to the desires of the intellectually impoverished, and, also one that will only get more fecundation. There are merely three laws of nature that obviate the physical manifestation of what we imagine: 1) fiscal indefiniteness, 2) a labyrinth of perplex mathematical equations, and, most importantly, 3) the intellect. This manifesto, along with others of commensurateness that identify the advancement of our mechanical and biological engineering, delivers a cacophony of truth to the archaic bigots of stagnation, and a sweet symphony of ornate spiritual scriptures for those who realize human potential. Call it fantasy. Call it hubris. Call it inane. Call it heresy. Call it crazy. Call it ostentation. Call it what you will, but the truth is that it is a movement that exists within the realm of our intellectual elite. Remain in a self-denying austere if you will, but the endeavor has an impetus that will be impeded by no resistance.No matter the auspicious content I do retain a level of despondency when reference to overpopulation that would ensue. In the last section of the book there are essays that both rebut and exalt immortality. One of these is an essay that defends against the concern of overpopulation. If the technology became available to everyone the population would precipitously increase. The author offers quite an optimistic, somewhat, credible and logistically affirmed argument about population density, what means cause rapid reproduction and other varieties of defense. But, overpopulation would eventually be inevitable and soon pose a problem if we were still confined to colonization on Earth. However, if we were to have the ability to colonize other planets and live on advanced space vessels the Universe would be our domain, and we would need a life span equal to the vastness of it. Obviously, it would not be beneficial for everyone to have immortality or an extensive life span due to their moral, social and intellectual insolvency.Inclosing, this is an amalgam of a multitude of essays from degreed men and women with an auspice that exponential life extension is on the horizon. Utilizing the representation of technology the Immortality Institute guides you through their reason for accepting the possibility of what we have thought, for far too long, to exist only in fables. This is an ephemeral read due to the end notes and bibliographies at the end of each essay, but imbues the reader that embraces the ideology that is the novel conception of immortality and its imminence. So if you are one that likes to read esoteric topics, considered unorthodox, and are among the free-thinkers of society, this book is definitely for you. However, if you are a religious bigot of archaic perspective, or have difficulty swallowing profundity that takes an intellectual to comprehend, then you may not want to endeavor here."},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"SUMMARY: Overall, this collection of essays is a great and thought-provoking look at whether biological immortality, i.e. not aging, is possible (it is), how soon it will come (see below), and whether it is desirable (I think so, but if you're interested you should read it and decide for yourself). It's very well-organized considering the number of authors, and provides a lot of cool perspectives and predictions about present and especially future medical technologies (especially the first half of the book). For those with only passing interest in immortality research, the second half (about ethics) will probably become boring well before the end. With that said, I would highly recommend it to anyone curious about the idea of biological immortality. You should just realize going in that it is very optimistic and much of the science is either watered down or slightly outdated. That shouldn't be a dealbreaker. For most people, that is actually good because it means you won't be drowning in jargon and science that you have no way of evaluating. And if the science interests you, the book cites many other good books and articles you can check out. Just take note: this is an introduction, not a textbook.One more note: at the time of this writing, a free PDF copy of this book seems to be available online from the publisher (The Immortality Institute). Their wiki claims the book is free, and I know they have offered it and advertised it as being free in the past which is the only reason I mention it. I'm not clear on whether they mean to offer it for free now though, because it is \\"restricted content\\" if you try to navigate to it from their main website. If in doubt, I would recommend buying it. Plus, that way you have a hard copy and have supported immortality research.--DETAILED REVIEW--The first half of the book (Chapter 1) is devoted to anti-aging interventions. Several of these sections are written by people well-known in the area of rejuvenation research; I know that Rose, de Grey, de Magalhaes, and West are all well-published in peer-reviewed biological literature. Kurzweil is a well-known futurist who has written several notable books. The other 4 contributors to this part I am unfamiliar with, but the point I'm making is that these aren't random quacks. Many of them are well-respected scientists. With that said, their writing is frankly a bit below their usual level, probably because this book was meant for a lay audience and is too short for them to explain the science in detail. Despite this, they raise several excellent points. I particularly commend de Grey's idea of \\"escape velocity,\\" where he points out that each year of life a new life-extension technology grants us is a year in which medical research will continue to advance to buy us even MORE time, and so on.A few of the sections are really outside my area of expertise (which is biological aging research), so I'll leave them aside. The sections on nanobots and cryonics are among these; they were definitely interesting, but some of their predictions were quite bold (to say the least) and I simply don't know enough to evaluate them fairly.One final note about the first half of the book: Michael West's section about the need for allowing wide-scale embryonic stem cell research is rather outdated. There is now an ethically uncontroversial alternative, \\"induced pluripotent stem cells,\\" which do not involve tampering with human embryos. There is still a lot of debate about whether induced stem cells are as medically useful as embryonic stem cells, but they seem satisfactory for most purposes (and the technology is improving constantly). I don't know for sure which technology will win out (I would guess induced stem cells, simply because there is a LOT of pressure in the U.S. against using embryonic cells) but just bear in mind while reading that embryonic cells are not the only option anymore.The second half of the book (Chapter 2) is focused on the ethical aspects of antiaging research. As I mentioned earlier, it is a bit of a slog for those who aren't super-interested in the topic. However, there are a surprising number of people in the world who think that trying to extend life past 100 years or so is unethical (see below) so addressing the ethical basis of intervening in aging is extremely important. After all, as the embryonic stem cell debate proved, popular opinion can be extremely important in science.Unfortunately, despite what previous reviews have said, the book doesn't really offer any essays from objectors to life extension. It DOES provide both sides of the debate about \\"immortality,\\" but they distinguish that from \\"extreme life extension\\" in that \\"immortality\\" pursues the goal of no death AT ALL, while life extension just wants to add a couple hundred years to life. At least at first. And that's basically what the \\"objectors\\" say: we can worry about trying to live forever AFTER we figure out how to conquer aging. I agree. Personally, I'll settle for a few hundred years of life before I worry about trying to outlast the sun. The problem, as you've probably figured out, is that the \\"objection\\" papers really don't cover the objections to LIFE EXTENSION, which are the ones that matter the most.However, there is good news. The papers that argue in FAVOR of life extension actually do a good job of presenting the opposing viewpoints - the ones that most people actually care about (such as overpopulation, affronts against God, tampering with nature, the possibility that living forever will mean valuing our time less, the possibility that only the upper class will be able to afford antiaging therapies, and so on) - quite fairly. They rarely lapse into beating up a straw man, which was unexpected and awesome. Just know that if you want to hear the arguments against life extension from people who actually BELIEVE we shouldn't extend life, you'll have to look beyond this book (see next paragraph).As I mentioned before, I personally am strongly for life extension. However, if you're interested you should read this book critically and decide whether you think the authors' arguments make sense. Then find resources from the other side and read THEIR arguments critically too. Sorry. I know that's Science 101, but many people (notably, just about all of the popular media) don't seem to grasp it. Or don't care. Briefly showing both sides of a debate (or just one side, depending on your agenda) is not the same as critically evaluating the LOGIC underlying each side of the debate... but that's a different rant. Anyway, for those who are interested, one good paper arguing against life extension is \\"Who wants to live forever? Three arguments against extending the human lifespan\\" by Pijnenburg and Leget, which should be available free from Pubmed (a very well-respected repository of biomedical literature).Last, a note about timing:A previous reviewer has pointed out - and I agree - that authors are probably too optimistic about the \\"couple of decades\\" time frame given for medical advances allowing biological immortality (i.e., not aging) and other huge advances.Biomedical research is advancing incredibly fast. Sixty years ago we didn't even know that DNA was the \\"blueprint\\" that encoded information to allow us to grow, develop, and perform the normal chemical activities of life. Today we have sequenced the human genome (MANY different people's genomes, in fact), we routinely modify genetic information in model organisms to do everything from manufacturing drugs to studying gene function, and we are beginning to use gene therapy to target human diseases. But while there is plenty of cause for optimism, keep in mind that the development of any new medical technology in humans rarely works out as we hope it will at first. Even if we got a new drug perfectly right the first time - which would be extremely unlikely - it would still be years before it was approved for human use, and even longer before it was produced on a large enough scale for everyone to afford it. This pattern has held true for even theoretically simple medical technologies, so a complex process like aging would be incredibly tricky to intervene in, and moreover, even simplest questions about aging are still debated in the literature (such as what causes aging, and why we have evolved to age). So it could be a long time before we see truly effective antiaging therapies.I'm sure the authors would argue that the advances they are touting COULD come as quickly (or even more quickly) than they claim, IF society gave aging research the high priority that it deserves. As the space race proved, when society and the government throw a ton of financial and human support at a problem it can be resolved with stunning speed. But the support has to be there, and while the idea that biological immortality is both possible and desirable seems to be gaining fairly rapidly in popularity, aging research is not yet a high priority for the majority of people. In fact, in the only decent survey I've found, the majority of people seem to be more concerned about it than optimistic, though not by a huge margin (source: \\"Ethical, Social, and Personal Implications of Extended Human Lifespan Identified by Members of the Public,\\" Partridge et al. 2009). I would also note that the study I cite was done in Australia; in the U.S., aging research with the goal of significant life extension would probably be even more controversial, since religion is more prevalent here and \\"playing God / tampering with nature\\" was a common concern among those surveyed. By the way, if anyone has found a better survey, especially one done in the U.S., please comment and let me know.Anyway, the take-home message is that you should take the authors' predictions about the timing of aging interventions with a grain of salt. Depending on potential breakthroughs (or lack thereof) and the priorities of the public, their predictions could certainly come true in the few decades they claim - but we really have no way of knowing at this point. It could easily be much longer, and I think they may raise some false hope with their writing. If you want aging therapies sooner rather than later, the best thing you can do is advocate for it (and of course exercise, eat your vegetables, etc. - life extension therapies aren't the only thing that can help you live longer, and right now they aren't an option anyway. Side note: taking tons of supplement pills and that sort of thing won't necessarily help that much in most cases, although the only real damage is likely to be done to your wallet - check out, for example,Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacksby Ben Goldacre if you're interested in being entertained and learning more, and don't be put off by the stupid cover; it's actually quite well-researched).Anyway, like I said before, the public plays a big role in determining the direction of medical research, so advocating is a good way to speed things up. Plus, that way you don't need to go and get an advanced degree in biology (which reminds me - in the interest of full disclosure and for those who are curious, I'm an undergraduate biology major in my senior year). There are several big antiaging organizations that offer advice about advocacy. The Immortality Institute is only one of them, and depending on your goals they may not be the best fit for you, although as I think I've mentioned, their book is quite good. Google is your best resource. Anyway, sermon over.In summary......just kidding. The summary was at the top. But feel free to scroll up and read it again if you want."},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"For a long time, I have been considering the viability of immortality, albeit a subject that is still treated as either lunacy or taboo. I was happy to find that the tide is changing and that people are considering the subject more seriously. I eagerly purchased this book in hope of gaining enlightenment from those who have studied this important subject in more depth than me. I was disappointed, however, on many levels by most of the essays in this collection, which seem to all be authored by people on the fringe of science and philosophy (or even those who have barely any credentials at all).I would love to give a very thorough review of this collection - go into each essay in detail - but that is beyond the limits of my time availability. All I can do is summarize some of the main problems I found in these essays.Foremost, when the book considers immortality, it really only considers how to slow down or possibly eliminate aging. I was hoping for more comprehensive consideration of the subject. What is death, philosophically and scientifically or chemically? The subject is never treated in this manner. Another negative aspect of many of the essays is the overly sanguine outlook of the future. Each author relays that immortality is merely 20 - 50 years away. This is based on nothing more than unfounded optimism. Moreover, some of the views of solutions to aging come off as ridiculous even to those who foresee scientific miracles in the near future. The coup de grce was the \\"nanorobots in our underwear in the near future\\" proposition. (Biological scrubbing bubbles!!! Really?) The authors seems to have no idea of where science research stands today with any of these advancements and what it would take to approve any of their usage. And even though the focus of the book is on aging, the role of telemeres and the advancements in this most promising realm is never covered in much depth.One of the most egregious problems is the flawed logic. For example, when considering the population problem that immortality (or very prolonged aging) would pose, one author dismisses the problem since the propagation term in the equation is exponential whereas the lifespan term grows much slower. Yes, however, the point is missed that we are talking about aging in good health when people can spawn children for perhaps hundreds of years. Yeah, I think that might be relevant in the formula. (HOW WAS THIS MISSED?) There are several other similar examples of specious logic.The true source of my disappointment is in the fact that this book sets the subject matter back quite a bit. If this represents the present best thoughts on the subject, it is no wonder that the subject of immortality is still thought of as seriously as alchemy or perpetual motion. I strongly believe that one day (likely in hundreds of years) mankind will indeed overcome mortality, but based on this book, we are nowhere near prepared for that reality to pervade the thought of the masses. I give the book 2 stars since there are some good points smattered among the topics (e.g. if aging is solved, who will take any action that might lead to accidental death?)."},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"Goes through and explains the science behind cryonics. It disproves what many of the cryonics detractors assert. Over all a good read!"},{"Title":"The Scientific Conquest of Death","review":"Long Life?: A Journey into the Unknown World of CryonicsI enjoyed this book and also wanted to call your attention to another, a courtroom thriller about cryonics called Long Life?Long Life? tells the story of cryonics expert Dr. Rebecca Adler, who agrees to freeze the body of a virile, 34-year-old AIDS patient. She sets off a controversy that cuts across science, religion, ethics and the law. Her case serves as the touchstone and focal point for Long Life?, Phoenix attorney Robert Begam's second novel.To help her patient, a physicist who has contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, Adler performs a \\"pre-mortem\\" suspension, putting the patient into a cryonic state before he has been declared legally dead. The physicist requests the procedure to protect his body from the ravages of AIDS. He is convinced that, after a cure is found, he will be reanimated to live a rich, full life. The Maricopa County attorney's office sees the matter differently. Chief prosecutor Scott Novak files first-degree murder charges and seeks the death penalty for Adler, and a fascinating novel is off and running.Adler and her cryonics institute, the for-profit Omega Terrace of North Scottsdale, Ariz., engage famed New York trial lawyer Joe Purcell to represent her. He hesitates to get involved in what appears to be a lost cause. Finally he agrees because, as he says, \\"This will be the first murder case in which there is only one issue: Is the victim dead?\\"If you're interested in these issues, and you love a good page turner, you'll find this to be a fascinating, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"History of English Speaking People","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book. With his fine writing skills, Churchill teaches nearly 1,000 years of history in an educated, interesting, moving, suspenseful, and even entertaining manner. He also offers beautiful photographs of certain historical figures. One thing he does very well is that he gives a scholarly view of historical figures (like King Henry VIII) who are subjected to harsh and inaccurate views. My only complaint about this book is that he speeds over some things that should have been given more attention. (Just make sure this is not your only book on the subject.) If I was teaching history, I would most probably have my students buy this. Letting this book go out of print (in my opinion) was a MAJOR MISTAKE!"},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"In The Fate of Their Country, Professor Holt skillfully and helpfully clarifies the vexed question of slavery extension, a controversy that played an important role in dividing North and South and setting the stage for war.This is a relatively short book, and for a reason: Professor Holt wishes to acquaint a larger audience with some of the important issues that he has covered at greater length in some of his other work. Hence this accessible introduction.What I find so interesting about the book is that it shows rather convincingly that debates over slavery extension were often not about slavery per se. The question of extending slavery into the territories became an issue of Southern honor: whether or not Southerners actually wanted to bring slaves into, say, New Mexico Territory (none were there by 1860), the issue became a matter of principle between sections of the country that had been so often at odds in the past.The insistence upon slavery's extension into the territories was often a matter of saving face for the South rather than (necessarily) a matter of actually desiring to bring slaves there, particularly since neither North nor South seriously expected slavery to take root in most of the places over which they argued at such length.Moreover, the subject of slavery extension came to symbolize all the differences between North and South, including controversies over the tariff, a homestead bill, internal improvement legislation, and the like.Professor Holt is certainly not saying that slavery played no role whatever in the coming of the Civil War. But the issue has often been misunderstood, and it is Holt's aim to provide the reader with the evidence and the historical background he needs to understand the context in which slavery extension was debated. He concludes that irresponsible politicians, for their own narrow partisan advantage, all too often exploited the issue for demagogic purposes, with (ultimately) tragic consequences. A superb book."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"This short book by Michael Holt is the story of politics in America leading up to the Civil War. On the one hand, Holt makes a convincing argument that political leaders between 1820 and 1860 often acted out of raw political ambition rather than what was best for the country. In calculating the risk of taking certain actions Democrats, Whigs, and nascent Republicans took into account how their decisions would most affect their own political fortunes.While principle sometimes played a part, this can be seen in Calhoun's staunch support for slavery no matter what and Republican's anti-Southern stance in 1858 and 1680, in too many instances all that mattered was how issues can be leveraged to gain the most support for you in the next election.This is not a new idea in Civil War histories, but Holt makes an impressive case for it in just over 100 pages. The other theses of the book, the danger of sectionalism and the need to compromise, are also portrayed well. However, it is the danger of putting one's personal interests above the national that is the main lesson of this book. I don't believe another civil war is in any way imminent, but it would be wonderful if today's politicians would relearn that lesson. This book would be a great place for them to start."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"Michael F. Holt makes a great argument on past historical events leading up to the Civil War. He states clearly in the preface that he is writing this book to reach a wider audience. (And from the other reviews I can see he did!)It is a resource book containing thoughts he previously used in his books on the Whigs and the 1850's, but if you're an American History teacher or professor this book could be used in the classroom. It is a great addition to my library and would easily work in an academic setting to hit on all the major \\"coming of events\\" before the War.The only probably I have with this book is that Mr. Holt portrays John C. Calhoun as a radical. While me might have been in the 1830's by the Mexican War and the Compromise of 1850 Calhoun predicted the future of our Country and in his address to Congress in 1850 urged for compromise over disunion.I still would recommend this book to anyone who wanted some straight answers to the Antibellum period of United States history."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"This book is a great introduction to the political causes of the Civil War. Holt has written an engaging, easily understood work that focuses on the key political events and players in the decades leading up to secession and war. Having studied this period for 10+ years now, I still came away with new bits of information and interpretations that I had not seen before. The only negative to the work is that it does not have any footnotes or endnotes, but that didn't detract that much from the book overall. Featuring a brief listing of books to consult for further information, Holt's work here should serve as a great introduction, or great refresher, for anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"In 'Fate of Their Country' Michael Holt makes a very compelling argument that political posturing by Washington politicians, both Northern and Southern, deserves much of the responsibility for the American Civil War. One could easily contend that the Washington politicians were simply representing the opinions of their electorate, but Holt dispels this with convincing examples of both party and regional politics leveraging slavery and its extension for political gain. For example, it was widely accepted by politicians in the North and South that neither Kansas nor Nebraska would become slave states, making it a moot topic for argument. Nonetheless, it became a heated political battle and matter of North vs. South regional pride, and was siezed by individual politicans to advance their careers. In retrospect, the Kansas-Nebraska Act set the stage for war but it is altogether possible had reason and responsible politics prevailed, the Civil War could have been avoided. Holt did a splendid job of explaining events clearly and concisely so as to make them easily understandable. This is a fairly short read but very much worth the effort and should be read by anyone interested in events and personalities that led to the American Civil War."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"My political history professor recommended me this book. It was a fantastic, easy, and fun read that I went through in one afternoon. It is books like this that make me feel like political history is a topic that does not get enough credit. Political History may seem dry but I find it to be the most interesting and relevant aspect of history to the problems that we are having in our country today. If there is anything I have learned the actions of politicians hasn't changed much.Holt is completely right that the actions of politicians DOES MATTER. Anyone who thinks that politics isn't important obviously hasn't turned on the TV.This book is only 150 pages and is a one night read. However, all of the information in this books discusses a very short but important period of time and gives information about events that are not taught in any class."},{"Title":"The Fate of Their Country: Politicians, Slavery Extension, and the Coming of the Civil War","review":"In \\"The Fate of Their Country\\" Professor Holt discussed the politics and events surrounding the Wilmot Proviso and its prohibition against slavery extension, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act with its popular sovereignty doctrine, placing emphasis on how the issue of slavery extension into the western territories became a political football in the hands of politicians, ultimately leading the nation down the road to the Civil War. Politicians would exploit the slavery extension issue, whether it be to advance their own political careers, the interests of their political parties, or their own personal interests, regardless of whether it was good for the nation as a whole. The best interests of the party often took precedence over the bests interests of the nation.Professor Holt showed how politicans would split along sectional lines (North vs. South) as well as partisan lines (Democrats vs. Whigs), over the slavery extension issue; and how the Free-Soilers and Know-Nothings played a significant role, together with Stephen Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, in bringing about the eventual demise of the Whig Party and emergence of the Republican Party as the second major party in American politics.There is a nice Appendix at the end of the book, which includes among other documents, Lincoln's \\"House Divided\\" speech and Seward's \\"Irrepressible Conflict\\" speech, as well as a section entitled \\"Suggestions For Further Reading\\" encouraging the reader to explore further books on this interesting topic.Although the book was only about 159 pages, it was packed with information on the interplay of political parties with the slavery extension issue.

These 13 short stories are as full of description and feeling, and humor as a whole novel (A novel is 50,000 words or more, usually more.).In each one you see a new perspective, and a new since of Mark Twain's imagination.&quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog&quot; is a humorous story about a man who had a frog that could jump higher than any other. Well, he made a bet with a sly man, and he went off to catch a frog for the man, the man filled the &quot;Celebrated Jumping Frog&quot; with quiall shot, and the frog wouldn't move. It is funny, and he uses a very heavy southern accent when he is telling the story, sometimes it is hard to read, but still very funny.&quot;The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg&quot; is the second best of these stories. Hadleyburg is a town that every other town wants to be, it is clean, small, and has never been corrupted. No one ever falls into temptations here. A man that was badly treated here wanted his revenge... The story is very good, and has a great meaning in the end, every mortal falls into temptation, and those who think they dont are liars.This story goes along the same story line as &quot;Was it Heaven? or Hell?&quot; It's about two old aunts whose niece is very sick, the daughter of the niece also becomes ill. The aunts hate lieing, but in the end they lie continually to the mother, and telling her that her daughter is just fine. It leaves an open ending, so you can decide if is &quot;Was Heaven, or Hell.&quot;&quot;A Fable&quot; is about a bunch of animals who stumble across the mirror. The cat says it is a picture of a cat, the elephant said he only saw a big beautiful elephant, and so on, and so on. The moral, by the cat is:&quot;You can find in a text whatever you bring, if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination. You may not see your ears, but they will be there.&quot;Isn't Mark Twain great? I would never think of a story like that, that would get you such a good grade on an English report.The story that totally blew me away was &quot;An Extract From Captain StormFields's Visit to Heaven.&quot; It's about a man who dies, and spends 30 years in space looking for heaaven, he ends up in another part of heaven that isn't for his world, here is an extract from the book:&quot;Well, Sir,&quot; I says, pretty humble, &quot;I dont seem to make out which world it is I'm from. But you may know it from this--it's the world the Saviour saved.&quot; &quot;He bowed his head&quot; (The clerk at that heaven) &quot;at the Name. Then he says, gently--'The wolrds He has saved are like the gates of heaven in number--none can count them.&quot;Mark Twain was very imaginative in his writings, and could make a wonderful story out of any little thing. &quot;A Dog's Tale&quot; is sad, and joyous, and humorous in just 12 pages (Hardback), I dont want to ruin this story for you, so I'll let you read it yourself.These are all very great stories, and I wouldn't have written so much if I thought otherwise.Mark_Sigel"},{"Title":"The Celebrated Jumping Frog and Other Stories","review":"The Jumping Frog is an interesting tale, but this book is more about the difficulties of translations than about the Jumping Frog itself. You can probably find the Jumping Frog in other collection of Twain's books, so don't bother to buy this book if you are only interested in the tale. It is only a three-page tale.To make a long story short, the Jumping Frog was translated into French with the objective of demoralizing Twain's humor. Obviously, the humor in this tale was more in between the lines and in the form it was written than about the story itself (which was silly and not funny.)As Twain says, however, the translator \\"has not translated it at all; he has simply mixed it all up; it is no more like the Jumping Frog when he gets through with it than I am like a meridian of longitude.\\" To prove his point, Twain proceeded to translate the French translation \\"back into a civilized language\\" [i.e. English] to show that the French translation did not do justice to his work.This book has the original tale in the first pages, then the French translation, and then the English version of the French translation.It is more a personal vendetta from Twain than a work of literature.

But whilst philosophical meditation has been the main feature of countless cults, the path of action, in the most varied and practical sense, has ever been distinctly Rosicrucian.The aspects of the subject I have sketched in this work are all related to the tecnique; - its fundamentals, the preparation for it, common delusions about it, its impersonality and magic, the Masters of the technique, vocation in relation to the technique, personal adjustments, the neophyte and his critics, and in conclusion, the vexed question of probation. My hope is that this book will be an inspiration and companion to every student of mysticism. -- Excepts from book's introduction."},{"Title":"CLASSIC THEMES BY THE MASTERS (Arranged for Piano By James Bastien)","review":"Bought this book because the one my daughter had was worn out.

The book describes very clearly what ASP is, how it works, what it does, etc. This book will also make the beginner comfortable with how to write basic VBscript or similar in order to code their Active Server Pages. Wonderful coverage is given to all the basic ASP objects, their properties, and methods and how to invoke the power of each. This book has some funny prose to it and is not overly in-depth, but it will make a newcomer comfortable with integrating their current html skills, client-side scripting skills, and ASP into useful applications."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages Solutions: An Essential Guide for Dynamic, Interactive Web Site Development","review":"Excellent guide for developping dynamic, Interactive Web Site.

This book contains chapters on just about everything you can put on a website. (dynamic) HTML, client (in vb) and serversidescripting (vb &amp; jscript). Building components, java-applets, database-access. You name it, and it's there. The downside is that this quite expensive book it not detailed enough. The only chapters that are reasonably complete are the ones about Jscript and VBscript. The others will not get you much further than some &quot;hello world&quot;-like application. The other thing that I don't like about the book that it is very Internet Explorer oriented. The chapters on HTML are completely unusable for netscape-browsers, and this is the only book I know that boasts Vb as a client-side scripting language. Add the very irritatng introductions of the chapters and there you have it. Not a book for pro's, but I can imagine it being usefull for people who wish to know a little about a lot of things and are prepared to buy seperate books for the items they are actually interested in."},{"Title":"New Trends in American Cuisine","review":"1992 Culinary Team USA scores a gold medal with this book. Professional chefs who compete in International or domestic competitions will appreciate the detail in explaining techniques used by the team for their award winning presentations.

The menu includes an easy main dish and one or two exceptionally easy side dishes. It requires almost no thought.I pick something to make over breakfast, make a small shopping list, then take 20 minutes to make dinner when I get home from work.With twice the effort I could make slightly better food, but this book makes everything super-duper easy.

The meals are tasty, yet simple and (of course) superfast! There's also plenty of opportunity to play around with the ingredients and make the dishes your own.

It was a Christmas gift and ever since we've been having great dinners nearly every night. I don't even want to go out anymore. This book contains easy to make meals in under 30 minutes (with the exception of the chapter on crockpot cooking). What I love about this one is that it plans the entire menu for you, and gives you steps to follow to prepare 2-3 recipes at once. Meals are usually a protein and a side, and sometimes include salads, breads, veggies, etc. And the best part? They're very light.I've made probably 30-40% of the menus in this cookbook now, cooking them nearly every night. The only down side is the more expensive ingredients (sometimes) and quite frankly the time it takes to find and purchase all of the ingredients in the grocery store. I spend a lot more time in the produce aisle these days.Two favorite chapters are the section of meals for two people, and the \\"20 ingredients\\" chapter, where you keep 20 ingredeints on hand to make each of the 20 recipes. Favorite menus include peppered beef tenderloin with orange-herbed asparagus and crusty french rolls, pan-seared chicken in proscuitto-fig sauce with roasted green beans, caesar-style green salad, and whole grain rolls, chicken piccata with garlic-basil pasta and steamed green beans, and seared chicken with avocado and tortilla chips con queso... yum!!!!!"},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"With a newborn and a toddler running around, I'm constantly strapped for time.

(examples: frozen cooked chicken, frozen mashed potatoes, commercial pesto, frozen beef stew, etc.) i originally purchased this & began cooking out of necessity, so it was o.k., but now i don't like it as much for this reason.there is a section of side dishes in the back of the book, but it doesn't contain the great majority which are dispersed along side most of the entrees. while convenient at the time, it makes finding them again a pain.the serving sizes are small!pros:the recipes are good, easy, and guide you through with a chronological supper plan, including serving suggestions.there's even a good french toast recipe, despite the \\"supper\\" title, rationalized by breakfast for supper. =Di am usually cooking for 2, and while this cookbook is not entirely geared for 2, it does have a nice little section for just that, and the other recipes are not overwhelmingly large."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"This book is wonderful. The meals have minimal ingredients and require minimal time to prepare and cook. Many times with meals like this they lack flavor. That is not a problem with these recipes. As a mom, I love the \\"On Hand\\" section. In this section they give you 20 ingredients to keep on hand. With these you can make 20 different meals. I really have enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"The first time through this cookbook, I found myself only making the slow cooker recipes (I like the slow cooker recipes in this book better than the Cooking light slow cooker cookbook). Subsequent times through the book, I found myself trying more and more recipes. Everything I have made has been easy, practical, and great tasting. This is now my most used cookbook.Adding 2 Years later:Still my most used cookbook. Easy, practical recipes that result in great tasting dishes - worthy of company."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"I usually flip through the book as soon as I get home from work.

Can't put my finger on it but usually I buy a new cookbook and mark about 30 different recipes I can't wait to try and there really wasn't anything here that moved me. Also, for the price and a large, color hardbound book you would expect pictures of everything and they are few and far between. I don't think its worth the money."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"I'm a big fan of Cooking Light magazine and their cookbooks. However, I was disappointed when I bought this one. There are some really good recipes in this book but there are more that i'll never make. When I think of superfast suppers I think of good food that my family will enjoy eating. Most of the recipes in this book just don't fit that description. I would recommend any of their annual recipe books and especially The Complete Cooking Light Cookbook, I've made many dishes from that one and my family has loved all of them!"},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"I've had this book for years but decided to write a review tonight after a yummy and simple dinner that I made for my husband and my 16 month old son. I work full time at a demanding job, and I'm the type that would love to make fresh meals every night for my family but I just don't have the energy for it with all of the other demands and priorities. We order in or have refrigerated or frozen meals more than I'd like. After being back at work for 10 months after my son's birth, I just picked up this cookbook again. I used it all of the time when I was home with him the first six months for healthy meals for me and my husband - it definitely helped me lose the baby weight. Being back at work I went back into old habits of not cooking as much; this evening's meal has inspired me to get back into this cookbook and spending just an extra few minutes to make these great and truly easy meals. My son ate more than he usually does tonight and I can't deny that the fresh and simple food may have played a part in that.If you want to eat fresh foods and healthier but feel you just don't have the time - this book is definitely for you. Some recipes can be a bit bland as written but they're very easy to spice up or to customize. The ONLY downside I've found for this book is that since it's a Cooking Light recipe book, the portion sizes/calorie counts I find are too small for my fit 6' 185 lb. husband. I generally have to serve him at least double portions and/or a light dessert for him to be satisfied. That's not really a bad thing but when he's had a long day and he's hungry I know he sometimes sighs at these meals since he knows he may not get full - this is also something to be aware of it you have a family with older kids. Recipes that say they serve 4 for instance may not always go that far depending on the appetites - something you can always adjust for.Truly a Life Saving recipe book that always makes me feel like a good wife and mom when I use it!"},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"I am middle-aged and for the last four years I have been altering my diet, step by step, to reduce my cholesterol and maintain a proper weight. It hasn't been easy. I love to cook and make everything from scratch, which may be impressive on the table, but it's also impressive along the beltline! Becoming more vegetarian wasn't so hard, but the boredom set in and I found my tastes wandering back to those good ol' plates of beef and gravy, chicken pot pie, etc. In looking to renew my zeal for eating right I began a search of cookbooks from my local library (inter-library loan is a real money saver-you learn first which ones to buy!). After using Superfast Suppers for a month, I felt my doldrums in the kitchen were a thing of the past. This cookbook taught me to think differently--outside of the box, so to say. The author suggested buying flash-frozen seafood (always had an aversion) and, against all my senses of what is right, I made the Tuna (Coleson's Ahi) and Jalapeno Cream Sauce with Pepper Slaw side. Wow! Yum, yum! This taught me to think about possibilities. I had closed my mind to \\"what could be\\" in my kitchen and was clinging to what I knew. Likewise, the author calls for pre-made crepes for several meals. I had to make my own as my local grocer had none, but I froze them and made a few of the different suggestions from the book. Again, I was amazed at how this expanded my thinking. Black bean tostadas with sauteed mushrooms and zucchini--who would have thought that eliminating the beef would go unnoticed? Again, yum yum!I have now made approximately three dozen of the recipies and continue to be surprised at how well they work for me. Even the side dishes are pleasant. This cookbook is not about \\"instant\\" preparation, but it is about \\"quick\\" and healthy. No one cookbook offers everything, of course not, but I would suggest that you begin using this book on your day off, until you are familiar with several recipes, because changing one's routine must be accomplished one step at a time and therein lies our challenge! Once you have made a few of these recipies your own, then you will see the incredible value of this book. This has become my second favorite cookbook and yes, not only did I purchase a copy for myself, but have also given it as a gift. (Stir-frying to the Sky's Edge is my favorite.) Happy, healthy, cooking!"},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"Great cookbook for the busy person who wants to cook healthy and fast food."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"I own two copies of this book-one for my home and one for my motorhome and I use them both places. For traveling I decide on menus for my trip, make a shopping list from the one at home and stock the motorhome. If I need new ideas on the road this book is great-easy to find ingredients, and most of the recipes can be done using the 3 burner stove and microwave and they have all been very good. Most cookbooks designed for on the road cooking, that I have found, have been pathetic. The fresh food fast cookbooks have also been very good for both locations.

One thing I like about the book is that most of the recipes give you 4 servings, which is great when you're cooking for two. You have enough for leftovers the next day, but you're not eating leftovers over and over again for a week. There is a whole section of recipes for use with \\"on hand\\" ingredients... it gives you a list of 20 or so ingredients to keep on hand and a variety of recipes you can make with those ingredients. Some of the recipes in the book use convenience foods, like Stouffers frozen pot roast dinner, so you have to be careful of the sodium (there's a warning right on the recipe about the sodium content). I substituted Smart Ones pot roast dinners, which didn't make for a cheap recipe, but it was healthier than the other options and easy to make."},{"Title":"Cooking Light Superfast Suppers: Speedy Solutions for Dinner Dilemmas","review":"This is a wonderful cookbook.

My only question is about the choice of the term \\"Superfast.\\" To me, a wife that works full time, weekday dinners need to be fast. And, there is a plethora of information out there on fast meals, but most aren't too healthy. I need a combination of both. And, I thought this would be it.But, I think the term fast means something different to me. These are quick, easy recipes for 7PM on a Monday when I get home. These require a lot of additional prep that I wasn't looking for.It will be great for weekends when I have more time, but for weekdays, I continue my search.

With just one recipe, I fell in love with this book. I wasn't sure I would ever be able to find it. Alas I did.

The murders and other strange events which have occurred there have frightened people away, so that it stands empty. As Easter nears, a psychic comes to town and is invited to lead a seance at the house. Several close friends gather for the event, and one of them seems literally frightened to death by the things that happen during the seance.Once again the enigmatic Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Surete du Quebec is summoned to investigate the strange death. He is never one to rely solely on physical evidence, so he pursues his investigation by delving into the relationships that the friends had with the deceased woman, and draws his conclusions from psychological indicators as well as the facts of the case. Meanwhile, to add an extra layer to the plot, Gamache himself is being pursued by someone who wishes him harm.This is the third book of the Three Pines Mystery series and is written just as deftly as are the first two. I look forward to the next book in the series, \\"A Rule Against Murder\\"."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"At first I thought star wars was borng but on May 16, 1999 when my brother took me too see epiode 1 I was impressed that lucas still had somethig in him, and it was the filling to the missing gap to trilogies that started it all.Clone Wars was also coolbutnot as cool as episode 3 which I was first in line on May 18 at 11:30 PM. I loved the 3rd part so much that I bought everything that was about episode 3, and that was when I got to Matthew Woodring Stovers version of Star Wars. I read that book over and over and over again until I bought Patricia C. Wrede's book of Star Wars, and eventually got bored and bought the game.I reallylovd that book and the front cover. People make Darth Vader look very strong when they put fire all around himm. But throughout my opinion I think Vader is really weak. I can't belive Ben couldn't defeat him.

That's all I have to say about Matthew's bad a@# book, and to my fellow human beings may the force be with you.[...]"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Stover's novel of episode III is a great afternoon read! The action flows well and it actually unfolds the story better than the movie, as is true with most movies and books. You get get much more detail and insight into the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. This book is a very easy , fast paced read. I highly recommend reading Labriyth of Evil before reading or seeing Revenge of The Sith. I read both before seeing the new movie and it did not hinder by enjoyment of the movie in any may."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am not going to play spoiler so I will only say that this is not only a great book, but it is also very well written and reads just like a suspense/thriller -- could not put it down. I am a big Star Wars fan but I have only read a few of the books that have been published (Zahn trilogy and Labyrinth of Evil). I typically read books that are considered \\"literature\\" instead of \\"fition\\". If it is up for an award or was in the NYT Book Review, it is on my list to read.This book, however, has sparked my interest in future SW books and also rekindled an old interest in other Sci-Fi/Fantasy books. Somehow I will find the time to read the 200+ books lying around my apartment.P.S. - Matthew Stover came and signed books at my store and said that the book contains a fair amount of material that will *NOT* be in the movie and there will be stuff in the movie that is *NOT* in the book.

Fortunately, the same didn't happen with the novel. Stover cut what needed to be cut, rewrote what needed to be rewrote, and overall made a spun of gold out of the straw script."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This ranks among my least favorite novelizations of the Star Wars films, but it was not the worst in the Star Wars series. \\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\\" holds that distinction, in my opinion.Mr. Stover's writing style seemed uninspired and the story plodded along from one event to the next without much excitement. Reading the novel made me want to see the movie again.I grew tired of reading the silly made-up names (duracrete, transparisteel, etc.) that, admittedly, other authors have used also. We get the idea that it's concrete and glass.The worst parts of this book were the headings \\"this is how it feels to be Anakin/Mace/Obi-Wan.\\" I think that Stover could've explained that better without such jarring billboards that reminds us that we are reading a book written by someone trying to convey how the character feels.Also, the chapter breaks that described the light vs. dark was bizarre and not descriptive. It was like listening to a new-age guru babble on about their ideas of religion or philosophy.Two stars for this effort, and it will be the only SW novel that I won't buy. I borrowed the copy that I read from the library, thankfully."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Well I have read this book through but not in order (I read the second half, then I read the first half). If you are looking for a fictional book with concrete lessons to be learned (like crime and punishment, or the godfather) you'll be disappointed.That being said the strength of this book is it's the fact that it is just so enjoyable to read. The author gives you just the right amount of detail and action at just the right time that you never get bored nor do you ever get overwhelmed by the story. That makes it one of those books you could just spend hours reading from cover to cover.The plot itself is fascinating, and this book is great to read before you go to see Star Wars Episode III (for a complete understanding of what is going on in the movie). From what I read this part of the Star Wars story has the potential to make up for the failings of the previous two episodes if the movie is done nearly as well as the book. The story is so very much distinct from what has happened thus far in the series (I would divide the star wars saga into 4 parts (Episode I&2: Anakins troubled childhood, Episode 3: The fall of Anakin and the Republic, Episode 4: The coming of age of luke and leia, Episode 5&6: The growth of the resistance and the final confrontation with the empire).In regards to the plot, the structure is again absolutely fantastic. The beginning has the feel of Star Wars episode I when the two Jedi's are on the droid battleship. However, after that part the story gets rapidly more interesting when you start seeing the tug of war (between Palpatine and Obi-wan) for Anakin.It is extremely interesting to see Anakin's progress towards the dark side (although for him it's almost like it's his form of becoming an adult, he is so immature, impulsive, insecure and thoughtless before he becomes Darth Vadar). As Darth Vadar and during his progression towards becoming Darth Vadar he finally starts thinking for himself, stops whining so much, and takes control and responsibility for the direction of his life (although obviously he doesn't choose to take his life in the right direction). Like Luke in episode VI, his choice between good (Jedi) and evil (Sith) is what propels him into adulthood (needless to say I found that one of the most interesting aspects of the book)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"3.5 starsI pondered for quite some time on whether to review this book or not. After all, Star Wars is a visual medium and the movies are the original voice of the creator. Thus the novelizations cannot help but exist in the shadow of the movie.The strengths of Stover's novelization are the added depth to the thoughts and motives of the prime players with conversations added and inner monologues revealed. He also dispenses with some of the silliness of the battle of Coruscant the movie engaged in.The most welcome extra exposition in particular are the background on Count Dooku, which makes his death much more deliciously ironic, and the extra background on the seeds of the Rebellion being planted which in addition to being of historical interest also serves to allow a wedge to be driven between Anakin and Padme and push him further into Palpatine's clutches.On the down side, the battles after the Count Dooku encounter were strangely sterile and antiseptic. For some reason they came across to me as being completely devoid of excitement on the printed page and that isn't always the case.I believe that this works best as a companion to the film not as a stand alone work. As I said at the start novelizations must exist in the shadow of the movie generally. The added exposition to what is happening in the movie makes the book worthwhile, I don't feel the actual story does."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is IT.. every fan from 28 years ago to the ones that began recently waited patiently for this moment.We find ourselves in a story that could actually be related to anyone who feels frustrated with family, friends, coworkers, partners, etc.... We discovered an Anakin that is dealing with a great deal of issues at the end of the clone wars. A hero to some, A brother to the Jedi, a husband to Padme, a future apprentice to Palpatine... but who he truly is and wants to be comes beautifully almost at the end of the book.The book is a trip to SPOILER who was the true mind behind the rebellion, the beautiful under use in the movie and the book Padme Amidalla.The book also touches in the failure of the Jedi to adapt to the times and how the Sith played them during the whole incident.The decision that takes Anakin to the dark side is basically to save Padme, but reading carefully I strongly believe that is in the beginning but in the end it's his thirst for power and to rule the galaxy, as the best there is.The book in my opinion is a GREAT complement to the movie, and each stand on its own. The book touches the personal thoughts of every character, while the movie goes for the graphics. Watch the movie, and then read the book.

Though Davis' rendering of Padm&eacute; and Yoda's voices is--how can I say this politely?--an homage to the film series' occasionally flat acting, the 14 hours of the unabridged version is spent mostly in wonder and awe.What most impressed me about this product, however, was the way in which Random House Audio stood by their product. Unluckily, I got to the last two tracks of the very last CD only to discover that they were completely unplayable. Ten hours and fifty-five minutes into this last, greatest chapter of the STAR WARS saga, and all I had was dead air.So I called up Random House's technical support line, and, without question or issue, a very congenial operator asked for my shipping address and sent me a brand new copy. No hassle, no wading through the minefield of \\"RMA numbers\\", no \\"we're gonna send it to you once we establish that there really IS a problem with your copy\\".

One, don't expect incredibly intelligent writing. Two, it will invariably (gasp!) spoil the movie. The book does, however, provide us with a more revealing look inside the complex thoughts of Anakin, Darth Sidious, Padme, Obi-Wan, and Yoda...stuff you won't get from the movie.\\"Infinite knowledge...Infinite time, does that require.\\"- Yoda"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The Republic falls and the Empire rises in what is probably the final entry in the Star Wars film cycle, it's all video games, TV shows and Expanded Universe novels and comics from now on. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by the Seperatist leader General Grievous and Republic heroes Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi head to the rescue in what promises to be a show stopper of an opening. But the kidnapping and rescue are just one of the final moves in a intricate game that Darth Sidious (aka Palpatine) has been playing with the Jedi Council from day one. Or should that be Episode One? The noose is around the Jedi Council's collective necks and it begins to tighten as Anakin is tempted to follow a dark path to save the woman he loves. Matthew Stover has done an excellent job breathing life into George Lucas's story and connecting it to other stories in the expanded universe canon. There isn't a Star Wars fan out there that will not want to read this, and for good reason - this is the story fans have been waiting nearly thirty years to see completed, and it is worth every minute of the wait. Recommended."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is the one that they've promised, and it if the movie is half as good as the book even the most cynical fans will be pleased.Matt Stover was the perfect guy to write the novelization of the film. If one reads any of Stover's other novels (Star Wars or other) you know that Stover himself must have spent large quantities of time deep within the \\"dark side\\". This story will add tremendous depth to the original trilogy and most definitely encourage even those that have seen the first three movies many times to watch them with new eyes.Anakin Skywalker's \\"fall\\" is very real and mirrors what all of us experience within our lives at one point or the other. Evil is often times in the eye of the beholder. Stover reinforces the idea that attachment always leads to suffering. This is a belief espoused by most religions and philospies, but is particularly important in the Vedic and Buddhist traditions of India and China.Star Wars is an archetypal story that has become the myth of the 20th and 21st century. Read the book and enjoy it...it will add a whole new depth to the new film as well as adding a new twist to the previous five."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Having looked forward to this novel for many months (if not years), I was pleasantly surpised by the author's writing style. Mr. Stover made the book come alive. I could almost see the action in my mind.I was pleased at how well Mr. Stover was able to get inside the character's thoughts/minds. You truly feel for these characters as their lives fall apart around them.I was also glad that there were moments of deliberate humor. It helped to lighten what is a very harsh & sad tale.Having been a fan of Star Wars for most of my life, I am glad that this novel did not disappoint & left out some things for the movie.After reading this novel, I am confident that this will be the most amazing movie and will nicely wrap-up nearly 30 years of work by George Lucas."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"A little history. I loved the first two Star War movies and was dissappointed in episodes VI, I and II. With Return of the Jedi, my dissappoinment was not so much with the Ewoks, but the lack of any real tension for Luke to join the Dark Side. Also, I haven't read a Star Wars screen play since the original in 1977. It was the positive reviews of this forum that prompted me to buy this book...and I was not dissappointed.As others have mentioned, the political aspects are similar to today's. Given the war climate, is the difference between \\"justice and security\\" (Sith) that much differnet than (Jedi) \\"justice and peace\\"? Sounds like the Patriot Act. The Jedi Council is portrayed as an exclusionary good old boy network. Would a young rebel prefer to join the establishment or an older rebel with seemingly similar beliefs? The Chosen One was predicted to bring balance to the Force and Anakin did,...twice. Once in this book, creating two Sith and two Jedi and near the end of Return of the Jedi when there was one Sith, Vader, and one Jedi, Luke.The Empire Stirkes Back has been my favorite of the five movies becasue of its darker tones and exploration of the Force. Return of the Sith deepens the spiritual exploration with added Christian tones:Palpatine offering Anakin a speeder, a planet and a star system to join him is too similar to Satan tempting Christ (another chosen one) on the mountain.The closing Force \\"discussion\\" regarding Eternal Life closes the deal. \\"The quest for everlasting life is the goal of the Sith but can never be reach by them, because they exalt themselves, rather release their focus of self. The way of the Force is through compassion, not greed. Love is the power against the darkness.\\"After all, it was Luke's love of Leah that drove him to defeat Vader and \\"resist\\" Palpatine. Also, Vader's love of his son and indirectly Padme, drove him to destroy Palpatine.Finally, Anakin/Vader's revelation as to how lonely life is when your whole focus on life is yourself. His choice made a once promising life a, well, living hell.Others have pointed to flaws:(1.) Leah's recollection of her mother, when she died in chid birth. Did she ever know Padme was her mother and not the Alderaan queen? Not a real hole.(2.) Vader's comment of Obi-wan having made mistakes training Luke when Yoda supplied the advanced training. To Vader's knowledge Yoda was dead. Not a hole.(3.) Concern that the book left out Yoda's battle on Chewy's planet. This is a hole, but I hope it is not over played in the movie. How did Yoda survive is important; his meeting Chewy is a nice thing to do, but not essential to the success of the story.Recommendation: Read it before you go to the movie. The gold of the movies has always been a simple plot with great special effects. The book adds the sub-context regarding characters we've come to know during the last 28 years. Knowing the story will enhance, not ruin, the movie experience."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I got this book from my local library, lucky they had it! I couldn't go to bed w/o at least starting it. As soon as I woke up and got acclimated, I picked up where I left off and didn't put it down until I finished. It was an awesome book, but the starship & battle scenes were a little too detailed for me, so I skipped around on those parts. The details on everything else were AWESOME, and there are a few surprises!I had to read this book BEFORE the movie came out and I HIGHLY recommend it. Everytime I came across \\"big scenes\\", I kept imagining what George Lucas has up his sleeve for the movie. I'm even more anxious to see the movie now than before! I'm not even letting my vacation keep me away. It just so happens that opening day, May 19th, I'm going to Florida. I'm not missing ROTS for anything. My goal is see it on the first day out, if it isn't sold out or anything!P.S. To the \\"Warsies\\"(Star War Fans) such as myself, if you've been checking out the starwars.com site and forums(spoilers,etc.), here's a hint. The Force runs strong in that family, because a lot of the predictions/speculations about the story I found, many(but not all) were true. The Force must also be w/me, because a lot of things I thought would happen & the way they would happen, pretty much did!May the Force be with you........jedikelli"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Sure, it's not classic literature. Sure, it's written based on the screenplay. But we know that going in, so that shouldn't count against the book at all.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually *liked* the author's device of pausing the action for a character description. Watching each choice that Anakin makes lead him closer to his destiny just makes the pages just fly by. I couldn't put the book down.I thought the rather lengthy first part of the book (where Anakin and Obi Wan are on their rescue mission) was very well done. It gave the rest of the book some context, and SHOWED us, rather than simply told us, how great of a team the two had become.I also liked how the author kept the focus on Anakin the entire book; I think if he focused too much on the action in other parts of the galaxy, he'd have lost the desparate mood he was going for throughout the entire book. All in all, a quick, fun read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I usually see a Star Wars movie several times in a row when it first comes out to absorb every ounce of detail, and review the movie once or twice a year after that. I have never read a SW book...until now. I bought \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" on a whim, because I couldn't wait for the movie to come. I read it in two days, sacrificing sleep, meals, and hygiene because I couldn't put it down!To be critical, a book cannot describe a light-saber duel as well as a movie can. But conversely, the movie cannot take you inside a character's thoughts and feelings like a book can. I feel like I have a better idea of how the force is used by Jedi and Sith alike. I have a better picture of everyone's motivations and private thoughts. I didn't think it possible, but the story is much more alive to me now.Now, when I finally get to see the movie, I expect to be able to sit back and enjoy the eye candy, since I already know where the story is going and why. And knowing Lucas, I will always find some new details to appreciate every time I see it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Yet again, the SW authors have brought us another story that leaves our hearts skipping beats at every turn. As if the story iteself isn't enough, the presentation by this author is simply phenomenal. The way he speaks in this book had me reading it twice within a period of four days and staying up 'till all hours of the evening just to finish a chapter and then starting another, unable to close the darn thing!It is simply AMAZING. The horror of what it is that Anakin is doing, coupled with his astonshing love for Padme', and when he chooses to do the things he does you feel as though your heart will stop. Obi-Wan's grief almost ripped my heart out, and even though I knew what would happen, the forboding nature of the book made everything fifteen-hundred times worse. The book is astonishing and compelling, a fight between the good and bad, and a show of what it takes to really fight for the good of humanity, not corruption or power. With fantastic saber fights, and the frightening terror of Darth Sidious and the fact that his design had been going on for ages simply destroys any thought of hope for the Jedi (particularly Master Windu). I also particularly love the addition of Qui-Gon, since I loved his character from Episode I, and Obi-Wan, as I've said before, his character simply breaks the heart. The scene in the story of Bail watching the 10 year old youngling chased by clone troopers is horrifying, and it gets worse from there. The book was filled with scenes as these, and it really digs into the characters hearts and lets you know what is truly going on. This book captures the heart of all characters Star Wars, and it encompasses the darkness and the light of humankind. As soon as you can lay your hands on it, buy it...even if you're not a SW fan in the least. The discussion of corruption vs. compassion alone will test your own heart. Enjoy. :O)"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First of all, we've got to put this in context. This novel is not Tale of Two Cities or David Copperfield. It has no significance beyond the fact that it is an exploration and variation on the theme set by a popular sci-fi movie.In other words, it's junk food for the brain. But it's GOOD junk food for the brain.Compared to other novels it's about average. But it's easily the best star wars novelization I've read -- and I've read them all.He gets inside the characters heads. The people are well drawn and their motivations are believable. This is combined with a sometimes snarky sense of humor that makes this often-sombre work bearable. In other words, the story is well-told.Nitpicks: The pacing is uneven. I thoroughly enjoyed the description of the opening space battle -- but when I finished, I noticed that I'd read almost a third of the book! I felt cheated that the other events in the story could not be visited in similar detail. And so they were. For instance, one of the most climactic scenes -- when the Emperor decides to make his bid for power -- a ruthless galaxy-wide plan coming together in one massive orgy of betrayal and destruction -- gets three whole sentences. THREE!Still, I stand by my characterization of this as the best novelization of the series. As long as you take it for what it is, it's enjoyable and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"It's difficult to rate a novelization of a movie, given the fact that it relies so heavily on the screenplay it's based on. Items like the annoying dialog of young Anakin in Episode 1 or the clunky romantic dialog between Anakin and Padme in Episode 2 couldn't be helped. So I'll start out by saying that the storyline itself seems solid. The downfall of the Jedi and Republic, coupled with the rise of the Sith and Empire is definitely a satisfying experience to read. So why the low rating?One of the main themes of the three prequels has been that of subtle schemes, hidden agendas, and plots within plots. So it's annoying that the author describes character motivation and feeling with a sledgehammer. Chapters and sections start out with blunt statements like: \\"This is how Anakin Skywalker feels\\". I know some reviews here have praised such writing, but I find it sloppy and lazy. A good author should interweave character building and plot points together seemlessly. This author does nothing of the sort, basically spelling out \\"here's the part about character development. And now here's the plot.\\" Again, it's sloppy, lazy, simplistic, and is a disservice to the subtle nature of how the Sith come to power.As has also been described by other posters, the author takes a good third of the book to describe the opening space battle, which will probably only take up 10% of the actual movie. One wonders if the author wrote the battle without checking the page count, realized that he had already used up a third of the target number of pages, and instead of editing it down, decided to just shorten up the rest of the book. As such, the book suffers quite a bit of a pacing problem.I fully expect this review to receive very few \\"helpful\\" votes, as it seems the critical reviews are getting voted down by fans. As I've said though, the movie storyline seems to be quite entertaining, and I look forward to seeing it on the big screen. I just find that the book version won't do it the justice it deserves."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Reading this book I was reminded of what a mediocre filmmaker George Lucas actually is. Stover provides a truly heartbreaking glimpse into the mind of Anakin Skywalker that for me was almost entirely missing from the movie. Read from Anakin's point of view (i.e., without knowing that Palpatine is in fact the bad guy), it is easy to understand the difficulties he faced in trying to sort out who was on the side of honor and justice, especially given the high value he placed on friendship and loyalty.The chapter detailing the Jedi Council's decision to have Anakin spy on Palpatine, and Obi-Wan (knowing this is not only wrong but the devastating impact it will have on Anakin) trying to talk them out of it is worth the price of the book. You get a strong sense that the Jedi, in their adherence to dogma and by extension blindness to what makes Anakin tick, had as much to do with the fall of the Republic as the schemes of the Chancellor. This action by the Council (along with Yoda's inability to help Anakin deal with his suffering), much more than Anakin's desire to save Padme', was where the Jedi lost him. It was clear that even if the whole issue of Padme's eminent death was not a factor, Anakin would have eventually left the order anyway because they did not share the same values (i.e., love & friendship vs. selfless duty).The movie leads one to the conclusion that his main motivation and reason for turning against the Jedi was to save his wife, which of course begs the question, why did he stay with Palpatine once Padme' was dead? The movie screenplays for Episodes I through III are often clunky, childish and full of holes. There were so many times reading this where I found myself saying, \\"Why didn't Lucas say something like this in the movie?\\" that I eventually lost count. Highly recommended read not only for all the usual Star Wars action, scenes, etc., but for the complete psychological study of the tragedy of Darth Vader."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"\\"Even stars die\\"Palpatine has been abducted from Coruscant in a daring attack from General Grievous of the Separatists. Anakin and Obi-Wan head off to rescue the Chancellor. Thus begins the end of the Republic...and the rise of the Empire.I Liked:THIS is what the prequels should have been. THIS is what the movie should have been. This is the pinnacle of Star Wars novelizations, the best showcase of characters, of story, of background, of setting, of action, of dialogue, of everything that readers love.When I first heard that Stover was penning this novel, I knew it would be good. I loved Stover's other Star Wars entries. But I still was a little unsure. Could Stover pull it off?Now, I realize what a stupid question that is.Stover has a masterful hand at writing, at writing a tortured character like Anakin, and writing a book as deep, as heavy, as ominous as Revenge of the Sith. For the most part, Stover uses third person limited--except for his brilliant \\"This is...\\" scenes, where he switches to second person present. As most readers and writers know, second person is rare in a novel and rarely well done. Stover sees that and laughs in its face. His \\"This is...\\" scenes are personal, gritty, introspective views on the characters, emotions, and feelings of the moment.His grasp of the characters is excellent. From Anakin and Obi-Wan to Yoda and Bail, his characters are real, they are consistent with their on-screen presence, and they are sympathetic, most notably Anakin. At the core, Revenge of the Sith is Anakin's story, and it is vastly personal. We learn why he wants to be a master (because Jedi Masters have access into Restricted areas of the archives--areas that could contain information on how to save Padme), his friendship with Palpatine, his burden at being the Chosen One (best line ever: \\"Why couldn't people let me be? Why did their problems have to be his problems?\\"), and how confused and conflicted he was at having to betray Palpatine, his dear friend. I got so much more about Anakin from this book than I have from multiple viewings of the movie.Throughout the story, there are beautiful scenes were the characters show they are much more intelligent than their on-screen versions. Mace and Yoda recognize the risk of Sidious and the Dark Side and attempt to lay a trap...a trap that ultimately back fires. Bail and Mon Mothma start the Loyalist committee, something that ended on the cutting room floor, but needed to be in the movie. Even Padme comes out a much better character, being smart and cunning, yet tender and broken-hearted (to the point where I could almost understand her dying of a broken heart).And then, Stover shows he did his homework and acknowledges continuity. Of course, we get Tatooine, Own, and Naboo references, but also expect to see Garm Bel Iblis, Ansion, and Subataars crop out. I love it when an author takes the time to reference other material.I Didn't Like:This is such an amazing book, finding flaws were nearly impossible. But I did feel the first battle with Dooku, Anakin, and Obi-Wan on Grievous' ship did go an awful long time. Also, do not expect a word by word transcript of the movie (I think this is actually an asset).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:H*** crops up.Padme is pregnant.Where this book is notable is its violence. Stover doesn't hold back on battles, starfighting (is there anything he can't write), and lightsaber duels (particularly the last one is gruesome).Overall:This is a stunning work of art. It blows all the other novelizations out of the water. Heck, it shatters most Star Wars Expanded Universe (and I am even including Timothy Zahn's works here!). This is a brilliant, heartfelt novel, a novel about a man's destruction, about the end of everything. There were times my heart ached along with the characters as they endured the pain, and that isn't an easy feat for an author to accomplish, even a good one. Even if you have seen the movie, even if you are not a Star Wars fan, you need to read this book. Five stars.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have to admit a certain bias against the writers of Star Wars novels. The majority that I've read or even glanced at have been either the work of breathless fanboys or the sort of bleary-eyed, penny-a-word hack writers who seem to abound in the paperback industry. However, Matthew Stover's REVENGE OF THE SITH is not only the best novelization of a movie that I've ever read, it's also a tremendous book in its own right - a faithful yet imaginative take on the last (and best) movie of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.Why does it work so well? For starters, Stover seems to have a keen ability to penetrate the souls of the characters of Lucas' space opera, and to pump in breadth and dimension where in some cases it was sorely lacking in the script. He has a hard-core fan's passion for the material, coupled the true writer's ability to bring the reader into the story and keep him there. His takes on the characters, while not always to my liking, were fresh and original. And he works very hard to close up some of the plot holes, inconsistencies and unanswered questions left by the prequels, without necessarily conflicting with the \\"canon\\" fans seem to find so important. But it's really the little things, small prose-touches which elevate the read to such inspiring levels - his habit of presenting a character in a sort of vignette style, his clever word choices (lightsabers are \\"ignited\\" as they should be, not \\"activated\\", as is often dully written), his sense of humor, his keen understanding of how the Force really works, his oddly introspective way of describing lightsaber duels, and finally the atmosphere of dread he creates among the Jedi, who can sense they are on the chopping block but can't fathom where the axe is coming from.SITH is a novelization, but hardly an imitation, of the film. While the plot essentials remain the same, readers will see that Stover's take on Anakin Skywalker is sharply different than it was in the movie: he's far more powerful, far more unstable and fear-haunted, and far more scarred by his experiences in the Clone Wars, than Lucas depicted him in the movie - a sort of Force powder-keg waiting for the match. Count Dooku, far from being just an enigmatic, power-hungry scoundrel, is rendered as an arrogant sociopath with an oddly Hiterian streak of idealism. The fearsome General Grievous becomes an almost pitiable figure, manipulated by Darth Sidious like an armor-plated puppet and then coldly sacrificed to feed his ambitions. Even the \\"prophecy of the chosen one\\" is handled differently, particularly in its implication that Anakin really is the chosen one - he just \\"brings balance to the force\\" in a way the Jedi could not have fathomed in their wildest nightmares.Of course I had some issues with the book. Stover's attempts to sew shut certain plot holes merely create tears in other parts of the story, and he never quite solves the logic-problem of just how Anakin kept his three-year marriage to Padme Amidala a secret from the Jedi, or how someone as wise as Obi-Wan could have mistaken their passionate love affair for some sort of chaste, Victorian-style mutual infatuation. Also, I should greatly have enjoyed some backstory on Palpatine, how he came to be Darth Sidious, and so on - that character remains as mysterious as he is in the movies. Overall, however, none of these quibbles can detract from the fact that REVENGE OF THE SITH is a tremendous accomplishment, a \\"real\\" novel which even those who didn't see or enjoy the movies could greatly enjoy."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have only read a few Star Wars books, but I'm building my collection up pretty fast, and so far, this is the best one I have read. I really love the way the author breaks away to describe a character while a scene is heating up or something big is about to happen. The book was so good, and the story ( the parts that aren't really described in detail or simply not covered in the movie), even tho I knew its outcome and how things were going to happen still drew me in. I loved the Jedi order and I found myself, while reading the book hoping that somehow things would go differently. But of course they didn't. But thats just how much it draws you in. The ONLY downside I found in this book was the death of my favorite Jedi, Mace Windu. The fight scene with Palpatine was awesome and in depth, but at the end of the fight, we all know what happens and the author only chose to describe the death of arguably the most powerful Jedi in the order in only a few words. I think that part could have been written alot better. Other than that, this author is such a good book, that I have already told everyone I know ( Star Wars fan or not ) that they should read it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"A wonderful book! My congratulations to Matthew Stover.. I read this book in 6 days.I highly reccomend this book. It is very,very well written and has lots of emotion. It however is fairly gross. I am not just saying it is gross 'cause I am a girl.It adds in more disgusting stuff then the movie, however I don't think parents should restrict thear children to reading this book. It has no bad language whatsoever. Overall it is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars books ever. Unlike others, it is lengthy and is more intended for young adults than children, which is a nice change. This book has 418 pages and 21 long chapters. I finished this book within 24 hrs., but only because it's long battle scenes, descriptive writing and interesting \\"This is how it feels to be [insert character]\\" extra, kept me wanting more. I was satisfied, but disappointed it was done when I reached the last page. This has to be one of the most emotional Star Wars books to date. It's non-stop action, moderate violence, and emotional mind games are a bit overwhelming, but this is all about the Eps. III experiance. I hope to see the movie in the future."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Stover tackled the tough job of filling in the gaps of, what I felt to be, a dried-out sponge of a movie. When he starts a paragraph, \\"This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker...\\" you almost feel him saying, \\"I know it didn't come across in the hollow dialogue and weak drama of the FILM, but THIS is what Anakin is ACTUALLY feeling...\\"This novelization makes Anakin's fall deeper & more convincing and dramatic, and also elevates the friendship of Obi-Wan and Anakin from its drab surface in the movie. If you felt that the characters in the film of Ep3 lacked emotion, turn to a novel, where this solid author can actually help open up This is a worthwhile read, especially if you watched Ep3 and decided to give up and mentally remove the prequels from your Star Wars canon."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Most Star Wars novelisations are merely expanded screenplays, where the author writes the book of the shooting script without having seen the actual movie. The end result is generally a fairly brief book that is light on detailed descriptions.Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover couldn't be further from that defintion.While written from the shooting script, the book adds at least a viewable 'hour' onto the actual film, describing the extra scenes in wonderful detail.Stover's style is carried on from 'Shatterpoint', and he divides the book into 3 distinct sections, with each section titled with a clear, distinct and logical division between each.I found his descriptions of the characters, particularly Obi-Wan to be spot on. He incorporates small sections where he describes 'This is how is feels to be (character)'. In this sections, he really gets down to the essence of the character, and defines them brilliantly. He nailed every character, Kenobi, Anakin, Padme, Grievous, Windu and countless others. Stover clearly has a soft spot for Mace Windu, and follows on from Mace's previous outing in 'Shatterpoint' to his fateful confrontation with Darth Sidious. This confrontation, and Anakin's subsequent betrayal, were amongst the best written in the book.Stover shows a deep and thorough understanding of Star Wars lore, particularly the precepts of the Jedi Order, and the way in which explores what it means to actually be a Jedi. The way he described Obi-Wan Kenobi, after learning of the massacre of the Jedi Order, is beautifully tragic. And int he final scenes, when Kenobi leaves Anakin to burn on Mustafar, Stover describes it as 'leaving it to the will of the Force', a succint explanation for what becomes one of the major plot points of the sequel saga.As Star Wars fan of some experience, I didn't expect to be surprised by the Episode III novel. I was wrong. Stover explores the story of Episode III in so much more detail than the film, particlarly in regards to the nature of the Force itself, and Yoda's recognition of the cloud of the dark side, failure of the Jedi Order, and why Luke and Leia were not trained as traditional Jedi. These are all 'big picture' issues in the Star Wars saga, and set the scene for the sequel series.I highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I would imagine that turning a book into a movie would be the one of the hardest tasks an author could undertake, simply because of the phrase \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\". A movie happens to be created from hundreds of pictures, thus making the authors job that much harder. Some movie books simply end up transferring the movie into words, leaving the reader with the thought: I could have just watched the movie.The author Matthew Stover not only accomplishes the difficult task, but he goes beyond the normal parameters set for a movie novel. He describes the images in the movies with stunning description and detail, not an easy task due to the fantastic special effects in the movie. He fills in the gaps created by the movie with fascinating sub-plots and enlightening character studies. There is suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat whether or not you're seated, and it leaves you craving more. There is a humor and camaraderie between Obi-wan and Anakin makes you wish that you were close friends with them as well. It also portrays the breaking up of the friendship they had so vividly that you will feel as if you have lost a friend yourself.But at the core of the book is the following of Anakin's path down into the depths of the dark side. Using many awesome metaphors Stover allows you to begin to see into Anakin's heart and mind, and you find the seemingly inexplicable motives for his betrayal. The novel also speaks a very profound message, Beware the dark in all of us and in everything.Stovers wonderful language is present form the very first page:\\" The skies of Coruscant blaze with war.The artificial daylight spread by the capital's orbital mirrors is sliced by the intersecting flames of ion drives and punctuated by starburst explosions; contrails of debris raining into the atmosphere become tangled ribbons of cloud. The nightside sky is an infinite lattice of shining hairlines that interlock planetoids and track erratic spirals of glowing gnats. The beings watching from the rooftops of Coruscant's endless cityscape can find it beautiful.\\"Such great words are throughout the story and give the movie a run for its money. Star wars fans should definitely read this book and all fans of great literature should consider it as well. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I saw the movie before reading the book. The movie was a visual cornucopia of fast paced action sequences, colorful special effects, sprawling sci fi backdrops and a managerie of alien life forms. The novel, like the movie is an adreneline rush from beginning to end. The significant difference is, the author provides ample doses of internal POVs. Major characters are analyzed with a thouroughness that lays bare their hopes, desires, fears and hatreds. Exposition runs rampant in this book and that's a good thing...particularly where Anakin is concerned. His relationship with Palpatine is given the kind of depth and context which the movie, understandably could not display. A relationship, which the author, so eloquently presents on the page. The kindly, avuncular figure Palpatine appears to be in the movie is seamlessly depicted as such in the book. If anything, the written word makes him all the more a chilling, insidious personality. My only complaint about the book concerned Stover's interpretation of the fight between Yoda and the Emperor. I won't go into detail-don't want to add spoilers-but it's obvious in the movie that Yoda had the upper hand through much of the fight. The author,however, presents a different picture of that contest in the book, one that confers upon Yoda a disadvantage I did not detect in the movie. As far as I'm concerned, Yoda remains the undefeated practitioner of light saber combat. That quibble is enough to omit a star from this review. Otherwise, Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars novel I've read since the original trilogy."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First off, I must say that I am an avid reader and am writing a novel of my own, and am also an aspiring filmaker. I actually read four books in the last four days... and yes, my Algebra II teacher grew rather upset with me for reading in his class.I must also say that my favorite authors include JRR Tolkien, GK Chesterton, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I love classics- hard to read, deep, mind-bending novles that are challenging and leave me with a sense of accomplishment.And I must say that this is one of THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. In all honesty and seriousness... it is. It is better than ANY sci-fi/fantasy (except for Tolkien's works, of course),even the masterpiece Dune. It is anything BUT a challenging read. Chesterton empoyed Jedi mind tricks better than most SW authors. And yet I adore this novel.Why?In the simplicity of it: it is a well-written, well-executed analysis of the story that digs into what is REALLY happening here- just from watching the film, one has NO CLUE. This book reveals it all in a way that is tantalizing, intoxicating (to borrow Ani's adjective from the ever-lame film AotC- the book is perty darn good though, btw), fascinating... and most of all, heartbreaking. If you don't at least feel tears start to crawl to your eyes while reading this, you have a heart of stone more black and unfealing than the infamous Darth Sidious himself- and I swear you'll hate Palpatine FOREVER after reading this.In conclusion: I don't care whether you love the classics and hate the prequels, love all the SW films, hate reading, love reading, loathe sci-fi/fantasy, are a Trekkie or HP fanatic, or simply love a good cry- this book is a must-read. It's... breathtaking. Just writing about it makes me want to go read it again!!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This review pertains to the unabridged audio cd version of this book, read by J. Davis.If you, like me, enjoyed the movie this book will give you a much greater appreciation for the story. While the action scenes and fight scenes are much better when viewed on screen the plot and character interaction is much better in this book. Matthew Stover, the author, really provides a lot of background information the movie did not have the time to explain or explore. For example, readers will learn much more about Count DooKu's past, his motivation to become a Sith lord, and his fighting technique, style and powers. The movie just didn't have the time to provide viewers with all this info. Fans of Star Wars and or Count DooKu will really appreciate this glimpse into his character. Another example of character development would be Obi-Wan's and Anakin's relationship. While the movie did an adequate job of conveying both their friendship and their mistrust of each other, this book really develops these aspects of their relationship. This increased understanding of their relationship adds even more emotion to their final confrontation at the end of this story, as well as more emotion to their conflict in \\"A New Hope\\" (The original Star Wars movie).Another treat was learning more about the mistrust the Jedi Council had for Palpatine and even more about how they were unable to understand what was happening around them. Palpatine and Anakin had more detailed conversations and these detailed conversations made it easier to understand whom he chose to support and whom he chose to betray. Next to the extra detail about Count Doo-Ku I would have to say the additional information about Mace Windu was not only a treat but much needed information. In the movies not enough time was given to his character. We were told he was powerful but we never got to see him behave in a way that indicated just how much more powerful he was when compared to other Jedi's. Well Stover really adds some important background information about Windu and much more information about his Vaapad form of Jedi fighting. Also, the movie does not make it clear as to who won the initial fight between Windu and Palpatine. Many fans wonder if Palpatine was staging the end results or if the fight was real. Stover's additional information really answers that question. Stover also clears up another sticky point, at what point Anakin arrived at the fight between Palpatine and the four Jedi, including Windu.I could go on listing all the additional information that Stover brings to the table in this book but I think those reading this review will get the point. Personally I would suggest watching the movie first and then listening to this book or reading it. The movie is, obviously, much better at providing visuals and sounds. The fight and action scenes are better when viewed than when read. This is why I suggest watching the movie first, the reader/listener will have the basic imagery and sounds in place when he/she reads/listens to this book.Lastly, a special thanks to J. Davis, he provided the reading for the unabridged cd edition of this book. Considering all the characters he has to provide distinct sounds and characterizations for he does more than an adequate job. This cd edition also includes the expected sound effects. If your auto is equipped with a cd player I would really suggest purchasing or borrowing this version of the book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book explains the characters and lets the reader know what they are thinking and feeling. You get a better idea of why things in the movie happened the way they did. For example: Why Anakin seems jealous over Obi-Wan speding time with padme; Why Obi-Wan leaves Anakin in the lava pit; Why Anakin turns to the darkside. There were also parts in the book that should have been in the movie like the creation of the Rebel Alliance.In my opinion the best part of the book is right after Anakin is put in the Darth Vader armor. The book discusses the pain he feels as he breathes and the loss he feels. He has a feeling of regret almost.By the time I got to the end I didn't want it to be over. That's how much I connected with the characters. I can't wait for the sequel book to this.I recommend seeing the movie first, then read the book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I haven't read any of Matthew Stover's writing before, but do note that he is apparently a popular author of Star Wars fiction. Much to his credit, he offers a fine novelization which adds great depth to the action depicted in the original screen version. Most of the scenes in the film are fleshed out substantially here in the novel. Indeed, in the novel I have a much better sense of the political intrigue between the Jedi Council and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's office. Stover does a fine job too in describing Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace, providing a more plausible course of events and reasons behind his acceptance of the Force's Dark Side and becoming Darth Sidious's latest apprentice as the young Darth Vader. He also excels in providing Padme Amidala with a superb subplot which ties nicely into the main plots describing the exploits of both Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and explains how the Republic became the Galactic Empire by the Senate's majority vote. Stover's novel is fine summer reading for both Star Wars fans and those interested in understanding more of the story depicted in \\"Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith\\"."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Jonathan Davis' reading of \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" by Matthew Stover sizzles in your ears, a step by step story of corruption of one individual with galaxy wide consequences in the Star Wars universe. Davis' reading of \\"Attack of the Clones\\" was excellent and filled in some understanding of the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala left unclear by the movie. In \\"Revenge\\" Davis reads every character with a mastery that is a triumph. Stover's words boil off the page but Davis conveys the suspense of heavy metal droid fighting, personal combat between Jedis and half human enemies, as well as intimate dialogue with superior skill. Eleven CDs gives the seduction of Anakin by the scheming Palpatine time to unfold, provides space for Obi-Wan to kill an enemy,ride a dragon and ultimately realize how he has enabled the dissolution of his own friend. Subtle use of sound effects and music make this more than a reading where Stover's words and Davis' voice combine to delight."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"There's just one word to describe this book- WOW!It just sucks you in like a Twister and when you finally are allowed to escape at the end, you don't care that you ain't in Kansas anymore, as your whole peception of the Star Wars universe has changed; you begin to comprehend all the things both big and small that made Anakin turn \\"Red\\"- you become \\"one with the force\\", so to speak.This is hands down the best Star Wars book that I have ever read, and it makes the movie pale in comparison.I had the unique (I think so, at least) opportunity of seeing the movie after I was halfway through the book, and so I felt the first half of the movie was pathetic, and not just because of the wooden acting and forced humor; they cut down the glorious fight between Obiwan,Anakin and Dooku, and so many more scenes (the fight between Grievous and Obiwan, to cite another instance), which serve to make this final instalment in the Star wars saga so much more richer.The author switches from the traditional 3rd person narration to the second person POV, which really puts you under the skin of each character(Obiwan, Mace Windu, Padme, and of course, Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader).The way in which all anakin's grievances, both real and imagined build up slowly to make him turn evil is explained so well, that you really sympathize with him, but the movie made such a mess of this part that you feel like turning a red saber on George lucas!A must have for any true worshipper of the Force."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"For the author to go inside some of the principal characters' heads was a big plus. This answers some of the questions fans may have after they've watched the movie.However, the last quarter of the novel looked a bit rushed, as if the author had forgotten how many pages he was limited to after writing only half the story. In the movie, Mace Windu's showdown with Palpatine occurred at around the middle, while in the novel it didn't come until the last quarter. That left a lot of story to be told in the not quite 100 pages remaining in the book. A 500-page novel would have done the story more justice.Still, this was a hard book to put down once you've picked it up. Some Star Wars fans could probably read it in one day."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"With spending more and more time in traffic, listening to audiobooks really helps pass the time.

Excellent. five stars!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Labyrinth of Evilhas one purpose and one purpose only: to provide the backstory toStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. As we all know, there were quite a few plot holes in the film, as Lucas just couldn't fit everything he needed to in the span of 2.5 hours. For example, who exactly was General Grievous? What was the point of the Separatists' striking at Coruscant to capture Palpatine? This book helps resolve some of those issues, and I think does so pretty well. Luceno writes Palpatine brilliantly, combining subtle political nuance with an underlying threat. He's somewhat less convincing with Yoda (I found some of Yoda's dialogue a bit too jumbled), but I could easily imagine the rest of the characters having come straight out of Lucas' notebook.Now, this book isn't really meant to be read on its own and only serves as a backdrop toStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Don't expect to be blown away by the plot or action scenes -Labyrinth of Evilconsists mostly of a (fruitless) search for Darth Sidious. In fact, it ends at the very moment the movie begins, with Palpatine's kidnapping.Of all the prequels, I think there's unanimous agreement thatStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis the best of the bunch. Yet, even this finale faltered at times with choppy dialogue and unclear plot twists. Now, imagine you could reedit the movie and make perfect. That's what Matt Stover'sStar Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis like. This novelization takes the movie as a base and makes it even more of an epic.First, Stover's writing style mixes \\"stream of consciousness\\" sections, with glimpses into the minds of characters. While potentially risky, Stover pulls this off well, showing the inner emotional turmoil at which the film can only hint. Anakin's motives for joining the Dark Side become a lot clearer as we Stover explores the depths of his confusion. And he manages to really capture certain character dynamics well with just a few choice phrases, such as calling Obi-Wan and Anakin a team.Beyond that, Stover also expands the plot beyond what was covered in the 2.5 hours of the movie. Palpatine's discussions with Anakin are longer and more intense. I particularly thought Palpatine's depiction of the Jedi-Sith conflict as a dispute over \\"philosophical differences\\" was quite clever. In the book, he's so effective at blurring the line between good and evil that I almost felt like I was falling for the Dark Side! Meanwhile, we actually get to sit in on the deliberations of the Jedi Council and hear some of the shockingly candid disagreements amongst Yoda, Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan.Just as important sometimes is what Stover left out of the book. For example, Palpatine does not scream \\"Power, ultimate power\\" when he's zapping Mace Windu with lightning. Nor does Vader scream \\"Nooooo!\\" upon hearing about Padme's death. In fact, overall, the book and the characters' dialogue have a more dignified \\"age of heroes\\" feel. If only Stover had had a bit more influence over the final script.Of course, the novel isn't a substitute for the movie, particularly for the action scenes. They're short and often not particularly exciting. I thought the first few pages of the space battle were the only slow part of the book, although they're a visual feast in the movie. It seems - wisely in my opinion - that Stover essentially left the epic action to the movie and focused on plot and dialogue.ROTS] is probably one of the most compelling Star Wars stories ever told. If for whatever reason - the acting, CG special effects, Jar Jar Binks - you were not enthralled with the story as told in the movie, you owe it to yourself to enjoy it as told through Stover's adaptation.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis a tough act to follow, especially Matt Stover's excellent adaptation ofStar Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. James Luceno'sDark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vaderdelivers a mixed bag. It is interesting to observe Jedi adjusting to the aftermath of Order 66. I like how Master Roan Shryne is torn between the Jedi and trying to return to a civilian life. It's an interesting struggle, one not fully explo. There's a mix of reactions as the survivors find that they're alone in the universe, with surprising leadership from a young padawan.The sections dealing with Vader seem demeaning at first, almost as if he were an awkward teenager in his new suit.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vaderbriefly shows us a Vader consumed by pity and lacking confidence. However, the story explores how he transformed from the devastated man after Mustafar to the fearsome dark lord. It's a fairly compressed but plausible character development (I suspect in real life Vader's transformation would have played out over years, not weeks). I particularly appreciated how the Imperial officers at this time aren't quite sure whether Vader is superior to the military officers or not (one officer calls him \\"Admiral Vader\\" by accident).There were a few points I think were off. Luceno implies that the Emperor manipulated Vader so much that he even brought Padme and Anakin together, which seems like a stretch. If that is indeed what happened, it would completely eliminate any choice Anakin Skywalker had in turning to the dark side. There are also a few too many \\"close calls,\\" such as Vader seeing Leia through a holoscreen but being too distracted to enquire further. It's hard to believe such a near miss occurred only a few weeks after Vader's conversion to the Dark Side. Overall, Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader is still a pretty good installment in the Darth Vader story, but feels like more of a denouement than a climax."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"In 2002, Matt Stover established himself in the Expanded Universe with the New Jedi Order's \\"Traitor\\", which challenged Jacen Solo and the reader's preconceptions on the Force and the nature of good and evil in that galaxy far, far away. His 2003 Clone Wars novel \\"Shatterpoint\\" was one of the darkest Star Wars tales ever published. When it was announced that he had been tapped to pen the Episode III novelization, fans were curious to see how it would turn out.The story is the same as the film. There are discrepancies and different sequences due to revisions and cutting, as to be expected. Rather, Stover's style gives added characterization and focus towards Anakin, Dooku, Mace, and the other players. It makes them more realized and adds depth to their actions at this critical juncture in the Star Wars saga.The novelization is also unique in that it isn't a stand-alone work or a mere novelization of George Lucas' screenplay. Stover heavily references the Expanded Universe, with links not only to the Clone Wars multimedia campaign, but to \\"Shatterpoint\\" and to James Luceno's Episode III prologue, \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\". The novelization itself is the middle chapter of the unofficial \\"Dark Lord Trilogy\\" which began with \\"Labyrinth\\" and concludes with Luceno's \\"Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\\". Jonathan Davis' performance on the audiobook is equally crisp and good."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is an amazing book. I bought it 'cause I'm a huge star wars fan. I read it and it really explains the story like if you were in Coruscant, Mustafar and Utapau. It also has deleted scenes from the movie and all-new-scenes. There's only one flaw: there's missing some scenes from the battle of Coruscant and Kashyyk was kind of missing. But even though, it's really satisfactory and pretty complete."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover's novelization of the third Star Wars movie, \\"Revenge of the Sith\\", is, quite simply, the best Star Wars novel in the entire series. More than any other Star Wars novel, it captures the characters, the story, the setting, the FEEL of Star Wars, in its often poetic but never obscure and dragging words.The plot should be familiar to anyone who has seen \\"Revenge of the Sith\\", the movie. Anakin and Obi-wan defeat Dooku, and return to Coruscant. However, all is not well in the Republic and Jedi Order, and as Obi-Wan leaves to hunt down the last remnant of the Separatist leadership, Anakin finds himself descending into darkness, as Palpatine reveals that he is more than he seems.In between descriptions of the story (of which the characterization is excellent), Stover inserts little poetic viniettes, some of which almost moved me to tears.The whole result of this work is a grand epic, one which comes closer to Lucas's vision than any other novel, and which is arguably as good as the movie itself in many ways (the characterization, for example, is in far better depth than in the movie). This man understands Star Wars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I devoured this book while on vacation. Not only is Stover's style appealing and fast paced, but he is utterly true to the movie's characters, both old and new. He beautifully illustrates the fact that Anakin's descent to the dark side is far more complicated than simply a bad guy doing bad things for bad reasons...the layers to his persona are drawn out beautifully by the author, and follow with perfect syncronicity the plot/mood/characterization of the movie (Hayden Christensen's portrayal of this multi-layered character, by the way, was simply incredible). Loved the movie, loved the book, and unhesitatingly recommend it (and beyond Star Wars realm, I'm not much of a sci-fi reader...). ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This novel is a must read for anyone who is a fan of Star Wars. In my opinion, this is one of the best Star Wars books you can find.The story is much more intriquite that that of the movie. The inner workings and motives of Anakin Skywalker's mind are laid out with crystal clarity and Matthew Stover does a superb job of filling in the gaps that the movie version leaves in its wake.The book differs from the movie in that it's main focus is on the turmoil raging inside Anakin and how he is ultimately seduced to the dark side. I feel there is no need to explain how this happens, but I will say that it's presentation in the novel is much more satisfying than that of the movie's.The highlight of Anakin's relationships with Palpatine and Obi-Wan are also central to the story and Stover contrasts them beautifully in his writing.Unlike the novels of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, which are basically glorified versions of the movie scripts, with almost every line of dialogue coming directly from the films, Reveng of the Sith tells the story of the main events in the film, but in Stover's own way that is both faithful and familiar to the movie, and different enough to be refreshing and unexpectedly exciting.Several story archs from the movie are absent from the novel, however. Such as the battle of the Wookiees for Kashyyk and the death of many Jedi through the execution of Order 66. But, with the focus being so skillfully directed towards the spiral of Anakin towards the dark side, those scenes are hardly missed.Overall, this is a fantastic book and should not be missed by anybody who is a fan of either the Star Wars movies or the expanded universe of novels."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"A Glimpse Into The Shadows of His Soul. Matthew Stover does just that! Once again, another excellent addition in the movie based books in the Star Wars saga. This book, like the others, is chock full of insight that you may have missed while watching the movie and will focus in on every detail of the story and climatic battles. My favorite parts of the book is when Stover careful crafts in the lore and back history of the Sith and when he sneaks in some added and most helpful information that the movie left out, for example...ah read it!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is the best star wars books of the movies i've read so far. It is totaly awesome the best yet. Mathew Stover does a great job."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am a Star Wars geek! I have read many SW books, but this by far was the sadest. It was gut-wrenching to see how Anakin finally was seduced by the tantalizing lure of power and the ability to save his pregnant wife, Padme Amidala. You began to see the slow breakup of Anakin and Obi-Wan's relationship and the insidious presence of the dark side. In the book, according to Anakin, a 'dragon' seemed to be inside him, eating away at his self. The 'Hero With No Fear' he is called. The readers sees how while this may be others view of Skywalker, and even though he may want to believe it himself, fear is what turned Anakin to the dark side. He fears that his wife may die in childbirth and that makes Anakin lust for larger powers. Another factor that made Skywalker betray the Jedi is the death of his mother. Later, after slaughtering a village of Sand People he recalls to Padme, \\"Why'd she have to die?... Why couldn't I save her?\\"As a very wise old man once said, \\"Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering...\\""},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I enjoyed the revenge of the sith novelization immensly. It went into the further details of the story, that may not have translated well to the screen. Stover proves himself a capable author and worthy of the fact that lucas picked him for the novilization. The only part that annoyed me after a while was the This is how it feels to be (Insert character here).. While a great way to get inside the charater's heads I felt that there might have been a better narative way of doing it without the repetative statement, as it grated after a while. But that is a relativly minor point in an otherwise excellent novel."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Although I haven't read all the Star Wars novels, I have read my fair share and this one was so unique in a very good way! I loved the way this author wrote and got into the soul of the characters. Also, reading the novel gives you more detail than a 2.5 hour movie can and there is lots of insight into the thoughts of characters that the movie might not be able to get across, because it is hard to act out thoughts! :) Anyway, I was not at all disappointed with this novel and I savored every minute of reading this...I was actually sad when I finished because it was just that good!! So, if you love Star Wars novels, look no further and add this exceptional story to your collection!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Stover's excellent adaptation of George Lucas' screenplay is one of the best I've ever read, as far as adaptations go. After reading it, I definitely have a greater appreciation for the movie. I wish I had read the novel before seeing the movie. If I had, I think I would have liked the movie much better.Unlike the movie, the novel goes deeper into the mind of Anakin Skywalker and leaves the reader with a greater understanding of his turn to the dark side of the force. Gone are the cheesiest lines of dialogue that plagued the movie and, in return, we are left with a thrilling adventure worthy of being called 'Star Wars.' The character and plot development that Stover conveys explain so much more than the movie does. Here, we find not only the struggles within Anakin Skywalker's mind, but also with the other Jedi such as Kenobi and Mace Windu. In this perilous time for the Republic, the Jedi try to solve the mystery of the Sith Lord that seems to have taken control of the senate while, at the same time, must struggle with the darkness that dwells within each of them. It's not only a war to save the Republic, but also a war within themselves that is the most intriguing aspect of the story. In his movie, Lucas was unable to convey this same depth to the characters that would have made it a masterpiece instead of a \\"so-so\\" escape into the world of Star Wars. Undoubtedly the most important chapter in the series, Lucas should have spent more time with his script or allowed a true writer, such as Stover, to pen it for him.The only disappointing aspect to the novel is that Lucas' own inept political opinions are still present and leave the reader with a bad \\"after-taste\\" each time they present themselves. Other than that, this is a great novelization that sheds a lot more light onto the events of Revenge of the Sith."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I consider myself to be a bit of a Star Wars fan, not as much as I might have been before, due largely to the fact that the first two prequels where a dissapointment for me. However Revenge of the Sith was a great read, I couldn't put it down for a couple of weeks. The novel allows you to see why Anakin made his decision to join the Sith, and you can get a greater insight into what was transpiring inside the characters thinking. Although the part of Yoda being on the Wookie planet was somewhat absent from the story, the main focus was about Anakin Skywalker and the begining of his journey down the Dark side of the Force. Stover does a great job taking a good movie and making it into a great novel."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"When i picked up this novel from a friend, i was expecting a crummy movie adaption with no depth whatsoever. boy was i wrong. this is by far one of the best books ive ever read! it goes beyond the movie and expands on things the movie only hints at! i definately reccomend this book, it is more enjoyable than the movie and mathew stover is an amazing author."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"My daughter and I are both great Star Wars Fans.

I would recommend this book to any Star Wars lover."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"That is what this book does to the saga: it changes Star Wars from a space drama started before my time to a story that feels like it's happening right here, right now. I wasn't going to read it, because i'd seen the movie (3 times to be exact) and i thought it would be a complete waste of money. Then one day i was in a GROCERY STORE, saw it and opened the front flap. i was hooked from the intro. scratch that, it left me amazed, and i immediatly bought it and read it in about 2 days. the beginning was my favorite by far. althougth it takes the whole first half of the book to get to the point when Anakin lands the ship. the middle was well written. so well that i didn't like that part because it's anakin's decent and his life gets more complicated adn stressed with each paragraph-leaving the reader stressed for him, and wanting it all to end along with him. the end is of course awesome since it is the climax of possibly the most infamous saga ever, and the rise of the most reveared villian. However, after reading the book when i see that black helmet, i do not feel fear but sympathy knowing it is not Darth Vader, but Anakin Skywalker forever trapped inside. That is what this book does."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It gave me some insights that I would never have experienced if watching the movie. It is very well-written, and the author has an incredible talent of using descriptive verbs as adjectives. In particular, I enjoyed the parts where he described the certain characters, like so--This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker, forever...However, it was rather disappointing to read some hilarious parts in the book that were not in the movie (when Obi-Wan poses as the slobbering hunchback and Yoda as the baby) Still, it is a wonderful book, and makes the perfect companion to the movie. I recommend it for everyone!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"just because it wasn't \\"SO well written\\" (wich i think it was very well written) why would that even change the story. that is the best book i think i have ever read. it adds in alot of detail thats not about the movie. i would recomened everyone to read this book. don't listen to the 1 and 2 star idiotic ratings because it isn't true. i could never put this book down. i read it in two days."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Stover was the right man for this job. His prose is ernest and concise. He brought me into this story world from a perspective not able to be brought to the fore in the film.His passages are textured with physical detail and emotional clarity. This guy knows what makes a warrior tick -- tick -- tick -- BOOM! The last few chapters had me working between a desire to tear thru the pages of the engaging story while trying to savor every detail.I will return to REVENGE OF THE SITH for years to come and will be sure to look for more of Mr. Stover's offerings."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Anakin and Kenobi. The Heroes of legend. The heroes of the Clone Wars. The Hero with No Fear. How can it go all wrong? Where and when did it all go wrong?

Or was he doomed to become Darth Vader all along?The third and final chapter of the Star Wars saga has no happy ending. How can the ending be happy when the birth of the most defining villian of the Star Wars saga can't be stopped? This doesn't mean the book is bad. Far from it. It's a good book. I read it before I saw the movie. This book is execellent and the writing style is superb."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This was a great read.

Read this book if at all possible."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This adaptation actually has a good narrative flow unlike the book version of Attack of the Clones. I liked this book a lot because they actually explained what was left out in the movie. The book is a knockdown drag out firefight.

The story is extremely compelling, and I couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Finally a book that lives up to all the hype! With the other two books I know what I wanted to get out of them but they just came up short. ROTS on the other hand completely satisfies in everyway.This book really seems to dive into the close relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Which is great because you get to see how truly close they are and just how deep the betrayel is. I would say they are the main characters of the book. Padme Amidala is also in it of course but her role is bit smaller than in the other stories. An Chancellor Palpatine is in the spot light quite often. Then finally Mace and yoda, they both have thier fare share of spot light. Mace actually has what I consider the best lightsaber fight of the book, thought Anakins and Obi-Wans is quite amazing.This story is also high speed action from begining to end. It rarely slows down and when it does, it's not for very long! The first 130 pages is one big airial and lightsaber fight!Well if you love Star Wars, and you don't mind them being dark, this is the best there is. and believe me all of your questions will be answered in this one!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am a classic Star Wars fan. I don't have any interest in the new books or spinoff stories (although I just bought the Clone Wars DVD and Heir to the Empire), I just love the movies and have seen them all so many times I can recite them word for word. I chewed this book up in 2 days and loved every minute of it. When I was a kid, even before \\"Empire\\" came out I heard stories about the battle that left Darth Vader as more machine than man; how Obi Wan Kenobi duelled with the Dark Jedi over a lava pit and left him there to die in the most horrible of states. To watch that episode unfold in my mind courtesy of these pages so many years later is a thrill that I can barely describe.The writing is good and stylistically flowing, and I was struck by the feeling that I was reading a Stephen King novel. I think that the issue of \\"This is how Anakin feels right now...\\" is a valid one, but I think that in the context of the writing style and the story it works pretty well. Ultimately one has to remember that we're not reading high literature here; we're just fleshing out the bones of what I think will be an amazing movie. I daresay after reading the novel that this could be the best movie of the series. The characters are at the forefront and what's more, at least in the style of this novel, I feel that The Force becomes a true character. I'd like to see how that plays out in the film.Anybody who is a Star Wars fan will get this book and read it. Anybody who is a fan like me and sticks to the movies for their Star Wars fix ought to spend a little cake, break from tradition, and read this book. It won't spoil anything; it will just further whet your appetite for what will surely be a great moment in film... The moment some of us have been waiting for all our lives."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"As a huge Star Wars fan growing up, I greatly anticipated the release of the prequels. The movies were disappointing, with the books being better because they at least expanded on the emotions and motivations of the characters. The main question I kept asking was how Mr. Lucas was going to pull this off. How is he going to turn little Annie into Darth Vader, kill off all the Jedi and set up the the original Star Wars movie. This book delivers on all this! I actually had goosebumps reading the last page and immediately began to read my copy of the orignal Star Wars. The book amazingly makes all the other 5 movies/books better! I hope the movie is as good, but the book is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The Clone Wars still rage, with Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi dashing from crisis to crisis. Although Anakin is no longer Obi-Wan's padawan apprentice, he's not yet a Jedi master in his own right; and that rankles, because in spite of his youth Skywalker knows himself to be the galaxy's most powerful Jedi. Nevertheless they are still a team, and a famous one at that. Kenobi carefully looks the other way where the beautiful senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala, is concerned. Officially he doesn't know that Anakin and Padme are husband and wife - and neither (officially, at least) does anyone else. Yet that's the case, and now it won't remain secret for long. Padme is pregnant, and Anakin - haunted always by fears that his Jedi training hasn't brought under control - dreams of her death in childbirth. Preventing that dream from coming true, as his nightmares so often have in the past, becomes his obsession. He will do anything to keep her safe. Anything at all.How could the poignant and gifted little slave boy Anakin was at nine years old grow up to become Darth Vader? How could nineteen-year-old Anakin, Obi-Wan Kenobi's exasperating yet beloved and brilliant apprentice, pass through that horrible transformation just a few short years later? REVENGE OF THE SITH delivers a credible answer, presenting the first Jedi knight named Skywalker as the flawed hero of a classic tragedy. It's also an exciting adventure story, of course, and an interesting character study to boot. I do have a few criticisms that keep me from giving this one five stars, though. The \\"this is how it feels to be (insert name of character)\\" scenes sandwiched into various chapters have an awkward, flow-interrupting quality, making me wish the author had chosen a different technique to accomplish his goal of making the reader experience being inside the character's mind and skin. Italics are over-used, reminding me of how some Victorian letter writers underscored every other word for emphasis. There's also (which is not author Stover's fault, of course, but it affects his book nevertheless) a glaring continuity problem that I won't mention because it would be a major spoiler.Overall, a satisfying read; and a very good job of tying up the loose ends of the first trilogy while setting the stage for the second one's opening."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"But I'll find them anyway.I've just finished reading Ep III- Revenge of the Sith, and I have to say that Matthew Stover has forever changed Star Wars for me. Whether the movie lives up to the book or slaughters it is completely unimportant.He has an insane talent for portraying characters, for making one love them more than one did before-- or, at least, this is the effect his writing has had on this reader-- I'll never look at Vader the same way: I'll see what happened to him in this tragic chapter of his life. Obi-Wan is now shadowed as well by sadness. Before, you learned the story; you knew the gory details, but with each new page of Revenge of the Sith you really Know. Matthew Stover has written a masterpiece custom-made to break any Star Wars fan's heart.I can't bring myself to agree with those who have said that the proverbial breaking point for Anakin is anything less than devastating, but I suppose thats for each of us to decide ourselves.Highest praise to Matthew Stover for writing one of the most moving novels I've read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The story and the characters in Revenge of the Sith are more interesting than in any other Star Wars book I have read.

If the movie can come close to the book in capturing Palpatine's subtlety, the love many of the characters have for each other, the impossible choices Anakin is faced with, and the heart wrenching fall of Anakin, it will be the best of all the Star Wars movies."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is filled with suspense that kept me reading. The movie has to be like this. George wouldn't let his fans down. The book is a battle between love and hate. I will love the movie as much as this book.

That is somewhat misleading because it is actually Episode III of a six Episode adventure. The movie bridges the gap between what happened in Episodes One and Two and the events of the original trilogy. Matthew Stover was assigned the task of writing the novelization of the movie, and he proved to be up to the task.For the most part, the novel follows the events of the movie, with some key differences. Yoda's trip to Kashyyyk, the wookiee homeworld, is largely absent from the film. None of the scenes from the planet appear in the novel. Instead, Stover chose to spend more time closely following Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi.In addition, Stover further develops many of the things that were mentioned in the movie, but not fully explored. More attention is given to the tension between the Jedi and Chancellor Palpatine. Stover also dives into the details of how Palpatine seduced Anakin with promises of power and how he planted the seeds of betrayal in his future apprentice. The birth of the Rebellion also is given considerable page space.Stover's style is unique amongst Star Wars authors. He frequently begins chapters with a brief synopsis of exactly what the character that is the focus of the chapter is going through. Usually, this treatment is reserved for Anakin and Obi-wan. It was always great back drop that gives added meaning for the scene to come.The one thing I would like to have seen more of is action. After the opening rescue scene, the novel settles into a lot of intrigue for the greater part of the novel. While it ultimately makes Anakin's fall and the tension between the Jedi and the Chancellor make more sense, at times I felt myself screaming for more action.Star Wars fans should be pleased. Stover has created a great supplement to the movie that fills many of the spaces of what was a great conclusion to the saga. This is not the place to start for those not familiar to Star Wars though. New fans to Star Wars should start where it all began, and go to Episode 4: A New Hope.Overall: 4.75 stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover's novelization of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith surpasses a very good movie. This has been the case with many of the novelizations of the Star Wars films, but has especially been the case with the prequels. That is the case largely because the books have been able to go much further into details that the movie cannot go into due to time constraints. Palpatine's account of the story of Sith Lord Darth Plagueis the Wise goes further in-depth than his conversation with Anakin in the movie. Stover also goes further into depth in examing the relationship between Anakin and the Supreme Chancellor, who have been close friends since Skywalker was a child. My only complaint is that the battle of Kashyyk was basically ignored, leaving out Wookie characters Tarful and Chewbacca. Stover's novel gives us a much greater understanding of the story and the characters. Now hopefully Stover or one of the other Star Wars novelists will write a novel chronicling Palpatine's Sith apprenticeship under Lord Plagueis and his rise in the Old Republic's political ranks while also rising to Sith Master."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First off, for those who pay attention to the star rating: my rating of 4 stars is a relative one, in comparison with othre tie-in novels and movie novelizations,not an absolute number compared to books of all types. (If that were the case, it would deserve more like 2.5 stars.)It's been a while since I've actually read a movie novelization, but I like Revenge of the Sith a lot (it's the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back), so I decided to read the novel, to see if it provided a bit more background detail on some of the things I was interested in. It did so, and by and large it did it pretty well. Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin (and the other Jedi, though in different ways) is more fleshed out, as are Anakin's own reactions to it. We also get a bit more of Obi-Wan's reaction to what is going on, and some explanation of a few key events.The novel does fall down in one key place: during Anakin's killing of the Separatist leaders, he makes snide remarks, then gloats a bit when it's all over. In the film, he is quiet throughout, and afterwards is clearly shaken and upset. The movies view -- of an Anakin who knows he has crossed the line and is upset at what he has become -- is much more powerful, and I wish Stover had stayed with that.In the end, I'd say that the novel is enjoyable and worth reading if you want more details about the events of the movie, though unless you're really impatient, you can just wait for the paperback. (I really dislike the way movie books are now coming out in hardback first. In general, I prefer hardbacks only for those books that I plan to reread a number of times, and movie novelizations and tie-ins really don't fall into that category for me.)"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"**** Although no novel can capture the images so vividly portrayed on the screen of unimaginable visual concepts and aliens never before seen, a novel can do what a movie can not. It can take the reader into the heart of the characters and provide the mythic history that there is no way to depict without weighing down a movie. By now, you surely know that Revenge of the Sith is the story of how Anakin completed his journey to the Dark Side, so unlike many reviews, this is not so much to tell you about the story of the book, but why it is important to read this book if you see the movie anyway. Although there are not quite as many \\"deleted scenes\\" in the novel of Episode III as there are in the novelization of Episode IV, A New Hope, there are still quite a few insights that will enhance the movie viewing experience. Things that are murky or ambigous on screen gain clarity if you have read the book.

It is a character-driven drama that elegantly brings together puzzle pieces and backstories in a very satisfactory, epic, deeply-moving and painful \\"conclusion\\". It is the end of an age, beautifully told and darkly realized. All of us who know the Star Wars universe understand that this story really isn't a conclusion but is instead the darkest chapter in a saga of lost innocence, betrayal, misguidance, lust and power - it is the story of how one of the greatest modern villians, Darth Vader, fell into darkness and lost his humanity. The novel itself is a joy to read, wonderfully told in a style that captures the drama and excitement that is Star Wars all while openly revealing individual characters and \\"what it's like\\" to be them. Fantastic! I applaud George Lucas for creating this epic story and Matthew Stover for doing such a superb job of writing this novel!

Stover did a great job of letting us know how it felt to be the characters, letting us understand what was going through their head. Now we understand (in a twisted, evil, tormented sort of way) why Anakin turned to the dark side.There are still a lot of surprises left in store. The story arc ends nicely, setting up Episode IV perfectly. Indeed the last few pages, as one reviewer put it, broke my heart.If the film is anything even close to the book, it will be the redemption of Episodes I, II, and III."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"If the movie is as good as the book can we say Best Picture Oscar nod"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The part I most enjoyed about this book was the character development of Obi-Wan: He has human emotions, but he can rein them in with his Jedi discipline. I loved when the Emperor referred to Yoda as a \\"green freak.\\"I disliked the switching back and forth between scenes. I know it's supposed to build tension, but it's just annoying. The Qui-Gon Jinn references were overdone. He was the most forgettable Jedi in the series to me.The success of the movie will greatly depend on the acting of Hayden Christensen. Now, that's scary. But at least the stilted dialogue of the first two episodes is mostly gone. Also the Jar Jar character has been minimized."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Uh, so how could you not want to grab this book the minute it came out to find out how the whole thing ends/begins?! This story does serve as a good bridge between the \\"prequels\\" and the original Star Wars. And it's not nearly as complicated as I thought it was going to be.Why the three stars? Well, the actual writing of this book was only fair. The author used some techniques to get the reader inside the characters' heads that I believe actually backfired. However, Stover was able to keep the story moving, and while the language didn't conjure up images of the characters/scenery very well, you pretty much got what you wanted out of it. This novel is not nearly as well written as Episode II was, but I still couldn't put it down.A decent novel in and of itself, but more than the others (Episode I and II), the reading of more peripheral novels (Labrynth of Evil, etc) really helps place the story line in better context.One thing I have to give the storytellers...the last few pages of this book actually broke my heart. Weird, considering how we all know how it's going to turn out. Oddly moving, I think."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Episode III shows exactly what can happen when a society decides to trade their freedom for security. In the end, they end up with neither and in the case of Ep3, a Republic becomes an Empire and in the end, the good guys find out that the war was basically all for nothing. This is probably going to offfend some of the Bushies out there, but I have no doubt that Lucas had current events in mind when he came up with the screenplay for Ep3. There is also talk of the force as it pertains to eternal life and the force described as if it were kind of divine entity, so I'm pretty sure the Fundies aren't going t be happy with it either.As for the book itself, I thought it was pretty good, but I also felt there wasn't quite enough there to make Anakin do what he did. The device they came up with to make him turn to the dearkside was a bit half-hearted ... I was hoping for a little more of a pschological twist to it rather than a specific set of events.To me, part of the excitement of Episode III is getting to see all the lightsaber duels in the movie. But in the book, you just don't get the same experience as actually seeing it on screen. On the other hand though, you get additional insights into what the characters are thinking that you may never get in the movie, so the book and the movie kind of make up for the other's weaknesses."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Well, it's too late at night to write up a complete review, so I will hit on the major points that I have with the book.1. First off, I am incredibly glad that I read the book before watching the movie. Although much of the initial \\"what's going to happen\\" magic will be gone, I will know more deeply what is going on in the heads of the characters as things unfold. I will understand why particular actions/thoughts are going on. The author did a FABULOUS job detailing this. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book and so many things that I already knew about the entire saga just did a complete click. I feel completely different about Vader, Obi-Wan and everyone else. I no longer am totally irritated by Anakin's whining etc. I see more deeply into him. Again, the author did a wonderful job pulling the characters into focus as he went through the story.2. What's with his \\"clenched knuckles\\" fetish? Within just a couple of chapters, if that, he goes on to explain like 3-4 character's clenched knuckles at least. It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't use practically the same description less a couple varying phrases near the end of those descriptions.3. This is Mathhew, now and forever. Wha...?? I see his point for these sections however I must say they really drew me out of the story. Surely they could have been written in a more inclusionary way into the story?4. What happened to the battle of Kashyyk?? This is one of the most absolutely MAJOR parts of Episode III! Seriously! We get introduced to Chewbacca. Supposedly there's a relationship between him and Yoda, we're supposed to learn about Chewbaccas true brute strength and honor as well as the wookie homeland, fighting styles and dedication to eachother or one that saves their life. There is seriously about 1/3 of the story in that battle. Be it direct or hidden within what's happening! How can this be totally left out in the book?? It goes from a clipit about Yoda talking to Obi-wan via commlink from somewhere on the planet to Yoda being found in a pod over the planet. It doesn't even describe yoda's \\"disguise\\"! What is up with this?? Surely this wasn't some \\"hidden plot\\" when he was given the storyboard. Again, this is one of the major points of the saga, and it's totally neglected in an OFFICIAL representation of the story. This is the LAST official book covering the true 6-part movie, and they totally leave out one of the major plot-points in the entire thing.This last point is totally unforgiveable in my opinion and really throws fear into me as to where Lucas is leading this \\"empire\\". He used to hate the \\"Big company\\" tactics yet he's become the worst of them all. He gives in to Samuel Jackson with the purple lightsaber. This was never to be. . .he gives in to Hayden being the one in the Vader costume. .thus making vader look like a pansy. He's thin, he's weaker looking, and he's just plain small. Again, no excuse.Overall I'd say the book itself is written extremely well, and I don't know if I have to put the blame for my 3rd point on Matthew or on Lucas so I can't really put that against them as much as I'd like to. ..although the knuckle fetish and pulling you completely out of the story so often with these descriptions really hurt my overall rating.However, I do recommend reading this before seeing the movie, or perhaps after if you're willing to go see the movie again after reading the book. I feel that it would add a LOT to your movie experience!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I COLLECT THE HARD BACK Star Wars books that go with each movie I almost didn't get this because it doesn't say episode III on it the first 2 list which ones they are but for some odd reason this one didn't."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is awesome! I think it is better than the movie. I am absolutely OBSESSED with Star Wars. So when I saw the first preview of Episode III and heard the movie was coming out in May, I was beside myself with excitement! I literally felt like I was about to BURST! One day, I found out that Matthew Stover was coming to a book store near the place where I live to discuss his book with others. I just HAD to be there! And fortunatly, I was able to go!!! I got to ask Matthew a couple questions about the process of writing Revenge of the Sith, and I had him SIGN my copy! Afterward, I decided that I would not read the book until right after I saw the movie. And a few days after I saw the movie, I snatched that book and put my nose right in it. I did not like the beginning that much because the first two little battles were way too detailed for me and I thought they would never end. But the more I got into it, the more I fell in love with the story, the characters, and the deep, deep emotion in this wonderful book. I was extremely disappointed when I got to the end of this book, and now I want to read it again. I love the way this guy writes. I just find it so interesting. I might try reading some of his other Star Wars books as well. If you have not seen the movie yet (which I highly doubt) and you are an anti-spoiler type, you should definetly buy this book, but you don't have to read it yet. If you have seen the movie (which you probably have)then this book is a must-have if you want to really almost feel the true feelings and emotions the characters experience in this story. Either way, you MUST buy this book. PLEASE buy it today!!!Signed,A 13-year-oldStar Wars-lovingGirl."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was fairly disappointed in the book, probably because I'd already seen the movie before I read it and there were no surprises and little additional information in it. Reading it was rather like going to a concert for a favorite band who are touring on their new album- which you really liked, but they're playing *exactly* the same way live as they did in the studio. Granted, it isn't Milli-Vanilli- but it isn't anything special either. I think what I was hoping to see was some genuine emotion, and some pathos, which was only sketched on the movie screen. We know Anakin is becoming a great hero, but a lousy Jedi, when the story opens. Obi-Wan is still stuck in teacher/Master mode, and not really trying to get out of it. He is the perfect Jedi, the knight without flaw or reproach- except that he really loves Anakin deeply, as a brother, and hardly knows it. This is the chink in Obi-Wan's armor. He is as guilty as Anakin is about forming forbidden attachments and allowing emotion to rule better judgement. As it becomes plain to that Anakin will never be a Jedi- and he doesn't want to be, and Obi-Wan never wanted to be anything else, but is also in danger of losing the Order he loves so much to forces that he cannot control, the conflict that this creates is pretty much absent. Moreover, the brotherhood and love that Anakin and Obi-Wan still feel for each other, right up to the end [Anakin may shriek, \\"I hate you!\\" to Obi-Wan as he lays dying on the black sands of Mustafar, but who does he think he's kidding? Hate is the flipside of love, its darker twin, and we all know this. Having Obi-Wan walk away and leave him to his fate is a thousand times worse than hacking him up with a lightsaber.] In the book, Obi-Wan realizes just how much Anakin means to him, how much he really loves him, and decides that as a Jedi he can only do one thing: let the attachment go. Love might be hot, love might be swift, love might be blind and love might be strange, but *love doesn't ever completely let go.* Love can sublimate, take another form, but it never truly dies. This action of Obi-Wan, in the book, completely killed the buzz for me. However, as movie treatments go, this isn't a bad one. My advice: wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Despite the best efforts of the author, Matthew Stover, the novelization of Episode III still shines through. Mr. Stovers style of writing is in stark contrast to the previous writers of Episodes I and II, Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore respectively, in that it is not good. Instead of adding to the book like the previous authors, Mr. Stover feels it necessary to sprinkle the book with useless and rather un-StarWars-like descriptions and asides. I still recommend that any star wars fan read this book, but be careful before you read anything else by Mr. Stover, lest you get more of the same."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This story starts in a space battle that doesn't look good for the republic. Then Obi-Wan and Anakin show up and the action begins...this story has lots of mystery and the whole time the story unravels itself you are wondering when will anakin turn bad ...this book is very confusing but keep with it and it will make sense in the end.this book was a little pricy but it's a great book and i hope a good movieemail at VIXXER282 AT yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Warning: Slight Spoilers:As in the prior prequel books, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and the \\"Attack of the Clones\\" they provided a greater insight into Star Wars nostalgia. \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" is no exception and helps give a better understanding of what the characters were thinking. I am looking forward to visually seeing the pseudo-sea battle with the wookies and the separtists. As well, it characterizes Anakin as not being very bright. I mean Palpatine essentially tells Anakin that he is the villian and Anakin still joins the Sith. Even more, he goes and begs Mace Windu not to slay Palpatine, but just arrest him. Anakin is protrayed as very immaturistic of which he is and that is why he went to the dark side, he was immature. He even was getting suspicious with Padme and Obi-Wan as concubines. Obviously, he had a lot of growing up to do and it is understandable how he turned to Darth Vader throught he build up in the book. Though my favorite villian was Jango Fett, I like General Grievous and looking forwatd to seeing what he looks like on screen. Although, Darth Vader was stylistic in his armor, he was weakened dramatically following the lava incident.As such, the book is good and I enjoyed re-reading it. This movie will be equal to Empire Strikes Back in terms of drama and broadening the character development. Still, I think the Star Wars prequels should have started with AOTC, ROTS, and then having the third prequel cover the Jedi Purges (which was began in ROTS)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I will not talk about the plot, but Stover wrote a piece of literature. His writing GRABS the reader. It is amazing how it pulls you in from the first sentenece and never lets you go. If you liked Traitor, you like this book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"i love the star wars series and i am currently reading every novel published. i give the movie books episodes 1-6 four stars because george lucas is a fool when he wrote the movies such as making anakin a little complaining brat or including too many contradictions. these authors had to write based on the movie and it did not come out so well. but it is star wars and the general concepts are quite amazing. so george lucas isnt a complete fool. i recommend star wars to any individual who found something interesting in this series. i recommend this book just as another book you should read in the series because you should be reading every single one."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"...you'll probably enjoy this title. It differs in some respects than the film but not in a way that changes the heart of the story. I take issue with the portrayal of Palpatine as something of anti-Christ, i.e. he's called A Shadow and it's suggested he's the embodiment of all Evil in the Galaxy. My take on him is that he is just as human as the rest of us and made choices the same way Anakin did. Was Palpatine always evil? Or, like Anakin, and other apprentices of the Sith, did he become who and what he was step-by-step?In any case, it's a good read and explains in greater depth how what happened happened. The sequel: Dark Lord, gives greater insight into Vader's \\"new life\\" inside that suit, as well as his growing disenchantment with the Emperor he's pledged to serve."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"My wife and I both read this book after seeing the film.Stover does an excellent job of adapting the screenplay to book form. The novel is true to the film, adding dialogue and exposition that enhance the story without changing it. Stover's Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme all seem more 3-dimensional than the filmed characters, and Palpatine is more sinister.If you're a moderate to hardcore Star Wars fan, this book is probably a must buy item. But if, like me, you're a mild fan, this book is still a fun, adventurous read that answers a lot of questions raised by the film."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"it follows the story really well.

It shows their thoughts in their mind and has some cool stuff like this.This was in the beggining of part one\\"The dark is generous. The first gift is concealment: our true faces lie in the dark beneath our skins, our true hearts remained shadowed deeper still. But the greatest concealment lies not in protecting our secret truths, but in hiding from us the truth of others. The dark protects us from what we dare not know.The second gift is comforting illusion: the ease of gentle dreams in night's embrace, the beauty of that imagination brings to what would repel the day's harsh light. But the greatest of its comforts is the illusion that the dark is temporary: that every night brings a new day. Because it it day that is temprary. Day is the illusion.

It is the dark that seeds cruelty into justice, that drips contempt into compassion, that poisons love with grains of doubt. The dark can be patient, because the slightest drop of rain will cause those seeds to sprout.

The vast majority of the scenes seemed to have been shot in front of a blue screen, with digitized backgrounds and effects added on later. At one point I even found myself wondering whether the armchairs in a scene had been added digitally. Unlike the original trilogy, this was basically an animated film with a few actors thrown in, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, not particularly good actors.I bought this book on CD and listened to it before seeing the film and to be brutally honest, I preferred it. The narrator does a great job with the voices, imitating the accents and tones of the various characters. There are lots of special (sound) effects, and the story has much more depth than the movie version. Some of the forced similes were a little irritating, as was the over-use of the word \\"being\\" instead of \\"person.\\" But overall, I'd say skip the movie and get this on CD instead!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"You know its going to be great. Why spoil it for yourselves now? You waited nearly 25 years to see how Luke Skywalker's father became Darth Vader. You can't wait another 6 weeks? Do what I did. Buy the book, put it on your shelf, and DON'T READ IT UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE.Trust me, you'll regret it if you don't. 25 years ago I read the novelization to \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" before the film came out. I just thought I couldn't wait. I was the only audience member who didn't audibly gasp when Vader said, \\"Luke, I am your father\\". What I would give to have not known that Vader was going to say that. Don't make the same mistake that I did."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I wanted to see the movie before reading this book, and so I did. It was right up there with \\"Empire Strikes Back\\".After that, I thought I might fill in some holes by reading this book. Well... I'm not so sure it did that very well, as a matter of fact, it kind of messed with it a little, and changed some of the Star Wars facts (Amidala states in episode II, \\"I was not Naboo's youngest Queen\\", yet this book claims she was).This book does do one thing extremely well. It demonstrates why you should never use a particular writing tactic I was told never to use. If you do employ such methods, you wind up with this crap.I was told, \\"Never say 'Obi Wan and Anikin were the best of friends, closer than brothers, blah blah blah for two pages, to the point where you're expecting a love scene between the two of them'. Instead, you should show this through the story, NOT come right out and tell the reader what they should get about their relationship (or how a character is feeling)\\".This sounded like good advice when I heard it fifteen years ago, but this book showed me exactly how awful it comes across when done. And this book does it through about a third of the book.For every scene, they'll start some action or dialoge, then, to make sure we get the idea of what the scene wants to portray, the author goes into a two page \\"aside\\" telling the reader exactly what the point is, then finish up with the action or dialoge.For example (small spoiler),Anikin needs to land a space cruiser that is not designed to land, and is falling apart to boot. As this scene starts to unfold, we are told, \\"[This act will define the impossible for thousands of years]\\"\\"[Anikin is the best pilot ever]\\" \\"[You've got to be really really really really good to even think of this]\\" \\"[Even the best pilots would never never never never ever even conceive of doing this.]\\" \\"[Holly crap readers, can you believe he's doing this?!?]\\" \\"[Oh my goodness readers, you should really be amazed at this!]\\" Then he lands the ship.Yes, I'm paraphrasing a little ;) , but I'm not exagerating at all. Truly, I've learned my lesson better than ever... \\"Show, don't tell\\".This is a book I would have put down twenty pages in, but I really wanted to see if any more details were thrown in. A little on the timeline, but I really should not have wasted my time."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This novel got to me in a way that I didn't think a novel could; let alone a Star Wars novel; let alone a Star Wars novel based on one of the movies;let alone a Star Wars novel based on one of the PREQUEL movies.The sole reason I purchased this book was on account of Matthew Stover's name being attached to it. I had recently jumped back into Star Wars novels thanks to his book, SHATTERPOINT. Up until then, as I've mentioned before, I had only perceived the Star Wars line of books to be marketable pieces of fanfiction (no thanks to previous experiences). But thanks to Stover, I came to believe in Star Wars again. He showed that there can be some ruthlessness in that realm, and that there is some room in the Expanded Universe for deep, philosophical musings about the ever-present clash between light and dark.I found that book just shy of a five-star rating because of a few gratuitous action scenes and some hang-ups I had with character development and pacing.His novelization of REVENGE OF THE SITH, however, not only came to fully deserve a five-star rating, but also developed to become one of the best, if not THE best, novels I've ever read. Again, I realize how silly that might sound: that a novelization of a Star Wars movie could accomplish such a thing. But I couldn't be more sure of it, because this novel is more than a mere interpretation of a screenplay, it serves the core-story to an extent that if I had read this book before seeing Episode III for the first time, I probably would have felt cheated by the amount of content that had all but disappeared in translation.I don't think I have to recap the story as, essentially, the main story-arc remains the same as the movie. But as I said, it expands on this to an insane degree. Characters, like Count Dooku, who really only seemed evil for the sake of evil, now have motive, fears, ambition. Every turn of emotion and every betrayal seems more devastating because of this exposition. Even Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who we've followed through three movies, seem almost alien as we completely rediscover who they are, what motivates them, and exactly how close they were to each other. The pair actually feel as though they're brothers-in-arms here, not the squabbling pair they came off as on film.Some scenes are extended and pack more of a punch. One particular addition that I was mesmerized by came just before Palpatine reveals his true identity as Darth Sidious, where he tells a troubled Anakin that he can give him anything he wants in the galaxy. Anakin playfully begins naming off anything from an expensive speeder to an entire star system, and Palpatine, without hesitation, grants all of these things purely to prove a point. Scenes like this worked so well on paper that I haven't the foggiest why they didn't make an appearance in the movie.And, yes, I would certainly say this book is better than the movie it's based upon. It goes so far as to transcend the Star Wars canon itself, providing such entrancing moral dilemmas and philosophical thoughts that, at some points, these thoughts leap off the page and make you wonder their context within our own universe: the frail divide between good and evil, relativity, and giving in to tradition.Again, this is a Star Wars book.I must also mention the writing, because Stover has a natural gift for making the reader feel what his characters are feeling. He tells this story from many points of view so that this vast story is properly covered, and he tells it all with the exuberance of a narrator of a tragic play. He allows you to see through the eyes of the characters, and takes you aside to really point out key moments in their lives. And when the end comes, and Darth Vader dons his trademark armor for the first time, there is no \\"Hey, look, it's Darth Vader!\\" moment, there's only the pity and sadness for a boy that you've come to know and care for who had flown too close to the sun. And he sums it all up perfectly in a way where you come to understand Vader so much more intensely:\\"This is what it's like to be Anakin Skywalker, forever.\\"I must fiercely recommend this to any Star Wars or Stover fan. The way this book reads, it's as if you've missed out on half of the movie--the good parts--and you will come to know some of your favorite characters in a way that you didn't think possible. [SPOILER]: Mace Windu's death will actually shock you! Yeah! And if you've read SHATTERPOINT, it will most certainly sadden you.I have two more Stover/Star Wars novels left to go. Here's hoping he doesn't stray too far from that universe, because it's in desperate need of him. May the Force be with us all."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker:The Hero With No Fear is what he's called, but it isn't true. Fear is his constant companion. He fears for those he loves, especially his secret wife, Padme Amidala. Dark secrets are revealed and loyalties are pushed to the breaking point. His love and dreams are falling apart before his eyes. No longer does he feel he can trust those he's considered his closest friends. He isn't even sure anymore the side he has been fighting for in the Clone War is the right side.Revenge of the Sith doesn't start out very dark, with lively banter between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, but as it progressed I found it to be the darkest, saddest, definitely the most emotional Star Wars book I've ever read. It was obviously one of the more difficult books to write but I think Matthew Stover did an excellent job.As a hardcore Star Wars fan I found everything I would want in this book: the greatest lightsaber duals ever dreamed up; enough built up suspense to drive a person nuts; an in-depth look at all the characters in the book, from the small role of Count Dooku to the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious; and a climax to end all climaxes.

The middle will be filled with political strife and Anakin's temper tantrums. (I apologize, but there is absolutely no other way to put Anakin's emotions.) The climatic ending, however, will have a huge impact on the Reader and promises to be the most memorable scene EVER for Star Wars fans. I highly recommend reading this book BEFORE going to see the movie at the end of May 2005. If the book of Episode III is anything like Episode II, then the people that reads this novel before seeing it all unfold on the big screen will understand a whole lot more of what is going on and why things are happening a certain way. By reading first, you understand why Anakin chooses what he does at the end. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you will understand. Also, there will be scenes omitted from the movie version, just as some humorous parts and what could have been awesome special effects were deleted from the second episode.Whether you read this novel or not, buy it.

Doesn't matter, because the point of reading through this book is to provide points of view from key characters and also explain certain events leading up to the dialogue / scenes from the movie.Don't think about getting this. Just GET IT. Although the movie was good, it can never give you the complete illustration of how great the movie can really be. Perfect companion to the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I gave this book the highest rating because it is one of the best of its kind. This is definitely one of the best novelizations of a movie I have ever read. I read it before viewing the film and it added depth to characters and motivations to their actions that were hard to find in the movie. This story fills in most of the plot gaps between Star Wars 1 and 2 and The New Hope.I won't recap the plot, but here are some highlights.This book clarifies how Anakin's fear of loss (of his wife Padme) drove him from one bad decision to the next and eventually into the position of apprentice to Darth Sidious, Sith Lord. A primary teaching of the Jedi is to release attachment to things and people, for these attachments cause weakness and distraction. Anakin will no-doubt become the textbook example in the next Jedi school.How can 1 Sith (and his apprentice) outwit and eliminate the Jedi? The Jedi had become complacent in their teachings and practices. Too late, Yoda realizes this and is forced (no pun intended) to retreat into hiding on Dagobah (where we find him in The Empire Strikes Back).How does democracy fall? With cheering and applause, according to Padme Amadala, as the Chancellor maneuvers, lies and schemes his way into position as Emperor. &lt;SOAPBOX ON> The Clone Wars serves the same purpose as the 9/11 attack in making people WANT to surrender their rights - a la the Patriot Act &lt;SOAPBOX OFF>. Watch as Palpatine outwits everyone, including the 900-year-old Yoda.The writing is well done and I loved the layout and approach the author takes.Read this books before you see the movie. Read it after. Or read it while you watch it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I'm only going to mention a couple of things. Both the novel and the film have been out long enough that I don't see any real reason to go back over a synopsis of the story.Once freed of a film's running time Stover could really take his time fleshing out issues that the movie was forced to speed through. For example, he made it clear as day why tension had mounted between the Jedi and Palpatine, and the current political climate on Courasant.The relationship between Anakin and Palpatine is explored much more then in the movie. In the scene when Palpatine revealed himself to Anakin, Palpatine's emphasis on his right to live and his prediction that the Jedi would kill him on the spot for his religious beliefs, I found, much more effective then in the film. From what I recall, the film focused more on trying to save Amadala from her predicted demise.I thought that the effect Anakin's visions were having on him were much better explained then in the movie. The novel, basically, had Anakin terrified to rest and exhausted from sleep depravation. This worked in that when the climatic battle between Windu and Palpatine came to a head, Anakin (who, at that point, was nothing short of delerious from exhustion) obviously wasn't thinking clearly.I loved the way that the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan developed. It was very well illustrated that Anakin was always using Obi-Wan as his emotional anchor and when removed of that, just how easily he could be manipulated by someone Anakin saw as never having lied to him.The only thing that I wound up dinging the novel for was the Wookies role and Yoda's escape. It's virtually missing, as if someone just accidentally edited it out. It was really bizarre that it was just ... not there.Outstanding book though, as much as I liked the film, the book is significantly better."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I'm no major \\"Star Wars\\" fan, but I have seen all of the movies and even picked up a few of the books. I saw \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" and wasn't wowed by it, but I thought it was a decent, enjoyable movie. After seeing some of the acclaim for the novelization, however, I decided to definitely give it a read --- I love movie novelizations.Although I know of course it couldn't be possible, I do call this the book on which the movie should have been based. This is a thrilling and compelling adaptation of the true final saga in the \\"Star Wars\\" series. Matthew Stover gets right into the heart of the story and the characters. Throughout the book, you'll find his compelling and detailed descriptions of the characters --- their emotions, their place in the story at that time, their relations with others and much more.The action scenes are great, but this book is at its best in the depictions of the characters and the relations. You'll learn many things you never knew or never picked up on before about Darth Sidious, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and many of the other characters you've come to know through Episodes I-III (and in Kenobi's [and I suppose Anakin's] case, the other Episodes as well.) Matthew Stover writes about these characters with such depth that one would almost believe, if they didn't know better, that he created them. You'll relive all the drama, the highs and lows of the movie and feel more satisfied with the plot than you ever were before.I'd even go so far as too say that even someone who's never been a fan of \\"Star Wars\\" before could enjoy this novelization. As for myself, I'll definitely be seeking more of Matthew Stover's work.Edit --- Audiobook on CD ReviewHmm, apparently you're only allowed one review per \\"set,\\" so now I'm adding in my review for the audibook version on CD as of November 6, 2005:Wow, and I Thought the Written *Book* Was GreatThis is the audiobook adaptation of Matthew Stover's version of \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" on CD. The story it contains is powerful and strong, written by a master writer.No doubt, you would be listening to a great story even if this were a normal audiobook production. However, following up on the great example set by the book, the people at Books on Tape who put this together have gone the extra mile. There's stuff on here I never expected --- musical scores from the movie, sound effects including light-saber humming and astromech whistling, full surround sound and other audio elements for a truly immersive experience. Pretty much all audiobooks I've heard before have been pretty much just a straight read-out-loud, with maybe some music at the beginning and end. For this to have all of this totally blew me away.Of course, I couldn't do this review without complimenting the excellent talents of Jonathan Davis. One thing this audiobook does not have is a \\"full cast\\" like some audiobooks these days, but it doesn't need it. Jonathan Davis is everyone, from Padme Amidala, to Yoda, to Kenobi and to Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader, dark lord of the Sith. And he's also the surround-sound voice of that whispering dragon in Anakin's ear --- \\"All things die, Anakin. Even stars burn out.\\"Even if you've read the book, or seen the movie, you haven't yet fully experienced the story until you've listened to this. Get a hold of the audiobook on CD (or tape --- but I don't know if the tape production is quite as good) and relive the story once again."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First of all, let me tell you a little about myself. I am an avid reader, however in the past four years I have been in college and haven't gotten to physically read very many books. Therefore I have turned to the UNABRIDGED audio books for the books that I really want to read.I have hundreds of these audio books personally including the majority of the Star Wars Audio Books. Out of all of the audio books I have listened to in my life, this has got to be in the top two.This audiobook is read very nicely and it is easy to understand the person who is reading it. The story itself is really great. It takes place a few years after Episode II: Attack of the Clones and about 20 years before A New Hope (aka Star Wars 1977). It tells about the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the darkside of the force as well as the Fall of the Republic.The thing I really enjoyed about this presentation, is that first of all it is Unabridged. Then one of the biggest reasons I liked this audiobook, is because it incorporates sound effects and music from the Star Wars movies. Including blaster fire, John Williams' score, lightsabre sounds. The reader also uses different voices for each of the characters. Some of these voices are also enhanced by the computer generated sounds for example General Grievous sounds very much like a cyborg. The voices for Anakin and Obi-Wan are very close to those of the actors portraying them in the movies.If you are thinking about buying the audiobook of Revenge of the Sith, I would tell you the best set to buy would be the unabridged edition it has little areas which are most likely not in the movie that helps to explain other portions of the plot.Thank You For Reading My Revue!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Nobody, not Qui Gonn, not Obi Wan, not even ancient Jedi master Yoda knew Skywalker's destiny. The Jedi could only sense that the boy would bring balance to the force. But how? They didn't know that. The Jedi didn't even know what bringing balance to the Force meant! But the Sith Lord Sidious did.In Revenge of the Sith, chancellor Palpatine reveals his true self as the puppetmaster who fights against the republic in the name of separatism and against the separatists in the name of freedom and democracy that the Republic represents. He betrays his own generals and \\"friends\\" in a plot to corrupt Anakin, destroy the Jedi and grab the power in the Senate becoming the fearsome dictator.I always thought that \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" was the best Star Wars. Well, Revenge of the Sith surpasses it in every way. It is the deepest, darkest tale of a scared boy with the powers of a dozen Jedi.The story takes several turns but never loses the sight of scared little 6 year old Anakin in a man's body, losing the war against his dark side even as he wins battle after battle for the Republic. His ruthless murder of count Dooku, his cockiness as he battles droid armies and his lingering fear of losing those he loves most is so eloquently presented that you pity his ignorance, his helplessness and that inherent, heart wrenching fear that is his constant companion.I don't want to ruin it for you by saying more but I will say this: if you are planning to watch the movie, don't miss the book. While the movie will show you droid armies and battle ships in great details, it will not, cannot, make you hear the voices inside Anakin's head, voices that eventually lead to his transformation to Darth Vader."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers who have commented that they feel that the book far outshines the movie. Stover takes full advantage of the ability to \\"get inside the characters' heads\\" that a novel affords its author. The motivations of the major characters is made clear, especially Anakin's reasons for wanting to be promoted to the rank of Jedi Master.Scenes that were either deleted from the final cut of the movie, or never intended to be included in the first place, do much to flesh out the story. We see much more of the beginnings of what will become the Rebel Alliance, and the role of Padme becomes much more than that of anguished wife.I am a huge fan of the movies. The original Star Wars is the first movie I can remember seeing in a movie theater back in 1977. Having said that, I wish more elements from this book would have been included in the Revenge of the Sith that we saw on the screen. Stover's description of Darth Vader's thoughts and feelings when he first awakens in his armor is worth the read alone."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"With most books turned into movies, the book is usually better. However, since this book is written from a movie, they are roughly the same.I enjoyed this book almost as much as I enjoyed the movie. The book does however have a slight advantage, as do all books: you get to see what the character is thinking. I found it especially interesting to read about what was going on in Dooku's head while he was fighting Anakin and Obi-Wan. Another place where this really came in handy was at the end where Anakin was offically crowned Darth Vader...mask and all. You can tell that there is \\"still good in him\\" as Luke put it in Return of the Jedi.This book along with the movie points out the irony of ironies: Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side so that he could save Padme and increase his power. However, his turning to the dark side is what killed Padme. Not even Shakespeare could have written a better tragedy.On a last note, I would like to say that everyone plays a part of the blame in Anakin's demise: not Just Anakin himself and Palpatine. Think about it: NO ONE truly trusted and believed in him...except Qui-Gon and his mother who were both dead. Not even Padme trusted him completely and certainly not Obi-Wan. Yoda made it very clear from the beginning that he did not agree with Anakin becoming a jedi. Although Mace Windu believed he was the chosen one, he still did not give Anakin the respect he deserved. Palpatine was able to lure him over to the dark side by appearing to be the only one that Anakin could truly trust. But in the end, Anakin was the chosen one because it was he, and not Luke, whom destroyed the Sith and brought \\"balance to the Force.\\""},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Having watched the movie, Revenge of the Sith, about four times, I still had many questions in my head. I read this book to answer those questions, and was not disappointed.The author, Matthew Stover, clearly has a deep understanding of the Star Wars characters. This is not surprising since he has written two other Star Wars novels, but I found that he anticipated my guesses and confirmed some of my theories about the novels. He also is good at writing dialog that sounds true.The plot of the book follows the path of the movie fairly faithfully, but it is fleshed out by character profiles that explain the history and motivations of each of the principle characters. This can be a little trying if you are reading the story for the plot, but if you already know the story it can be very enlightening.I really liked that the author was not afraid to change dialog from the movie, or to extend scenes. Having seen movie novelizations that slavishly follow the screenplay, I was really pleased that he had the courage to change things.For example, the first major sword battle in the book is the one with Count Dooku. In this book Mr Stover narrates this fight in detail, even creating the names of different Jedi fighting styles, and as mentioned before, the details of the fight are NOT the same as the movie, so it seems a bit fresh and differentI also enjoyed the asides about Mace and Yoda's fighting techniques.At times, I found the writing style jarring as the author used weird tenses and odd viewpoints in some scenes. His use of the second person, YOU to help the audience identify with Anakin, for example, kept reminding me of my high-school English teacher who told me never to use that tense.Objections aside though, I quite enjoyed the book.It confirmed to me that Obi Wan is as cool as ever, that Mace and Yoda were flawed by their own arrogance, that Palpatine was absolutely salivating over the chance to convert Anakin, and that Padme is overcome by the complete failure of everything that she believed in.Reading the book made me want to see new novelization of episodes 4 - 6 from the viewpoint of Obi-wan, Yoda, and Anakin. To greater understand how the NEW Jedi Order led by Luke Skywalker will be able to overcome the failings of the old one.All in all I enjoyed this novelization and would recommend it to anyone who wants a greater understanding of the history and motivations of the characters. If you can overlook a certain oddness of style the end result is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"....Darth Sidious laid a pale hand on Anakin's brow. \\"Then it is done.

We just didn't know HOW it would happen. Matthew Stover has vividly brought to life the epic bridge between the \\"old\\" and the \\"new\\".Do you feel sorry for Anakin? Can you almost feel how much he loves Padme', and how much he will do, what he will surrender, to keep her love? Do you almost see the progression of daring young Jedi knight in love to skeptical, egotistical madman?Do you feel the sorrow of Obi Wan, realizing that his Padawan, his lifelong friend, has allowed emotion to cloud his judgement?Do you feel the limitless love of Padme' for her prince, and how she yearns to be with the one she loves?Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover is a MUST read for the true Star Wars fan. It is skillfully written, a real page turner.Run out and get this one - you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I originally had no intention of reading this book before seeing the film. The customer reviews on this site changed my mind. I got really excited about the overwhelming amount of positive response and ran out to get it. I read it in two evenings and probably would have read it straight through except for that annoying work thing.I am really impressed. If they can even come close to pulling this story off on the screen I'm going to be one very happy Star Wars fan. Incidentally, I'm really happy I read this before seeing the movie. Much of the underlying story is progressive and subtle. I almost caught myself tearing up at the end, over a Star Wars book! Very well told and almost impossible to put down. Even better, I don't think you will spoil the movie for yourself if you read the book. Get this one!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I don't know how to best describe this book after reading it a second time, and my husband has banned me from saying a word to him about the book, so I'm writing here...Things I liked... the action is stunning, the \\"This is what it's like to be...\\" are insightful, and the plot is great. I absolutely loved the fact that the transformation from Anakin to Darth Vader, was not instanteous and it was very subtle. I thought viewing the first two movies (and reading the books) that the transformation would be more of a reaction to Amidala dying than the political manuevering and manupulation. I actually can see Palpatine's point of view clearly, and I sympathised with Anakin as someone, who had power beyond comprehension, and both sides of the war were using him to his demise.Things I think will be tricky in the movie... I didn't like the way Amidala was portrayed in the book. I thought the personality went against what I thought of her in Episode I and II. Being a military spouse, I truly understand the complexities of sending a husband off to war, but I thought that her reactions to things were contrived. I didn't liked the glossed over explanations for the \\"force ghosts\\" and how Anakin came to be."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Firstly: this is a Stover novel, unquestionably. Lucas may own the characters, but few others could have given us the window into Anakin Skywalker's soul as he descended into the abyss. Secondly: we all know how this book will end. We know Anakin will become Darth Vader, apprentice to Palpatine. We know Palpatine will take over the Republic and make it into the Empire. We know that of the Jedi, only Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda will survive. What we're reading this book for is to see Anakin fall.Stover does a great job of getting us into the characters. Anakin is front and center, but Mace and Obi Wan take their turns as well. However, he saves his best for the Anakin scenes. The Hero With No Fear in fact faces fear every day, as well as other emotions, emotions which his Jedi training should've taught him to let go of. Yet that is his greatest strength, and ultimately his greatest flaw. Anakin cuts a tragic figure, as struggling with conflicted loyalties, he inexorably descends towards darkness, to rise again as Darth Vader.Even if you abhor novelizations, read this one. If you can't stand media tie-ins, read it. It is possibly one of the finest novelizations ever written."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First, be warned that this novel is a major spoiler for those who don't want to know what happens in the movie before going.But I assume many of those interested in reading this now will, like me, have already read the online version of the script plot.Just like the Star Wars novels include scences that got cut from the movie during production because the scene didn't play well / length of time, there are a few scenes that wouldn't read particularly well that should play very well on screen and so they were cut from the book. (Yoda on the Wookie planet.) Characters that are part of the background / in a group but not speaking on film simply don't get referenced in novelizations.There are a few questions from Attack of the Clones that weren't addressed in Revenge of the Sith; the short version of their answers can be found online. And it's probable that the Star Wars novels set between the movies will have long answers to them.Revenge of the Sith really explains exactly why Yoda & Obi Wan are so concerned about Luke heading to the Cloud City to rescue his friends in response to seeing the future. [Ankin's attempt to prevent the future he saw in fact causes it!]In addition in the future when people watch the Star Wars Movies in order starting at PM, they'll start seeing the foreshadowing of the end of ROTJ in one spot in ATOC and at least two spots in ROTS. This is very fitting since an excutive summary of I - III is found in the first two pages of the novelization of ANH.A minor spoiler for the movie: Jar Jar Binks goes with baby Leia and Bail Organia to Alderan because he's too closely associated with Padme.Draw your own conclusion on the fate of Jar Jar. :D"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Ok first off...I'm so annoyed by all the bad ratings based on lack of a Wookie battle. If you truly were into the book you would realize that it would be completely inappropriate to leave the story line of Anakin and his fall to the Dark Side by putting a few hundred pages worth of battle scene on Kashyyyk. It would completely disrupt the flow and true goal of the book. I personally would have been upset if a battle was dropped into the middle of the book just to please those who were sure it would be there because they had seen a short scene in a trailer. And to leave the main characters of Obi-Wan, Palpatine, and Anakin in exchange for the minor role Yoda played in the book would have been absurd.Now to the actual review. There were points in the book that I was overtaken by how well Stover depicted what was going on. There were two particular points where I found myself having to take a brief break from the book because it was that powerful. The development of the conflict within Anakin is presented with minor flaws and overal reflect an inner struggle between what everyone is shouting at him and who he must ultimately follow. The tranformation of Anakin is so rapid that I found myself flying through the middle portion of this book.Overal I believe this has only heightened my anticipation for the release of the movie. Although I pretty much know what is going to happen I still understand that seeing it will be even more powerful then reading what was going on. Much better than the books for Episodes I and II. Fast read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is better than the movie. In the movie, it looks like Anakin just randomly turns to the dark side. But the book reveals much more.Matthew Stover has writtena brilliant book. Here we see what Anakin is thinking, and all the turmoil within him,and how Sidious ultimately persuades him to join the darkside. I felt that after seeing the movie and reading the book, I had a much better understanding with the book as to why Anakin turned to the darkside.Bravo Mr. Stover. An excellent book that is better than the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover's telling of Revenge of the Sith goes beyond a mere \\"novelization\\" of the movie. This is a fine (soft) sci-fi novel in its own right, and fans of the movie will enjoy how the book fleshes out some of the ideas only touched upon in the film.Those who thought Annakin's descent into darkness went awfully fast in the movie will be pleased to read how Stover handles the same material. Stover puts us inside Annakin's head as the the transformation happens, most importantly during the fateful meeting with Count Dooku, and the transformation is much more believable.In fact, all the facets of the movie that I thought were rushed or incomplete are filled in nicely in this novel. For instance, in the movie, we watch a conversation between Obi-Wan and Annakin conclude, then follow Annakin into a coversation with Padme. In the novel, after that conversation finishes, we follow Obi-Wan instead, who has a coversation with Mace Windu that nicely sets up major plot points. We also get a more complete explanation of how the rebellion begins, and even get a clue as to why some Jedi, like Yoda and Obi-Wan, disappear into nothingness in the original movies while others have to be cremated.But most of all this is a fun read. The pages turned freely and I was engaged from start to finish"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"All I could say is WOW! If the movie is as good as the book, it would make the prequel trilogy a worthy compliment to the original trilogy (the other two episodes have been let downs). The story shows us who the mysterious Darth Sidous is, how the Jedi fall to the Sith, how the Clone Wars end, and finally what everyone has been waiting for, how Anakin Skywalker transforms into Darth Vader. All these years, people thought that Vader was the personification of evil, and yet his origin shows he was a tragic hero, who turned to the dark side to save the life of the woman he loves. You now understand why he made the decision to turn to the Dark Side, and the forces driving him to do so, torn between the Jedi and the Sith.Stover does an excellent job of showing the emotions of the characters and character interaction. The lightsaber fights (rather violent, and probably won't transfer to the film) and space battles are well described, its a book I couldn't put down and finished in a day. I also like the fact that Jar Jar's part is extremely minimal and that we finally understand how Obi Wan and Yoda learn how to disappear when they die.My only complaints: Where were the Wookies? in the commercials, I saw a young Chewbacca along with many other wookies in battle. This portion of the story seemed to be omitted. And the Sifo-dias order for the Clone Army wasn't clarified. I think its clarified in another book, but i'm only a fan of the movies anyway, and hopefully it will be brought up in the film. Otherwise, it was a great read and I can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This novelization was surprisingly well written, especially in comparison to others I have read on Luca's films. In fact, reading this novelization greatly enhances the film-viewing experience and ties up a lot of loose ends that aren't so obviously well tied up in the film. As I say, surprisingly good job."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover is the latest author (after Terry Brooks and R.A. Salvatore) to be given a chance to adapt one of the Star Wars films to a novel. Stover is no novice to the Star Wars universe, having written the excellent prequel novel \\"Shatterpoint\\" and the New Jedi Order volume \\"Traitor\\". Considering how dark and gritty \\"Shatterpoint\\" was, Stover appeared to be the perfect author to give the novelization for Episode Three to. Episode Three was said to be the darkest of all 6 films, and Stover is good at going dark. This was one of the few Star Wars novels which I was actually looking forward to reading.The basic outline of \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" has been known for years, even before \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was a glimmer in the eye of George Lucas. This is the one fans have been waiting for. This is the fall of Anakin Skywalker. This is the film, the book where Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the Dark Side of the Force, turns his back on the Jedi, helps destroy the Jedi and becomes Darth Vader. We know the history. We know what the end result is, that Luke and Leia will end up being separated with no knowledge of each other or their father. What we don't know is exactly how this all goes down. When the first two prequel movies were not what the audience had expected, \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" had to contain all the fans had wanted for the prequel trilogy. Since the release date for the movie is still a month away, I can't say if the movie will deliver the goods. I can say that the book does.The Anakin Skywalker that we know from \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is more than a little brash and angry at times, but he is dedicated to the Jedi. The other prequel novels give little foreshadowing hints to the fall, as does the scene in Episode Two where he slaughters the Tusken Raiders who kidnapped his mother. But how does he fall from the Jedi to the Sith? Matthew Stover does an excellent job at showing the reader the inner workings of Anakin's mind regarding the Jedi and how much of a friend Palpatine is to him, how important Palpatine is and how little Palpatine judges Anakin. He is exceptionally close to Obi-Wan, but Anakin still feels judgment from the Jedi. Through tightly described scenes of conversation and battle, we see Anakin slipping closer and closer to being able to accept the Dark Side. We see Palpatine continue to manipulate Anakin so that when he finally does reveal himself Anakin doesn't see the monster, but his friend who also happens to be a Sith Lord and might the Sith really not be as evil as the Jedi have taught?I can only hope that George Lucas proves to be half as good of a director for this final Star Wars film that Matthew Stover is a writer. If so, we can be looking at one very, very good movie. I'm skeptical, of course. Stover set the bar pretty high with this book. Including this book I have read forty of the Star Wars novels and this is easily one of the best. The story is gripping and one which I wanted to keep reading to find out exactly what happened next. Stover is very good at describing the lightsaber battles as well as making the dialogue feel natural (something that we don't often get in Star Wars). The only thing that felt off was the use of the trademark \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\" that must be contractually required of every Star Wars author. If Stover is this good playing in somebody else's world, I can imagine how good his original work must be. Not all Star Wars authors seem capable of writing this good of a Star Wars book. One could even skip all of the other prequel novels that fill in the story and having seen the first two films just jump right into this book and read arguably the best Star Wars novel out there (Stover's \\"Shatterpoint\\" and Karen Traviss's \\"Republic Commando\\" must also be considered). If you are looking to read a Star Wars novel, this might be the place to begin.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"While I do not consider myself a fanatic I was motivated to read the book before the movie comes out. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is because I reserve my 5's for books that I believe are truly classics. Although fun to read, I just can't call star wars books classics. I think the book does a great job of tying episode 3 into the original star wars movies I grew up with. Given all the bad things that have to happen to setup episode 4, the book is \\"dark\\" and I found myself saddened by the actions of Anakin. I must say that I disagree with the criticism of the book about Anakin's turn to the dark side. It seems that some people expect (or demand) that one single big event MUST happen in order for the character to choose evil pursuits. All I can say is that life does not seem to work that way. History is full of humans that gradually fall into evil pursuits. That seems to be far more common than those anectdotal stories of people that just \\"snap\\". It is more common to hear of those that snap in the modern media because of the increduelty we all experience when it happens. I guess you can call me an apologist for the author!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"After a campy but innocent hiccup with \\"Phantom Menace\\" (a decent adaptation by Terry Brooks) and just flat out disappointment in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" (R.A. Salvatore doing the best he could with that mess), we finally get the Star Wars we have been wanting for decades. Mr. Stover does a phenomenal job adapting what seems to be the best of the films to date, even experimenting with points of view, linear storytelling, and expanding the characterizations of previously one-dimensional characters. The downside is that the movie holds no surprises for me now, but the upside is that at least I have a movie to look forward to, instead of dread.Revenge of the Sith is shaping up to be what Return of the Jedi should have been: an action-packed, b@#%s-to-the-wall, space-operatic saga. Well done!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is a psychological story of Anakin's fall to the dark side!!! It is a gradually, slow, and convincing descent!! All his confusion, his fears, his temptations. It is the human condition we all go through at one time or other!! As for everybody's complaints of the wookies being left absent in this book, they simply have no clue!!! That background skirmish has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MAIN CUSP OF THIS STORY!!!!!! It is Anakin, Obi-wan's, and palpatine's focus, not a battle on a wookie planet!!!!! I was glad it wasn't included because I didnt want to waste valuable reading time on that battle!!!! It would have been useless and slowed the story down!!!! Good job Stover!!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I got it in the mail yesterday and read it overnight. I was very pleased how everything is wrapped up and things are set up for the original Star Wars to begin.There are many \\"Ah-Ha\\"! moments and many scenes of bravery and depravery. The story is much darker than any of the previous episodes but we were expecting that weren't we ;-)? The ending though is more satisfying than the best segment of the series, The Empire Stikes Back. I can't wait until the movie comes out on DVD and we can spend a New Year's eve some day watching Episodes 1-6 back to back.One caution though the Book is definitely PG-13. I would recommend the Scolastic or the Storybook versions for preteens. There are so many flying limbs and decapitations in the Book I am a bit apprehensive about taking my 7 year old and my 10 year old to see the movie.**************Spoiler***********They forgot to finish off Jar Jar Binks."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was prepared for more of the same, based on the fairly lame books that came out of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. But this exceeded expectations by a wide margin. The story is much better, the characters are deeper and more interesting, and the writing style is very crisp and entertaining.If you're wondering how Lucas could make the whole \\"Anakin descending to the dark side\\" thing believeable - well, it is. Anakin's gets a key motivation to take the dark side seriously, and the motivation is only a little bit of a stretch.Other high points - the humbling of Yoda at the end was very satisfying, and the evolution of Obi Wan is extremely well done. The battle scenes sound terrific. The resolution of what happens to the droids is well handled.Not-so-high points - the books does not go into the Wookie revolt in any significant way, and I understand that this is an important part of the movie. Amidala is not really in the story very much, though her role is key. And there's still just a whiff of \\"how could Anakin possibly be that stupid?\\"But all in all, far fewer flaws and far more to like than the previous two stories. I'm counting the days until May 19 to see this story on the screen. If this book is any indication, this should easily be the best of the second trilogy."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"If the movie is as good as the book, Star Wars fans are in for an awesome treat! When I purchased the book I told myself, \\"You're only going to read the first few chapters, you're not going to spoil any surprises in store for you by finishing this book!\\" Well, let's just say the force isn't very strong in me as I'm almost done with the book.The pacing of the story is just perfect. Slowly we see what caused Anakin to turn to the dark side and this is such a tragic story because Anakin REALLY is a good person.I would highly recommend reading the book! Matt Stover has done the Star Wars universe a great justice in creating a story so carefully crafted and paced that it may be the best Star Wars novel ever written!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"So I stayed up until two this morning to finish the book. And when I was done, when I had closed the last page, I could only take a deep breath and think, \\"Damn this is going to be awesome on the screen!\\"Now as for the book, it's great. Matthew Stover is an amazing author. Shatterpoint was a little better at showing Stover's gifts because of the fact he created and wrote the whole thing - not adapted it from a screenplay. But still Revenge is very, very good. It's tight, cold when it needs to be, fanciful when that's caused for. There's a lot of what's going on in the minds of the characters compared to what we are going to see on the screen. You can tell also that Stover has a love for Mace Windu. Mace has got it going on in this book. And it plays really nicely into Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil. The two fit together really well. If you were thinking of skipping Labyrinth, I would suggest rethinking that notion. Because to really enjoy the novelization and get it's references, you should read Labyrinth. And Shatterpoint. He makes a few references of Mace's time on his home planet.A few bones of contention: the last 100 pages are really sparse. The stuff that Lucas really wants you to love and drop your jaw at on the screen, Stover goes over really quickly. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is two pages, at best. I think it supposedly gets ten minutes of screen time. Also, the battle between Yoda and the Emperor is glossed over. And there are no real time spent or even glimpses of Chewie's home world. I know that Lucas is saving that for the film but still I think Stover is getting cheated as a writer because he could have done better things with it. Anakin's fight with Doku is tops, though! So is Obi-Wan's battle with Grevious!To sum it up, I really loved this book. I couldn't put it down and now that it's done, I miss it. I've read all the Prequel novels and I feel like I can close the book on Star Wars until Episode III hits the theaters. I'm glad that it ended with this book. Actually, if anyone were to read them in order, they'd get three really great books in a row with Dark Rendezvous, Labyrinth of Evil, and Revenge of the Sith.May the Force be with us all."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Having already seen the movie many times, I really had no interest in reading the book. However, examining other Star Wars books and seeing so many reviewers refer to Mathew Stover's book, the Revenge of the Sith, made me finally pick it up. It is a very well written book, and makes a lot of things in ROTS make sense, that really needed more to them in the movie. I won't go into too much detail, but for example, Anakin's obsession with becoming a Master. So many things were left out of the movie, probably due to time issues."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I ordered this book before seeing the movie in 2005 but I had my mother hide it from me until I saw the movie so I wouldn't be spoiled. I agree that this book outshines the movie in some ways but I'm glad I read it after seeing the movie. I always re-read it every couple of years.The book's greatest strength is that it goes beyond the movie and includes scenes that were deleted or not even filmed. It gives more background into what's happening--the political side of the war with the growing tension between the Senate, Chancellor and Jedi Order. Stover does a good job of weaving in the actual script of the movie with his own vision. It really feels like you're reading an extended version of the movie.Most positively it shows a sub-plot involving Padme Amidala (some of which are in the deleted scenes), portraying her as more than a worried wife/expectant mother. It reinforces the similar paths Padme and her daughter took while highlighting her tragedy as she watches everything she believes in crumble before her eyes.Recommended for any Star Wars fan."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I believe other reviewers said this as well, but I liked how the authors were able to fill in what was going on with Anakin before he became Vader. The third book wasn't quite as good, but it did explain why he never used force lightning and how he lost a significant amount of power after so much of him was replaced by machine and how he had to work to regain it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I borrowed this one from a friend before I went on a conference. I have seen all of the movies but this is the first novel that I've read for Star Wars. After reading it, I have discovered a new group of books to get into. I enjoyed the movie for Revenge of the Sith (although I know that some of the die hard fans were annoyed with it) so when I got into this book, I was surprised to see how much detail there was an how much it expanded on what the movie portrayed.An example in my mind is how exactly Darth Sidious became disfigured from his own lightning blasts. There is a good account of it. Also, a couple of the fights (Count Dooku vs. Obi-Wan and Anikan, Darth Sidious vs. Mace Windu) made a lot more sense and were far more expanded in the book. After reading this, I realize just how much more sense the story now makes. I highly recommend this book, even if you don't plan on following the novels."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"There are lots of reviews so I am just going to be brief. I was pleasantly surprised with this book. The other novelizations of the Star Wars movies have been pretty much the movie verbatim. This one is different. The depth given is incredible. For those who were disappointed with the movie, try reading this book, I think you will be happy that you did. If you liked the movie, you'll probably like the book even more (I did)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have read all the prequel books and they are all different in their own respect. This one was by far the darkest. It read (at least to me) almost like a horror book. I really wish there were aspects of the book that were put into the movie especially the seduction of Anakin by Palpatine. There are so much more details to how Anakin fell that were not in the movie which made it kind of weak. I really love the ending of the book when Anakin has turned into Darth Vader and he realized the \\"truth\\" about the Sith. It is really sad and I won't ruin it for anyone how has not read the book. I would recommend reading this book if you have watched the movie. It will help you understand the movie better."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have been reading Star Wars novels on and off for about 20 years and really enjoy them Reecently we bought a series of Karen Travis's and saw thsi novel below. Sounded good but it is such a hard read and choppy and well just annoying to try and read.I have attempted a few times as I like the subject matter but just put it down."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Then read this book. It is so in depth and fills many of the holes that left me wondering.The only thing that I irked me about this book is it seems the author didnt use the information from the previous book Labrynth of Evil. In RotS the Republic is borderline collapse when in LoE which takes place righth before the Republic have pushed the Seperatist to the Outer Rim and victory is in reach.Stop wasting time reading reviews and read this book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is by far the best of all of the novelizations of the Star Wars movies. Mathew Stover is an exceptional writer and gives the reader just what is expected from a Star Wars book. Action, suspense, drama, and a great perspective of each of the major players in the George Lucas universe. I can say with great confidence that I was sucked right into this book and had a hard time putting it down. I really got a great feel for Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace, and all of the other characters. When Anakin falls to the dark side I really pitied him. There is also a particular scene in the end when Palpatine confronts Anakin who had been rebuilt as Darth Vader and you could feel exactly what Anakin felt. Very powerful! The whole book was just fantastic, and I'm even tempted to pick up a copy to own. The last few lines were so perfect and tied the whole saga together nicely! This is an author who knows how to show, not tell! If you like Star Wars, you should read this!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I definitely loved the movie and equally enjoyed the novelization as presented on Audiobook CD. The novelization helped flesh out the characters and helped to better explain some of the things that happen in the movie, particularly the confrontation between Anakin and Count Dooku at the beginning of the movie and how Palpatine/Sidious manipulated and ultimately betrayed Count Dooku in his pursuit of gaining Anakin as his new apprentice as well as the nature of the \\"plot\\" against the Jedi briefly mentioned by Mace, two things that were never properly explained or developed in the movie. It was also nifty to for Stover to throw in a VERY MINOR character from \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (Captain Needa) during the opening space battle. The book does have a few graphic scenes particularly its illustration of the ruthlessness displayed by General Greivous towards one of his bridge crewmembers, as well as its description of Count Dooku's death. Although I preferred (most of) the film dialogue over the dialogue in the book, there were still a few really good lines that were NOT in the film such as when Obi-Wan is trying to get General Grevious to surrender at the beginning. Jonathan Davis does a good job of vocalizing all of the various characters, particularly Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Palpatine/Sidious and I loved that they included well-placed clips of music and sound effects throughout the audio presentation. Although I haven't had an opportunity to listen to it on my home theater system, the fact that the audiobook was recorded in Dolby Surround sound was a nice bonus. I have only listened to the abridged version so I cannot comment on how it compares to the unabridged version, however I felt satisfied that the abridged audiobook captured all of the main highlights from the movie, as well as incorporating at least a couple scenes that were filmed for the movie but later cut. Overall highly recommened!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have to admit that the book starts off very comfusing. Stover struggles with writing what is otherwise a very visual story with suspensful action. What I read the book for was insight into the thoughts and reasoning of the characters, and I don't care what style of sword fighting Kenobi used to fool Dooku or how many back flips Skywalker did before he mowed someone down (for Lucas to say that he wasn't going to write a movie about Darth Vader going around and killing a lot of people, boy he sure comes close in this book - would it really have been a bad thing for Jar Jar to mysteriously join the Separatists and have Anakin mow him down? Really George, just for the fans?). I especially liked the contrast with how Obi-Wan delt with his attachments (by letting them pass) and how Anakin delt with them (but holding on tighter and tighter) as described in the character's thoughts. These were the things that I was interested in, and after I got past page 200, I could not put the book down until I was finished. If you have grown to care about these characters, this is a very sad and engaging story. I found myself continuing to hope that Anakin would choose a different path, and you could see how he could sense the truth at each point, but could not let go of his loyalty to Padme. The story concerning the treachery of the Sith and the Emperors gradual accumulation of power was masterfully done and I will enjoy rereading the book and seeing the movie to more closely follow the subplots."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First off, I would have given this 3.5 stars if it were an option.Stover does what he does best. He's king when it comes to characters. Anakin was tormented, but also the loving husband. Obi-Wan was the kind father figure. Palpatine was the devil in disguise. The friendship between Skywalker and Kenobi was well portrayed. But this is where my praise ends.I realize that the novel is not representative of the final cut of the movie. Stover's deadline was before Lucas's deadline, so some things just didn't make it into the novel. I don't know if I read it well enough, but aren't we missing scenes on Kashyyyk? I could have sworn I saw Wookiees in the trailer. I also found the action was somewhat lacking in the fight scene between Mace Windu and Palpatine. I hope that Lucas can rectify this in the final cut of the movie.The other problem I had was that I was spoiled by James Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil. That one got me primed and ready for Revenge of the Sith because Luceno is one of the best the EU has to offer. Stover disappointed me here. He might have worked for Traitor, but he was not the best choice for this novelization."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Woodring Stover has produced a veritable literary masterpiece in this most important episode of STAR WARS, EPISODE III Revenge of the Sith. Especially well done was the way in which Stover develops the political manoeuvering leading up to Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side of the Force at the hands of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (i.e. Darth Sidious) and birth as Darth Vader. The philosophical acumen and sophitistication which Stover brings into this central plot of the story, particularly in broaching the ambiguity between good (Jedi) and evil (Sith), makes for some illuminating \\"existential\\" reading of an almost Dostoyevskian or even Nietzchean kind. Very well done! I could not put it down.May the Force of the movie be as good as the novel."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"That was amazing! I just finished it, and I am practically screaming. I can't sleep.I am a huge Palpatine fan, and I was totally blown away by how well he orchrestrated everything. The beginning scene with him and Dooku is amazing as are his scenes with Anakin. The scene with him and Mace and the other jedi just totally blew me away.Anyways, amazing book. All Star Wars fans should buy it. I can hardly wait for May 19."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I bought this book as a way of overcoming the anticipation. After reading it, I hope to not be disappointed by the movie. Yes, I know, that sounds dumb considering the author dogged Mr. Lucas for details as to character development and story. However, slight changes in detail, and deep character development, will make the book and movie provide their own way of going from point A to Z. For example, in the scene where Palpatine discusses secrets of the force to Anakin, the book version describes them as sitting during this discussion. The trailer shows them as leaning against a railing. This difference may not seem major, but look at the old saying. On another point, Darth Vader seems to be a tyrant for tyranical reasons in episodes IV, V, and VI. But Mr. Stover provides excellent narration and a deeper view of the tortured spirit.The narrative asides add to the reasons why the characters behave the way they do, and bonds they forge within their environment. I hope to see all of it portrayed accurately by the actors. Any reader who enjoys poetry in narration will find the end bittersweet but inevitable. It provided me with a new perspective on the man behind the mask.A worthwhile read for anyone interested in character development."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Star Wars Episode III is one of the best stories I have ever read. Finally we know what really happened to Anakin Skywalker.Matthew Stover captures everything about the story to its fullest. I recommend this book to anyone who is a Star Wars fan and to anyone period. Everything is where it should be from the end of the clone Wars to the fall of Anakin Skywalker."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I polished off this novel in a day and a half. I considered holding off until after May 19th, but the temptation became too much for me.Was the movie ruined because I made this decision? The answer to that is a resounding NO. If anything, I am even more excited about seeing this on film now. Granted, some of the areas seen in the trailers, such as the Wookiees and Kashyyyk are barely a flash in the pan of the overall story, and this is how it should be. This story is about Obi-Wan and Anakin, love and darkness. And that's where Stover shines. As mentioned in an eariler review, you can tell Mr. Stover has a great affection for Mace Windu, and he actually makes you feel the pain when the Korun Master becomes one with the Force(not a spoiler. Search your feelings, you know it to be true...). The battles are animated, and well written, as are the 'cut scenes' which drill into the feelings of characters at points in the story.Overall, I would heartily recommend this book to any Star Wars fan. And for those of you that may believe that the Prequel Trilogy is a bunch of bunk, you may just be surprised come May 19th. A warning though, if you have children under the age of 7 or so that you plan to take to see the movie...after reading the novelization I would recommend a solo trip first, to evaluate whether or not the action may be a bit too...intense for your child.Oh, and for the negative reviewers who are rating the book a one star just cause you think Lucas has 'lost his edge', or because of no Chewbacca...grow up. Chewie has three movies of his own to shine in. He's a guest star in the movie simply as a bridge between the trilogies and to satisfy all you slathering fanboys. He has no part in the book because that was a part of the story that didn't need to be told to advance the story arc."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I read this book before I saw the movie. I am glad that I did. This book adds to the movie experience. The book follows the movie very closely and there are a lot of things that were not in the movie that the book adds in quite well. The reader gains a fuller understanding of the tensions and conflict that arise between Anakin and Padme throughout the story that the movie was not able to portray. The book also expands on some of the dealings with General Grievous and Count Dooku. This book is a definite read for any Star Wars fan, whether or not you read, it adds so much to the movie experience."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Given that this novelization is based on the original screen play for Episode III, it's hard to believe it came off so well. Episode III, while being a flashy movie with very good acting--except for Anakin Skywalker--the dialog was... well... bad. In the movie, the villains, save for Palpatine who was portrayed brilliantly, seemed rather weak and pointless--Dooku and Grievous, anyone?Well, the novelization is totally different. I should have expected as much from Stover, he has never let me down in any of his novels, both Star Wars and his own. In addition to Stover's excellent writing style--he really is a master at this kind of story--the scenes in this novel flow together perfectly. There's a brilliantly written introduction at the beginning before the first battle that just sets the tone for the entire novel and foreshadows what will come. I love how the thoughts of the characters were fleshed out, both Jedi and Sith, and the passages where he explains how some of the characters are feeling are some of the best in the book.In this novel, the villains don't seem weak at all. Grievous is a total bad a** in this book, you finally see why so many people fear him. He is heartless evil made into a physical manifestation of flesh and droid, in some ways he's even more evil than Darth Vader ever was--once you read this, you'll know exactly why I say that. Dooku, while still dying too quickly--Stover didn't really have a choice in this--is fleshed out much more and seems a much more believable character. There's a scene in this novel that should have been left in the movie that shows Dooku and Sidious--aka Palpatine--talking about their eventual plan, and there's a moment of revelation for Dooku, just before his death, that Palpatine has just been using him that just hits you like a slap in the face.In addition to much more believable villains, the dialog is so much better. I'm not sure if Stover basically rewrote the dialog or if this was the way the original screen play was written, but it's just much better. Lucas, take a hint from Stover when it comes to dialog, okay? Grievous actually talks and has some great lines especially between himself and the Neimoidian Viceroy--no, Grievous doesn't cough, and even Mace Windu's dialog is done well. Heck, I could even read the Anakin/Padme scenes without cringing too badly.If you like the movie, pick this one up. If you didn't like the movie... definitely give this one a read, it will surprise you how much more enjoyable the story is. And after you've read this, do yourself a favor and go pick up one of Stover's other novels, they're even better than this one."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is a great novelization of the third star wars movie, focusing mainly on Obi-wan and Anakin.I feel it describes everything in the movie perfectly, this book helps you understand exactly what the characters feel. When I first saw Episode III, I felt it skipped some things that obviously needed to be put into it or went too fast in certain scenes. Matthew Stovers masterpiece adds some extra dialogue that needed to be put in the movie, like a conversation between Darth Sidious and Count Dooku.The main characters this focuses on are Obi-wan, Anakin, Mace Windu, Padme, and Yoda. Although these are the main characters, Skywalker and Kenobi are mainly in the spotlight. So if you are a big Yoda fan and you loved the scene where he is on Kashyyk you are warned that this is not in this book.Well I should say that the spotlight characters are Padme, Anakin and Obi-wan. You see this includes some conversations between Bail Oragana about going against Palpatine that is not in the movie.I have found that when reading the book of a movie it is easier to see causes and effects, the same goes for this novel. You can see Anakin slipping into the dark side much more effectively, than in the movie. It talks about how afraid he is of loosing his loved ones more than, I feel, in the movie. It also puts more into the chancellor and Anakin&egrave;s talks and how Palpatine is turning him against the jedi.This a great book but a few things irked me, such as when Stover comes out and says This is how it feels to be so and so. He could have been a little more subtle with that.So it is time for the pros and consProsExcellent writinggreat descriptionsCause and effect comes through expertlyConsleaves out things with Yoda being on Kashyykcomes out and says thingsI hope you enjoy this if you end up reading it, it will not let you down."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I loved the movie. As Film Historian Father Gene Philips would say, \\"Lucas got it right.\\" The movie is filled with symbolism and philosophical content it takes multiple viewing to grasp it all. However, the novelization ruins it. If you do not understand what Lucas is doing, then read this. Stover spills all the beans, and does it in a bad way.A major flaw is the book's style. Stover is not a good writer. I would be mad to see his book as a bestseller and William Faulkner's short stories in the bargain bin. First of all, he is too wordy. He goes on forever to describe a scene. For example, when Anakin kills Dooku, he uses a page to describe, and ruin, Dooku's betrayal. A good writer would use half, or less, than that. He has sentences like, \\"this is how Anakin Skywalker feels right now,\\" and would give half-a-page of unnecessary information. He also uses ridiculous methaphors like Anakin's inner dragon.Another major flaw is Stover's target audience: It is written for the Expanded Universe fan's. I do not read the Expanded Universe, and there were several times I was trying to wonder what Stover is talking about. I do not know Mace Windu's fighting style or his home planet, nor care. Stover reminds the reader every other sentence. I was surprised to learn there were fighting styles. I find this to be uncessary since it has nothing to with the story. The only time it works is when Mace tells Obi-Wan why he was picked to destroy Griveous.Besides its flaws, there were some intresting parts, like Anakin giving Padmen his Padwan braid, and telling her to take care of Threepio. Scenes like these make it a worth read; however, Stoover's writing style gets in the way.This book is a waste of time and money. The film is filled with symbolism and philosophical conent, and this book ruins it. Buy this book if you do not understand what Lucas is doing. Another reason to buy it is so one can be a better writer."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"4 aspect I will judge this story by, Story, Worldbuilding, Characterization and Emotional response.Story: 3 starsCharacterization:1 starWorldbuilding:3 starsEmotional response: 1 starsAdded note:I thought the book was actually weaker than the film, which as far as the prequel trilogy goes, was a first. This is partially due to Stover's irritating and rather immature style, he seems to cater to young adults in this book ( I wonder what his own, non-Starwars books are like) and partially because the movie was sublime and the best of all 6 Star Wars films."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This Is a very good book except for some missing parts.

It was dreadful, and I'm a big Star Wars fan. The writing style was bad, but I could get passed that. Sadly, that was not the worst part.Characters. I can barely recognize the movie characters, as they're written so differently than the way they were portrayed in the movie.Dialog. Okay, one of the things I like best about the book versions of a movie is the added dialog. It compliments the existing dialog from film. This book rewrites the movie dialog. Seriously, there's barely a phrase from the movie that was the same as the book. It felt like a totally different story.The story. As above, things happen in the book that I know happened in a very different way in the book. For instance, the Jedi starfighters entering the landing bay of Grievous' ship, or the way Anakin cuts off Dooku's hands. In the book, he cuts one off, then cuts the other off. In the movie, both at the same time.This is not an attempt to be nit-picky. Simply put, if you're doing a book about a movie, try to make it actually like the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is by far the worst adaption of all the star wars movies. What was Lucas thinking? I could not stand his \\"Roadrunner vs. Wile E. Coyote\\" style of describing characters as they appeared in the novel. Just like the RR vs. WEC cartoons, the book opens in the middle of the action, then stops while he explains the back grounds of the characters involved in each scene as they appear, then restarts the action, then stops as new characters appear. Just horrible, IMHO. Perhaps people like his style, I don't know, I know that I don't. And the stuff about the dragon eating away at Anakin, it got very old, even though I let the dragon thing pass (hey, they're in a completely different galaxy and time, what are the odds on them coming up with dragons, too?). What really got to me, though, and just shows how sloppy this author is, was when he described Padme as the \\"youngest queen ever ...\\". In both the movie itself and the novelization of EP II, Padme insisted that she WASN'T the \\"youngest\\". What also drove me nuts was this author's incessent talk about fighting styles. I mean, does it really matter to nuance the point? There was the same old Jedi fighting style in the movie, so you'd never tell that there were any differences between the styles, so why nuance over such a petty thing, then read the back cover and the author is supposedly a master of \\"several marshall arts\\", so now I know why he nuances it, its to show off that he can do several fighting styles, big freakin' whooooop! My final point is that the author's nuancing and stopping the action and actually dragging out the fight scene with Obi-Wan, Anakin and Dooku so long (don't get me wrong, it should be more in depth and longer than the movie scene, but he went ridiculous) that it took 1/3 of the book to go from the opening scenes to the final landing of the ship on Coruscant with Palpatine, Anakin and Obi safe. That only took 30 minutes on the screen! After this, the rest of the book did keep moving at a decent pace, except for his typical stop to provide background info.Avoid the book, IMHO, just see the movie, even though the fight scene at the beginning is much shorter than the one in the novelization, the fight scene in the movie is MUCH more believeable, IMHO. He just nuanced the whole fight scene into an unbelieveability. The final fight between Obi and Annie, however, was far better written, since he let it flow and did not try to nuance it death."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Books are supposed to have more than the movie.well thats not the case here.The writer never mentions chewbacca or anything about the wookie battle on their homeworld.Anyone who has seen the movie has seen this in the movie.If the book is supposed to be about the movie don't leave parts out from the movie.he also writes to much about the space battle at the start of the movie and doesnt go into enough detail on other things.They couldn't hire a better writer than this guy?Is it that hard to write about everything in the movie?Most movie books write about everything in the movie and then some.LUCAS SHOULD HAVE HIRED ALAN DEAN FOSTER THE ORIGINAL WRITER OF STAR WARS EPISODE IV.ALAN WROTE about the whole movie and a lot more not included in the movie.Thats why people liked brian daley or alan dean foster star wars books.they included more than the movie.but this writer falls way short."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is the first movie adaptation novel I've ever read that is so much worse than the film itself. Who the heck is this guy? He's terrible. Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore both did a good job making enjoyable novels out of boring, poorly acted movies (episodes 1 and 2), yet you screw up the only watchable movie of the last three?AVOID"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is about Anakin takin that final slide to the dark side, but it seems so straight forward for a Star Wars book. The authors style is the worst that I have personally ever seen, and I really didn't enjoy the book that I read in five hours, I would've rather read a Jedi Quest book. Mr. Stover used stupid little phrases like 'This is what its like to be Anaking Skywalker' to start entire chapters that centered on only the characters feelings, doing nothing to move the story along. His approach to everything was much too straight forward and the action was descrived horribly"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Star Wars Revenge of the Sith book has it's good and bad points. First off the good points: I really liked how the author gave us background stories on some of the major characters and told us what it was like to be Anakin Skywalker during the different times of his life. I got to learn things about characters like Count Dooku and others that I had no idea about and it made the character stronger and better.The parts I did not like are that the author did not have the battle of Kashyyk at all. He only mentions that Yoda goes to this planet and then later gets picked up. He at no time mentions any of the whookies or Chewbaaca. This made me very upset because I was looking forward to it during the whole time I was reading the book. I don't care what reason he had for leaving it out it was not a good reason and truly ruined it for me. I also did not like the authors lack of vocabulary. Every thing made out of metal was \\"durasteel\\" or \\"armaplast\\" I got so sick of him using those words I literally skipped over them every time it would come up. The hull of a ship, Anakins arm. General Grievous, EVERYTHING is made of durasteel according to this author. I also did not like his attempt to describe action aristiacally, it came across as annoying and I kept thinking to myself just describe the action and don't try to put \\"flare\\" into it.Of course I am just one reviewer and this is just my opinion, but reading the book did not make me eager to see the movie. I love Star Wars and I am sure I will love Revenge of the Sith but the book to me was poorly written, too short, and lacked a critical part on the planet of kashyyk."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"There are many people out there who do't like this book. Well, I thought the book was excellent. Some readers can think that the book rambles on, but if you actually know the Star Wars universe well, it is actually very interesting. Check the forms and styles of lightsaber fighting for example. They are described very well in the book, and the way that it has been written into the fast and furious battle scenes is excellent.I quite like the parts where Stover writes \\" this is Anakin Skywalker....\\"This style of writing is really very informative and can give you a good understanding of the feelings of the character.Overall this book is excellent, Stover has written an excellent novel that explains the Star Wars III plot. The way he integrates his other novel \\"Shatterpoint\\" is also good.Definetly five stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Modest Spoilers herein, so read at your own risk.By far this is the best of the prequels. It's probably much more in-line with Lucas' original vision whereas the previous two films could be argued to have been \\"filler\\" to turn his meager backstory into a full-blown trilogy. I found the sequences with General Grevious to be a distraction from what I was most interested in reading, namely Anakin's fall. But, Lucas always has to include an episode-specific villian, and this time it's General Grevious. It also makes for a convenient way of getting Obi-Wan away from Coruscant so that Palpatine can work on the corruption of Skywalker. Noticeably absent from the book is any of the Wookie action on Kashyyk that is shown in the movie trailer. Yoda is dispatched to Kashyyk, so there is an allusion to what's taking place there, but no specifics. Bail Organa arrives at Kashyyk just in time to find Yoda evacutating the planet in an escape pod, but the reader really has no insight into what has occurred to bring this about."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I picked this book up, started reading, and found it almost impossible to put down. When reading it to kids -- forget it. They'll never let you stop (until you get to the end).All of the foreshadowing in \\"Episode II: Attack of the Clones\\" is resolved in \\"Episode III: Revenge of The Sith\\". Those who suspected the worst about 'Chancellor Palpatine' will not be disappointed. The intrigues and treachery that run through and around the narrative guarantee a great reading experience.This is, however, the story of Anakin Skywalker. In this novel, he is a classic hero -- but in a tragic sense. The Jedi training taught him to tap into great powers, but he could not use it to overcome his personal flaws. His trust is exploited and betrayed by those whom he admires, and this shakes his confidence.When he what he truly values above all else is lost to Anakin, it's too much for him. He tosses wisdom and good judgement aside, believing that these have failed him and led to tragedy. Blinded by emotions which he has not mastered, and lacking the discipline of a Jedi master, Anakin steps into the Sith traps that have been carefully laid in his path, and embraces 'The Dark Side' of 'The Force'. In his rashness, he ends any chance to re-create the now-abolished Republic, and all hope of restoring peace. Instead, he ensures the rise of Imperial tyranny.The book is a political allegory, in addtion to being a tale of personal tragedy. The errors of others that lead to Anakin's sense of betrayal, and ultimate destruction of his humanity, are all Faustian bargains where the liberty of a Republic is willingly surrendered for the promise of security. After the exchanges, there are fewer liberties (and less security) for everyone. In the end, liberty and security are gone.The transformation of Anakin Skywalker, from a young human being led by his ideals, to Darth Vader, the cyborg directed by a malevolent Sith lord, mirrors the transformation of a free republic into a tyrannical empire. THe republic, like Skywalker, was guided by ideals. THe Empire, like vader, is directed through fear and the threat of violence.For the details, it's best to read the book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I frequently listen to audiobooks on my iPod while headed to work, school or performing household chores. Audiobooks provide a huge opportunity to multitask and improve ones productivity and learning. Episode III marks the first time that I have just layed down on the couch and devoted my time entirely to an audiobook. This is just too good for multitasking.I picked ep III up primarily because I'm jonesing for the movie pretty hard. I've never gotten into star wars novels before this partially because I'm afraid I will become addicted and this book largely confirms that fear. I would also recommend the clone wars cartoons as a way to prepare yourself for this book. You don't have to and I don't think it will lose much but the cartoons are cool in their own way and explain how Anakin has faced the sith before. Also don't even bother with the abridged version even though it's cheaper.This book brings out depth, history, and endearing minutae in ways simply impossible for a film. You get to see inside of characters and in particular see the memories that they are reliving. This book manages to bring character and feeling to Anakin Skywalker when Hayden Christiansen makes the same character comical.This book contains a lot of interesting little tidbits that you probably won't see in the movie. For instance, a scene when C3PO is trying to decide if he should alert Amidala's guards when Obi-wan comes to visit. I particularly enjoyed the glimpse inside of Count Dooku's motivations that turned him from a cookie-cutter badguy into a dynamic, interesting character. The same is true for Mace Windu, as we get a glimpse into the lightsaber form that he invented as well as some of his less spectacular yet equally amazing ability to percieve \\"shatterpoints\\" in the force. We get to see obi-wans heartwarming relationship with the dragon-mount Boga, Palpatines vicious political manipulation and most of all Anakins truly tortured existence.I must admit that it's a bit cheesey at times, but those old cliches are what makes starwars fun. Revel in them.While I haven't seen the movie (it isn't out yet), it seems like there is something missing from the book. I've been trying to get my hands on any episode three material available, apparently there are some significant wookie characters in the third movie, yet they are nowhere to be found in the book beyond a mention that yoda is headed to Kashyyyk, (their homeworld).Also the balance of the book seems to be a little off. There is a LOT of time spent on the starfight at the beginning, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just seems that other events seemly just as complex if not more so, unfold without the same attention to detail. I think that aspect alone reduces this book from brilliant to merely good.Here's a good example of that, The battle with dooku is AMAZING, stover manages to catch the intricacies of footwork, lightsaber styles and characterization perfectly. Yet the battle between yoda and sidious gives the reader (listener in my case) nearly no clue what's going on because it takes up sooo little space. I'm guessing that stover had to finish the book on a deadline and couldn't devote equal amounts of attention to the end. I think this will probably agravate some people.One last thing, there is no mistaking that George Lucas is looking at current events. This book is extremely political."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I used to hate Mr. Lucas. When Ep 1 came out, I was pulling my hair out. When Ep 2 came out, I was almost as angry. After reading Ep 3 and then going back and watching those movies again, I have to say that it makes these two movies sooooo much better. I now only have 2 complaints about Ep 1 and 2: Jar Jar Binks and stilted love dialogue between Anikan and Padme. Ep 3 doesn't improve on those any. However, when we hear little Annie in Ep 1 talk to his mom after reading Ep 3, we realize that even at this young, innocent age he was already on the dark path to destruction. Those lines were written that way for a reason. Now we didn't need dancing Greedo, but everything Annie did makes sense now: from crying over his mother to his improbable destruction of the Federation capitol ship. Also, Qui-Gonn Jin's outlook makes sooooo much more sense now. Living Force? What the heck are you talking about? Well, we learn, and it both makes sense and fills other holes in Ep 4, 5, & 6.To be sure, I can see places in the book that will probably seem very stupid in the movie, given how Annikan acted in Ep 2. I'm not sure if Hayden's delivery will be goo or good, but past experience says goo. On the other hand, the extensive content of story should be enough to overshadow bad acting by said personalities.This book is the early (1,2,3) trilogy's salvation, and only makes the latter trilogy better."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"How do you take a character that you KNOW will become one of the most evil of the galaxy, and make his transformation something that people will not only understand, but become emotionally involved in? Stover does this job admirably and writes a book that takes Lucas' fantastic story and wraps up the loose ends and ties them into a big bow. While Anakin Skywalker might not be the most sympathetic character in all of the Star Wars stories, the manipulation of him by all involved, and his emotional confusion over what is right for him, versus what is right for others, made this book almost painful to read. You know what is going to happen in the end, but you still wish that it wasn't so. You go in thinking that it will be one staggeringly crystal clear incident that drives everything to the final outcome, only to find out that the progress has been made slowly and steadily all along. It drives the suspense along and makes it a hard book to put down. What starts out as the comradery we expect from Obi-Wan and Anakin, and continues in the increasingly downward spiral keeps you engrossed in every page.The battle scenes are described in such great detail, you can visualize each move. However, they are not such that if feels like it goes on forever. And many battles there are! New or vaguely familiar characters are given much more story time. Histories are examined and so much becomes clearer and clearer with every chapter.This book is a must for any Star Wars fan with any attachment to the franchise. While many dissed the previous chapter(s), there is no question that the story stays true to itself and is not allowed to vear off in directions that might be more popular."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I just finished reading this book today and thought that it was very good. There's been a lot of talk as to the Prequel trilogy not living up to the standards of that of the Original trilogy and if people feel that way, that's on them. However, what we all need to realize is that this is ultimately George Lucas' story and his vision for what he's created. His films don't need to be defended nor his imagination. I truly enjoyed reading the novelization by Matthew Stover as it has given unto me a greater respect for the characters who encompass this particular episode. I tip my hat to you, Sir. Now, all that's needed is to view the movie which hits theaters May 19th, which I'm sure will be visually stunning, highly emotional and disturbingly dark."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"One would not envy Stover's task when writing this book. Such a book has to be suspenseful, and how do you manage this when everyone knows the final outcome of the book, and have known it for 28 years. How do you write a book that is 30 years in the making. Yet somehow, Stover did.The way Stover makes the lightsaber duels come alive. The way he lets you in on each character's thought; how each character involved in this passion play felt in being involved in circumstances beyond their control. The way he expressed the inner turmoil that Anakin felt each step of the way towards his eventual destiny of becoming Darth Vader. The way he kept you in suspense, even if you knew who all would live and who all would die by the end of the novel. Finally, the way he managed to cover most of the unanswered questions regarding how those characters involved in Episode IV (A New Hope) were seemingly unaware of the vastness of the situation that occurred when the Empire was established.If you have ever been a fan of the Star Wars saga, you need this book today."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have read other Matthew Stover books. I have generally been disappointed with the writing style (creative, but too rambling and disorganized). However, there is no denying that when you're done, you've read a great, imaginative storyline with lots of character development and thought.This novelization of the last Star Wars movie is not just a good story; it is excellent writing. It provides behind-the-scenes information about character backgrounds and thoughts that I can't imagine being completely evident in the movie. This is the first time that the movie novelization of a Star Wars movie may be significantly better than the movie itself in its storytelling. I can't imagine the saga being complete without also reading this book.Note: I have not yet seen the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I just got this book the other day and read it within twenty four hours. I'm not much on movie tie-in books, but Star Wars is a little different, especially when it covers this crucial period in the Star Wars universe. What a dark and grisly tale. There's no cutesy creatures in this one, only a sense of increasing dread and impending doom.I read Stover's Shatterpoint, which focused on Mace Windu, and one of the things I appreciated was how he writes how the Jedi mind operates when taking care of \\"Jedi business\\". The confrontation between Windu and Palpatine especially shows this as well as Obi-Wan's battle with Greivous. This is something that the movies really cannot detail, and this makes the book all the more worth reading.But what really got me about this book that we get to see how clever Palpatine really is, how he seems to justify his own evil deeds, and how he was able to turn Anakin over to the darkside by using something that almost resembles common sense. Also, even after Anakin/Vader commit the most horrible atrocties, I had more than a shade of pity for the guy. It would appear that Anakin never really had a chance, all the cards were stacked against him from the beginning.So if you want to spoil yourself silly, and enjoy a quick and easy read, buy this book. If the movie can turn out as well as the book, we might very well have the best Star Wars movie ever. My only wonder is if Lucas has the guts to portray the violence that plays through this book onto the screen."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover did an outstanding job on writing this book. If your imagination is big, this is better than the movie. Goes into much better detail than the movie. One thing I did not like though was Order 66. I think Stover should have included much more when writing that part. Other than that, the book was funny, serious, sad, and a love book. This really explains how Anakin became Darth Vader. Great book!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I loved the movie, and I was one of those people who read all the other clone wars books and wasn't convinced that I needed to read this since I've seen the movie a bunch of times. I was totally wrong. The book answers so many of the questions and doubts I had about the movie's storyline. It really is very well done in every way. I can't say enough about how much better of a job they did bridging the gap between episodes III and IV. I highly recommend every Star Wars fan read this."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I absolutely loved this cd. I've listened to it at least 3 times and various parts of it countless times. I enjoyed the many voices used, the music, and of course the many sound effects of light sabers striking, planes flying, and etc. But, I think my favorite parts are when the narrator says, \\"this is how it feels to be\\"....and he names the character. I had read rots, but hearing the words were so much more powerful. There is a moment in the cd where Mace learns from Anakin that Palpatine is Sidious. And, upon hearing those words, the narrator states, \\"this is how it feels to be Mace Windu, Mace Windu also has an attachment,\\".....As I listened to it, I thought oh my gosh. But then Mace Windu comes through it so cool, that he never changes his expression. There is also humor. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the things said by Yoda and Obi Wan, mainly because they were said when these guys were in the toughest situation. The cd does start out upbeat, but as it progresses, it quickly goes darker and sad. At the end, when the narrator says, this is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker....each injury is described and how it makes Anakin feel. This part was particulary sad for me. In honesty, I shedded a couple of tears. At the end of it you realize that Anakin is doomed. Anakin wanted everything, but now he has nothing. He's lost everything, including most of himself. There was no turning back for him. There was nowhere he could go."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Do you like science fiction? If you do this book will be great for you. Star Wars Episode III is a good book if you like action, space battles, wars and saber duels. It was written by Patricia C. Wrede. This book is based on the story and screen play by George Lucas.The main characters are Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padme, Chancellor Palpatine, and Mace Windu. The story takes place at the end of the clone wars. The chancellor is secretly a sith lord. He loves power and wants to take control of the republic to make it the first galactic Empire! Anakin the student of Obi-Wan, is secretly married to Padme. He is also a friend of Palpatine. Anakin has become a very powerful jedi Knight. Anakin has visions of losing Padme. He becomes afraid of losing padme. The Chancellor uses Anakin's fear to turn him to the dark side of the force. Mace Windu, the leader of the Jedi council, has a fierce battle with the sith. As he is about to eliminate the Sith, Anakin slices off Mace's hand. Then the Chancellor kills Mace with a lightning attack. After this Anakin turns fully to the dark side and is called Darth Vader.I like the book because it has a lot of action. I mostly like wars, duels or space battles. Mainly I loved the book. My favorite duel was when Anakin and Obi-Wan fight each other. I recommend this book to action and fighting and shooting lovers because there is lots of that in this book. You could see the movie but read the book first because there were parts left out of the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"It was a great book exactly like the movie.You should read it.It has a lot of excitement and action.I loved the book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I like this book as a companion to the movie. You are given much more information as to what the characters are feeling and perceiving.He goes into great detail in the action scenes. And the romantic scenes between Padme & Anakin are nice too."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Having read all six of the movie-based Star Wars novels, I feel Revenge of the Sith is the strongest offering. By now everyone knows the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader. In fact, the odds are if you're reading this review you've also already seen the movie. So we'll stick to the basics.Author Matthew Stover does a solid job of keeping the novelization close to the movie. It's clear from some key plot points and dialogue that he was working from an early script draft and not the finished product that we see on film. That's a good thing because it allows people to enjoy a new take on Sith even if they've seen the movie multiple times.The key difference is that the novel stays close to the key combatants of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin. We are given plenty of insight into their thoughts, motivations, and fighting styles. The novel makes it painfully clear what drives Anakin to the dark side of the force. If you're looking for a retread of the movie you may be disappointed though as key moments like the destruction of various Jedi, the battle of Kashyyk, and the duel between Yoda and Sidious are glossed over to allow a more in depth look at Kenobi and Skywalker.Still, this is a strong novel with a good writer driving it. Star Wars and sci-fi fans will love it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"As with any book based on its far more popular movie incarnation, readers tend to expect the book to trace the movie's plotlines, deviating little from beginning to end. This book however is different.Though the book traces the same plotlines, it reveals far more important backgrounds of each character such as how Dukoo became Sidious' apprentice, how General Grievous earned his \\"Jedi Killer\\" reputation and even how Obi-wan's lightsaber fighting style became the perfect foil for Grievous.Also given extensive treatment in the book are major plot points which should have been further developed in the movie such as the seduction of Anakin Skywalker, the identity of Darth Plagueis' apprentice, Padme's involvement in the attempt to curtail Palpatine's power and the reason Yoda left the final battle with Palpatine.All in all, the book fills all the gaps in the movie's plot lines to the point that I could even say that the movie was based on the book. A well spun dark tale indeed by Matthew Stover."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Hoping to avoid as much advance knowledge regarding the release of the last \\"Star Wars\\" movie ever to keep the experience as new and as fresh as possible, I purposely avoided Internet gossip/rumor and any other possible bit of plot revelation made available in advance of the movie's release, including this novelization. As I've made a tradition of following the novels ever since the first movie's debut almost 30 years ago, this was no idle feat on my part.I don't regret that decision; I truly enjoyed watching \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" onscreen in the theatre and I came away feeling that it was as close to the perfection that was the original \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" movie back in 1977. It is, in my opinion, that good. As a film and a chapter within a series, it actually succeeds in making the films that came before it even better (no small feat considering my initial impressions of Episodes I & II).Except...the issues most frequently cited for affecting the complete enjoyment of the preceding Episodes I & II -atrocious dialogue, mainly- are still evident in the \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" film, as well. For the first time since \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", the story is interesting and original, the tension is unsurpassed, and the climax of the movie (and arguably the entire series) is fully satisfying. But listening to the dialogue that George Lucas has written for these characters still rivals the Labors of Hercules in terms of personal strain.Matthew Stover may not be as fine a sci-fi/fantasy craftsman of words as is Terry Brooks (the writer of the novelization for \\"The Phantom Menace\\", another book that exceeds the onscreen accomplishment of Lucas's effort), but he does know how to tell a story and he knows how to layer it with levels of insight that aren't to be inferred from viewing Lucas' motion picture. He knows how to expand upon the characters that George Lucas (to his shame) was incapable of further detailing onscreen and how to communicate the thoughts and words of the characters that Lucas has proven himself incapable of doing as a screenwriter since \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was released in 1999.The result is a story that works better as a work of literature than it does as a motion picture (at least the motion picture that was the final product). This is not so much a knock on \\"Episode III\\" as a film -I stick to my recommendation of it as being the 2nd-best movie in the entire series- but if you thought the movie was somehow short of the complete experience you were expecting and you can pinpoint the reason being George Lucas' overinvolvement in the creative process, you'll owe it to yourself to read this book to see how the story unfolds when it is relayed by a proper writer. If you liked the movie, I'm reasonably sure you'll love the book. If you loved the movie, prepare yourself for another level of appreciation altogether. Fans and non-fans alike, this is the story you should have seen onscreen in 2005."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"After seeing \\"Star Wars Episode III\\" at the theater, I was anxious to read the book, and, after finishing it, I was very glad I did. The book does a very good job of following the actual events of the film, and it flows along at a rapid and exciting pace.In summary, the events unfold like this. In the beginning, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are piloting their starfighters in battle against the Separatists in order to save Chancellor Palpatine, head of the Republic. Commanded by General Grievous and Count Dooku, the Separatists have placed Palpatine in a starship and are luring Skywalker and Kenobi towards them.Anakin and Palpatine have enjoyed a very close relationship since Anakin was a young boy. Now \\"The Chosen One\\", Anakin still seeks advice and guidance from Palpatine. However, many members of the Jedi Council fear that the relationship between Anakin and Palpatine may explode into something much worse than what it is.Anakin and Padme, married now for several years, are shocked and excited to find out that they are about to become parents. But, they also know that as long as Anakin is a Jedi, they will never be able to be together and raise their family. This knowledge places much strain on their relationship, and Anakin is troubled by nightmares of Padme dying in childbirth.As the book progresses, Anakin continues to slip more towards Palpatine and farther away from Obi-Wan and the Jedi council. Palpatine fills his head with many things, and Anakin finds himself believing everything he is told by Palpatine. The Jedi also find out that Palpatine is threatening to dissolve the Jedi council completely. The Chancellor finally reveals himself as Darth Sidious, leader of the Sith, and in turn influences Anakin about the dark side of the Force. Will Anakin be strong enough to resist Palpatine? Can the Jedi stop Palpatine before its too late? What will happen between Anakin and Padme?This is an excellent book. If you've already seen the movie, you'll find yourself remembering scenes from the film as you read. If you haven't seen the movie, this book will serve as a perfect introduction. Read this exciting chapter in the Star Wars series and experience Anakin's ultimate fall to the dark side."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I found Revenge of the Sith to be a very entertaining and well written book. It manages to captured the Star Wars Universe quite well and its characters. The plot immediately follows the Star Wars movie, Episode 2: The Clones War and the basic story was lifted from the script originated from George Lucas. This however take nothing away from the book which proves to be easy to read and fast pace.Of course, if you read this before you see the movie, the general plot of the Revenge of the Sith movie will be given away. However, if you are a true Star Wars fan like I am, I already knows the general plot of the third movie so it didn't harmed me at all. The book just go into more details than what any true fan already knows.I did find one major error with the continuity of the Star Wars saga. In Return of the Jedi (up in the trees with the Ewoks), when Luke asked Leia about her \\"real mother\\", Leia had vague memories of her, saying that she was beautiful and sad. But in the book and probably in the movie, Padme dies at childbirth. So how does Leia remembered her \\"real mother\\" in Return of the Jedi. Did someone dropped the ball here?Overall, this tome does the Star Wars series of books good justice. I would say that this is probably one of the better Star Wars books out there. For those who don't have clue about the plot, see the movie and read the book. For those already got the general understanding of the plot (true fans), reading the book or not is really up to you. Of course, not everything in the movie might be in the book. I read one previous reviewer talks about Wookies in the movie. There is no Wookies in the book. Overall, a good late night reading material, undemanding and a time killer (perfect for reading while traveling)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"INTRODUCTIONAs an AVID Star Wars fan since 1977, and as a voracious reader, I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. I preordered it on Amazon weeks ago. When it arrived, I sat down and dug in . . .Matthew Stover, the author, is truly accomplished with nearly a dozen books under his belt, including TWO previous Star Wars works. In spite of his experience as an author and dedication to the Star Wars saga, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith proves remarkably shallow through many of the VITAL events that DEFINE Episode III. This terribly unfortunate flaw torpedoes the book right at the MOST critical junctures in the story. Indeed, I put the book down feeling that it has been penned by a novice, as opposed to the venerable Mr. Stover.DISCUSSIONAs noted in other reviews, Stover unfortunately elected to throw -- or rather shove -- the vast amount of crucial Episode III events into the last 10-15% of the novel, spending comparatively too much time through the middle 75% of the work on much less interesting fare. While the beginning proves truly outstanding with superb imagery, great syntax, intoxicating detail; and while the middle is insightful, thought-provoking, and well-written (e.g., Stover's mastery of storytelling causes the reader to feel quite a bit of animosity TOWARDS the noble and reputable Jedi), these high points do little to make up for the poor, splotchy treatment that many of the pinnacle, highly anticipated events receive -- all being crammed into the last 10-15% of the book.For example, at the beginning of the novel, Stover spends a HUGE amount of time portraying step-by-step, nearly thought-by-thought, a moderately important lightsaber duel. That initial duel comes across as invigorating, intense, exciting, realistic, and quite enjoyable due to careful attention to detail and story-flow. Then, however, towards the end, Stover suddenly flies through two or three VITALLY important lightsaber duels without half the detail and effort he put into describing that first, much less significant lightsaber battle. This example of the deterioration of storytelling towards the end of the book is also applicable in both emotional and dramatic story parts as well.CONCLUSIONAll this is not to say that the first 85-90% of the novel, proved too long, for that portion of the novel contains some truly wonderful writing, stories, and insight. Indeed, the problem is that Stover seems to have \\"run out of gas\\" on the last, crucial leg, throwing-in the proverbial towel. If Stover would have put the type of passion, detail, art, and image into the defining final events of this novel, we may have seen a 700-800 page work, but it would have been a brilliant and satisfying 700-800 page work . . . worthy of the legend that Episode III has already become."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This official noveliztation of the last star wars movie is good.. as a science fiction/psychological thriller. To go deep into the characters and to have whole sections of the book dedicated to the inner workings of anakin/obi-wan/greivous/etc. is a good idea.. but it doesn't always work here. Maybe there are too many of these occurences, thereby diluting the effect. To me however, they just don't belong. Seeing as this is the last movie, the back story should have been more fleshed out, including adding depth to the deleted movie scenes.this is NOT a bad novelization, and it does have a lot of good points, i was just looking for more (who knows maybe i should have read it AFTER i saw the movie.. but that's another story :D)"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The novelization of the \\"Star War:Revenge of the Sith\\" by Matthew Stover is a great book. The book opens with a battle between the Separatists and the jedi masters Obi-Wan Kenobi Anikin Shywalker. The battle is won by the jedi's, but Anikin fears for the future and the life of his wife Padme Amidala. The dark side rising and the fate of the whole republic is at hand.This was a great book that makes me look foward to the movie. Its more darker than earlier movies, and that what makes it so great. The novelization was great. Can't wait for more."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is a brilliantly written book, perhaps the best written of the movie books. They really took the time to do it right and make it very high quality, with lots of important details and pefectly tieing in with all the other movies. It explains many things I had previously wondered about. The descriptions are totally real. I feel like I am actually there when I'm reading it. I couldn't stop reading til I was done. This is the saddest of all the six movie episodes by far. By the time you finish, there is nothing to cheer about, and many sad things to contemplate. Rather depressing, but a must-read nevertheless. However, I really disagree with the Star Wars philosophy that you have to be extremely moral, a saint, or else you're going to fall into a hellish life. I see nothing wrong with killing a defenseless villain, and I resent Star Wars and other fiction for making out that you're the devil if you do that."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The novel is a mixed bag. But it is a good novel, mostly well-written, and I recommend it. The only let down is a stupidly long opening, a lot of extraneous detail, and the omission of key information (you'll soon notice if you read it)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matt Stover has written a masterpiece to end the Star Wars saga. The book brilliant in all it's nuances. It gives us insight into all of the characters in ways that the movies cannot. Obi-Wan shines as a beacon of the light side and one, if not the greatest Jedi of them all. I can't wait to see it on the screen. The best of everthing that makes Star Wars great is in this Book! Read it and enjoy the Force!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Whether you liked the movie or not and are a Star Wars fan... Read this book! This is not an option, it is a command. I say again... If you are a Star Wars fan, READ THIS BOOK. I hated the movie (read my review for the DVD) but loved this book. I read it after I had seen the movie at the insistance of a friend. I have to say thank you Dwight and thank you Matthew. I really enjoyed the book and it breathed life into a dull and horrible movie. It almost seems as if George Lucas wrote a poor script from this book. Sadly it's probably not the case and Matthew Stover did a remarkable job with it!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I thought the reader for this book was very good. He did Palpatine's voice especially well. I also felt that the book filled in gaps about character motivations that there wasn't time to cover in the movie. I felt the book enriched my experience of the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Great book, gives so much more insight into characters, you get a better understanding as to why Anakin turns to the darkside.Good Read!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I thought the movie was pretty good, but the novel is even better. Stover has the most unique and interesting writing style I have ever read.First off, the thing that stood out the most from this book was how Anakin's turn to the Dark Side was better and more believable than the movie. In the book, the stress and not being appointed to the rank of master coupled with being sent to spy on the Chancellor wears Anakin down. All of these things are constantly chewing away at him untill the point at which he breaks.Secondly, as mentioned above, the writing style of this book really stood out and is what anyone who has read the NJO book 'Traitor'(by Matthew Stover) can expect. The way things are worded is very interseting.And Finally, another (small) thing that I was happy to see explained was why Yoda fled from Sidious.If you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the novel even better."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Yes.This review may encourage those who really wanted to enjoy the closing of an age of storytelling, in the form of Episode III on the big screen, more than they actually did.I read this book before seeing the movie. Upon seeing the film I found that the fullness of the novelization filled in many of the nooks and crannies left by some not-so-strong dialogue, some could-have-been-better acting, and the confines that a 2.5 hour movie is forced to work with. There is a depth to this book which I have not experienced in any Star Wars novelization before.This book does what movies often don't do well and that is explore the depths of thought, the inner workings of the mind and emotions, and paint a picture for your imagination to indulge in. Good actors can convey these ranges in a film, and there were good actors to be sure, but not such great acting from them (sorry). The author uses a very creative approach to placing you in a scene or into a moment; \\"This is Obi-Wan Kenobi right now:\\". He cuts loose and dives right into the characters to a degree the movie didn't achieve. As for the story itself, most of us knew it before hand or know it now. I wouldn't say it was surprising necessarily but it was handled with confidence, skill and reverence.If you are like me and had a lot of trouble understanding and feeling the fall of Anakin Skywalker as presented in the film, the book helps a great deal with that. In the film I found myself filling in the blanks. The fall of Anakin is the backbone of Star Wars after all and I didn't want to have to do that. I found a more believable fallen hero in Stovers pages. It was far more dramatic and sympathetic in the book, a real page turner. Stover starts the book by bringing readers as high as possible in the heroism and legend of Obi-Wan and Anakin so that the fall is that much more devastating.Pick it up and read it. The force is strong with Matthew Stover.Be well."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am forced to agree with the previous reviewers. This is the epitome of a good book, by far the best Star Wars novel my eyes have ever graced. Though most of the details have been revealed, I will give my honest opinon. Anakin Skywalker, The Chosen One, takes his final step towards becoming the most iconic sith and villian in history. This book could not gloat anymore about how powerful Anakin truly was. Even going as far as saying the he is the most powerful Jedi of any generation. A bold, but truthful statement I believe. This is a book devoted to True Star Wars fans, especially Anakin Skywalker lovers. It answers many questions that the movie does not, which was to the liking of many fans. It is truly a masterpiece. The Saber duels unmatched in any other book I ever read. The dialogue, much better than any other book I have read ( pertaining to Star Wars of course ). Much more exciting than its movie counterpart. Read, Read, Read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Script to screen there are bound to be differences, with a film of the scale of Star Wars Episode III., possibly more so. But, Lucas has such a clear vision of what he wants from the beginning of his projects that the book adaptations tend to differ very little from the film (as with the last two text installments). Matthew Stover's Revenge of the Sith thankfully does contain these subtle differences that make novelizations interesting to read, before or after you've see the film. The dialogue in the movie is at times brilliant and rewarding for fans (both old and new), other times painfully awkward (like the best example of the worst): \\"...she's loss the will to live\\" OH, PLEASE! We love Lucas like a great-Uncle, but a hard-headed great-Uncle. Stover's dialog can be more moving and comfortable than the screens, Anakin's return to Padme' following Palpatine's rescue, for example, is very different moment in this text. Another treat in the text is Stover's tie-ins to some of his previous Star Wars novels like Shatterpoint, which focuses on Windu, giving the author a unique perspective on the Jedi Master's thoughts and motivations. Definitely recommended summer reading, but much of the ship & saber-action contained in both, needs to be seen. So read it, then see it, or see it, then read it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is excellent and succeeds where the movie fails. I would see the movie before reading the book. Some excellent things about this book is the devolpment of the plot. The time between Anakin's reutrn to Coruscant after Palpatine's rescue and when he becomes Palaptine's apprentice is expanded and you see more reasons for Anakin's turn, which to me is the heart of the story. Padme is seen more (without Natalie Portman's bad acting) and has her own storyline, which I liked. She doesn't sit around all day and cry. You learn how she's dealing with everything going on around her. You learn she's as afraid of losing Anakin as he is of her. You see more of their relationship (again without Natalie Portman's bad acting and Lucas's cheesy dialogue)which I liked. Other cool things about it is Stover's ability to really bring out how the characters are thinking and feeling; something movies often fail to do.The book is awesome but it does have its flaws. Stover uses TOO MANY italics that are annoying after a while but they become unnoticeable later. Too much time is spent on Anakin and Obi-Wan rescuing Palpatine and not enough on Anakin's turn. By the time Mace Windu dies there's 100 pages left and you're like \\"Wait a minute, did I miss something?\\" The last fifteen mintues of the movie is summarized in a page or so and that can be a let down.I highly reccomend this book for any Star Wars fan, especially if you were disappointed with the movie or if you want more. This book defintely gives it to you."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"As Palpatine says, \\"I have been waiting a long time for this.\\" Philosophy, war, treachery, combat, betrayal, love, Sith and Jedi, what more could you ask for in a Star Wars book? This book was stunning from the first CD to the last. The battles were well described and the suspense was constant throughout the whole book. Anakin's fall was well understood and you could almost sympathize with him. The true star here is Palpatine however. When all is revealed the Jedi are left slapping their heads and screaming in frustration. As they say, Revenge is truly sweet. It was so refreshing to finally see the Jedi beaten, really savagely and definitely beaten. Every since the Thrawn trilogy book after book has always made the heroes invincible and the villains either completely stupid or too blind to their weaknesses. This book rectifies that and delivers with a punch. The scene where the \\"little green freak\\" gets it was worth the purchase price. I would have liked to see a bloodier outcome but I guess you have to soften the blow somewhat. Obi won comes across as some super Jedi but the emotional turmoil he feels takes it's toll on him. Grievus for all his vaunted power appears a little too weak for my taste although he does put up a good fight in the end. Anakin is true to form before and after and stars in one of the bloodiest scenes here. Count Dooku as always is elegantly evil although he realizes too late what he has been reduced to. Then there is Palpatine. What machinations, what skillful planning; he truly is the \\"Shadow\\" and a dark master. His seduction of Skywalker is brilliant and it seems that in nearly every scene he is lurking in the background making sure things go his way. Yes, for those pro Sith this book will satisfy your desire to see that order come on top for a change. It does end on a high note and sets the stage for Episode IV but as the book states, \\"The darkness is patient, and the darkness always wins.\\" This truly is the number one book for all SW fans. Nothing that has been published before comes close to the sheer action, intensity and storyline of this book. Highly recommended. This book contains 11 CDs and along with the reading there are sound effects and music to enhance the overall audio presentation. Enjoy, but be weary of the dragon inside."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is fantastic. Stover's writing stle is excellent. He kept the story moving, yet still managed to keep this abstract feeling with it. Most characters get their own \\"This is what it's like to be ______\\", which gives a lot of background and keeps the reader on his toes.If you love Star Wars, you'll love this. If you hate Star Wars, you'll love this.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I loved the film, \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\", but I think the novella for the film is even better.Usually, Star Wars books are light reading - something to do on a rainy day that doesn't stress your brain too much. Most of the books and novels that fall under the Star Wars franchise are of this sort; nothing spectacular.However, with \\"Revenge of the Sith\\", author Mathew Stover has delivered what I feel is the best Star Wars literature to date. This book goes a bit above and beyond the usual Star Wars fare. It's somewhat more philosophical and has some real solid depth that I found refreshing and rare. This author develops character depth where the films fail. If Obi Wan Kenobi, Padme Amidalla, and Anakin Skywalker seem one-dimensional and \\"cardboard\\" osncreen, they certainly do not here. The reader truly gets to wear these character's skins and walk a few miles in their shoes.This novella goes into more depth than does the film, and really lets fans get a feel, not just a glimpse, of the true powers of the Jedi Knights. The book also goes into Sith legend on a deeper note and that's the sort of detail that I wish all three Prequel films would have contained.I assume George Lucas steered the films from being too \\"historical\\" in tone, thinking that would bore audiences, but I disagree. I think the Star Wars diehards demand that level of detail in the backstory and with Mathew Stover's wonderful novella, they get some satisfaction.Personally, I want to know more about the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise. Chancellor Palpatine tells Anakin that his former master could use the Force to create life. Is it possible that Darth Plagueis used the Force to give birth to the Chosen One? The films never answer where and how Anakin was fathered.But all fans must read this great great novella by Mathew Stover: the single best-written Star Wars book to date and heads-&-shoulders above the rest in quality."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Overall I really liked this book, since it goes into greater detail about some things only touched-upon briefly or not at all in the movie, but at some points the author's style became, at least for me, a little bit irritating.Some things I enjoyed about this book were the explanations of the way Jedis are supposed to think, and their basic philosophy on life and friendship (as in, Jedi can be friends but they mustn't hesitate to kill everyone they care about if it will result in peace, and they also aren't allowed to ever get married). I also enjoyed getting more info about the way the Sith think (there are only ever two sith alive at any one time -- the master and one apprentice, and they let their passion and inward, selfish thoughts govern their actions).This book also draws out and makes sense of certain scenes in the movie that are a bit confusing for the uninitiated. Count Dooku's duel with Annekin and the reasons for their duel are well-explained.What a really didn't like very much about this book were the author's somewhat obvious attempts to add artistic flourishes to the book. His writing gets a bit flowery here and there, like he's trying to write classic literature in a F. Scott Fitzgerald sense instead of a contemporary action-drama. Also, sometimes his \\"This is what it feels like to be [insert character] right now...\\" gets annoying, like he thinks he's a better author than he really is and he's giving you some sensual, vicarious experience.The few negatives hardly vitiate the many positives, among which the \\"turning\\" of Annekin by Palpatine is a well-written portion of the book. I also like the fact that Annekin actually acknowledges that Palpatine looks like a freak after his fight with Mace Windu, instead of the movie where Annekin never takes Palpatine aside and says \\"hey, I wasn't going to say anything, but what the heck happened to your face?\\"I recommend this book, but I can't help but think that it could have been even better if a different author were chosen to adapt the screenplay. The story would have been basically the same, but maybe the different author would dump some of the pseudo-artistic literary flourishes that add a flat taste to some portions of the text."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"To go and start throwing mud at the author because as someone put it, \\"he thinks he's a better writer than he is\\" is just stupid. You like the style he's giving you or you dont. Anyway... I loved the deeper plot and the descriptive angles the author takes. Fights are more than fights in the book. The lightsaber fighting between Dooku, Obi and Anakin is handled quite well. We learn more about the deception they use on the Count through different sword styles. Descriptions of the space battles are easy to follow and quite fun.The real reason I like this book so much is the fact that it's a book. Taking the story and giving us the reader a full blow account of the details in the plot. Something like this is very difficult to pull of in film and it's why films rarely sing on the screen in comparison.Worth the read and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Revenge of the Sith brings about the end of a saga that has occupied the mind of George Lucas for over 30 years. This novelization of the movie by Matthew Stover tries to bring together all the strands of plot from the prequel and make them into a symbiotic whole with the the second trilogy. While it succeeds more admirably than its sister episode, Return of the Jedi, this book is still an average affair at best, that will probably be a better movie than a read.As Revenge of the Sith opens, the Seperatists have launched a daring raid on Coruscant, capturing Chancellor Palpatine. What ensues is a fierce battle in space that rapidly becomes a winner-take-all proposition between the Republic and its rebels. Obi-Wan and Anakin, returning from an off-planet mission take it upon themselves to rescue the captured champion of democracy. Even though Darth Sidious has orchestrated the whole dumbshow of an affair. But they will have to face Lord Dooku and the fearsome General Grievous, a cyborg whose body has been turned into a mechanical jedi killing machine, along with his bodyguards. Even if they win that battle, the Republic is still not safe. Anakin has been seeing horrible visions of the death of Padme, and these dreams will make him seek out knowledge, whether it be of the dark or light variety. Even as Anakin becomes closer to Palpatine, the Jedi Council grows ever more supicious of the Chancellor as he begins to take over more and more power from the democracy. And yes, we still have Darth Sidious looming out there somewhere, pulling the strings of everyone in a bid to become ruler of the galaxy.Well, I have to say, after reading the novel, this seems the best written episode since The Empire Strikes Back. At least the writer is TRYING to develop the characters a little more, even if they all seem a little shallow and ignorant. For example, after 10 years, the Jedi really haven't made any progress whatsoever in finding the Sith. They just seem so clueless. Anakin is still the whiny brat he's been since episode 1, but Stover does an admirable job at showing the conflicting loyalties he feels towards the Jedi Council and Palpatine, ALMOST. He also does a good job of showing the moral relativism of the dark side, meaning that in the Sith's eyes, there is not much difference in the ends between the Sith and the Jedi, simply the means used to arrive there. Even I found myself saying \\"that makes sense\\" about the dark side, \\"maybe it's not evil\\". But therein lies the seduction of it. The book focuses mainly on Obi-wan, Anakin, and Palpatine, with all the other characters, including Padme, taking minor roles. If you can't wait for the movie, I would recommend reading the book, but don't be prepared for excellence. If the Star Wars name wasn't on this book, it would probably be a one or two star review. For example, the opening space battle chews up around the first 130 pages of the book. In a regular sci-fi book a similar battle would take around 30 pages at the most. It is a glaring example of how 30 minutes of film can become a leviathan of description in print. Also, all of the characters are in such denial and are so full of stupidity that you're almost glad when the Republic falls. It's almost as if Darth Sidious is the most admirable character because he's the only one with a lick of intelligence."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT!Annakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vadar! oh yeah, everyone already knew that.my only disappointment with this book; no scenes on the wookie homeworld. it's my understanding it is shown and featured in the movie, yet nothing in these pages other than \\"yep, Yoda went there and escaped thanks to Bail Organa.\\"still, this is a fine read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and have been eagerly been awaiting its finale. So when the book came out I instantly got it from the library. I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. Not in the book, mind you, but the author.When I read the novels for the first two movies I learned things they don't tell you in the actual movie, got to know the characters better, and had a great time reading the book itself.With this novel I got no such pleasure. Though I just saw the movie and absolutely loved it, the author of this book drove me insane. He would constantly pause in the middle of different scenes so he can describe his characters and give you a breif look into their history. In any book this is nice, but these breif interludes while short, were down right annoying. They were abrupt and distracting. The author yanks you away from the story to give you a boring discription of someone or something they've done and takes away from the suspense of many action sequences. And to boot it gives you little extra info than the movie itself.After about fifty pages of this I was so annoyed that I skipped ahead to a few important parts then sent the book back.While I highly recommend the movie, this book was sadly disappointing for me."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The author used an ambitious writing style, but apparently didn't have the talent to pull it off. The book ends up reading like amateur fan fiction. Very disappointing and distracting. BUT the book does provide more detail and background than the movie and is therefore a worthwhile read. It just could have been much better. They should have gotten the Attack of the Clone author to write it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I loved this book it was a great adventure and it took me 2 days to finish but man it was Great."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"As much as I like Matthew Stover's writing I wasn't nuts about the way he handled this adaptation. Sure, we got in the heads of the characters- well, some of them- but I still didn't get a clear picture of the story he was telling. Some of the insights were drilled so deep that I stopped paying attention to them.What surprised me most was how much of what I've seen in the trailers WASN'T IN THE BOOK! Yes, a Jedi goes to Kashyyk, but absolutely none of that story is told in the book. We've known for over a year that Chewbacca is in the movie but he is not mentioned once in this novel- even in passing. Even Jar Jar gets ONE MENTION in this book.I've read every STAR WARS novelization before seeing the movie since EMPIRE. This is the first time I've been LESS excited to see the movie. Don't get me wrong- I will see it and love it. I guess I just expected more from such a good writer."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I dont know about every other fan of star wars books out there, but for me, I always love reading the descriptive detail MOST authors put into those fight scenes. The expressive phrases, detail so crisp and exciting, its as if you can visual see every stroke, every block, every spark of force lighting etc.... The rest of the book can be okay, but if the starwars novel details great fight scenes I am really happy. This book was sadly lacking in such detail. I shall spell out what I found to flaws and then end with what was good.Some things simply should not be glossed over and left to the mind to figure out. For example, the yoda-Palpatine battle - watered down, short and lacking detail - very sad. The same can be said for at least two or three other encounters.In fairness - the Dooku v. Anakin/Kenobi scene was well thought out and described - you will enjoy that immensively.Aside from the watered down beverage of fight scenes, the constant use of the term \\"shadow\\" to describe the sith, especially sidious - and especially constantly through fight scenes was confusing and ambiguous. Going with sith lord, or dark lord would have been much cleanerNow the most disturbing flaw of all - Anakin's conversion. What's terrible is many star wars geeks (affictionados :)), have been speculating for months that whatever turned Anakin must have been traumatic. A grand death of his wife blamed on the jedi OR Kenobi - his dear friend betraying him - say a trumphed up love affair with Amidala. But no.... Palpatine cajoles him to switch sides, confuses and entices him. But its just not convincing. Simply put thats all it took - a little prodding to think \\"for yourself and take what you want\\" next thing you know Anakin goes marching off and starts slaughtering everything he sees. It makes little sense that such a massive personality change can come when throughout most of the book - all though irritated and cranky (as usual) Anakin is laughing, telling jokes, and still has respect for friends and at least a little respect for life. And with only minor stimuli - that changes in a flash. I DONT BUY IT! Some story is conconcted how Amidala dies in Anakins dreams and Palpatine offers him the power to raise the dead. This theme is wasted. It's thrown out there with no real purpose or explanation. It seems more or less that the way this author writes Anakin WAS ALWAYS TRULLY EVIL - there really wasn't good at all, Palpatine just had to bring it out. It goes against all star wars - the good man gone bad - there is still good in him. Through this book - it WAS NEVER THERE I TELL YOU.Finally - Anakin proclaims his undying love for Amidala all throughout the book but in the end...it is she who dies by his very HAND! This is just unacceptable. It only supports that Anakin is truly evil and always was deep down inside.I think the writer has made a serious plot mistakeOh one more thing - Chewbacca??? Non existent in the book, wookies???? non existent. The wookies are only mentioned along with their planet when yoda goes with a force of troopers there - thats it - period - yuck!Now - done with the bad. Readers will enjoy the dialog between Palptine and Anakin - totally evil/sinister -very nice. You learn some very cool things such as why Palpatines face gets so nasty, back info on Palpatines own master (awesome stuff) You further learn how the infamous \\"threepio doesnt recoginze darth vader later problem\\" is solvedAnother great area of the book is the writers work on Grevious - awesome detail, good background - a well written character!Overll 3 out of 5 - honestly a wait for the movie isnt a bad idea for onceOn a scary note, I am almost hoping Lucas's film cleans up this writers mess when in the first two movies it was the other way around.

I was falling asleep while reading the conversations in this book.

What a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is probably the worst book I've read all year. Wanna read the word \\"butt\\" 4 times in one paragraph? Then this is for you.Yup, when Obi-Wan wakes up after the Dooku fight he's really interested in Anakin's butt.Wanna get tired of the phrase \\"_____ coloured arc of brightness exploded from _____'s hand\\" over and over? Then this's for you.Apparently \\"Obi-wan ignited his lightsaber\\" just isn't flowery enough for Mr. Stover.Actually, in Mr. Stover's universe, everything tries to be flowerly. The problem is that what tries to be intelligent indepth discussion and description of events becomes tiring, meandering pages of pointless drivel.Did you hate Hayden's protrayl of Anakin? Well, it's not just the acting, that's how this horrible character was written and envisioned by the grand master, Lucas himself. You'd think the Jedi would be a bit more mindful of their chosen one...If you're in grade six and want a simple read, this is for you. If you enjoy reading, stay away. Instead of wasting an afternoon reading this book, see the movie.If you want some good Star Wars reading, check out anything by Kevin J. Anderson.If you want actual 5-star sci-fi reading, go check out Dune."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is a really well done Star Wars book, and has the added bonus of being an excellent add-on to the movie. You gain a much greater insight into what the characters are thinking and the depth of the overall plot. Stover does a better job in this book than in Shatterpoint, a novel which was entertaining but went on far too long. In Revenge, the pacing is perfect, the fleshed out dialogue convincing, the emotions deeps, the action suspenseful even *after* seeing the movie, the droids humorous...I really can't find a fault. I found it so consistent with the Star Wars universe I found myself wishing he'd write the next three episodes.Worth 5 stars if you're into Star Wars, 4 stars even if you're not."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"There is a reason that Matthew Stover was chosen from the large pool of Star Wars and science-fiction authors to pen the novelization of Revenge of the Sith. This reason is that he writes dark well. Very well.Some fans will be completely disarmed and shocked by the brooding atmosphere created by both Lucas and Stover. After all, this is the darkest chapter in the Star Wars universe, the fall of The Chosen One. There should be no surprises.Anyone who has read Stover's other work, either Star Wars or The Acts of Caine, will tell you that it is anything but comforting. The worlds he depicts exist only in shades of gray, to some his work possesses a great deal of 'moral ambiguity.' But as Stover himself put it in an interview with SF Site:\\"It only looks ambiguous if you insist on framing a story's conflict in terms of Good vs. Evil. It's not that simple. Real life does not operate in those terms. Neither does my fiction.\\"This might look like a startling conflict of interests. Stover's instinct to write honestly, and describe the world as it is, flies in direct opposition to the very thing Lucas set out to do with Star Wars: casting the world in absolutes and retelling the timeless conflict between good and evil by way of universal archetypes.Instead we see a stunning demonstration of Matthew Stover's ability to transform these unyielding absolutes into a truthful study of the human struggle to live with the consequences the decisions we make, even when we were only doing what we thought was right. In this, Stover captures the failing of Anakin Skywalker perfectly. He not only sympathetic, he is entirely human."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The most important thing this book does, and it does it wonderfully, is to give you the background and depth of the friendship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am very hopeful that the movie will convey this as well but amidst all the space battles and lightsaber duels I don't think it will be possible to get the full effect of what I feel is the most important relationship in the entire saga. I'm old enough to remember seeing the original trilogy when it was initially released in theaters and I have followed the Star Wars Expanded Universe faithfully throughout the long, long years in between the original trilogy and the prequels and I am a true fan (and defender) of the prequels as well.At five years old my favorite character was Darth Vader so maybe it's no surprise that I love that the entire saga has been turned on it's ear and that when you step back and look at all six movies you are suddenly seeing it from a totally different perspective - that it is, after all, the story of the life of Anakin Skywalker. Therefore, no relationship in the entire saga is more important than that between Anakin and his teacher and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Star Wars fans are not known for keeping their opinions to themselves so I'm sure others would argue for Anakin and Padme, Anakin and Luke, Luke and Leia, etc. For me, it's Anakin and Obi-Wan.In Attack of the Clones we saw a master and apprentice, frequently at odds with one another, fighting in the first battle of the Clone Wars. By the time Revenge of the Sith begins we have a Jedi Master and Jedi Knight fighting side by side as equals three long years into this neverending war. What they have endured and accomplished in that time is remarkable but is the subject of other novels. What this novel does is allow us to see into the friendship and love that now exists in that relationship. Ultimately, we know, this friendship will crumble and the result will devastate everyone involved. I was so glad to read their happy banter during the opening and to get their inner thoughts about the strengths that each felt the other had. I love that you can feel their love and respect for one another and that when it all goes bad, you understand what each has lost. Fighting together, side by side, they are an unstoppable force and neither can truly imagine a time when they would be on opposite sides of a fight until it happens and there they stand face to face. Heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First, I'm going to spoil the ending for you: Anakin goes over to the Dark Side.Okay, we all knew that, I know, but what we've been teased with all these years was how this happened. This novelization does an excellent job of answering that question and of bridging the prequels to the original trilogy.I can't review this book without imagining how the movie is going to be (which is, of course, why they do movie novelizations). Where the last two movies kind of fell short of everyone's expectations, it is more than made up for with Sith. Let's just say, the movie should be spectacular.(I'm trying to write this without ruining the book/movie)Throughout the novel, Anakin's slow descent into the Dark Side is done so believably. The foreshadowing is obvious, but it rings so true. You actually hope that Anakin will overcome, even though you do know he won't (at least not in this trilogy).His \\"betrayals\\" of Obi-wan and Padme are amazing. Padme's ultimate fate is ironic, and sheds light as to Anakin's return in the next trilogy.The action sequences are plentiful: from the opening space battle and fight with Count Dooku to Anakin and Obi-wan's climatic duel at the end. The movie should leave us breathless.I had some issues with the style of writing that was used in this novelization. \\"This is what it's like to be . . .\\" became a little annoying after awhile. This is why I gave the novel 4 stars.But all in all, The Revenge of the Sith is about Anakin's descent into hell, and it chronicles that well. To see how that sweet little boy became one of the biggest bad guys in moviedom, complements (and completes) the entire mythology of Star Wars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matt Stover's script adaptation for the final Star Wars prequel is simply outstanding. Even though Stover's novel is based on Lucas' script, you'd almost think that it was the other way around, this is so good.There are an incredible number of great quotes in the book that \\"coulda, shoulda\\" been used in the film. I read this novel before seeing the film, and quite frankly, it was better than the film (which I nonetheless enjoyed). For instance, in the latter part of the film, when Obi-Wan Kenobi faces General Grievous one-on-one, Grievous taunts Kenobi by telling him that he had been trained in Jedi skills by Count Dooku himself. In the film, they progress directly into combat. But in Stover's novel, we hear Kenobi respond to Grievous with the following: \\"Isn't that a coincidence? I trained the man who killed him.\\" The film clearly would have benefited from Stover's excellent use of wit, in this instance.Stover's personal background in the martial arts also deeply informs that novel. He is able to give extended discussions of the various moves in the multiple light saber duels that are found in both the novel and the film itself. Though we see them visually in the film, we UNDERSTAND them through Stover's writing. To give an example of Stover's incisive phraseology: When Mace Windu is engaged in heated battle with the Sith Lord Sidious, Stover treats us to the sense of desperation, of finality, that Windu is experiencing. As Windu ramps up his attack, shedding all fear and dangerously tapping into his own passions to gain strength (remember, this use of emotion is a potential \\"no-no\\" for a Jedi, as opposed to a Sith, who relies on his emotions to sustain him), Stover describes the action (at the end of a paragraph, as a concluding effect) as thus: \\"Mace Windu was cutting loose\\". This was fantastic phrasing, given the context, and painted an indelible picture in my mind of the battle, before I actually visually saw the duel in the theater.The fact of the matter is, Stover's novel is more than great Star Wars storytelling-it is just great sci-fi, period. Even though I've already read the novel and seen the film, I recently felt compelled to pick up the audiobook for the novel, just for one more go-round with it!A must-read for all Star Wars fans, and a strong recommendation for even just sci-fi readers generally."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Wow! If the film is anything as good as the book this will be the best episode ever. I'm totally impressed! Stover has undertaken the monumental challenge of portraying how and why Anakin Skywalker, the Hero with No Fear, ultimately surrenders to the Dark Side. I keep remembering Yoda's line from Episode, \\"I sense much fear in you.\\" It all makes sense in this outstanding book. Stover's writing truly captures the reader's imagination and draws us into the story. I literally couldn't put it down, staying up until 3:40 in the morning to finish.The scale and scope of Palpatine's manipulations is finally revealed. We get fantastic insight into the central characters like Anakin, Obi Wan, and Dooku, seeing their motivations, strengths, and failings. The book starts out light and fun then gets progressively darker and more disturbing as Anakin is drawn inexorably into Palpatine's web.Everyone knows what's ultimately going to happen, of course, but the journey sure is fun. This book is a fantastic read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I'm an Independent Moderate, so I take the opposite view of the reviewer Albert Lee. This story has parallels to what happens in a democracy, but the clearest parallel is to how the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, the fall of Athens to Sparta, and the precursors to the fall of the Roman Empire.However, it is science fiction and make believe. I'm sure some reviewers hear the noise of extremism in any story that has parrallels to real life issues, but I doubt a child will be confused between real life issues and metaphysical struggles of the force. I think some people underestimate the intelligence of children.The most important lesson this story can give to younger audiences is how important it is to keep the ideals of democracy in your hearts and mind. At the very end of the book, one sees how easy it is to fall from the graces of peace and power to the depths of powerlessness.After all, Anakin starts out with so much potential, but the inability of his Jedi society to help him is what leads to his fall from grace. In addition, Padme is a driving force for peace, yet she showed bravery and courage in previous chapters. This movie shows how too much love and peaceful desires can prevent us from seeing the reality of a situation - Anakin lost what he desired and valued most despite all his sacrifices and Padme lost her life and battle for justice because she was unable to fully provide for Anakin a reason to live, for which she cannot be blamed.The 'Revenge of the Sith' is a must read, because it shows that democracy falters and justice falls when honest people are unable to find the strength to do more than moralize and hope for a better future. This book clearly opens the door to the war of the twins, Luke and Leia, and we clearly see, despite horrible acting in the movies, bad pacing, and stilted plot development, where the strengths of each twin comes from and how each is so important to achieving a balanced universe.Revenge of the Sith is a sad story because it is the closest we've come to developing the Greek tragedy of Anakin Skywalker since 'Return of the Jedi'."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover, author of the excellent Mace Windu novel Shatterpoint, does not disappoint with his novelization of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Movie novelizations are often inconsequential by-products of a marketing push behind a big event picture, but in Stover's case, he strongly builds upon the film plot and adds meaningful substance to what was already a great story. Rather than give his readers a simple blow-by-blow recap of the screen action, he adds many sequences not in the film and cuts others entirely (fans of Yoda's visit to Kashyyyk will need to stick with the movie).The novel spends significant time in the opening space battle, fleshing out the action sequences and delving into the participants' motivations. At first I found Stover's technique here slightly jarring. The story is clipping along and we are suddenly sidelined by a page or two that start something like this (for example): \\"This is how it feels to be Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\" We then get a summary of who Obi-Wan is, what he's feeling, and what role he has played in the saga to date. However, as we read more of these entries, Stover's chance-taking really pays off: I found myself looking forward to the next one more and more, as the insights he provides illuminate certain story points brilliantly.I especially enjoyed the time he spent taking us into Count Dooku's head. Dooku doesn't get much screen time in the saga; some choice moments at the end of Attack of the Clones and his duel at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith are about it. Why would this respected and powerful Jedi have any interest in sublimating himself to a Dark Lord of the Sith? Stover paints a realistic portrait of what Dooku hoped to get out of their twisted relationship and muses about what Dooku believed would be his role after the end of the Clone Wars. Of course, Dooku is sorely mistaken with his perception of his relationship with Darth Sidious.Another place Stover excels is in subtly tinkering with some of the storylines to deepen both the motivations and the payoff. For instance, in the film, Anakin's lust to be elevated to Jedi Master and granted a seat on the Council is driven by his ego and inner demons. Stover adds an ingredient to the mix: Anakin also wants access to the Jedi Archives, which is only granted to Masters. He believes the Archives will contain Sith Holocrons with the forbidden knowledge Palpatine alluded to, including how to stop a person from dying. This small change greatly aids the believability of how furious Anakin is at being denied the Master rank when he claims his seat on the Council.Near the end of the book there is a noticeable shift toward more economic storytelling, and the final duel on Mustafar is very similar to what we see in the film. This didn't bother me, as by this point events are rushing to their bitter climax and interjecting long character analyses wouldn't really work like it did early in the novel. The pacing of the book taken as a whole is spot-on and well considered.Revenge of the Sith is a sweeping, dark, epic conclusion to the prequel trilogy, and Matthew Stover's novelization is more than worthy of the film. Kudos to him for not just cashing in a paycheck and writing a blow-by-blow account of the screenplay. He chose to take some chances and the results are quite rewarding."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This unabridged version is packed with exciting details. Some that were not even in the movie. It gets into the mind of Anakin Skywalker and how the internal struggle is so powerful. 14 hours, 11 cd's. Great!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"There are many people out there who do't like this book. Well, I thought the book was excellent. Some readers can think that the book rambles on, but if you actually know the Star Wars universe well, it is actually very interesting. Check the forms and styles of lightsaber fighting for example. They are described very well in the book, and the way that it has been written into the fast and furious battle scenes is excellent.I quite like the parts where Stover writes \\" this is Anakin Skywalker....\\"This style of writing is really very informative and can give you a good understanding of the feelings of the character.Overall this book is excellent, Stover has written an excellent novel that explains the Star Wars III plot. The way he integrates his other novel \\"Shatterpoint\\" is also good.Definetly five stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Matthew Stover does a wonderful job of really serving up a great novelization. At this time, the movie has still not been released, but if it has anything like the feel and pacing of the book, it stands a chance to be one of the best in the whole series.This book picks up right where Labyrinth of Evil left off. As soon as you open this book, you know that you are about to step into one of the more emotional and stirring Star Wars books. Stover does an excellent job of capturing all the characters including Obi-Wan, and especially Anakin.I have to give credit to George Lucas. Just when you think he's gone off the deep end, he comes up with this story line to make you rethink the whole Star Wars universe.I can't say enough good things about this one. Whether you enjoy the Expanded Universe of Star Wars or not, this is a great novel that leaves you wanting much, much more. I look forward to reading more of Stover's additions to the Star Wars universe."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"At the risk of sounding cliche...wow. That was incredible.Granted, it is still the book form. Most know that both the Ep. I and Ep. II books represented the movies fairly well (in both pro and con categories). By all accoutnts, the book is just the book, right?Revenge of the Sith, as most know, recounts Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force. We've known that for years - we know what's coming. That doesn't stop the story from ripping your heart out and squeezing. By the end, the pain of the characters is felt by the readers - the journey has come full circle, and by being there for the entire saga, the reader is naturally going to feel something.What is felt, however, is beyond comprehension. You feel like you've known these characters your whole life. You feel like screaming to them, imploring them to not take the paths that they do. And all the while, even though you know what is to come, every page will shock you with the details of the Republic's fall.I was very impressed with Stover's clever mix of past and present tense throughout the book (often describing what it's like to be a certain character at any given moment). He has created an elegant version of George Lucas' story, willing at any moment to yank the reader back into the hearthrob of action.If you are a Star Wars fan (of which, I am), this is a no brainer: this book is going to strike you on a level that none (and I mean NONE) of the other chapters, old or new, have. If you are skeptical, and in your mind, the words \\"Star Wars\\" conjur up what Ep. I and Ep. II COULD have been...this is still a no brainer. Prepare to be riveted to your seat - this final chapter is one you cannot afford to miss."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I could not disagree more with many of the comments in other reviews regarding Anakin's gradual seduction to the Dark Side of the force. I only hope that the movie is at least as subtle as the book in this area.Looking back 28 years ago, ObiWan mentioned in Episode IV that \\"Vader was seduced by the Dark Side of the force\\". Not that \\"Vader was turned to the Dark Side by a dramatic event in his life\\". Get with it people! No singular event magically and dramatically turned him over to the dark side. Period. That is just silly.The way evil works is exactly as depicted in the book... slowly, methodically, over a period of time, using arguments that almost seem to make sense, making the \\"good\\" appear wrong, etc. etc. If Lucas were to trivialize this down to one event, such as Amidala's death, etc., that would totally cheapen the real impact of the \\"slow seduction of evil\\" that is a reality in our world today. And to totally miss out on the true nature of evil.To have the Emperor open up to Anakin, then to have Anakin struggle with what to, then to have him run to the Jedi's only to be put down, and finally to see the Jedi's as the bloodthirsty killers. The Emperor turned Anakin into the hero, doing the right thing for the Republic and for life. And then, to further have Anakin's own anger toward Obi Wan cause the un-intentional death of his wife (choking her with his anger in his mind) - is just brilliant.I only hope this is part of the actual script and not something that Matt Stover developed on his own. Let's all hope the movie is as subtle and as textural with these layers..."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I just put this book down and closed it as of 10:01pm Pacific Time. I've spent the last 6 hrs reading it. Stover has blown me completely away. If the actors can convey this story in half the capacity of Stover, we have a masterpiece on our hands. I don't care what anyone says about so-called \\"redemption of the Star Wars franchise\\", I loved the novelizations and films of this prequel trilogy.Stover injected a sense of urgency into this work; urgency that was badly needed to jumpstart this story. His peering into the mind of Anakin Skywalker as Palpatine utilizes beautifully-woven subtlety and manipulation to persuade Anakin to see his one-time allies as enemies to be eradicated is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. The raw emotion he brings to the climatic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan, the ripping sense of betrayal, and the feeling of brotherood lost and love forsaken; it's all brought together wonderfully by Mr. Stover.I don't know how I'm going to contain myself for another month and a half...."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was one of those people who loved the original trilogy but have been, thus far, disappointed by the new trilogy. However, if the movie is as good as this book then Lucas might have finally made the movie we've all wanted to see.This story is obviously the final transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader in preparation for Star Wars: A New Hope. The transformation is pretty believable (not perfect) as Anakin's emotions, desires, and passions overcome him and turns him into Lord Vader.The bridge is also created that explains the death of Amidala, the erasing of memories of C3PO and R2D2, the elevation of Chancellor Palpetine into the emperor, the births of Leia and Luke, the destruction of the Jedi, and the hiding of Yoda and Obi-wan.The book is pretty dark, though this will most definatly have some of the best sci-fi battle scenes ever and the light saber battles will be better than we've ever seen. There are some dull parts when they are dealing with politics. But the best part about this book and movie is that Jarjar Binks is in neither. That should give it five stars alone.With a few weeks left before this opens in theaters, the real question is whether or not to read this book. My answer is, \\"That depends.\\"Do you want to know how the story goes before seeing the movie? If so, then yes, read this book. I don't think there will be anything in the movie that isn't in this book.Would you like to know what the characters are thinking or some of their motivations? If so, then yes, read this book. Matthew Woodring Stover does an excellent job of not converting the script over to simple dialog and a battle play-by-play.Would you likely read this book after you've seen the movie? If so, I would recommend reading the book first. That has always been a general rule with all book/movie combos.Otherwise, wait for the movie.In the end, I must say that the book is very well written and very enjoyable. The story is fast paced (maybe too fast paced in some areas, but these are Jedis -- not sloths -- we are reading about) and hard to put down.The audio version of the book is wonderful. Jonathan Davis does an excellent job with the character voices. Okay, Yoda's voice was a stretch, but all of the other voices I thought were very close to dead on. Mr. Davis also does a fantastic job of putting the right emotion into everything that was read. Also, there are many sound effects in the background that add to the story. For instance, when there is a space battle happening, you can hear Star Wars space battle noises in the background. There are light saber noises in the background when they are in use. And you can even hear the bleeps of R2D2 whenever he speaks. This is one of the best audio books productions I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot of them."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was floored by not only the writing, but the indepth character studies in this book. The fight scenes alone are incredible. I was hooked from page one. And yes, you do get to taste every drop of the evil as it wells in Anakin, and eventually you really think you know what will turn him to the darkside.Unfortunately, I wasn't ready for it, for any of it, and even after reading the reviews, (especially the ones that go into great detail and tell vital info. Shame on you,) if you look into the character, thoroughly, Anakin's turn to the dark side isn't as cut and dry as most would have you think. He is an uncontrollable force, passionate with everything he does, so when he turns to the darkside, that passion turns to uncontrollable evil. It's scary, it's dark, and the book is worth every penny. Read it, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Of all the prequels, I think there's unanimous agreement thatStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis the best of the bunch. Yet, even this finale faltered at times with choppy dialogue and unclear plot twists. Now, imagine you could reedit the movie and make perfect. That's what Matt Stover'sStar Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis like. This novelization takes the movie as a base and makes it even more of an epic.First, Stover's writing style mixes \\"stream of consciousness\\" sections, with glimpses into the minds of characters. While potentially risky, Stover pulls this off well, showing the inner emotional turmoil at which the film can only hint. Anakin's motives for joining the Dark Side become a lot clearer as we Stover explores the depths of his confusion. And he manages to really capture certain character dynamics well with just a few choice phrases, such as calling Obi-Wan and Anakin a team.Beyond that, Stover also expands the plot beyond what was covered in the 2.5 hours of the movie. Palpatine's discussions with Anakin are longer and more intense. I particularly thought Palpatine's depiction of the Jedi-Sith conflict as a dispute over \\"philosophical differences\\" was quite clever. In the book, he's so effective at blurring the line between good and evil that I almost felt like I was falling for the Dark Side! Meanwhile, we actually get to sit in on the deliberations of the Jedi Council and hear some of the shockingly candid disagreements amongst Yoda, Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan.Just as important sometimes is what Stover left out of the book. For example, Palpatine does not scream \\"Power, ultimate power\\" when he's zapping Mace Windu with lightning. Nor does Vader scream \\"Nooooo!\\" upon hearing about Padme's death. In fact, overall, the book and the characters' dialogue have a more dignified \\"age of heroes\\" feel. If only Stover had had a bit more influence over the final script.Of course, the novel isn't a substitute for the movie, particularly for the action scenes. They're short and often not particularly exciting. I thought the first few pages of the space battle were the only slow part of the book, although they're a visual feast in the movie. It seems - wisely in my opinion - that Stover essentially left the epic action to the movie and focused on plot and dialogue.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sithis probably one of the most compelling Star Wars stories ever told. If for whatever reason - the acting, CG special effects, Jar Jar Binks - you were not enthralled with the story as told in the movie, you owe it to yourself to enjoy it as told through Stover's adaptation."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I'm a big Scifi fan, and the final Star Wars trilogy left me feeling empty and hollow. The movies simply did not do the characters justice.I recently had to take a road trip, and all I could find was this audio book in my son's room. I remember enjoying Stover's \\"Shatterpoint,\\" so I put it in the car stereo and, being uncertain what Matt Stover could do with Lucas' lackluster final episode, hoped for the best.I was entranced.Stover has a wonderful grasp on Lucas' universe. Stover also seems to have terrific insights into human nature. As a mental health professional, I've seen evil on a few occasions, and Mr. Stover's description of the Sith Lord's evil is spot on. Palpatine's self-serving twisting and turnings ... both in word and deed ... would make any psychopath proud.This novel fills in so much of the back story behind the final movie that I want to go and re-watch it now.If George Lucas ever does another Star Wars movie, he should hire Matthew Stover to write the screenplay and the novel.Great job, Matthew!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I expect that most readers of this book will have already seen the film and will be familiar with the plot, If not, I suggest you read the book first and then watch the movie to see the incredible cinematic interpretation by George Lucas. The plot picks up right where Labyrinth of Evil left off. Chancellor Palpatine has been captured by General Grievous, and our heroes Obi-Wan and Anakin are coming to the rescue. They succeed in finishing off Count Dooku and force Grievous to flee to Utapau. Obi-Wan goes to Utapau to deal with Grievous while Anakin stays in Coruscant trying to decide between a future with the Jedi or a future with Darth Sidious and the dark side. We all know how that comes out with the final result being the introduction of Darth Vader and the twins Luke and Leia.In the book of Revenge of the Sith, Mr. Stover spends a lot of time with the internal struggle Anakin has with feeling underappreciated by the Jedi while at the same time trying to grasp the possibilities of the dark side. He is desperately attempting to learn enough about the Force to be able to keep his nightmare from coming true and to keep Padme alive. Darth Sidious is unbelievably smooth and persuasive as he continually massages Anakin's mind and ego and hastens the turn to the dark side. Rather than just telling the story of the film, the author gets us to understand the thought processes of the main characters. I think that will be invaluable as I prepare to watch the film yet again.We are also privy to a number of conversations among the Jedi masters - Mace Windu, Yoda, and Obi-Wan. They are confused by the Clone Wars. They do not understand the Senate's agreements to give Chancellor Palpatine increasing powers. They don't know what to do with Anakin. He is the Chosen One, but he is also dangerous and unpredictable. The deterioration of the friendship between Obi-Wan and Anakin is heartbreaking, but Anakin's turn to the dark side is handled in such a way that it makes sense. All in all, Mr. Stover has done a remarkable job in helping us to understand more clearly the Clone Wars, the demise of the Jedi, and the takeover by the Sith.Read the book and watch the movie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I believe this book is the perfect companion to the movie, because they compliment each other very well. There were scenes that were cut from the movie that are explained here; there's scenes that are expanded here when compared to the movie.Mr. Stover stayed true to the movie, while adding very interesting insights into the different characters and situations, specially Anakin Skywalker. By the end of the book, you deffinetly get inside Anakin's head a lot deeper than the movie showed.I recommend this book enthusiastically to any Star Wars fan out there or just anyone in particular who enjoyed the movie Revenge of the Sith. I dont think you will be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I read that someone said Palpatine was Anakins father...thats quite possibly the most stupid thing I've ever heard. Anakin is the son of the force. He was born a virgin mother as the chosen one to bring balance to the force, which means he was born to destroy the darkside and bring the force back into balance. Over all the book is excellent."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Let me first say if the movie is as good as this novelization hints that it will be, Episode III should be THE BEST of the three prequel films. Of course, the prequels have not been that great so far. The Phantom Menance was a menance to watch, Attack of the Clones improved considerably but fell flat for the most part (especially in the Anakin/Padme love story). Revenge of the Sith, however, looks to be just what George Lucas said it would be, Titanic in space. Of course, we know what has to happen. Certain events must play out in order to set up the story that began in A New Hope. It's how we get to that point, and getting to that point should be quite good if this novel is any indicator. What I disliked about this novelization, and why I could not give it more than 3 stars, is the poor writing by Matthew Woodring Stover. It is choppy, immature, and poorly adapted. I wish Lucas could have found a better writer, Terry Brooks for example who novelized The Phantom Menace. Regardless of how Stover wrote this adaptation, if you're a fan of this film series the book is a must-have prior to the film's release next month."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I really enjoyed the movie. The book leaves something to be desired. Stover adds dialogue were it really isn't needed. He overindulges in drawn out conversations and innuendo and tries to explain why every little comment made by Anakin is the most important occurrence in the history of the galaxy. In many instances, especially with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he really takes away from the characters by adding to the dialogue and overdrawing on their feelings. It almost works with Anakins fall to the dark side but was really inappropriate in most of the book. There are also many unexplained references to other books (especially \\"Shatterpoint\\") that don't add to the story at all. Still, if you're looking for a vacation book and can stomach the additions, it's an ok read."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"If the movie is as good as the book it is going to be amazing!

And many other story transitions. But I think the author (possibly editor's) made some poor decisions in what to include and NOT include in this book version.The novel is broken down into three sections. The first section section (136 pages) could have been told in about 50-60 pages. Perhaps the author could then have sparred those 70-80 pages to tell us about how the Wookiees are involved.Speaking of Wookiees ... there was a full page (page 359) where a Wookiee escape pod was seen by Captain Antilles. Since the book referenced nothing about the wookies until this point, this page was useless and out of place. I'm going to have to assume that Stover DID indeed include the Wookiee storyline in his first draft, but it must have gotten edited out.A few other writing blunders, but I'm out of space to comment on them!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"this is the best prequal movie. star wars phantom menace was too kiddy, and star wars attack of the clones was boring, with boring love scenes between anakin and padme.

Darth Maul is soundly defeated and peace is restored to Naboo.In Attack of the Clones, Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect Amidala and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is given emergecy powers and Dooku and the Trade Federation lay the ground work for the construction of the Ultimate Weapon. What happens is Anakin and Amidala fall in love and Obi-Wan tracks Jango fett to Kamino and discover the creation of an army by Sifo-Dyas- who was murdered by Dooku.In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin and Obi-Wan are on a mission to rescue the Supreme Chancellor from Greivous and the Supreme Chancellor plots to turn Anakin Skywalker to the darkside and we see the love story between Anakin and Amidala continue.The Supreme Chancellor is rescued and we see Obi-Wan as a member of the Jedi Council and Anakin is appointed to Jedi Council by Palpatine and we see the end of the clone wars. Palpatine encourages Anakin to learn about the dark side and we will see Mace Windu attempt to arrest the Supreme Chancellor for corruption and then the Jedi Council is deemed to be enemies of the Republic and Anakin turns to the dark side and agrees to track down and kill the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Council asked Anakin to betray Palpatine, but it is the Jedi Council that is betrayed and with the death of his mother and Amidala and the murder the Viceroy- Gunray and Dooku and suspicions about Anakin- who can blame him for turning to the darkside- but he is not consumed with the darkside- we see Anakin's redemption in Return of the Jedi when he finally kills the Emperor and dies himself after an intense battle with Luke Skywalker.Revenge of the Sith is clearly the book to read and the movie to see. This movie has the potential to break the 16 week run at the box office set by Titanic.The dark side will reign supreme this summer!!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is it, the last written canon of the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise, so it's no surprise that it may seem a bittersweet read to SW fans. It's also a painful one, poorly written and, along with the movie, pretty much undermines any of the good done by \\"Attack of the Clones\\". \\"Sith\\" is poorly written, at best. At worst, it\`s stuck to the storyline of the movie, with its plot gaps, forced resolutions and horrible dialog. \\"Sith\\", like the movie, picks up a few years after \\"Clones\\". The Clone Wars between Republic loyalists and the droid armies of the Separatists have been fought over thousands of worlds, on an immense scale. By the beginning of \\"Sith\\", a droid fleet under command of an Osama-like cyborg named General Grievous swoops into the heart of the Republic and kidnaps Chancellor Palpatine. Kenobi and Anakin fly to the rescue, save the Chancellor, dispatch Count Dooku, nearly nab Grievous, and make it home in time for supper. They also miss some signs that the Lord Chancellor seems a might stoic during his captivity in the hands of the Sith Lord Dooku. Once safe on the ground, the JedI begin raise their suspicions that the Chancellor has conveniently used the war to solidify a stranglehold over the freedom of the Republic. Only ending the war will obviate Palpatine's road to ultimate power; only finding Grievous will end the war.And that's the rub. \\"Sith\\" is the story of how the Clone Wars come to an end, and how the Imperial regime came to life. The war can't be all that complicated if it involves the life of a single man. That it can be expected to begin and end so quickly highlights how implausibly simple the clone wars were. \\"Sith\\" is a story based on transitions, but not actually including any. There really is no war - the fact that the war is a sham is integral to the plot. The story underlines this by crafting a war in without making any of the combatants into real characters. The Separatists fight their battle using armies of droids - couldn't they find any partisans who weren't programmed? We were also clued in, at the end of \\"Clones\\" that we were witnessing the beginning of a process that would lead to the dawn of the Empire - with Chancellor Palpatine presiding over the mobilization of tens of thousands of clone troopers. When \\"Sith\\" kicks in, things don't look that bad - clone troopers and JedI coexist easily; troopers willingly sacrifice themselves for the JedI, and neither of the two confront doubts they may have about fighting the war because few of the battles actually require then to kill anybody. The story assumes that war is horrible state of affairs - insanity by other means - yet makes little effort to show it as all that bad. Also, while the characters lament the downward spiral into oppression of Imperial rule between \\"Clones\\" and \\"Sith\\", there's talk of military governors, but none are made into characters with speaking parts, and little of their encroachment on liberty actually makes it into the story. (Also, since Palpatine orders the annihilation of the JedI directly to the clone commanders, the governors seems redundant.) As for the twin centerpieces of the story - the seduction of Anakin Skywalker by the Dark Side and the downfall of the JedI - they just happen with no plotting meant to make it plausible. Anakin's motives are to save his wife, but once he's completed his end of the deal, his lust is for power and to rule - where did that come from? And the end of the JedI - they had it coming as far as I'm concerned. They may have voiced their suspicions against Palpatine, but never against the Clone armies that fought alongside them - despite the fact that the enigmatic origins of the clones (patterned on a bounty hunter in-league with the separatists) remains unsolved, while rumors of a Sith-Lord among the higher echelons of government gain credence with each day. Matt Stover doesn't really help things out by arming his characters with one-liners: in his coronation speech, Palpatine ominously intones Ronald Reagan's \\"Morning in America\\"; told by Palpatine to expect a handsome reward from Anakin, treacherous Neimodeans of the Separatists are shocked to see him massacre them all - \\"Aren't I handsome?\\" he asks; the most egregious is Kenobi's epitaph for General Grievous - \\"how uncivilized\\" he notes after a battle that's seen him thrown from great heights and tossed around by the General like a rag doll. It's almost like he's not Obi Wan at all, but McGregor's other character - the glib \\"Catcher Block\\" from \\"Down With Love\\". Stover tries to mitigate things by wrapping his prose in enthusiastic anticipation for what characters feel, but it's forced - he's writing less about the story of \\"Sith\\" than the audience that sits through it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I should say up front that I saw the movie first and that's what made me want to read the book. I have not read any of Mr. Stovers other works, and now I doubt that I will. I read constantly so don't let the fact that I saw the movie first lead you to believe that I would rather see a movie than read the book. I was on the waiting list from my local library and the movie ended up comming out before I got my copy. I can't really put my finger on what I didn't like, but it was so challenging to keep reading the authors prose. I think I only managed about 20 pages the first sitting and then forced myself to slug out another 30 to see if in fact it was as dreadfully written as I first thought. I know I am going against the grain with my 1 star review, but I couldn't even force myself to keep reading it. I thought that maybe seeing the movie first was the problem so I let my wife have a go with it since she hadn't seen the movie. I think she made it through about 60-80 pages before declaring it unreadable. You should take into account that I didn't finish the book, and I suppose that it could have turned around, but I think the real flaw was in the authors writing. I'm so very glad I stuck it out on the libraries waiting list rather than spending my cash on the book as I was tempted to do. Maybe all the 5 star reviews are written by young readers who haven't really experienced quality writing yet."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I can't say much more than has been said already. I rarely read movie novelizations, but I just couldn't wait for the Episode III story anymore. Even with reading too many spoilers online, I was still surprised.THIS WILL BE THE BEST IN THE SAGA.Matthew Stover is a phenomenal writer and I look forward now to picking up his other works."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is truly a great time to be a Star Wars fan. That is, if Matthew Stover's rendition of Lucas' screenplay is even half of what we will see on 5/19/05.Novels of this kind are often written poorly. No real suspense. A lot of fluff. Not the case here. This was a very well written book. I heartily recommend it.The tough part lies in Lucas' hands. Lucas doesn't do much justice to his films in terms of writing. The story framework is there, but the emotion (of the prequels) is vacant. Hopefully, he has learned from the past and has improved on the dialogue for Episode 3.If the movie is as good as the book, consider this franchise redeemed."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is definetly one great book, and makes me even more excited for the movie. There are no grammatical errors to speak of and the story flows really well. I did see some problems, however which annoyed me, but are of no fault of the writer. First of all, one of the new, supposedly important characters in the book had only a tiny role. I thought he was to be crucial to the story, but oh well. My only other problem with the book is that while the events of Yoda on Kashyyk are seen in the movie, there is barely any mention it in the book. But I guess it is so the book can concentrate more on Obi-Wan and Anakin. Still, it is worth the 5 stars, probable even more, and gets me ready for the movie and the Revenge."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This novel is a very good Star Wars story, as these things go. The problem is, if the last two movies and novelizations are any indication, then this novel is probably going to be better than what appears on screen. That being said, I don't believe that this is 100% a fitting end to the movie series that captured the hearts and spirits of millions of people.My problem with this story is that it is not dark ENOUGH to represent the final fall of the shadow of the Republic. I won't go into any spoiling details, but there were times I still felt Anakin was just whining in the same way he did on Tatooine during Episode 1. This represented a step in the wrong direction, and made his fall somewhat less potent than it could have been.That being said however, I'm going to reserve my judgement for what I see on film in a month. Unfortunately, Episode I and II have pretty much caused me to give up hope on the film versions of these stories. I don't know if PG-13 is enough for the darkest hour of the history of the universe.Overall, the book was WELL into the 4 stars category. I enjoyed reading it, even though I was dissapointed with parts of it. I believe that, overall, it is the best we could have hoped for after the past performance of the series over the last two sequels (prequels, whatever)."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I thought this book was soooooo cool!

Ya damn right Skippy*******Matthew Stover is arguably one of the best writers out there. His ability to portray characters and intertwine philosophical/emotion complexities is simply amazing. For the fall of Anakin Skywalker, no one could have done it better than Matthew Stover. With such glowing praise one would think this review would be a 5 star 2 thumbs up seal of approval endorsement, but sadly tis not the case. I would have loved nothing more then to give my favorite author a 5 star rating but after much self debating and excuses I made for Matthew Stover, I am ultimately rating the book. The book gets a solid 3 and a half stars, amazon does not let you vote half stars so I rounded up to 4 stars. Before you cry bohooo let me quickly clarify. For all of you Star Wars fans you will find this book is a gem deserving 5 stars but for all of us Matthew Stover fans it is only good. If you want to know what I mean, do yourself a favor and pick up Shatterpoint or Traitor (both are Star Wars novels) and if you really want to treat yourself to something awesome read one of his Caine novels (Mace Windu to the tenth degree)Now to the reasons why the book is just on-par.Could it be the pacing of the story? As other reviewers have noted the story-telling is erratic. Starting off slow it built to a mind numbing fight scene between Anakin, Obi-wan, and Dooku. Now this is an epic scene which reminded me of Mace Windu in Shatterpoint and Jacen Solo in Traitor. Matthew Stover's light saber duels are quite something truly to behold. These are the fights we all dream and fantasize about when younger. Reading these scenes makes me want to grab a plastic-stick-on-a-flashlight-wannabe-lightsaber and prance around in my jammies twirling, whirling, and accidentally videotape it, only to have it proliferate across the Internet ....errrrrrr got off on a tangent there, sorry ;P. Anyway Matthew Stover did a wonderful job with pacing until the dark side drew the curtains, at which time he decided its a wrap!!! Anakin has been converted and the liquid excrement just hit the fan, screw the fight between Anakin and Obiwan. Forget mini-me Yodi versus Lord Sidious. The birth of Luke and Leia, who cares we all know how this will end so lets just condense, summarize, and throw a low-carb cake version to the masses. ARrrggggg what were you thinking Matthew!!!!! How could you stiff us like that? How could you mesmerize and tantalize that carrot in front of us and pull the rug from under us???? Right after Anakin subverted the story-telling got butchered I tell you!!! BUTCHERED!!!Okay enough ranting, even with the erratic story-telling I can still forgive Matthew Stover. So what could it be that brought this rating down? That can only be characterization. Matthew Stover is a genius when it comes to characterization. He literally puts you in the persons shoes so you can see through the character's eyes and understand what the character is thinking. With an author with this caliber you would think he'd be able to pull through with the seduction of Anakin to the dark side. Now in all fairness he did a wonderful job at the beginning, heck half the time Lord Sidious spoke to Anakin I could not help but nod and agree with every word. Those jealous jaded jedi's how could they do this to you Anakin! The art of seduction is a simple, subtle, and slow process that poisons the mind yet it would still need something to push Anakin over the edge. That something Matthew Stover did not provide. Anakin is a maturing adult and no matter how twisted the maturing process is a person always makes choices that they believe are right. Its the proverbial pursuit of happiness, no matter how evil a person is they will do what gives them some semblance of happiness. Lord Sidious embraces the dark side for unlimited power yet Anakin at the end joined the dark forces for what? Some could say for his love of his wife yet that is contradictory because in the end Matthew Stover would have us believe he loved himself more than her. Matthew Stover totally botched this one and here it is.1 Palpatine is basically a father to Anakin, 2 he has twisted Anakin's way of thinking, 3 he successfully makes Anakin view the Jedi as corrupt, 4 he has shown Anakin the usefulness of the darkside powers, 5 he basically has Anakin thinking the Sith and the Jedi are the same, and 6 he has shown Anakin how corrupt the world is and the need for one strong \\"empire\\" for a new utopia of peace. So with all these reasons why would Anakin, a twisted maturing adult with more reasons to hate the jedi, ball up and cry like a baby after Palpatine reveals himself as the boogy man? Not only does he run away but he tat-o-tales on Palpatine his only father figure. And if that was not bad enough the sniveling snot Anakin, that is shaking like a leaf is converted to the dark side by perching his mind on top and looking down? So in essence he lets his body be controlled by the darkside so that he does not have to feel bad? WTF! When did the dark powers turn into a full blown poltergeist with the ability to change facial structure that would make a plastic surgeon jealous? Come on now, I feel like I am reading the exorcist here, whatever happened to the force being just a power that is synonymous to a gun in which the bearer uses for good or evil. But who cares about that because in a far galaxy far far away from here there was a poltergeist that took over Anakins body and turned him so evil that he would try to kill men, women, children, aliens, his mentor Obiwan that is like a brother, his wife that he loves not to mention the unborn child, and even his father figure that just converted and baptized him in the forces of darkness.As you can see his free fall to the darkside is just not believable enough. What should have pushed him over the edge should have been more in line with the story. For instance, in what Anakin feels is a betrayal by the jedi. It would have been more convincing if Anakin thought the jedi left Obiwan to die fighting General Grevious or the jedi letting his wife die. Then he would have reason to purge the corrupt jedi and pursue a utilitarian galaxy. What would have been the best though would be Anakin sacrificing himself to the darkside to protect his children and turning into Darth Vader to erase his memory of the twins hah I should help George Lucas with his stories :P Another tangent sorry. Anyway the book is good but in terms of the crucial turning point (which is the whole reason for this episode) was too weak. No matter how I look at it there is no concrete reason why he accepted to be Lord Sidious's apprentice and became such a twisted soul. Besides that the story is decent and to be fair no one could have written this episode better than Matthew Stover, I cringe to even think if another person wrote it.I can't blame Matthew Stover though, because his writing the book was a jedi trap. He probably had to stay as close to the screenplay as possible and with the screenplay being clouded by the dark powers of the Sith Lord Lucas writing a book this decent is commendable indeed. Also with a screenplay Matthew Stover didn't have much room to work without changing the entire story which is why Shatterpoint and Traitor are much better. I probably won't watch Episode III due to the craptacness of Episode II. Although I would put down 8 dollars at the movies any day to watch Jar Jar Binks roast on the end of Anakin's lightsaber. Heck I'll actually buy a ticket for all of my friends and family to cheer Jar Jar Binks to the after life but damn my wish won't be fulfilled, hey maybe I should prance in my pajama.............."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I started reading this book, put it down for a bit and then started to read it on Friday night. I thought I would finish it this weekend. It turns out, I finished it Friday night/Saturday morning. Once I got engrossed in the story, I couldn't put it down because I wanted to find out how everything closes together.If the movie is anything like the book, it should be the best of the 6. The story of the first triology is compelling (when I say first, I mean IV-VI) because it is about the redemption of a hero. This story is more compelling because it is about the tragic fall of hero. It shows the fine line that people walk between darkness and light and how that line can be crossed with a few actions.For all the downers of the book, it does sort of end on a positive note. You know that there is hope for the galaxy. (Not really a spoiler since you knew that anyway).I think the best part of the book is how the author put you in the mind of the principle characters with his: \\"This is how it feels to be So and So\\". He gave you enough background so that if didn't read the other stuff set between the movies that you wouldn't be lost.

For Christ's sake, he seems to know so much about them, yet he doesn't know he's Sith? The truth is, he DOES know, all too well. Yoda and Palpatine share more than a knowledge of the force. Truth is they have a great deal of knowledge about light sabers, namely each other's. He calls Yoda his little green friend. How insulting! How rude! An obvious love spat.

His use of vocabulary, personifications, and connations are blended together perfectly to out-do the film itself. Strover's depiction of Anakin and the fear that lives inside him really captivates the reader and makes them understand how Anakin truly feels and why he turned to the dark side. For example, Strover desribes how Anakin thinks of his fear as a dragon that haunts his life and lives in his heart and how it whispers of death and failure. It may sound silly now, but is wonderfully written in the book. The dialouge Strover uses is so much better than the novel. I only wish George Lucas had hired him to write it. Matthew's work is so wonderful you're pulled into a tale of lies, love, vengeance, and forgivness. Wether you're fan of the movie or not, you'll love this book. I only wish Matthew wrote other movie novelisations."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Just Read It!!!This books really explains the goings on in the movie. I didn't understand the movie but the book allowed the movie to make sense. Explains everything!!!If you are confused about some the dialogue in the movie buy the book. I finished it yesterday, feb.28,06. i loved the book in fact more than the movie.I am an adult reviewer so take that in mind."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"When I picked up the Revenge of the Sith novelization, it was only because the film was yet to be released and as a long time Star Wars fan I was pumped. Little did I expect the novel to be incredibly well written, with vivid and exciting descriptions of the battle scenes and several fantastic scenes which were not in the film at all. A scene where Palpatine tempts Anakin with unlimited wealth and power would have quite possibly been the best moment in the film, had it made it to screen!The film was okay, but the novel is much, much better. While it still suffers some of the same plot flaws as the film, the action reads every bit as exciting, the characters are much richer, and the experience is a good bit longer. Definitely recommended not just for hard-core Star Wars fans, but for anyone looking for an exciting sci-fi yarn."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This was a good trilogy about the rise of Darth Vader. If you havent read about it, and only saw the movie... there was probably a point where you were thinking, &#34;Wait, that was stupid... how did Anakin go from being a jedi to loping off the heads of younglings in one scene... he didnt even have to think about it!&#34; After getting angry at poor acting, you might decide to resort to books... this would be that series. It starts before Revenge of the Sith. It has all the set up, mental issues, games, and action that lead him down this path. It conveys the internal struggle that could not be portrayed on film, at least not by the actors paid to do so. And lastly it takes you further... at a time when Vader is struggling to learn to get around in this new suit, learn his limitations, and the extreme powers of the force. It is a good book, but prior to this, I had read Darth Plagueis, and it was written better (prose) and the story-telling was put together better. Still a good read, and great for filling in the cracks between the stories."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"So, I picked the book for the first and last story, but i was genuinely positively surprised by the novel of episode III, and as someone here had already mentioned, I was astonished by the amount of topics, ideas, conversations that were not present in the movie, and should be.The stories here are great, and has characters that made me care and also hate (especially hating Olee from the last one).So if you are into SW, and liked the Revenge of the Sith, i think you will enjoy it much more after reading the book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"REVENGE OF THE SITH by Matthew Stover is a great Star Wars novel, a great science fiction novel and in my opinion the novel we must read if we consider ourselves to be serious connoisseurs of Star Wars literature.We all saw the movie, and we all loved it. Reading this book took me back to that same incredible story, but reading this book was like watching AVATAR 3D but with the 3D glasses on. What makes this book so unique, so readable and so enjoyable is the way Stover tells his story.We are lucky to get insights into the mind of good (Jedi), the bad (Sith) and those in between. We find out what it is like to be in love, to be young, and to be free. We find out what it is like to be manipulated and to be the manipulator. We learn the ways of the Force. We learn what it is like to be a Jedi and we find out what it is like to go to war knowing who the bad guys are, knowing that you won't come out alive but GOING IN ANYWAY because IT IS THE WILL OF THE FORCE!!!The battle scenes were incredible.The story of course, is incredible.Matthew Stover, is incredible.Revenge of the Sith, is incredible.LR (Greggles)"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"great book if you are a star wars nerd like me. i loved every moment of this book. author did an excellent job. heh"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I'll start by saying this: if you're not a big Star wars fan, not necessarily \\"hardcore\\" but just a avid fan, you might want to skip this. If you've dabbled in reading Star Wars books (EU to those in the know) the this is a must have. Like The Clone Wars is currently doing to bridge Episode's II and III this trilogy perfectly satisfies any hunger Star Wars fans have after watching Episode III and deserves a spot on your shelf.Labyrinth of Evil - 4/5This is the prequel, if you will, to Episode III as it details the events prior to and leading up to the film. Anakin and Obi-Wan are fighting with their clones on the Outer Rim and must travel to Cato Nemodia to try and capture the slippery and elusive Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. The Clone War has already been raging for sometime at the start of this novel and for those who haven't seen the TV series this is great insight on the war we didn't' see in the films. While nearly capturing Nute Gunray, Anakin and Obi-Wan almost find out and capture the even more elusive and mysterious Darth Sidious. It's a great read and beautifully leads into Revenge of the Sith, whether you read the novel or see the movie.Revenge of the Sith - 5/5Like all novelizations of Star Wars films, the books are even better than the movies. Not that Revenge of the Sith was by any means the worst of the prequels (here's looking at you Episode II) but where the movie simply couldn't elaborate the novelization does brilliantly. If anything it serves as a helpful supplement to the film, as Matthew Stover pumps a different kind of empathy into the novel. Each segment starts out with a solemn poem that accurately describes both the following segment and the overall tone and mood of the story. The elaboration is key however and to get a grasp of how in-depth Stover gets here's an example: the beginning of the film sees Anakin and Obi-Wan flying to Grievous' main cruiser, an sequence that takes at the most 15 minutes. That should equate to 15 pages (a minute for every page of action). However it takes Stover nearly 100 pages to guide us to the two Jedi landing in the docking bay of Grievous' cruiser. It's worth the price of the trilogy alone to get this book and it fits perfectly as both a transition to Episode IV and the middle piece of this trilogy.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader - 4/5Another brilliant book that works both as a stand alone and the final act of this trilogy. We've seen Anakin begin to turn, and then eventually turn but ROTS only spends mere moments (more in-depth moments in the novel) with Anakin as Darth Vader. Here we get Vader's first mission in the suit. After being horribly mutilated on Mustafar, Anakin -- now Darth Vader-- must learn to not only deal with what he's become but carry out the tasks of the Empire. This novel serves as an even more solid transition into the action of A New Hope as we not only have Vader first becoming the dark, twisted demon that he is but we have the first reminisce of what will become the Rebel Alliance. There is a large portion of the book that takes place on Alderaan and even suggests that Padme didn't die and is living in hiding to mentor Leia (who makes a significant appearance as a plot device). Basically this serves as a two parter as we have Vader coming into the Sith Lord we all know form the movies and the last of the Jedi trying to sort things out as they are in absolute chaos after the Purge. It's a truly entertaining story, one that I sill think about reading for the first time -- it just sticks with you.OVERALL:Again, if you are a Star Wars nerd get this book. It's a must own and is a significant and entertaining part of the chronology of the saga. If you're not a hardcore fanboy but simply want to know more about what happened before and after Revenge of the Sith this is an excellent buy that won't let you down at all. Both of these writers have turned out entertaining books in the past and thus have a track record of great Star Wars novels. Stover has dabbled in Clone Wars stories before there was a huge interest in it so he has helped establish a lot of the continuity. Luceno penned the Darth Maul prequel \\"Shadow Hunter\\" which lead into The Phantom Menace so he knows how to write a lead in novel and make it work as a stand alone and not a tie in. Trust me, you don't have to be hardcore to like this trilogy, after all it deals with the Saga's main character and it's most interesting and infamous. You won't be sorry you got this and you'll have trouble putting it down."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The Star Wars movie novels can be a tricky thing. The films are made to be very visual in nature. This can be problematic for the novelization. This is the best of all six. The author made some \\"out of the box\\" decisions on how to approach this one. First he will stop the novel to do character studies of the main guys, at who they are right then. This roles through the rest of the novel because as they change, so does his studies. The final one of what it is like to be \\"Darth Vader\\" is haunting. Another smart choice he does is by using the Star Wars Holonet. He gets across how the Republic is feeling about the events. These are great, and go a long way in turning this visual story into a great novel.I myself love the characters of Count Dooku and Mace Windu. This novel really gives them their time to shine. I felt so bad for Mace. His journey in this book is totally original and keeps in the spirit of the adventure.I loved the movie and now I love the book. If you are like me, and love Star Wars then you should give this one a try."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The best part of this book is it doesn't ride my nerves with Skywalker's crybaby attitude. But better then that is the view it gives of the people around him and how they are viewed. Great book well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The Dark Lord Trilogy includes one part of the bigger trilogy (somewhat confusing at first glance huh?). The books sandwiching Revenge of the Sith (Which is, FYI, Star Wars Episode III, by Matthew Stover) are written by James Luceno.The series is full of chasing and lightsaber duel action sequences as well as the beginning of the story that leads into Episode III. The character development is great especially for Labyrinth of Evil. This book gives us the perspectives of General Grievous's and Count Dooku origin and how they ended up there.As for the Revenge of the Sith, there are several details and stories about how Jedi council was deceived and how Anakin Skywalker, slowly as well as abruptly, turned into the dark side. There are some parts of the book that makes me thrilled (I can recall the confrontation of Mace Windu and Jedi masters and Darth Sidious more vividly than the movies one)There is nothing much in the third volume, The Rise of Darth Vader. It's all about how Vader adjusted to his new position and power with some casualties along the way. There is not much redemption or mourning here.If you are Star Wars fan, The Dark Lord Trilogy will enhance the Episode III experiences. Do not miss it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book talks about Anakin wanting to keep Padm&eacute; alive so he turned to the dark side of the Force.

George Lucas has done it and with Matthew Stover as his proxy this volume is outstanding! I am just in the middle where the fit is about to hit the shan, if you catch my meaning, and I can't put it down. This is the one episode that will be lauded by true Star Wars fans forever and I am glad that I was around to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Has the wait been worth it? Yes!!! This is a stunning conclusion to the story some of us have been watching/reading since 1977. The novel opens well and gathers momentum as it hurtles toward an extremely moving climax. I can't wait to see how it unfolds on the screen ..."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"The NovelizationLet me start by declaring that I was not a big fan of Matthew Stover and was apprehensive about how this book would work out from the time he was announced as the author. I found his work in Traitor, whilst interesting, to be very inaccessible on first reading. It was so difficult to read that I don't think I really understood what was going on until my second or even third reading of the book. His style in retrospect was interesting and relevant to the type of book he was brought in to write. However, this was a style that I was concerned was completely inappropriate for a mass consumption movie novelisationI am pleased to say that I was wrong. Matthew Stover has written what in my opinion is the best of the six movie novelisations with detail and insights that are excellent. The result is not only comprehensible but is written in a style that evokes the mood of the movies of the past with a depth that foreshadows the mood of the movie that is to come.This review is written before the movie is released so is obviously limited in terms of comparisons with the movie. From the spoiler reports of which I am aware, there are a number of scenes in the book which are not in the movie - which is to be expected - but there are also a number of scenes in the movie which are either not in the book or are glossed over, which came as a bit of a surprise.There is very little information about the Battle of Kashyyyk - Chewbacca and Tarfful do not even rate a mention - with the limited information we receive being in the context of reports in the Jedi Council. I found this omission a little odd, but can understand that the author may have been concerned that the middle part of the story needed to move along at a faster pace.What was more surprising was the way in which the execution of Order 66 was handled. The screenplay indicates that the movie will have several specific scenes depicting this, and the spoiler reports indicate that at least three of these scenes will make the final cut. None are specifically referenced, except to refer to the planets on which Order 66 was being carried out. I also found this omission a little odd. Perhaps a mechanical description in print of what was going on at each planet would have detracted from the feelings evoked. As it stands, the way in which it was handled was haunting even without the detail. It certainly had me in tears.There were aspects of the book that will not be in the movie that I found particularly pleasing. First, there were many interludes in the book devoted to giving us specific character background and insight into their feelings in a way that I have not seen done before but which worked particularly well. Most of the major characters had a least one of these segments with some having two or more. Whilst it pulled the reader out of the action briefly, the pay off in terms of the emotional depth given to the characters was well worth it.Secondly there were many more EU references than have been seen in earlier novelisations. This is something that no doubt movie purists will take issue with, and some who have not read the EU may also find it alienating. I myself have not read many of the earlier works referenced (particularly Shatterpoint, one of Stover's own books) but I did not find the references alienating, although the references to lightsaber action/styles were a little odd. The other references to battles etc were not unlike the movies themselves (including this one judging by the screenplay) having obscure references - sometimes later taken up by the EU - and just fleshed out the fact that the characters had been through a lot in the lead up to the events of RotS.The Audio BookFor those who have not seen or heard of this, there is an audio version of this novelisation which is unabridged on 11 CDs, read by Jonathan Davis and presented in Dolby Surround Sound.The narrator does a magnificent job of making sure that every word is clear and actually provides different tones and accents for each character so that it is very clear who is speaking at all times. The interludes of character development were handled particularly well so that there was the same sense of standing aside from the story whilst the information was being provided that you got with reading the printed copy. As we moved into battles or duels there was a clear sense of urgency in the style of narration that enhanced the experience.More importantly the soundtrack and sound effects were awesome. John Williams's music was provided at appropriate times and there were various sound effects - from crowds and lightsabers to lightning and battle sounds - that really made the experience much more worthwhile.If you have any interest in audio books then this one is definitely worth considering."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This book is the best movie novelization ever! Matthew Stover caught all the action of the soon-to-come-out movie. I actually thought I was part of the action. I would not recommend this book to kids under 10. I hope Mr. Stover makes this kind of book for all the episodes. I don't think they would be 418 pages long!"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am not a huge Star Wars fan. You will never see me camping out for weeks in order to get movie tickets. But I had to ask my son if we were going to see the movie, after seeing the previews, he said \\"You know it\\". The movie had a PG-13 rating so I read this book prior to the film to see if he could go see it.The book was better than I thought with detailed space battles and betrayal. I found it more of a character study than an action novel, not to say that the action was lacking. I'm just sating that instead of cardboard figures running around with lightsabers, we got fully fleshed-out characters with reasons behind their actions. I would have to say the book was enjoyable and I can only hope that the movie captures the feeling of this book."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have been waiting for the \\"real\\" completion of this series for over twenty-five years so I was excited to hear that this book was coming out even before the movie. The last two movies have been decent but not up notch with the original movies leaving a lot of Star Wars fans somewhat dissapointed. Needless to say I'm betting that the next movie will be along the same lines.... good special effects and action scenes and horrible acting and monologue. So if the movie is mediocre at least I have this book to remember the conclusion of the series with.Stover did a terric job detailing the actions scenes putting you right into the action. The monologue actually made sense and was very well written (unlike the last two movies) and he setup Anakin's decline perfectly. You could actually see and feel for the evil Darth Vadar and think to yourself.... I think I would/could have \\"fallen\\" as well.Stover just did a terrific job with this book, the book is a perfect combination of action, actual plot, love story etc. I truely believe he did as good of a job as anyone could have with the script and has made me anticipate the movie even more.If you are a Star Wars fan read this book before watching the movie. That way if the movie is not up to par you will have this book to help enjoy the conclusion of the series."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I was a bit skeptical at beginning this last of the novels based on the very last film that will be made...If you have read any of the original novelizations based on Episodes IV, V or VI you know why. The first was actually ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster, the second wasn't quite as good, and by the third book it just seemed quite a poor version of what was put visually on the big screen. I believe George Lucas has learned a valuable lesson over the years in requesting novelists who are actually very talented, which translates into a MUCH better reading experience.That said, I still wasn't sure if I wanted to spoil the film by reading the book first. Of all the films, the only one I read in advance of seeing the movie was The Empire Strikes Back, and my audible *Gasp* at reading the stunning revelation when Darth admits to Luke he is his Father, well lets just say I interrupted my entire Language Arts Class with my genuine surprise. It was for this VERY reason I chose not to read Return of the Jedi and subsequently Episodes I & II until AFTER I had seen the movies. I took a gamble with Episode III and I believe I lucked out and made the right choice.Let's be honest: There really isn't going to be any MAJOR surprises here, right? We ALL know how it all ends, eventually. However, the series surprised me before, and although a few technical details won't shock me when I see it all on the big screen, I doubt I will enjoy it any less. Let's start at the beginning: George Lucas has written a MUCH better script than we had in Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. This really IS going to be a much darker film by comparison, because like it or not, the loveable little Annie from Tatooine WILL grow up to be the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. He is partially responsible for the death of the Old Republic and the slaughter of hundreds of Jedi Knights, along with future crimes against the Galaxy in helping to build the Death Star, which would eventually be used to incinerate the peaceful planet of Alderaan. Yes, like it or not Anakin Skywalker is going to become one of the worst people ever seen on the big screen. So, no REAL surprises there, right? I guess the REAL surprise is not necessarily in how things end up, its more or less the journey along the way. The spectacular crash of General Grievous' flagship INTO Coruscant, saving the lives of Obi Wan and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. I suppose a select few will actually be quite surprised at who Darth Sidious is revealed to be (to the hard core Star Wars fans this will NOT be a surprise). I must admit when I read the Phantom Menace I was a bit surprised at the mention of Darth Sidious. I mean this Lord of the Sith had never been mentioned before...I suppose I just assumed the Emperor just decided to become just that, the Emperor, and I never really put much thought into the fact that he was probably a Darth something-or-other before his self-appointment as the Emperor of the Empire. I guess now I know differently. It all becomes rather clear in the end.Others have noticed one glaring continuity error from this novelization which conflicts with the established chronological history as originally seen (and read) in Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. Just before Luke turns himself over to Vader, he reveals his relationship with Leia by asking her if she ever remembered her Mother...she said she did, only slightly. Well according to Revenge of the Sith this would be quite a miracle since it appears that Amidala, who is Mother to both Luke & Leia dies during childbirth. Yes, an error to be sure, but if the film version even remotely lives up to what I read in the book, we are ALL in for an incredible treat for the senses. The Light Saber duels ought to be the best of ALL the other 5 films COMBINED. For the first time we get to see the Emperor take up a light saber against not just Mace Windu, but Master Yoda as well. For the first time we get to see exactly HOW Anakin went from looking like Hayden Christensen to looking like, well Darth Vader in all his black helmet-wearing glory. We read a tiny bit about it in Return of the Jedi, but trust me, it doesn't even come close to doing justice for how it is in the book and I can only imagine how stunning it ought to be visually.Only one other thing bugged me about the book, but mind you it is only a minor gripe at that: Every few chapters or so, the author attempts to put us inside the head of certain characters by saying lines like: This is what it is like to be Obi Wan RIGHT NOW. This is what it is like to be Anakin Skywalker, and soforth. I can't exactly say why, but it kind of bugged me a little. Other than that, I am quite pleased with the novel as well as the culmination of how things came to be at the beginning of Episode IV, A New Hope. An achievement which will make us Star Wars fans literally BEG George Lucas to just consider doing Episodes VII, VIII and IX. C'mon, George...can't you just CONSIDER it??? For the FANS????"},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I loved the book, how it was wrote, and how the auther gave the reader a view of the star wars universe through the eyes of the characters. I believe this book is a must read &amp; best Star Wars read.

All Star Wars fans will definatly be raving for the full 9 wars. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"You already know the plot, you already know most of the story. But don't go into this book expecting to read what you are going to see on screen. *SPOILER* For example....Kasyykk and the wookies are in the movie trailers quite a bit. Only a mere mention of them in the book.The brotherhood of Kenobi and Anakin.The evolution of the Empire.The death of the Jedi.Those were my favorite parts of the novel.A lot of people have their own ideas of how Anakin should be seduced to the darkside. I believe no one can tell it better than it was told.I knew what to expect from the story, but yet, it was still the hardest book for me to read. The last few paragraphs in this book.......I will never look at Episodes IV, V and VI the same way again."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Revenge of the Sith, the final piece of the puzzle of the Star Wars Universe, completes Anakin Skywalker's transformation to Darth Vader. The book effectively handles the personality conflicts which drive Anakin's transformation. After the book I was left feeling sad. However now, A New Hope definitely seems like one. This book made the 4th (first film) make more sense. I definitely felt that the Universe had become a grimer place with Vader's debut. I mourned the loss of some of my favorite Jedi.One character I did not expect to like so much was the emperor. For the intergalactic equivalent of satan, he really is portrayed as a very real person. In the book he really seems concerned for Anakin.This book is a must for any Star Wars junkie."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I just finished the Laberinth of Evil and I am most likely to read Episode 3 again.The only bad things were that Terry Brooks took to long on the begining and told us the story of what we were all waiting to know cramed into the ending. I mean Brooks made it to where when they are back on carascont after saving palpatine was on page 100. Thank god that Padme was pregnant. She is a women and wemon are supposed to stay at home watch the children and cook dinner."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"First, Stover tried, but he was stuck with Lucas's storyline.Anakin Skywalker has been nuttier than a fruitcake since the second episode. He doesn't change here either. So when he joins Palpatine there is no real surprise.He is drawn Passionless. In fact when he does the unthinkable (at least to Lucas) I didn't bat an eyelash.I wish I could say that Stover is a bad writer, but alas, a blaster was held to his head by his contract with George Lucas.George Lucas should NEVER have directed these prequels, and should have shared screen writing responsibles with a talent.I love the play (dialogue) between Leia and Hans in the Empire Strikes Back.Aside from my dissatisfaction, if you enjoy the Star Wars universe I recommend you get the book and check out the trailers."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Leia is a super genius- she's got memories of her mother, who died immediately after she was born.

Once again, we see that Lucas is ignorant of the fan's wishes and forgot to include something known as \\"substance and plot\\". Many of the fans of the series expected to see an in-depth look of Wookies in this novel--they will be sorely disappointed. Wookies do not appear in this novel at all. I can only guess that Wookies are written into the movie script as a visual and marketing ploy--much like the Yoda Fight Scene from the last film. Lucas too often in this prequel series has relied more on CG visual effects than engaging plotlines.Although Stover was allowed some license to explore some of the previously rarely appearing character, the Anakin Skywalker plotline is stuck substance less and predictable. While in the original series, I could see that Darth Vader was immersed in the Power of the Darkside. The political ramblings between characters and the weak love story only gives excuses as to why Anakin turns to the Dark Side. I would have rather seen how the power of the Darkside engages and seduces Anakin like an addictive substance--somewhat like the Ring of Power in the Lord of the Rings.Sci-fi should be written just as any good novel: engaging characters dropped into a steady, driving plot. You won't find that here."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"It is the worst book I've read in a long time.First, I hate the writing style. It is just irritating! I guess the author gets paid based on the number of pages of his book, so there is a incentive to put minimum amount of words in each line.Second, I hate the story. It is just so illogic. The Jedi doctrines are irrational and fundamentally flawed. It requires its believers to give without even thinking about getting anything back in return. Based on any laws of Mother Nature I can think of, I can't imagine anyone can sustain such kind of selfless act indefinitely, expect maybe white holes?!Third, Yoda and his Jedis are a bunch of mindless, ungraceful, self absorbed idiots. The entire Jedi order owns Skywalker everything, but none of them did anything to help him in anyway. They did not free his mother from slavery, which become the root cause of Anakin's fall. They did not help him when he becomes desperate about the fate of his wife. The only advice Yoda, supposedly the great teacher, can provide to his Chosen One is something like \\"get over with what ever in your mind\\", no wonder Anakin turns to Palpatine, who at least pays attention to him and his concerns.Over all, this book is a great letdown and I wish I can get my money back, not only for the price of the book, but my time wasted reading it."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This movie is too dark and violent for kids. The story is about how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. The main character spends most of the movie either brooding or killing people, including children. Killing kids? Give me a break. Can't Hollywood think of anything positive for our kids to watch? My children are big fans of all the Star Wars movies but I won't let them watch this one again. The story line is also slow. My 6 year old fell asleep 1/3 of the way through, and I didn't bother to wake him up."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith as a movie was bad. but at least it on;ly wasted 2.5 hours of my time.this book is soooo silly and sooooo long.Pity the reader."},{"Title":"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This is nto a review. ill review it when Ive finished it.

The cover was unattractive and quite plain. However, an inner-awareness told me to check out the book and to read it. I did so.I enjoyed the book immensely, enough to order a copy for myself! Mr Pulos' book put the hypnosis phenomena into a perspective that allowed me to comprehend and apply the principals to my daily activities. I actually was able to hypnotize myself for a brief period. I envy the author for his intelligence and insight.Between readings, I left the book on my bed. Without prodding, my wife skimmed the book; I knew that she is skeptical about these things. To my surprise, she read the book in its entirety. She said that she could relate to many of the elements in the book. She commented that this was one of the few books from which we both received mutual enlightenment! The book also served as a foundation for further reading on hypnosis."},{"Title":"Normality and pathology in childhood;: Assessments of development","review":"Anna Freud captures childhood in all its abundance from normality to pathology, its refreshing to see all sides of the cube."},{"Title":"Button Man: The Killing Game","review":"This is the story of a former mercenary named Harry Exton who is recruited by an old compadre into a \`game' in which soldiers of fortune are sponsored by wealthy investors (called Voices, because they're only heard on the telephone) to fight it out gladiatorial style in a variety of settings, from the nighted English countryside, to an abandoned tenement, to the very streets of London. There's a lot of \`dosh' to be made, but Harry doesn't like being boxed in. After a particularly deadly game, on a whim to test his Voice, he wonders aloud what would happen if he were to up and quit. That's enough for the Voices, and in the very next game Harry is set up for the kill. But Harry X is a lot more resourceful than they think...This is a great thriller which is bookended by a wounded Harry telling his incredible story to the doctor treating him. While the concept sounds like Hard Target, forget that bit of fluff. This is an extremely well crafted bit of British noir. The action is completely believable (if surpassingly violent at times). There are no slow mo two gun jumps from the fireball here. This is hard hitting, driven plotboiler with a lace of cool. The characters are as hard boiled as they come, and the story culminates in a classic twist.The art here is gritty and realistic - perfectly married to the writing. And is it just me or does Harry look a great deal like Sean Bean?Buy this if you can get it - it delivers."},{"Title":"Ahimsa: Buddhism and the Vegetarian Ideal","review":"\\"The purpose of this book is to try to better inform those Buddhists that consume their brothers of the animal kingdom as to the reasons why they should try to refrain.\\" So opens Ahimsa: Buddhism and the Vegetarian Ideal by Bodo Balsys, a book that is at times clearly stated, confusing, and strongly worded: \\"How can you truly be a spiritual being when you kill (animals) via the consequence of eating meat? Your intention to not harm is negated by your intention to eat meat. You are the perpetrator of suffering upon others. Your Buddhist vows are useless, let suffering rule the world you inadvertently say, as you eat the cow.\\"Ahimsa is geared primarily towards Tibetan Buddhist practitioners, a school of Buddhism that strongly teaches the ideals of compassion, yet, despite the Dalai Lama's recent reaffirmation of vegetarianism, still continues, at least unofficially, to condone the eating of meat. \\"[Tibetan Buddhists have a] rich culture and teachings on wisdom and compassion are examples that many in the West are inspired by,\\" writes Balsys, \\"apart from this major problem of a seeming hypocritical stance with respect to their four-footed brothers.\\"The book discusses all the typical, nonsensical excuses used by meat-eating Buddhists-the three-fold rule; insects die in growing the vegetarian's food and insects and cows are equal so we might as well eat meat; you shouldn't discriminate against anything, including animal or vegetable food-but also covers some more obscure, strictly Tibetan excuses as quoted by the title of chapter seven: \\"The Highest Yoga Tantra -or- It's alright for me to eat meat because in my mind I am the greatest of all yogis living in the most austere way in the Himalayan snows.\\"The author views the eating of flesh foods as a war between animals and men and likens it to the invasion of Tibet by China: \\"the digestion of a country through war and that of meat are similar, both are bloody.\\" While he certainly blames China for the invasion, he also sees Tibet as having built a karmic pathway for the take-over because the monks ate meat. He goes on to stress the importance of karma in all aspects of life, including our diet, discusses the discrimination people show toward one type of animal over another, and shares symbolic stories that convey the esoteric truth of human/animal rebirth.The author does a lovely job of putting flesh, so to speak, on the bones of the old saying \\"you are what you eat,\\" and discussing the environmental considerations of flesh foods, including deforestation, over grazing, and misuse of resources. There is one point, however, where Balsys seems misguided. While he advocates vegetarianism he says veganism is an extreme, boldly stating-and quite arbitrarily-that veganism \\"is not the Noble Middle Way for humanity at this stage.\\" This is as arbitrary as saying you can take a skateboard to work or a helicopter, so I'll opt for a Hummer as the Middle Way. I think that if you look at the extremes of not eating anything, or eating everything one can get your hand's on-and the latter is unfortunately practiced by many-the Middle Path would be eating to sustain a healthy life while being as compassionate as possible. This is a vegan diet, not a vegetarian diet that, while very good, still has many undesirable effects on the animal world.While parts of Ahimsa are clear, concise, and even poetic, it is at times clunky and rambling as if a poor translation (some of this may be due to my inexperience with Tibetan practice-I come from a Zen background). The author was born in Germany, attended university in Australia, and the book was published in India, so your guess is as good as mine as to what language the tome was originally written in. But some of this book is so well done that is excuses the parts that aren't.Ahims lays out a course on meditative healing, each chapter includes detailed and very welcome end notes, and the appendices include extracts from the Lankavatara Sutra, an exposition on the nature of karma, details of meat and dairy production (when reviewing this section of the manuscript, I would think that the author would have rethought his view on vegan versus vegetarian), the levels of Tantra, and an index.All in all, I believe The Great Compassion by Norm Phelps (which I also reviewed for Amazon and VeggieDharma.Org) to be a better book and the obvious choice (if you have to make one) between the two. However, if you have an interest in this subject or are a Tibetan Buddhist, I would strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ahimsa: Buddhism and the Vegetarian Ideal","review":"i am a vegetarian who does personal reading/study of eastern religious/spiritual subjects. i bought this book in hopes of finding more information or a deeper view of ahimsa than i had found in other texts, and i did. presented in chapters that read like a collection of debate-like essays on related topics, this volume offered me deeper explanation of vegetarianism as an act of ahimsa and the wide spanning chain reaction that can come from both vegetarianism and meat eating. the arguments include scripture excerpts and their interpretations as used to support both eating habits-- but of course the author more heavily supports vegetarianism and offers good reasoning for this.unfortunately, the writing style of this text can become confusing. perhaps this is because the author is not a native to the english language, and this text was printed by an indian publisher. also, for those not well versed in tibetan buddhism, some concepts are difficult to grasp. i found this challenging and a source for more study, but not all readers will be pleased.overall, i feel this is an excellent text and will continue to suggest it to those i believe will find interest or benefit from it."},{"Title":"Ahimsa: Buddhism and the Vegetarian Ideal","review":"It's not the book's fault or the author's fault that this is a little more philosophical than I expected.

The illustrations are wonderful."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"I have experienced diverse worship styles in churches, differing definitions of what that worship means, and confusion as to why worship is essential for the Christan life. In many churches today, there seems to be more of a concern for putting on a show, big productions, etc. than for drawing people into a deeper fellowship with God. For some, worship has become the central theme of their Christian experience, and for others, something that &quot;those wacky Charismatics&quot; experience. Tozer, with prophetic insight, reveals the problem with the church today in relation to its worship and this distressing fact: many in this age have never experienced the sweet fellowship with God that can only come through intiamte worship as the creature to the Creator. This book is highly recommended for all sincere Christians who desire to move past the outer courts of &quot;showy&quot; worship, and into the holy of holies where true worship can be experienced."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"What a thought provoking book! Tozer seeks to inform the reader, or hearer in it's original delivery,that worship is more than a Sunday morning experience. There is more to worship than it's corporate function that most of us know it for. He has no qualms with laying it on the line with statements similar to this. If your not worshiping on Monday then you probably didn't have a genuine experience on Sunday.This book was written based on Tozer's desire to write it. It's content is based on a series of sermons he delivered about worship, but was unable to write due to his death. Worship is about a lifestyle dedicated unto God! Reading this book will give you opportunity to evaluate your relationship in worshiping God."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"Tozer writes (or speaks) with such grace and clarity that even 40 years later his words remain fresh, engaging and suited to our everyday language. He longs and agonizes over getting Christians to understand that \\"...glad and devoted and reverent worship is the normal employment of moral beings.\\"13In this short book Tozer is not attacking any particular for of worship but rather, with adequate Scriptural examples, redefines the heart of the matter and states that \\"True worship of God must be a constant and consistent attitude or state of mind within the believer.\\"24 That is, worship can neither be confined to Sunday nor can it have any pleasure to God when our hearts and minds are full of sin.'tis a beautifully worded book on this topic and takes a very different aim than most. Tozer isolates an unfortunate trend and condition with Christendom, namely our improper view of God and loss of fear. He impresses upon us the greatness and pure holiness of our God and can then define the \\"fear of God\\" as \\"...astonished reverence, breathless adoration, awesome fascination, lofty admiration of the attributes of of and something of the breathless silence that we know when God is near.\\"30Much of this book takes you away from our plastic gods and limp ideas of God to a deep and revealing study of our awesome creator and sustainer. For truly, Tozer would ask: \\"How can anyone ever worship God acceptably without knowing what kind of God He really is.\\"41This book is not amunition for our worship wars, but a rekindling of our inner fire and proper awe of God. A great morning devotional."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"I think this book is deep. Its not a book about you and how you can get God to do more for you. This book is all about God, but in saying that it means this book is all about you. Read it and read it slow. It will be boring because our excitement doesn't from reading about God, but from ourselves, so press on through the boredom until you hit pay dirt. The pay dirt is the desire to worship Him and in this desire we experience him and in experiencing Him, we are most content."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"It was in good condition and just what I needed to do a devotional with my Worship team at church."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","review":"Not a bad book, but not actually written by Tozer on the subject of worship.

Jo Gallant, the aged granddaughter of Charles Warren, claims that this particular book, along with the rest of a substantial collection of Burton memorabilia, was stolen from her grandfather's estate eighty years ago. Janeway, now a \\"bookman\\" who buys and sells antique books, promises to find the collection and bring the culprits to justice, if any trace of them can be found.As the search gets underway, author John Dunning inserts a long historical recreation, in which Charlie Warren and Richard Burton travel together to Charleston and Fort Sumter in 1860, leading Charlie to suspect that Burton is spying for England, taking advantage of the pre-Civil War tumult in the Union. This story, based on Burton's notes and drawings, Charlie's journal, and a photograph of the two men, all part of the stolen memorabilia, fill the search for Jo Gallant's collection with color and historical excitement and give life to the friendship of Burton and Warren.As the story of Charlie and Burton is further developed with Jo's recollections of her grandfather, as revealed under hypnosis, the old and the contemporary story intersect, and violence shatters the life of Janeway. A murder, a house fire, the theft of documents, the influence of the criminal underworld, sleazy book dealings, and beatings and mayhem keep the action quotient high as Janeway seeks the remainder of the collection and the killer of an innocent person.Though the book is great fun, it relies heavily on coincidence to make connections between the stories. The reader is never allowed to forget the presence of an author who is actively pulling strings to keep the two-phased plot moving. The story does not evolve naturally out of the characters and their lives. Instead, the peripheral characters seem created for the purpose of moving the story in the \\"right\\" direction. This artificiality ultimately affects the reader's enjoyment of the story.The third novel in Dunning's five-novel Janeway series, this audio edition is read by George Guidall, arguably the best reader in the audiobook business, a man who tells the story \\"straight.\\" Though it is easy to recognize individual characters, Guidell wisely does not try to imitate female voices, southern accents, and tough dialect. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Bookman's Promise [Audiobook] [Cd] [Unabridged] (Nero Wolfe)","review":"This should not have \\"(Nero Wolfe)\\" in the listing title as it is not a Nero Wolfe book.

Out of the whole CCNP curriculum, this was by far the dullest of subjects, but at the hands of Thomas &amp; Quiggle, it was handled nicely. All chapters were clearly written, though the practice questions at the ends of the chapters could have been tougher. The big problem, though, is the fact that this book is full of errors. Thankfully, they're mostly of the editorial kind, glaring at the reader from the page. They actually helped me to see whether I was following the text properly in my mind. If something was out of order, it immediately jumped at me.

I did NOT read Graig Dennis' Cream book but I did all practice questions. I spent one day read briefly on Catherine Paquet's BCRAN book and did all questions on each chapter(Very good questions). I believe ANY single one of those books contains ALL the information you will need to pass the test. The question is how much you can understand the technology only based on the reading. I have to say, I work on the remote access on the daily basis, but still there were a couple of questions on the test I was clueless (the solutions are on Catherine's book but I doubt if I would pay attention on them even I read).

It goes a step beyond all the other BCRAN study guides out there. It is obvious that the author intended to go beyond the BCRAN objectives and wants you to use it well after you have finished the exam. While many of the other books tell you to how to implement TCP/IP over PPP, none show you how to implement IPX/SPX and NetBEUI over PPP! (For material not related to the exam they make sure to note it before he discusses it). Another example of how the author went the extra mile is the inclusion of an extra chapter on implementing VPDN's (L2F and L2TP). This subject matter can not be found in any other BCRAN book!I found the approach to the material excellent, because they always start out by discussing the technology without regard to any Cisco product. Once finished, he shows how to implement the concepts using Cisco equipment. Then there are the case studies which give you a chance to do it yourself, and if you are having problems there are step by step instructions showing you not just how to do it, but why you need to use that command. While some of the case studies have some mistakes, if you are CCNA you should easily catch those mistakes (missing subnet mask when setting an IP address, etc.)I give this book an A+.

After sixty years it has lost none of it's punch and should be required reading for modern thriller and mystery writers that insist on putting every violent and gory act \\"onstage\\". All of the murders here happen off-screen, yet it is a frightening and ugly book, hard to put down.Dix Steele, the protagonist, is one of many WWII vets who came home and found nothing to satisfy himself after the war, either personally or professionally. Dix also happens to be a brutal serial killer, something we begin to realize as the novel tells the story of Dix on the west coast, pretending to write a book while living at the apartment of an old friend (who we come to believe Dix has killed). Dix is a taker, who contributes and does nothing each day except for sleep, drink, eat, look for women, and sometimes rape and stalk them before strangling them. Like Jim Thompson's classic \\"The Killer Inside Me\\", Dix makes feeble attempts to explain his actions to himself (much like \\"the sickness\\" Thompson's characer in \\"Killer\\" suffers from, Dix seems to have to kill each month to satisfy the urges within himself). However, we soon realize with his many lies and evasions and fantasies that Dix, while a smart and deadly killer, is also a lonely and desperate man who won't even try to fit into the real world.The novel takes off as Dix looks up one of his war buddies, Brub, and his wife Sylvia, telling them he is working on a book and borrowing a friend's apartment for a year. Brub is now a detective with the police and renewing their friendship gives Dix an excuse to keep up with the case from the police side,the case of lone girls raped and strangled late at night. Dix begins hanging out more and more with Brub (who has been assigned to the case) while playing a sort of cat and mouse game with Brub and the police. Dix also at about the same time meets Laurel, a gorgeous neighbor whom he begins to have an affair with, but his feelings become too strong too quickly and here Dix begins making mistakes in his frustration...mistakes Brub and his fellow police begin taking advantage of as the murders continue.Hughes does a masterful job here. Dix is a chilling example of a true psychopath, able to keep the veneer of civilization about him even though in his heart no one or nothing matters. Hughes lets us into Dix's mind just enough to see what could have possibly led to this....his terrible childhood, his overbearing and domineering uncle, his time in the service, the girl he loved and lost in Europe....but in the end we may never really now why Dix does what he does. The dialogue crackles with menace, the descriptions of post-war Hollywood are on target, and the metaphors of consumerism (Dix continually wants things that he cannot have or afford, and one gets the feeling he also kills out of frustration of this as much as sexual psychopathy) and fame are expertly weaved into the tale. That all the murders happen off-screen is a great device and rather than lessening the suspense, if anything makes the tale more chilling. As the net around Dix tightens, we are torn with wanting him to be caught or killed, or wanting him to make an escape as he has done many times before...the mark of a good writer is to feel something for the protagonist, and Hughes does here job here.\\"In a Lonely Place\\" should be read by anyone fascinated by the post-WWII noir novel, this is one that influenced the many great noir films of the 40s and 50s as well as writers like Jim Thompson and Robert Bloch (Psycho) and their portrayals of women-killers."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"I read this book after seeing the 1950 movie. Other than character names, location, and murder of Mildred, there is very little in common between book and film. Still, it is a good read."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"I love re-reading books, but I doubt I'll ever give IN A LONELY PLACE a second go. Not because it's a dull story or a badly written novel, but because in a sense it's almost too effective. Author Dorothy Hughes' venture into the mind of a serial killer in post-WW2 Los Angeles is gripping noir, but also mentally and morally exhausting. I may be slightly prejudiced because I happen to live almost exactly in the neighborhood where most of this novel takes place, but regardless of the reason, the book still kinda made me want to scrub out my brain after I finished it.IN A LONELY PLACE is the story of Dickson Steele, an ex-Air Force pilot who has come to Los Angeles with many secrets, not the least of which is that his hobby is raping and murdering women. When he runs into his old war buddy Brub Nicolai, he's at once alarmed and thrilled by the discovery that Brub has become a detective in the Beverly Hills police department, and is trying to solve the very murders that he, Dix, is committing. While enjoying what he sees as a a kind of ongoing in-joke at his friend's expense, Dix soon develops an attraction to a wanna-be actress in his apartment complex named Laurel Gray, but Laurel's presence in Dickson's life throws him off his game. On the one hand, he genuinely loves the hard and sultry Laurel; on the other, he genuinely hates women - especially Brub's attractive and too-shrewd wife, Sylvia. And when Dix Steele feels stress, his only relief is indulging in his hobby.IN A LONELY PLACE is in many ways classic noir. It was written in 1947, and a sense of postwar disappointment pervades every page, along with a feeling that Dickson somehow represents the stereotype of the midcentury American male gone horribly wrong. In one sense has all the traits associated with maniless - a danger-loving loner who drinks hard, loves hard, wears the right clothes, drives the right car and plays by his own rules, he could be the archetypal hero of any hundred detective or adventure novels, except that each of these traits is as twisted as a corkscrew. His daredevilry takes the form of a sick cat-and-mouse game played for cheap thrills, his sexuality is mixed up with misogyny and sadism, and his easygoing lifestyle is predicated on theft and parasitism. As for playing by his own rules, they amount to to thinking, apropos of one of his victims, \\"the only exciting thing that had ever happened to her was to be raped and murdered.\\" Being inside his mind is a grim and disheartening experience, a sort of tour-de-force of the worst aspects of human desires. In a sense he's a kind of metaphor for frustrated Hollywood types who are long on ambition but short on talent and scruples. And this is the novel's strength as well as its weakness, because Dix is such a total rotter that after a while you just want to put the book down and take a shower. And yet it's a testament to the strength of Hughes' cool, cynical, intensely personal prose that you don't put the book down. You have to keep reading, keep peeling back the layers of this rotten onion to see if there's anything at the core. Whether Hughes delivers that last explanatory kernel a matter of opinion; Dix's final utterance could be seen as an unsatisfying cop-out or a brilliant bit of existential simplicity. Who knows? Maybe I'll have to read the damned thing again after all, just to decide."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"An effectively creepy and believable portrait of a rage-driven serial killer.Quite unlike the famous (and excellent) movie based on the book, both in plot and in mood."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"\\"In a Lonely Place\\" is a neglected classic of American crime fiction. Harder than hard-boiled, it follows the actions of a vicious serial killer in post-war Los Angeles. The antihero, Dixon Steele, maintains the appearance of an average guy while periodically venting his anger and hatred of women by raping and strangling random girls that he picks up. Through the course of the book, he plays a cat-and-mouse game with his old army buddy, now a detective, who has been assigned to solve the case.Published in 1947, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; is different from much of today's standard serial killer fare. Unlike books such as \\"Hannibal\\" or \\"Red Dragon,\\" all the violence occurs offstage, during gaps in the narration. But that doesn't make it any less scary--in fact, it ups the creepiness quotient considerably. Hughes tells her story from the point of view of the \\"perp\\" himself, with all the events filtered through Steele's eyes and thoughts. Normal in the book is what's normal to the killer whose solitary, predatory nature places him \\"in a lonely place\\" outside of the rest of humanity. His anger, his misogyny, his hatred of those richer than he, and his sense of entitlement justify his actions in his own mind. By keeping the gore offstage, the author maintains the focus on the killer's twisted mind, which is where the true horror lies.\\"In a Lonely Place\\" was made into a movie in 1950 starring Humphrey Bogart (who else?) and Gloria Grahame. The film kept some of the elements of the book, but switched the focus to domestic violence. Dark as the film is (and it's a masterpiece of film noir), the book is even darker. If you're looking for a play-by-play novelization of the movie, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a character study of a killer's mind, then turn on the night light and dig in."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"How is it that Dorothy B. Hughes's great suspense novels of the 1940s have fallen into oblivion? This is clearly a situation for a nervy publisher like Godine or Dalkey Archive to rectify, as the more conventional ones, like Vintage, remain clueless. And here's a good place to begin. Written in 1947, In a Lonely Place was one of the first American novels to broach the subject of a serial killer--it was instantly followed by a host of imitators in the late '40s and early '50s. (Other than the Belloc-Lowndes The Lodger, a 1912 UK novel, the theme had been long neglected.) Hughes's approach is psychological stream-of-consciousness; she traces the cat and mouse game of the sociopathic Dix Steele who, reuniting with an old war buddy turned cop, comes along for the chase to find the murderer. If you know the great Nicholas Ray film with Bogart, don't expect much resemblance--Ray took only the title and the names of most of the characters. Though like the movie, the novel is a brilliantly claustrophobic look at LA in the postwar years. The violence is offstage, the pathology on. Hughes's ability to penetrate a man's mind is remarkable and never less than credible. She wrote only a handful of books (The Fallen Sparrow, Ride the Pink Horse, and The Davidian Report are her other benchmark novels) but they deserve a closer look--they are compulsively readable, prophetic, and apparently timeless."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Dorothy B. Hughes is certainly a powerful (and sadly over-looked) writer. In \\"In a Lonely Place\\" she depicts a vivid, hypnotic vision of post-WW2 LA, and she draws a scarily realistic and sometimes sympathetic portrait of \\"protagonist\\" Dix Steele. The novel is notable for its narrative twists & turns, its suspense (that most of the 'action' is not explicity show is both terrifying and brilliant, from a technical standpoint), and its tendency to turn both traditional noir structure and stock characters on their heads, so to speak. If you like noir or Cold War-era-informed fiction, give the unusual, the compelling, and the bone-chilling \\"In a Lonely Place\\" a chance."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Great mystery tale told from the point of view of a bad guy. Although somewhat forgotten today, Hughes was a superstar writer in her time. Her novels had been adapted into movies for Robert Montgomery and Humphery Bogart. Compelling fiction with strongly drawn characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"In a Lonely Place by Dorothy Hughes is written as a third person narration told from the perspective of Dix Steele, a cold blooded murderer. The evocative prose used by the author masterfully transports the reader to Los Angeles, circa 1947, where a series of rape/murders has been plaguing the area with no end in sight. It should be noted that the book contains no graphic violence. All killings take place off the written page.There are four major characters: Dix Steele, an outwardly appearing normal WWII veteran, who in actuality is a remorseless killer. Brub Nicholai, Steele's old war buddy, who by remarkable coincidence is now a police officer trying to solve the murders his own friend is committing. Laurel Gray, an ambitious starlet who becomes Steele's lover. And Sylvia Nicholai, Brub's wife and perceived nemesis to Steele.One of the most interesting aspects of In a Lonely Place is that the reader is privy to the inner thoughts of the killer as he goes about his daily activities; shaving, going to the dry cleaners, stopping for fast food, etc. Through most of the novel, Steele is acutely aware of his surroundings, always on the lookout for signs of law enforcement's watchful eye. Yet, when the police finally do catch on to him, he becomes all but oblivious to their not so subtle attempts to observe his increasingly desperate actions.In a Lonely Place is an artfully written, original take on the crime novel.

If you are into noir, at some point you need to read this book to complete your perspective."},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"This 1947 thriller by Dorothy B. Hughes is a master of its type--cold, unrelenting, yet tastefully done and nicely written. It isn't filled with blood and gore. Its violence is implied, forcing the gorefest fanatic elsewhere to sate his blood lust. Miss Hughes tells her story in a gripping style, placing ill-fated characters in a setting brimming with darkness and desperation, a cold tale that leads to a sudden, jaw-dropping climax. Don't confuse this novel with the 1950 film--Hollywood transformed the main characters as well as the theme, making the story a watered-down tale of domestic violence among the Hollywood set. Don't get me wrong--I've been a Bogart fan for many years. But I have to be honest. The film did not do this superb, chilling tale a shred of justice.David BerardelliAuthor of FATAL INNOCENCE"},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Dorothy Hughes was one hell of a writer. You may think you know this book from the movie with the same name with Humphrey Bogart, but that movie changed the story so substantially as to create a much different story line.In a Lonely Place is the tale of a psychotic WWII veteran turned killer who preys on lonely women at night. It's told from his perspective, albeit in third person. The scene is Los Angeles. The time is just after the war. The murders are senseless and seemingly random. The fault is all Dix's, the protagonist. The victims were in the classic wrong place, wrong time. Hughes does a very good job of feeding us a drip line of insights which begin to fill in the back story, and the first murder Dix committed in England. Yet, we really don't know that much factual information about him, nor do we ever. Most of our insight comes from interior dialogue in Dix's twisted mind. Hughes dribbles out key insights with the deft hands of a master writer.I was reminded of two authors continuously while reading this. The first is the late great Patricia Highsmith, another very gifted author from the mid century. The other is Dostoyevsky, especially his Crime and Punishment. Both are famous psychological authors and the slow, gradual closing in on Dix is very reminiscent of their best works.There's a marvelous afterword by a University of Cincinnati professor which does a great job of laying Hughes technique bare. As she points out, the irony of having a post-modern feminist deconstruction of masculine identity being told from the point of view of a male serial murderer is rich indeed. What Hughes achieves in this book is not just a superb thriller, not just a great piece of literature, but a searching of sexual identity in the modern world. This book will stay with you long after you have put it down.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"In a Lonely Place (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Despite having seen and enjoyed the film featuring Humphrey Bogart, I got this book, knowing it deviated from the screenplay (or, rather, the screenplay had deviated from this original novel!).

But I enjoyed Larry's perspective on suffering and I wish I wish I lived closer, as I would be attending his church!He acknowledges that when Christians suffer their first response is to question God and seek some understanding for their pain. In \\"Why Me?\\", he explains that it is not always possible to find easy answers to life's most difficult questions. But . . . we can find good--and God--in all of our circumstance and that discovering joy alongside the pain is possible.Larry has had his share of physical pain and has an understanding heart when it comes to those who physically suffer with pain, illness, and injuries. He has used the canes and crutches. He has sat in the wheelchair. He would say that his pain is minor in comparison to many of those with chronic illness, and yet, he has experienced pain and I think that always adds an additional understanding for those who are reading his words.The chapters include:1.

I found the little book and cards to be frustrating for multiple reasons. The flash cards get out of alphabetical order easily, so it's hard to look something up; and there are only about 50-60 signs featured in each set. Words that my son would really like to be able to express, like \\"light\\" and \\"fan\\" and \\"otter\\" and \\"frog,\\" are missing. Additionally, some of the words from the book and flash cards overlap, but the two formats disagree about what the signs are!So, based on the reviews and on the number of signs included, I couldn't wait to get the Random House Webster's Concise American Sign Language Dictionary. The book does have a lot going for it. If you know the alphabet in sign language (and it's included in the book, in case you don't), the descriptions of signs really help clarify the illustrations. As soon as we got the book, I looked up \\"light\\" and \\"frog,\\" and I was delighted to be able to sign them to my son. Catching my excitement, he signed \\"light\\" back right away. But \\"otter\\" was missing from the dictionary. \\"Well,\\" I thought, \\"maybe there is no sign for 'otter.'\\" No huge loss, since my son does an endearing otter impression anyway.But then I discovered that \\"fan\\" has also been left out of the dictionary. \\"Fan\\" is a pretty basic and common word, so I assume that there is a specific sign for it.Examples of words that ARE included: ascend, delegate, optimistic, sightseeing, humid, dominoes, rehabilitation, sterilization, robot, sacrifice, slavery, porpoise, hawk, pimples, zap, worship, prostitute, puzzle, diamond, lesbian, loiter, merchandise.Examples of words that AREN'T included: otter, squash, fan, beaver, whale, moose, ceiling, kaleidoscope, owl, crow, robin, quail, raven, tiger, zebra, wolf, coyote, tractor, mow, guava, tortilla, quesadilla, spinach, wheel, cactus, cardinal.Being able to say words like \\"rehabilitation\\" is definitely useful; it would take a long time to spell them out. But I think I probably talk about fans more often than I talk about robots. This is a self-proclaimed concise dictionary, and there is a note at the beginning of the book about which words were included and which words weren't (and why), but that still doesn't help me sign \\"squash\\" or \\"moose.\\"I don't know that anyone cares, but the copy of this book that we received does have a slightly different cover than the one pictured. The picture shows hands in a single sign, whereas our book features five full-color photos of a woman signing. I actually like the one we got better than the one pictured.Oh, and previous reviews indicate that the alphabet and numbers are listed in the back of the book. Numbers are still at the back of the book, but each letter of the alphabet now appears at the start of the section of words beginning with that letter.Overall, I was torn between giving the book three stars and four.

I searched for a dictionary that would meet our family's needs as being easy to use, small enough to carry in the diaper bag, and good for those new to learning ASL. I reviewed other ASL dictionaries and this one best met our needs. What I like most is that it lists the greatest number of words. Because there are fewer words in the ASL vocabulary (for example, the same sign can mean beautiful AND pretty) sometimes we look up one of the words that does not have a direct ASL equivalent. This book refers the user to the correct word. In some other dictionaries, there is simply no entry so the user is left trying to figure out other words to look up. I also like the price and that the author is respected in her field."},{"Title":"Random House Webster's Concise American Sign Language Dictionary","review":"I am fairly new to ASL, and I find this fairly easy to use.

I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two."},{"Title":"Siamese Fighting Fish (The Guide to Owning...)","review":"For anyone looking to find a detailed resource on the care of betta splendens, this book is not for you. A great deal of space in this book is devoted to the history of the fish, how they fight with other males (there are even explicit pictures of this process, which I was certainly not interested in seeing), and how to breed them. The sections covering their care are woefully lacking - the page on diseases merely lists the ailments and then offers a recommendation for another book in which to find more information. The tone of this book also stunned me - it is apparent that the author thinks of these fish as a source of income rather than as pets. Mention is made of fish that are not &quot;exciting or saleable,&quot; and how sub-standard hatchlings should be culled or disposed of. I was quite offended by this - even the most dully-colored betta could find a happy home somewhere! The only reason I'm giving this book one star at all is because there are a lot of beautiful photos inside. It looks more like a picture book than anything else, actually. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Siamese Fighting Fish (The Guide to Owning...)","review":"I thought this book was pretty good.

It left me wanting to know more."},{"Title":"Siamese Fighting Fish (The Guide to Owning...)","review":"This book has actually very scant information about casual betta pet ownership, focusing rather on discussions valuable for the breeder/hobbyist. In spite of this caveat, this is a great little betta book - if for nothing more than the fabulous and unusual betta pictures! WOW!The book opens with a trip down betta history - the careful breeding, the fiercely wagered fighting matches, etc. This is followed with a bit of \\"care and feeding\\"...which obviously does not hold the author's attention for long, since we quickly move on to a great series of \\"koi\\" - variegated gold and black - betta photos.The breeder will learn lots of tips from the award-winning betta breeder's insights. Following and documenting the \\"butterfly trait\\" is one such topic - brilliantly captured in dozens of full color shots.The rare \\"albino trait story\\" is told, from the perspective of the author's re-discovery and subsequent loss of the strain. Anyone who knows about the betta albino situation will appreciate the author's first-hand account.Advanced topics like judging and showing bettas are also nicely presented. What do the judges look for? How are points awarded? How are show fish presented? At this time, I have not found this information presented in any other betta care book.The near-obligatory betta breeding and fry rearing hints are here, with plenty of photographs for every step along the way. Non-breeders (ie - typical pet betta parents) will enjoy seeing the mating process so clearly documented.Don't pick this book up for disease and treatment tips - barely half a page is devoted to disease. I *do* appreciate their emphasis on prevention (ie - clean water, proper temperatures and a good diet) and observation being the best treatment for betta illness.Rather, just get this book to excite yourself about the possibilities of great color variations from responsible and knowledgeable breeding. The author had been one of the top breeders in his field and helped make the betta collecting hobby as exciting as it is today."},{"Title":"Siamese Fighting Fish (The Guide to Owning...)","review":"This book offers basic information to starting hobbyists about the physiology, care, maintenance and breeding of the Betta splendens species, as well as the rearing of fry.

However, it is a valuable resource for people wishing to breed Bettas as it contains extensive information on this topic. Personally, I enjoyed reading the historical background surrounding Betta breeding and evolution. This is truly a remarkable species of fish, and the author brought this out nicely. In addition, the photographs were better than any I have seen and the text was well composed.However, like some other readers, I had a big problem with the information presented on Betta fighting. I know that the text is dated, written for a different era of betta owners (in the 1980s maybe?).

I very much enjoyed this story when I first read it, enough that I even re-read it a few years later, something I seldom ever do. This one is about a murder on a planet where humans and aliens co-exist, and not just any murder: it looks as if the murder may have been done by an alien for inexplicable reasons. Sort of an early precursor to the I, Robot film I guess. I wish I could give more details; I would whole-heartedly recommend this one to any teen-aged reader; it is a good story, and I remember it fondly still a quarter century later. It really stands out in my memory. For adults, I imagine it is still a good story and might be worth tracking down."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer","review":"Schopenhauer by D.W. Hamlyn, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1985, 192 ff.Like most biographies of Schopenhauer, this book focuses on his greatest work, The World as Will and Representation (WWR). The author was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, London, when this book was written. After a brief Introduction, David Hamlyn devotes 30 pages to Schopenhauer's PhD thesis, On the Four-fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason - basically, a classification of different kinds of causes and effects. Schopenhauer supports Kant's classification of mathematics, space and time as synthetic a priori concepts. Here, Schopenhauer identifies knowledge with consciousness. Thus, the principle of causality is presupposed in perception and cannot be derived from perception.After a short chapter on the relation between Schopenhauer's Will and the ideas of Plato and, more particularly, Kant, Hamlyn tackles first The World as Representation and then The World as Will, the first two Books of Schopenhauer's major work. When Schopenhauer opens with \`The world is my idea', the meaning is that all we can know of the world is what we perceive through the senses - elaborating a view found earlier in Kant (and Locke). A difficulty with this view in Schopenhauer, as Hamlyn points out (again drawing on the Fourfold Root) is that \`the relation between sensation and perception is not a causal one, even if it presupposes the law of causality.' This is because the concept of causality, being innate, is part of Kant's noumenal and Schopenhauer's Will.The chapter on The World as Will identifies Will, as does Schopenhauer, as Kant's unknowable Thing-in-itself or noumenal dimension of the world. However, Hamlyn says it would be wrong \`to take the will as being . . . a kind of force which permeates nature and which thus governs all phenomena,' though that is precisely the view that emerges from another of Schopenhauer's works, On the Will in Nature. Elsewhere, Schopenhauer compares the role of will to that of God, except that will is essentially evil rather than good - but then Schopenhauer was an atheist. Will is the source of our continual questing in the natural world, which leads to human discontent (the dukkha of Buddhist philosophy) and violent competition in the animal world.The next chapters of Hamlyn deal with art and ethics, the subjects of Books 3 and 4 of WWR. Schopenhauer sees will as the will to live and, despite our continual torment, he says that suicide remains a \`useless and foolish act'. The route to escape the anxiety of life is through art and music.This is a book for serious students of philosophy. A more accessible introduction to Schopenhauer's work for the general reader is the book by Christopher Janaway in Oxford's Very Short Introduction Series.Howard Jones is the author of The World as SpiritKant: A Very Short Introduction by Roger Scruton"},{"Title":"Novell's Certified Internet Business Strategist Study Guide","review":"I took the Novell courses and have the student study guides, but I probably could have done just as well using this book alone.

Many interviewees discouraged the author from this task, but he persevered, and we have much to thank him for. All Benny Hill fans will now watch and enjoy his familiar sketches -- shamelessly recycled over the years -- with an added appreciation for their origins and rationale. Lewisohn helps us to delve into the psyche of this mysterious man, at once the embodiment of little Englishness, yet also a sensitive soul and a student of foreign cultures and languages.The book is not unblemished. Benny's 50s farce, \\"Who Done It\\", is not nearly as abysmal as the author suggests (it's adequate slapstick with a few laughs -- how many 50s British movies has Lewisohn seen, there are many worse!). Benny's frugality is surely comprehensible in a man who had withstood wartime privations; and that character trait, combined with the much-hyped locker-room chit-chat with Bob Monkhouse, was regrettable but entirely standard male behavior for the 1950s. Despite all the conventional wisdom to the contrary, Benny did evolve. And--again with respect to Lewisohn--Benny scaled some of his finest heights of inspiration during his latest years with Thames. I am thinking of the Chubby Dodds documentary, and Murder on the Orient Express, and the \\"Family\\" skit, which bring smiles and laughter without fail, though I know them back to front. Of course, he was a comedian who operated rather too comfortably within his decent but clearly defined artistic parameters. Yet what was comforting for Benny was also reassuring for us... Lewisohn is right that Benny Hill's work will return to favor some day. It deserves to."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"Good but slightly flawedI bought this book not only because BCCA started to run the half-hour series again, but because I remembered reading a story in the paper a number of years ago how Benny Hill died alone in a sparsely furnished apartment, unloved.What I got was a tremendous insight into English vaudeville and its morphing into radio and then television. I also got a tremendous amount of information about Hill's life, as other reviews note. I would, however, like to focus this review on the author's highly critical look at Benny Hill's work after he brought together the Hill's angels. The author unabashedly takes the feminist line that these programs were sexist, and there's no doubt that while the programs themselves were probably enough to get the feminists atwitter, now that BBCA is showing the uncut hour long shows, Hill's on air ridicule of the feminists was what really did it. I hadn't seen the hour long shows when I read the biography, so I more or less took the author at his word. Now that I've seen them, I have two comments. In no way are the Hill's Angels in any way objectionable. The author's comment, what did they have to do with comedy, is misdirected because they had everything to do with framing the skits that were carried within the performances. I think some of Hill's best work was done in these years.My second comment is more of a revelation. I've always wondered exactly what it was that set Hill apart, the quality that no one else could or ever will duplicate. I realized watching these later shows that Hill had done something no one else had ever been able to do. He brought vaudeville, in its true form, to television. From childhood, he was steeped in, although unsuitable for, vaudeville. Television gave his strength, an acute eye for vaudeville, and his weakness, an inability to project beyond the tenth row of seats, the perfect format. It happened once, and that's the only time it will ever happen.Finally, as to his death alone in a sparsely furnished room. The picture of Hill dead looks pretty bleak. However, the author makes one thing clear. Benny Hill did in life exactly as he pleased, lived his life exactly the way he wanted to live it, and knowing he was going to die soon, died exactly the way he wanted to die, eating candy bars, drinking, and watching his beloved TV. He had no regrets about anything in life and he was surrounded by people who loved him dearly. Even his failed romances weren't romances, but attempts to reach for unattainable women so he never had to make a commitment that would limit his freedom to do as he pleased. The one time he was expected to make a commitment, he ran fast. Hill did what he wanted in life, and to do that, he had to live and travel alone, and that's exactly what he did. Definitely buy this book, but don't let the author's prejudices dissuade you from enjoying all of Hill's work. As to the author's hope the British return to an appreciation of Hill, it'll never happen, but that doesn't stop us from enjoying him."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"An excellent biography of the funniest man who ever stole a gag from another comedian. Yes it's Benny Hill, a man who took a name because is sounded Jewish and wrote some of the funniest songs ever using the most recycled of jokes.His humour was what the people wanted in the seventies, coarse slightly obscene and saucy. He deserved the title of the the worlds most popular comedian. It was a shame that Benny ended up as a target for feminists and other politically correct groups and was eventually sacked for his humour. The people that hounded him must have been very humourless, cold hearted people indeed.The book is great though there are few mistakes here and there with respect to show titles and content. I recommend anyone who is interested in British actors and theatre read this book.Tim BrimelowMelbourne Australia"},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"This is a fascinating, first-rate biography of one of the twentieth century's most beloved comedy figures; a man who is now largely overlooked in his home country despite having been its most successful comic export outside of Charlie Chaplin. Benny Hill was a complex man who led a simple (if somewhat peculiar) life, and this book provides tremendous insight into not only his personal foibles and professional endeavors, but also the motivations and reasons for his intriguing private behavior and public rise and fall. Drawing on extensive research and fresh interviews with many of the key figures in Benny's life, Mark Lewisohn's writing combines warmth, empathy and humor with analysis, objectivity and attention to detail -- the comic inventiveness and outright stealing of other artists' ideas; the abnormally excessive frugality; the sexual indulgences and hopelessly failed relationships... whether you want to know about the man's career, his love life or the fact that he just loved a quick game of Kalooki, it's all here. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"This book is a tremendously thorough examination of Benny's life, and there are some surprises here for those who are only aware of him through his television shows. Lewisohn pulls no punches and leaves very little unturned, both good and bad. It is unfortunate that Benny is now almost taboo in his own country. Having read this book, I will appreciate his comedy in a different light."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"Make no mistakes. This is indeed the definitive biography of Benny Hill's life. Exhaustively researched, complete with interviews, at 439 pages, it stands above the rest of Benny Hill biographies, although, to be fair, there aren't all that many. However, I wouldn't recommend it to any Benny Hill fans. Then again, I probably wouldn't recommend any Benny Hill biography. The man, whether deliberately or by blind luck, was a bit of a Sphinx. An enigma wrapped in a frock wearing a wig.\\"Funny, Peculiar\\" tries to get us a little closer to the man who was Fred Scuttle by giving his life the standard show biz biography. Dark secrets are revealed (Although compared to some entertainers, Mr. Hill's secrets weren't all that dark), family relationships are superficially explored (His Dad was a bit of a jerk, it turns out) and his career, thanks to a multitude of existing records, is given a lengthy review sprinkled with various dates.All in all, a valiant effort to produce a clearer portrait of Alfred Hawthorn Hill, but I just never got the sense that Mr. Lewisohn cracked the mystery.Add to that Mr. Lewisohn's determination to treat every chapter of Mr. Hill's life as if he were Jack the Ripper and not a television comedian, and you see what the reader's up against (And who else would read this except a Benny Hill fan?).Say what you want about Benny Hill, that he was stunted emotionally, that he recycled the jokes of old radio and film comedians--and even his own--or that he was cheap, his shows say something else. Maybe not in every bit, but there is an energy there that translates to the viewer. He is having fun.This is one of those instances when it would probably be best if, in future, we allowed Benny Hill's shows to speak for him, instead of a biographer who might as well be trying to solve the riddle of the Sphinx."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"I have tried to find a complete biography for Benny Hill for years. This biography is complete from childhood until his somewhat early death.The title describes the book best, an interesting comic who did not become a success until he was on television."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"I was so pleased to find a biography of Benny Hill. I became a fan in the 80's when his show was televised by BBC. After 150+ pages, I can hardly bear to turn another. The author had no admiration for Mr. Hill; I would go so far as to say Mr. Lewisohn holds him in total contempt. The author also spends far too much time pontificating about Variety, radio and other topics in such minutiae that it detracts from the subject and makes this book a ponderous read with little enjoyment at best - excruciating at worst.Criticism is one thing but the way this author writes of Benny Hill, his life and comedy, is just shameful. I'm willing to bet he spared all of the Beatles his poison-pen treatment. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"I found this biography of Benny Hill well-researched and engagingly-written. Although a very public figure, Mr. Hill had few close friends or relationships and was something of an enigma. The biographer tries as well as he can to uncover all of the details of Benny Hill's life, from his childhood with a an extremely frugal father, to his early years struggling to make it in Variety (like burlesque) shows and his phenomenal success with his tv show.I don't think that Mr. Lewisohn succeeded in scratching below the surface of Benny Hill. He tries to emphasize the \\"oddness\\" of Benny's quirky habits, but they simply aren't that odd, to me at least. He just seemed like a shy, frugal man who had trouble connecting deeply with others.I liked that Lewisohn was able to look critically at Benny Hill's work, and honestly assess both the strengths and weaknesses. I think he truly admires Hill's most creative pieces, but is able to point out the flaws in Hill's output, as well as some flaws in his character.The book has a great index and several exhaustive appendixes chronicling all of his work.If you enjoyed Benny Hill's tv show and wish to learn more about him, this is a good book to start with."},{"Title":"Funny, Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill","review":"I purchased this item as a gift for someone very special to add to their collection and when it arrived the cover of the book was torn and there were red marks all over it (it is a white cover).Very displeased with my purchase."},{"Title":"The True Cognoscente's Culture Test: Your Know Your I.Q.--Now Learn Your C.Q.

Maggie, like her grandma, is fantastic at matchmaking for anyone except for herself as the Connor Curse insures that these females never succeed in finding the right mate.Needing a strong opening act for PR purposes, Maggie blackmails Nick Kaplan into performing the deed by threatening to renege on her grandmother's deal to rent a room to him for six months while he works on a construction project. Reluctantly the motorcycle-riding hunk agrees to Maggie's terms. As they work on his makeover and his dates flop one after another, they fall in love. However, she dreads the curse and he is not in the market for anything permanent. Still there is the intervention of a meddling but 100 percent successful matchmaking granny.HEARTS ARE WILD is an amusing contemporary romance starring two protagonists who want to believe in love, but fear commitments do not last. The story line engages the reader from the moment Nick parks his bike due to a strong cast. The lead couple is charmers though their nagging doubts slow down the pace of the tale. The secondary characters to include granny and some outrageous dating companions make this a delightful time for the audience. This is one author that displays the right stuff with a fun frolic.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"Trevor Norton is one of those lucky men who picked up an enthusiasm when he was a boy, nurtured it through his schooling, and kept at it through a happy lifetime of academic involvement within it. In _Underwater to Get Out of the Rain: A Love Affair with the Sea_ (Da Capo), he lets us in on why he has spent as much of his life as he could under the water, and whether you want to join him there or not, he does make a convincing case for a life passionately and usefully spent. After all, how many other experts on kelp do you know who may have changed the tactics of a war? In 1982, when British troops were dispatched to the Falklands because Argentina had invaded them, Norton was called up by an official from the Ministry of Defense: \\"'Are you the seaweed chappie?' said a man with a pound of plums in his mouth. 'Just a wee enquiry. I've been led to believe there are exceptionally large seaweeds off the coast of the erm... Falkland Islands.'\\" Norton confirms this, and explains that stems of the kelp might tangle the propellers of landing craft, but that there would be less of it in sheltered coves and inlets. \\"Really, by Jove, is that so?\\" came the reply, and so perhaps kelp and Norton's advice determined the landing places. It's one of countless odd and amusing stories, dished out with plenty of fascinating marine biology, in a thoroughly readable and enchanting book.Norton had been an unruly child, \\"but as I learned more about living things, I became too busy to be bad.\\" And he used his fascination for the sea to power his academic efforts (he is now Professor of Marine Biology at the University of Liverpool). The many chapters here cover Norton's underwater life all over the world, and convey his fascination with the creatures he sees. Barnacle mating, for instance, is extraordinary: \\"The bold, bisexual barnacle has a prick up its sleeve; its enormous penis is three or four times taller than the shell. Out it leaps, thin and arching, and dips into an adjacent barnacle as neat as a nib into a surprised inkwell.\\" The creatures are amazing, and so are the odd people who come into Norton's life, or historical figures who inspired him. Pages here are devoted to Ed Ricketts, the marine biologist of Cannery Row and John Steinbeck's pal. Norton describes Liverpool in the sixties, but explains, \\"People have often asked me what it was like to be there. If only I'd known it was going to become 'Liverpool in the sixties' I'd have paid more attention.\\" It was where he met his wife (who has done the charming illustrations for this book): \\"She was obviously bright and I would like to say that I was first attracted by her intellect, but in the age of miniskirts there was so much to admire that I got distracted.\\"Norton realizes his own good luck in timing. \\"Yesterday's expedition is today's excursion and tomorrow's package tour.\\" He has been able to see pristine reefs and to write about them, but then faces the dilemma that since complex reef ecology is damaged by human visits, to celebrate the beauty of a specific reef is to \\"expose it to the dangers of excessive admiration.\\" The coral reef state park in Florida, for instance, gets thousands of visitors a day, as well as damage by pollution and careless boat usage. It isn't the only instance Norton describes of the encroachment of the modern world into the oceans. Overfishing has changed the oceans forever, with much bigger nets, spotter planes to locate schools of fish, and sonar mounted on the nets to guide the skipper in enclosing his prey. \\"Fish have as much chance of evading a net as a tree has of dodging the ax.\\" Especially distressing is his description of ruin within the waters of the Philippines by such fishing techniques as dynamiting and poisoning by bleach and cyanide. This is far too lively and cheery a book, however, to be overcome by such reflections. Norton is a witty writer with a fund of good stories to tell and a delight in the surprises of the human and the marine world, a delight that any reader will enjoy."},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"As a young boy author Trevor Norton was fascinated by water: a fascination which would continue into adulthood, and which serves as the foundation of experience of UNDERWATER TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN, a blend of natural history and memoir. Norton's fascination would lead him to travel oceans of the world, to study the science and history of oceans, and to probe both the surface of the ocean and the world of a submerged laboratory. UNDERWATER TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN is a joyous celebration as well as a scientific investigation and a fine leisure read.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"Trevor Norton is a very gifted man: he is undoubtedly a first-rate scientist, who enjoys his profession inmensely, but he has other virtues as well. First, he can write: every page is elegantly crafted, with a knack for the telling detail and a gift for the essential. In a few pages you are there with him, becoming acquainted with an underwater scene, or with a long-deceased biologist. Second, Norton is interested in everything, from science to history, reminding us how fascinating life itself can be, if only we care to look. And he has a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"As the sub-title says, this is the story of a love affair with the sea. The author confesses to be an unruly child until he found the sea and then became too busy to be bad. His love has taken him to academic heights, to strange and exotic parts of the globe and to the depths of the ocean.The book is part the natural history of the ocean, part the story of man's interferrence, part just stories, and part science. More perhaps than any of these, it's a vision into his own philosophy of life, the fascination that both he and the surface of the world is seven tenths salt water.All in all, this is a delightful book. It is great to see that someone who starts out with a fascination about something is able to work in that area as a career and now many years later still holds that fascination. This fascination he then combines with the skills of a natural born story teller to produce a volume as entertaining as this."},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"This book heralds another delightful marine adventure by Norton, who has written two other beautifully crafted, and wonderfully humorous, books about the characters he has met, and some of the adventures he has had, in a lifetime as a marine biologist. It starts out with his memories of his childhood home, on St Mary's Island, Northumberland, before whisking us away to a series of globally-based adventures: Devon, via Liverpool to the island of Anglesey, North Wales, to his first encounter with the Port Erin Marine Laboratory, where... \`I was the least famous marine biologist ever to work on the Isle of Man'. From Port Erin we are whisked over the oceans to Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, where by chance, I happened to read the book. How changed the Canaries are today from the time when the party of \\"least famous marine biologists\\" were met on the quay by Don Mariano L&oacute;pez, local dignitary and ex-mayor, who arranged for their luggage to be taken away by donkey cart while inviting the all-too-rare visitors to join him in an eight-course lunch, followed by coffee and cognac.As one follows his ocean-bound circumambulations, back to Scotland, and the Scottish Islands, to Lough Ine, in the Southwest of Ireland - where he based his book, Reflections on a Summer Sea - to San Juan Island, Washington, then the Monterey California of Steinbeck's day, every journey is imbued with characteristic charm and wit, and all the while enlivened by his sharp observation of the idiosyncrasies of human nature. His odyssey takes him a good deal further than I have room to describe, but permeating the exhilarating narrative of courage, luck, humor and adventure, is a chronicle of change, painful to witness in the working lifetime of one man. We observe, by degrees, the progressive overfishing and pollution of the oceans, and we share his dismay over the loss of a more innocent world. And, finally, we embrace Professor Norton's caretaker role in the closure of the Marine Laboratory in Port Erin, a victim of the financial constraints that have afflicted many university centers in the UK in the first years of the New Millennium."},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"Excellent marine biology books that are written for the lay reader can be hard to come by. I read this book about 10 years ago and gave it away to a friend. I recently was thinking I would like to RE read it and ordered it from Amazon. It is a wonderful autobiographical account of the author's life as a marine bioligist and his travels and career. Although filled with interesting trivia regarding the British Isles, as well as other islands around the globe, history, personal anecdotes regarding friends and acquaintances, there is still enough marine science, scuba diving adventures, and amazing information about the ocean and it's denizens to keep any one interested. I am glad I ordered it for another read. It was even more enjoyable on the second time around and I recommend this book for anyone with the least bit of interest in the ocean."},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"\\"Underwater to Get Out of The Rain\\" is a book to read for the sheer pleasure of living vicariously through the author's life. If you have any interest in the ocean then Trevor Norton's poetic musings will seduce you into what he calls \\"the real world.\\" He recalls his crystal clear memories of his first experience swimming in the ocean and then details several trips he made to Northumberland, North Wales, Lanzarote, Spain, Liverpool, the Isle of Man, Scotland, Carsaid Island, Ireland, California, Sweden, Yemen, Egypt and the Philippines.This is a mixture of memoir, fascinating history and lore. I especially enjoyed the intriguing tales of mermaids and Trevor Norton's explanation on why ships sink in the Bermuda Triangle. I also didn't realize that there are giant squid in the San Juan Islands not far from where I live. While I've been to Orcas island for a weekend I had no idea such creatures lived there.Trevor Norton seems fascinated by seaweed and explains how it is used in toothpaste and ketchup. His descriptions of the sea hare had me looking up pictures online. His tales of the sea are not devoid of tragedy, he has survived where others perished. In one story he is surrounded by sharks in another he is wading in pools filled with sea snakes.It sometimes takes me a few years to get to a book I want to read and this one was worth the wait. Trevor Norton's writing style is a delight to read and his command of the English language is exemplary. If you love the ocean then I think you will enjoy these adventurous tales.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Underwater To Get Out Of The Rain","review":"The book arrived extremely quickly - exceeding expectations - and in excellent condition.

Bravo Blackwell!!"},{"Title":"A Companion to American Fiction 1865 - 1914 (Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture)","review":"I received this book as a gift from my father-in-law, who is an English professor specializing in the nineteenth century. It's taken me a while to get through it since as a high school history teacher I have little time for reading outside of my field, but the experience has been well worth it. The essays in the volume are all outstanding--well-informed, lucidly written, and clearly authoritative. What's especially impressive is that the authors assume an intelligent audience but not necessarily one that is in their area of specialization, or even an audience of literary critics. Equally notable is that the essays are fascinating and make the reader want to know more about the subjects they address. In many cases, as in the wonderful essays on ecological narrative and nature writing, the fiction of the Civil War and Reconstruction, children's literature, and consumer culture, I found myself both learning a great deal but also absorbed in topics I previously had little interest in. In other cases, as with the essays on literary genres, on ethnic fiction, Native American culture, urban fiction, and the single author essays, most especially the ones on William Dean Howells and Mark Twain, I felt as though everything I thought I knew was out of date. I can't say enough about this terrific volume. It's one from which I've learned a great deal, and it's one I shall revisit many times in the future. This is a truly valuable and beautifully produced book."},{"Title":"A Companion to American Fiction 1865 - 1914 (Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture)","review":"If I could have only one book on American fiction in the second half of the nineteenth century, this would be the book--a stunning and original collection from many of the finest scholars working in the period. The organization of the volume is terrific, with the expected types of essays as well as many innovative topics covered. The quality of the chapters is outstanding, providing a remarkable overview but, as well, original takes on the topics. The book also comes with a very usable detailed index and with individual bibliographies for further study of the period. Although the book is, as one reviewer pointed out, expensive, nevertheless you get your money's worth since the volume is the size of four books. And the production values are excellent--a sewn binding, acid free paper, and illustrations along with small texts attached to these.

This particular piece is mostly introductory, but is of value even to those with a deeper interest in the subject. For beginners, the book presents the Vikings in their own words. Dr. Page has provided useful explication to the texts he has chosen to help the novice understand the issues and background involved. The book's introduction, which contains a priceless piece on the difficulties of language and transliteration, will give a new appreciation of this kind of scholarship to those who have only dealt with this material in translation. For the serious scholar comfortable with Runic writing and transliteration, Page's work in this volume stands as a guide to the art of teaching this difficult material. Page's work is accessible--moreso to the novice, probably, than this review. This book is a welcome addition to any Viking scholar's library."},{"Title":"The Goober's Guide to Golf: How to Golf Like a Champ in 10 Minutes (or die laughing) (15 If You Read the Book Twice)","review":"I love Dave Barry and I loved this book!

The book explains the material so well that I taught myself reading the book. The examples are numerous and particularly good in showing both easy and difficult problems. (Some books only show the easy problems or insufficient variety of them.) If anyone has a trouble with this book, serious review of algebra 2 is recommended.As for some of the previous reviews, there is no section 5.1.1 or 5.1.2, unless they are talking about a previous edition, which I have not seen. There is no mistake in section 5.1 or 5.2. But there are some mistakes in the answers in the back.Looking back at the book now, I prefer what Swokowski did with the series chapter much better (Loomis has interesting discussions on irrational numbers etc, but at the expense of losing the focus.). But Loomis does one of the best job in introducing vectors and functions of several variables. The chapter on Green's theorem is very nice, too. The chapter on multiple integral starts out by stating that it is only an introduction (like any other book at this level). What I realize now is that one has to go on to \\"advanced calculus\\" or vector calculus to master those things.

He started his career in chemical engineering in England where he learned the importance of experimental design and statistical methods. He came to the US in 1953 and spent time at North Carolina State College and later came back to be part of the statistics group at Princeton. After that he founded the Department fo Statistics at the University of Wisconsin. This history and other important career decisions icluding the founding of Technometrics are detailed in the brief section \\"My Professional Life\\" that he wrote for this volume.Box's contributions to statistics are diverse and large. He developed many practical statistical designs including the central composite design. He is responsible for evolutionary operation and wrote a book on it with Norman Draper. He has also made major contributions to response surface methodology.With Gwilym Jenkins he systematized the application of the ARIMA models and led the development of software for easy application of these model building techniques. He championed the concept of parsimonious models and insisted that model building should be an iterative and continually evolving technique. He contributed to the area of control through his stochastic time series models and found ways to incorporate it in manufacturing process control.With David Cox he developed the Box-Cox family of transformations. These simple power transformation can be used to make the data have an approximate normal shape. he gave a prescription for how to estimate or pick the power to use based on the data.These enormous contributions can be found in the volumes of collected works that Tiao and others have edited. His contributions can also be seen from his books on evolutionary operation, time series analysis, automated process control, empirical model building and response surfaces, and practical experimental designs (\\"Statistics for Experimenters\\").However in the decades of the 80s and 90s from age 60 to 80, instead of retiring, George Box took on the challenge of developing a center for quality and productivity at the University of Wisconsin. This volme, edited by Tiao, Bisgaard, Hill, Pena and Stigler provides a collection of articles by Box. These are mostly articles written in the 1990s covering the subjects of A) continuous process improvement, B) designing experiments to gain quality information, C) sequential investigation and discovery (including response surface methods), D) quality control and E) learning how to identify and reduce variation or be less sensitive to it by constructing robust processes (i.e. processes not sensitive to minor changes in process parameters). The articles are mostly directed toward quality issues and are mostly articles that were published in the 1990s or 2000 with a few from the 80s. Some are important technical contributions but many are also very philosophical.George Box is one of the great thinkers of the 20th century and his philosophy on statistics and scientific inference is as important as his many technical contributions. There are 46 articles in total 4 on topic A, 12 on B, 10 on C, 11 on D and 9 on E. Each topic area has a brief introduction identifying a unifying theme in the papers in that section.Box has a terrific sense of humor that often comes out in his lectures and sometimes in his writings. One gets a good appreciation of it by reading the three songs on statistics that are included in Part F of the book. This is only a sample of several that he has written that are parodies of familiar tunes. Of these three my favorite is \\"There's no theorem like Bayes theorem\\" to the tune of \\"There's no business like show business.\\"There is a nice bibliography in the back of the book that is followed by a biography on Box and a list of his books and articles published between 1982 and 1999. This includes 3 books and 91 articles! Believe it or not he published even more in his earlier years."},{"Title":"In Quest of Clocks","review":"Enduring institutions draw inspiration from their founding fathers. A new publication, Thank God and Take Courage: How the Holy Spirit Worked in My Life, by Lewis T. Corlett, edited and annotated by Frank G. Carver (San Diego: Point Loma Press, c. 1992), leaves us an important legacy from one of the significant early leaders in the Church of the Nazarene. This book fuses Corlett's autobiographical memories with theological meditations. Equally important: it is bolstered by the meticulous, extensive, and illuminating footnotes provided by Frank Carver.The book grew out of a \\"Panoramic Vision\\" given Corlett which prodded him to write his life story. As he describes it, sitting in his recliner after an evening spent talking with his brother, Shelby, \\"I sensed the moving of the Spirit in my mind. As I listened I noted that the Holy Spirit was giving me a Panoramic Review of His dealings with me from early youth to that day\\" (pp. ix-x). Impressed to share it with others, he began writing with hopes of memorializing his insights in print. Subsequently he submitted the manuscript to the Nazarene Publishing House Book Committee, which did not wish to publish autobiographical works. His good friend, Frank Carver, thought it needed to be published and devoted part of his recent sabbatical to getting it prepared for this publication. On January 1, 1992, Corlett died, at the age of 95, while this book was going to print--comforted by the knowledge that his vision would be shared.Reared in a devout home in Pennsylvania, Corlett early attended a Methodist church. But his parents, hungry for clear holiness preaching, joined the Church of the Nazarene in 1910. As a youngster he responded to revivalistic invitations and tried to live a Christian life, but it was not until 1915 that Corlett discovered God's \\"Establishing Grace\\" in a local church revival. \\"In a few seconds,\\" he says, \\"I sensed an inner cleansing of my motives and a deep consciousness of a peace and calmness I had never felt before which has continued to this day. I realized I was enjoying what John Wesley spoke of as being 'sanctified wholly'\\" (p. 3). In addition to this clear testimony to the sanctifying grace instantly experienced in his youth, throughout the book Corlett explains how the Spirit enabled him to grow in grace, to become a more Christ-like person. Early on \\"The Spirit enabled me to make an honest evaluation of myself. My heart was pure in motives but my mind was warped regarding my mental powers, my actions, and reactions\\" (p. 16).Consequently he still tended to be critical, blunt, undisciplined, and cynical. Then \\"The Spirit showed me that these attitudes or moods were not only hindering me in spiritual progress, they also often blocked His efforts to use me in His Kingdom\\" (p. 17). So he discovered the need for self-discipline, for an on-going consecration, for learning even in the \\"dark night of the soul\\" difficult times, so as to allow the Spirit to refine him more perfectly.In time he felt called to the ministry, attended several colleges (meeting his wife at Arkansas Holiness College) and associated with some of the great leaders of the young denomination. One of them, J.B. Chapman, whom he met during his senior year at Penial College, \\"was the most balanced Christian I had ever met, a clear Bible expositor, a wise administrator and effective preacher\\" (p. 7).Following brief pastorates in California, Montana, New Jersey, and Texas, Corlett was called to teach at Bethany-Penial College. Here he began an educational career of 32 years which led him, in time, to the presidencies of Northwest Nazarene College and Nazarene Theological Seminary. Those of us associated with Nazarene colleges can identify with much in the chapters devoted to these years, for Corlett honestly describes the tough times as well as the triumphs he experienced. In the midst of one of his darkest hours, while heading NTS, he found strength in a phrase of the Apostle Paul's, \\"Thank God and take courage\\" (Acts 28:15), which serves as the subtitle of this book.Amazingly, one of the most fruitful phases of Corlett's ministry began when he and his wife moved into Royal Oaks Manor, a retirement complex. Here they supported the established religious activities, and in time he became something of a pastor to that community of senior citizens, counseling, praying, teaching and caring for them.In addition to his autobiographical chapters, Corlett discusses the Holy Spirit's help in counseling, leadership, and guidance. While short and succinct, these sections compress a lifetime's learning into wise words to digest and exemplify. Then, in a final chapter, \\"Development in Sensitivity to the Holy Spirit,\\" he sums up what he learned in a lifetime, confessing that \\"all that I have become and accomplished in over sixty years of service for God and His Kingdom was done through the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit as I gave wholehearted obedience to His wisdom, power, and grace\\" (p. 80).We who seek to follow Corlett's Lord can learn much from what he learned, listening as he did to the Spirit. This fine book can be purchased for $6.00 from PLNC's bookstore or the Point Loma Press, 3900 Lomaland, San Diego, CA, 92106."},{"Title":"Using Macromedia Dreamweaver 1.2","review":"Once again I fell victum to buying a Rick Darnel loser. However, this book goes a step farther by showing the arogance of the auithor. For an example: The book came out recently and yet the web pages that corrwspond to the book are no where to be found. A quick check with the URL as of today has the author, claiming that &quot;gee I was surpirsed the book is out, the pages will be up bur first I am off on vacation for June....&quot; Another note, and the one that really reeks of arogance is: &quot;I may be putting up a guestbook so that people can post their comments...but any comments that I deem that are not favorable will be eliminated&quot; Gee sooo sorry Rick for readershaving the gumption of complaing about your shabby work, and producing books that are missing many of the key elements that readers want in a book that refernces DHTML, and that go beyond what one can find in the users guide that comes with the program, ergo, simply not a re-hash of the users guide but something useful! Or for that matter what one can easily find by visiting the Macromedia site FOR FREE! But, I can understand Mr. Darnell's point, after he wrote a really shhhaaaaaaby Flash 2 book, and received many complaints from customers who bought the book, I can understand his sensitivity and insecurity. Unfortunatly, he is getting rich off of the people he short changes by his owrk or rather his lack of work!Here is an example: He does not touch on even one example of uses of MS ActiveX objects that allow those cool transition effects one wants to produce. Or the many other elements of DHTMl that go into Animation beyond the dragging motion of taking one object from one part of the scene to the other. Heck, what he wrote one could find in the help menu and much more. Let alone some of the many other multimedia tools you will want to learn. Of course if you wish to study frames or tables, well you can shell out for his book or buy something more complete on those subjects. Oh and one example that really needs to be mentioned here. Where is the needed discussion in the book on Style Sheets. DHTML is all about style sheets. You'll find a few pages on it and those pages seemed to be rushed out in order to meet Macmillian's dealine for publishing. Again, another area that is woefully missing. I could go on but what is the use?Thank goodness Amazon.com has the reader's interests at mind and allows feedback from people who have purchased uselss books from Darnell. That's why Amazon is the leader that all others will follow IMHO.My suggestion: Skip this book, and buy the others that are due to come out soon. Forget about trying to get some naswers from Macmillan Press, I've been trying for several days via telephone and email their support is only open from Mon-Thur."},{"Title":"Using Macromedia Dreamweaver 1.2","review":"Then this is the book for you. In its overly simplistic manner, it delivers the fundamentals of Internet authoring with Dreamweaver. But don't expect anything more than that. When I first heard about this book, I expected at least some sort of section on advanced techniques or something to the like. But no! This book is for &lt;b&gt;Total&lt;/b&gt; beginners, not experienced authors. Dreamweaver is a great tool with great possibilities. What's more is that it is so easy to use. The book simply parrots a bunch of information that Dreamweaver has made clear in and of itself. If, however, you don't know what an italicised word is, or have no idea what an image is, then you may consider buying this book. Frankly, I think you'd be much better off by pulling info from the Macromedia site. It will tell you all that you want to know about web authoring with Dreamweaver, for only the price of your ISP.

(According to the book, the code is supposed to be there) If anyone knows the location of the code for the examples, I would love to know where to get it.

This is a good book to read when you want to just relax be warn there are a few hairy adventurous experiences. To bad they didn't know that they could have used that underground spring to create a natural refrigeration system. Back in the day you would dig a deep trench and put a pipe at the edge outside for the overflow. You would put a bench like structure (usually wood or stone) in it and place the things you wanted to keep cold on it. Spring water is very cold. I only read a few pages so far; so maybe the people that live there will tell them how to do that, well that is if they know how. Oops it is hard to do when you lose a good part of your foundation. Ok got to tell you I had a chance to read more and those poor people, from what I have read so far, I could really relate to the storms and the darkness but not to have a black bear trying to get and your house feeling like it is falling down around you, makes me feel so lucky that wasn't me and happy for them that they survive it.

Fleeing the city of Chicago to risk making a life in the far northern woods of Minnesota, seeking virgin timber and solitude, Helen writes of their struggles with near poverty and the anxiety of isolation. Through it all they find peace of mind and spirit, and advocate for the preservation of wild natural places to the greatest degree possible. Once you read one of her books you will collect them all, and like another reviewer has so stated, you read them over and over and over again.

I have read the book a dozen times, and never lose interest in its capacity to instantly transport me to another time and place. Having spent many of my summers as a young boy in the Northern woods of Minnesota, this book brings back to me the scent of resin from the pine and birch, the fleeting glimpse of a black bear, and the natural curiosity of deer and other woodland creatures. You cannot help but be touched by this book."},{"Title":"A Place in The Woods","review":"Helen Hoover is one of those rare people (apparently) who is gifted on both sides of the brain. She was a very successful scientist in Chicago in an era when women scientists were few and far between. Tired of city life and realizing she and her husband had a now or never shot at a new life in the north woods, they took the plunge and basically burned all their bridges, spent their nest egg, and bought a cabin in Minnesota. This is the story of the winter, of the wilderness people, of their animal and human friends, and their struggle. Mostly, in fact it is about their struggle to adapt, and is a revelation of their character and commitment as they deal with one obstacle after another, each one by itself difficult enough to precipitate an honorable surrender, as most people expected would happen. Instead of surrendering they thrived, however, and this is the story of their first year in the woods. It is not laugh out loud funny, and is as much a story of home repairs, on the surface, as anything, but all the small details, patched together, tell a story that is worth hearing. I feel like a heel being the first reviewer not to give it 5 stars, but 5 stars means a classic to me. I couldn't put it in the classic category, but I couldn't put it down, either."},{"Title":"A Place in The Woods","review":"This book was very comforting and therapeutic for me. Being in a world of mainly material importance, it is pleasant to find a book that lets you retreat to a place, were tangible significance is not important. The Hoovers found the courage to begin a new life in the wilderness, without electricity and the modern conviences of city life. They found a much more satisfying way of life for them,although having to struggle everyday to persevere the wilderness. They found great compensation for there struggles. Anyone who appreciates, and respects wildlife will enjoy the great rewards the Hoovers gained while interrelating with the animals, and how the animals in the wild became there friends. I am looking forward to reading The Gift of the Deer also by Ms Hoover."},{"Title":"A Place in The Woods","review":"I stumbled upon this book when I was lazily searching for something to read on my parent's bookshelf.

A herculean struggle with small victories around every corner. A heart warming tail."},{"Title":"A Place in The Woods","review":"I have just finished this book. I read it many years ago and felt I needed to read it again. So I did. The book takes place in one year of living in the woods.This is the story of Helen and Ade Hoover who fell in love with northern Minnesota and felt they needed to live in this area. Would they be able to? They had taken vacations in this cold country and hated to go back to Chicago where both had a nice apartment and good jobs. But the couple agreed to give up their predictable livestyles, bought land and an old log cabin. Not long after purchasing their first home they bought a lovely, well kept summer home owned by an older couple who also loved this area but felt they needed to sell their vacation home and stay in Minneapolis.The Hoovers life was hard and filled with many incidents they were unaware of. Long, cold desolate winters, no near neighbors, a hard to keep warm log cabin, running out of food, running out of money, running out of equipment to work on the land and the house. But the couple loved their lifestyle beautiful as it was, but also discourageing. Much,much hard heavy work went into living their lifestyle. Ade loved wood working, fixing and repairing anything that needed to be fixed and repaired. Helen was happy, grateful and appreciative of her huband's good workmanship and productive hands. And Ade was all that as some people are and others are not, a man who loved to work and was always doing things around the house and land.Helen's description of the seasons, of sunrise and sunset, of trees, plants and wildflowers are beautiful also the beauty of all the different birds. Ade's drawings are excellent and bring the reader a clear picture of Helen's writing.Helen tells of her interactions with animals, there is the story of Mama Mouse and her babies, the bear that came into the house that Helen thought was a dog until she found out otherwise, the woodpecker parents warned the couple of danger and inadvertedly saved the house. Ade and Helen were grateful to this other couple.There is the problem of keeping up with food and repairs especially in the long cold winter plus being so far from large cities.Natives of this area plus the couple's friends in Chicago did not expect them to stay very long but stay they did and loved this beautiful country.Helen tells of the animal mothers and how loving and protective of their young these animals were. The Hoovers fed fishers, ermines plus a greedy young bear who the Hoovers tried to stop from eating the birds food, but the young bear won. There are the summer visitors, the lodge owners who befriended and were very helpful to the couple plus the trapper who wandered into their home and wo the couple fed. There is the feeding of the squirrels and chipmonks. The reader gets to meet the couple's three pet chickens, Crown Prince, Tulip and Bedelia plus a typing squirrel Hippity. This is a beautiful book of living with nature and wild things.Helen began writing first about Mrs Mouse then more nature stories. Ade did artwork concerning land and animals. This was a way to make money to enable this couple to live on their land as they wished, to live in nature as planned.This is a hard life not for everyone but for one couple it is the only lifestyle."},{"Title":"A Place in The Woods","review":"In the mid-1950's Helen and Adrian Hoover left their professional life in Chicago behind and bought some land and a log cabin in the Minnesota wilderness on the banks of Lake Superior.\\"A Place in the Woods\\" was Helen's description of their struggles, disasters, challenges and triumphs as the couple created a new way of life among the numerous animals and much less numerous people living miles away.Helen's writing style was easy, natural and sometimes lyrical. You can tell she loved the outdoors, the animals she came into contact with, and her new lifestyle. Her observations on her animal friends was my favorite part of the book, and her stories about the mama mouse, little bear and the squirrels and \\"chippies\\" were funny and cute without being cloying.This was a nice, quick read, and definitely satisfied my inner hermit.

Each tape holds a one-hour dramatization and a half-hour one; each CD a single one-hour show or 2 half-hour ones.The first of the one-hour shows is The Screen Director's Playhouse version of &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (11/16/50) with Tallulah Bankhead recreating her original role. &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1/25/51) on the same series offers Joseph Cotten and Mercedes McCambridge in the Peck and Bergman roles; while Studio One's &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (3-23-48) stars Glenn Ford and Kathleen Cordell in the leads. Academy Award's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (12/2/51) gives us Ray Milland and Frank Lovejoy in the roles created by Farley Granger and Robert Walker. All of these are extremely well done, forced (of course) by time considerations to leave out certain events shown in the film (such as the actual murder of the wife by psychopath Bruno in &quot;Strangers&quot;).The half-hour shows are not nearly as satisfying, being forced to rush the plots almost to the point of mere outlines of the originals.

Each tape holds a one-hour dramatization and a half-hour one; each CD a single one-hour show or 2 half-hour ones.The first of the one-hour shows is The Screen Director's Playhouse version of &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (11/16/50) with Tallulah Bankhead recreating her original role. &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1/25/51) on the same series offers Joseph Cotten and Mercedes McCambridge in the Peck and Bergman roles; while Studio One's &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (3-23-48) stars Glenn Ford and Kathleen Cordell in the leads. Academy Award's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (12/2/51) gives us Ray Milland and Frank Lovejoy in the roles created by Farley Granger and Robert Walker. All of these are extremely well done, forced (of course) by time considerations to leave out certain events shown in the film (such as the actual murder of the wife by psychopath Bruno in &quot;Strangers&quot;).The half-hour shows are not nearly as satisfying, being forced to rush the plots almost to the point of mere outlines of the originals.

I was, however, anxious to learn a bit more about Stewart's combat exploits during World War II. In that regard, this book was somewhat disappointing. Rather than let us get inside Stewart's heart and mind and sense what he experienced, it appears to chronicle Stewart's time in service, letting us know where, when, and in what capacities he served; what a great guy he was, how dedicated and successful he was, and when and to what ranks he was promoted; and, in general, what many of those who served with him thought of him, but it never gets down to the nitty-gritty of what he actually did at a personal level. The reader, it would seem, is always looking from the outside in.I was also disappointed by the fact that much of the book isn't even about Jimmy Stewart. Stewart seems to be a thread running through a broader story about World War II in Europe and, more specifically, the air war as fought by our B-24 Liberator bomb groups. I say that because more often than not the author deviates from his presumed subject, Stewart, and goes off on a tangent (e.g., Eisenhower's appointment, George C. Marshall, one officer or another, the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1940, manufacturing B-24 bombers, the Wright crew, Churchill and Roosevelt at Casablanca, and various reminiscences of one person or another). Perhaps I'm being too critical, but I would estimate that only about 30% of the book actually deals directly with Jimmy Stewart while the remainder concerns other topics. And much of the 30% is a bit repetitive.All that said, this is still an interesting history of the air war in Europe, much of it in the words of men who actually served with Jimmy Stewart. From that standpoint, it is well worth reading. After doing so, the reader will know where Stewart served, in what capacities, how many missions he flew, when he was promoted, what people thought of him, what medals and commendations he won, and where the Brigadier General James Maitland Stewart museum is located, but he or she probably won't have a real sense of the man, himself. But, maybe only Jimmy Stewart could have told that side of the story, and he was much too unpretentious a man to ever do so."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"This book is almost a love letter to Jimmy Stewart. And it may well be that the love is justified in this case. The mild \\"aw shucks\\" demeanor of an honest, average middle class individual thrust into crisis seen so often on the screen is reported here over and over by people who knew him during WW II. It's clear that he was no dummy, graduate of Princeton.This book though is on his wartime career. Entering the Army early in 1941 (and seeing his salary drop from $6,000 a month to $21) he was by the end of the war a seasoned bomber pilot with 20 missions behind him, including a visit to Berlin.In part this book has to concentrate on the differences a movie star has to see (the Army didn't want him killed), but most of it is on the way Jimmy Stewart handled himself in the War. It's a view of the war seen in movies like 12 O'Clock high, but this one is a personal view as seen by one man. If even half of what the book says is true, Jimmy Stewart clearly deserved his decorations."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Smith does a nice job recounting the days the Jimmy Stewart spent in the military during WWII. I found it very detailed oriented and less filled with anecdotes than I would have thought all these years removed from WWII. I knew a bit about Stewart's involvement in the Army Air Corps, which became the Air Force, but this book really filled in the details of his time during the war. Guys like Jimmy Stewart are a far cry from the phonies like Alec Baldwin who threaten to go back to Canada but wind up sticking around the USA to sap of of our money with second rate films.I think you will be amazed to find out all that Stewart had to do in order to become the hero he was. He was not drafted as a previous review claims, rather he inlisted against the will of the studio. He also had to endure undesired special treatment because no one wanted to put him in harms way. Eventually his desire to train for and see active duty prevailed and some forty odd years later this film star retired as Gen. Stewart, donating all of his retirement money back to the Air Force.This is a great book about an American hero. Like many of his day, Glen Miller, Ronald Reagan. Stewart did not wait he willingly enlisted!"},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"In reading the other reviews of this book, I found something very interesting: both the positive and negative are basically correct. This book is a near love letter to Stewart, but it also really fails to describe his military experiences. Stewart was the Pat Tillman of another era. He enlisted--enlisted--in the U.S. Army before--I repeat--before Pear Harbor. This after he was an Oscar winning movie star. The book is good at building up and describing Stewart's early career in Hollywood and his initial training. You get a good feel for his leadership ability. Then, the author fails to deliver. There is nothing about the missions Stewart flew. The book reads like a series of articles from unit alumni newsletters. It strikes me that Smith used this book as a post-retirment mechanism to renew old friendships from the war, and while everyone seems to agree that Stewart was an amazing man of integrity and character, they fail to provide any meaningful evidence to support their position."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"As a person, and as a great American and patriot, there is no equal to Jimmy Stewart, and he is truly one of my heroes, and by virtue of him leaving Hollywood to fight during WWII embodies him greatly in the history of this nation. Having said that, I found the book on my hero boring, devoid of any substance for his incredible service, and lacking any in-depth research into this extraordinary person. The entire book talks more about other people than it does about Jimmy Stewart. I bought the book thinking I was going to learn more about this man during WWII than about his Hollywood career, but the entire book falls short of any reading pleasure. I was sorely disappointed, and I would encourage no one to buy it. Save your money for Jimmy Stewart's biography. I'm sure it's much more impressive."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Jimmy Stewart was in the Air Force. I knew that; it's not a big secret. He was a general; again, I knew that, it's not a secret either. But he served in combat, at a time when he didn't have to, and was something of a hero. *That* was news to me, and frankly I'm somewhat surprised at how far into the warzone he got, and what he was able to do once he got there.Stewart led 20 missions over Germany and occupied Europe during World War II, and flew one during the early days of the Viet Nam War, also (truly a surprise to me). He was apparently regarded by the other officers and men of the various outfits he served with as intelligent, brave, and very cool under fire, in addition to being more than a bit lucky. You'd think this last would make people jealous, but in a war, the reaction instead is to try and get next to the lucky guy, be on his plane or in his orbit: if he's lucky, if you're next to him maybe you will be too.Unfortunately Starr Smith's book doesn't really measure up to Stewart's career. The author conducted a few interviews, but only a few, and sprinkled the story with his own recollections of Stewart. The two served together in England for a while: Stewart was Operations Officer of a Bomber Wing, and Smith was the Intellgence Officer. There is not much in the book about the actual missions he flew or anything like that: the mission to Berlin (probably his most dangerous) is described in perhaps a page. Since the author apparently realizes that this will leave readers thinking the book a bit thin, there's a lot of padding. One completely extraneous portion is a chapter on Dwight Eisenhower in Louisiana, which has almost nothing to do with the rest of the story. The last fifty or sixty pages of the book is a mishmash of recollections, appendices, short bios of people Stewart knew, and letters the author received about Stewart. Much of it repeats what's already in the text.The book does have the virtue of having 64 photographs in it. I guess Stewart was shy, but couldn't prevent people from taking his photo. While the book overall does perform a useful service in informing people as to Jimmy Stewart's combat record during World War II, it also isn't that readable or interesting."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"This book is lousy with a Capital \\"L\\".If you're looking for a book about Jimmy Stewart's wartime service, it's not in this book. The work is shallow, superficial, with almost no detail about the missions flown. It includes one totally irrelevant chapter about Army maneuvers conducted in Lousiana- that Stewart had no part in at all! There are no insights into Stewart's personality- all we find out is that he conducted excellent pre-mission briefings, and that he was a skilled pilot- which most Jimmy Stewart fans know already.Almost a third of the book deals with other irrelevancies, like the Jimmy Stewart museum and how he married and raised a family- after the war.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"The details of Jimmy Stewart's military career read like a movie script. you know, one of those sentimentalized 'biographies' that Hollywood used to grind out in the '40's. Actually, it probably would have been made into another one of those wartime films that dramatized the heroic deeds of numerous All-American boy heroes. The fact is, Stewart was a bona fide hero and this book does an excellent job of providing the details of Jimmy's remarkable accomplishments in the Army Air Force...starting as a private, drafted 9 months before Pearl Harbor (which like so many Hollywood types, he could have easily avoided), to leading his bomber group on more than 20 missions over Nazi Germany.Written by a former Intelligence Officer at Jimmy's base in England, this easy to read narrative avoids unnecessary exaggeration and provides a quiet, detailed account of Jimmy Stewart's military career. As Jimmy always avoided discussing this aspect of his life, this book provides details that might have never become available about the life of a true American Hero, James Maitland Stewart"},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"This book on the military life of Jimmy Stewart is long over due. Jimmy Stewart was one person on this earth that if you had ever met him you could never forget him. Stewart was the same in real life as he was in his movies.

He was as down to earth and humble off screen as he was in his roles on screen. To fly the missions, provide the leadership and command the respect of his men and his superiors is a credit to the kind of person he was.

I would gladly use this seller again in the future."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"The first step towards writing a good book is to pick a good subject. Chances are, even if you are not that great of a writer or do not have something especially compelling to say, if you have picked a good subject then the book will float on its own. Jimmy Stewart is a good subject and Starr Smith's brief biography of him, focusing primarily on his service as a pilot in World War II, floats. Starr Smith served as an Intelligence Officer with the Eighth Air Force and became acquainted with Jimmy Stewart in London when they were stationed together. Stewart served in London as a Bomber pilot with the Eighth Air Force. It's a little known fact that service as a Bomber Pilot in World War II was more dangerous than service as an infantryman. For an Oscar-winning movie star to brave those risks was exceptional. For me, this was an uplifting and enjoyable book.Jimmy Stewart was born in Pennsylvania in 1908 and grew up in Indiana. He became entranced with acting during his senior year of high school and continued to act when he went on to Princeton University. After graduation, Stewart worked as an actor in Massachusetts with a small acting company where he met another aspiring actor who would become his room-mate when they subsequently went to New York. That actor was Henry Fonda. The two actors shared a love of airplanes and flying and often spent evenings in their small New York apartment building model airplanes.Stewart and Fonda both landed in Hollywood in 1935 and launched upon successful movie careers. Stewart had gotten wide acclaim for his role in \\"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\\" and later won an Academy Award for his role in the \\"Philadelphia Story\\" in 1939. But when war came, Stewart volunteered for service with the Army. He was initially turned away because he was too light but, undeterred, he gained the required weight and joined up, eventually earning an officer's commission as a pilot. Despite frequent attempts to get to combat duty in Europe, Stewart served as a flight instructor in the states until he finally got his wish and landed a combat assignment with the Eighth Air Force in London. The Eighth Air Force -- which is featured in the classic war film \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" (a must own) -- had the mission of flying the precarious daylight bombing raids over Germany.This brings us to the best part of the book: first-hand testimonials from Stewart's men on what type of officer and leader he was. Unsurprisingly, he was a very competent pilot and an active leader who was very involved in the details of his job. The below quote from one of Stewart's men says a lot about his leadership style:\\"Jimmy Stewart walked all through the airplane, checking us all out, and returned to the flight deck. On the intercom he asked each crew position questions about our routine. He asked me, \\"What are you doing now, Sergeant Robinson? What do you see out the waist window? Can you see the supercharger position? Are the exhausts smoking? What color is the engine exhaust? How much fuel do we have on board? Are you checking it? Are the fuel gauges off and drained?\\"Stewart wanted to see every engineer on the flight deck. I went forward. Then more questions. \\"Robinson, can you fly as first engineer? Can you operate all turrets? Can you arm the bombs?\\" He had a question about everything. Stewart really knew this airplane. He wanted us to know it too.\\"After the war, Stewart married at the age of 41 and raised a family with twin daughters in Hollywood. He had a stepson killed in action in Vietnam while serving as a Marine officer. Stewart went on to become a Brigadier General in the Air Force reserve and remained most proud of his service during the war - much more so than his many acting accomplishments. In conclusion, this book leads us to believe that the camera captured Stewart's true essence in his most famous role as Frank Bailey in \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" Like Bailey, Stewart lived a wonderful life; and it is this fact more than anything else that makes this book such an inspiring and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"This is a very well written book about a true American hero. Jimmy Stewart has long been a great hero and idol to me. This is an awesome account of one of the worlds most awesome people. I highly recommend this not only for Jimmy Stewart fans, but for everyone. But anyone who reads this will be a Jimmy Stewart fan!"},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Smith's book \\"Jimmy Stewart Bomber pilot\\" honors the war time service of one of the most famous movies stars in American History. At a time when many celebrities enlisted in the military but spent their time doing what could only be called PR work, Stewart fought to become a combat officer. Refusing to pull strings or use influence he strove to become a combat pilot in the US 8th Air Force in WW2. Not an actor in uniform he ended his war time service with the rank of colonel with numerous decorations for courage and leadership and a total of 20 combat missions flown over Hitler's Germany. I only wish they had found a better writer to tell his story.Smith himself was an air force officer at roughly the same time Stewart was so he does bring to the book the knowledge and experience of war time service and an intimate knowledge of how things really were. Parts of his writing flow easily and fans of Stewart's acting feel they can hear his voice coming from the pages as it tells the tale of a man who passionately wanted to serve his country, whose life could be summed up in his own words \\"what's wrong with wanting to fight for your country? Why are people reluctant to use the word patriotism?\\"Reading about Stewart's exploits as a student, a trainer and finally a combat leader, I would find pages flying by but then the flight would crash to the ground. There are a few significant problems with the book that kept being some what jarring. Firstly Stewart himself did not write about his war experiences. Much of the book comes from his official war record, a knowledge by Smith about how the 8th Air Force operated and many, many interviews with people who knew Stewart in those days. The problem is that introducing these people comes across as severe padding to the book. It would be enough to say something like \\"a fellow officer remembered him as hard working and intense but casual\\" maybe if you want to credit the witness who helped you could give the name as \`a fellow officer...\\" but to go on about -name- now a retired skunk wrangler in Kalamazoo gets a little long. Even worse is a break off to give a several paragraph long mini-biography of other men. It's one thing to say so and so was a particularly close friend, or even he'd had to leave his new wife behind but two paragraphs about this guy and his own book gets a bit thick. Foot note the stuff and move on or tell their story instead of Stewarts! A small chapter on Eisenhower's desire to get into combat only serves as padding. There is no other word for it.A lot of the military is stuff from guys who were on the same mission as Stewart, but not in his plane so you can only guess that Stewart was going through the same experience, but it would be nice to KNOW. It is more US Bomber command that Jimmy Stewart's war. Even worse on several missions Smith draws from other writers work, quoting them for pages, should we be reading those books instead?An even worse matter is that you early on catch Smith in some points that are just plain wrong. And when someone drops the ball on an easy fact, you find yourself second guessing a lot of things. For example he talks the fact that as a youth Stewart was fascinated with flight and Lindbergh's transatlantic crossing, but failed to mention Stewart playing him years later. As early as page 16 smith writes that Stewart never did a world war two film. Which must come as a very great surprise to any fan of Stewart's who've enjoyed \\"The Glenn Miller story.\\" When telling about popular entertainments during the war he lists Noel Coward's \\"In Which We Serve\\" as a documentary, it wasn't. There are many such gaffs like these some are sins of omission, others well, but they all serve to distract the knowledgeable reader.More than the story of a movie star at war, Jimmy Stewart Bomber Pilot is the story of an earnest and slightly shy man from Pennsylvania who went to war and because of his intelligence and character and ability he was made a leader of men and how this was all done. On its own merits that would be tale worthy of a book. I just wish the man who told the tale was better at his job."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"I was given this book for Christmas (at my urging). I immediately started reading, excited to learn more about a truly wonderful person and war hero. By the time I got to the half way point I wanted to stop reading, only continuing as I was hoping it would redeem itself...It did not.To me, Mr. Stewart's name was put on the cover simply to sell the book; it is nothing but a clip collection of excerpts from other books, disjointed commentary and other assorted oddness. I believe no research was done for this book, the author simply put his own recollections to paper, (at the authors own admission, they were not close and only served in proximity to each other, not together) to prove this, I spent a mere day online researching his wartime record and had gathered much more interesting and relevant information than the book, and that is too bad, Mr. Stewart was truly a war hero, just like all of the other Joe's in the Eighth, he never ducked his duty (as the other reviewer pointed out, he enlisted before PH).I cannot recommend this book to anyone, if you want to learn about the air war in Europe pick up any number of excellent books on the subject (I can recommend), if you want to know more about Mr. Stewart, pick up his biography."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Jimmy Stewart was one of a handful of major American film stars to see combat in World War II, flying B-24 Liberators with the 8th Air Force in England. Logging 20 missions with the 445th and 453rd Bomb Groups, he won various decorations including a DFC and Croix de Guerre. Given his splendid record, details of his combat career would make for interesting reading. Unfortunately you won't get those details in this book!First things first. Smith's book is a warm tribute to a fine human being and patriot. He relates a number of stories that show Stewart to be a considerate, self-effacing, fair-minded and skillful pilot, aircraft commander and unit commander. The many photographs of Stewart, various aircrews, aircraft, commanders, etc. are a nice touch.What you don't get is details on most of the 20 combat missions Stewart flew. The book is entitled JIMMY STEWART BOMBER PILOT so \\"where's the beef?\\" Smith describes two or three missions and alludes to several others and that's it! The mission summaries and individual crew reports for all missions flown by the 445th and 453rd Bomb Groups are available at Maxwell AFB and can be purchased by the general public. Why Smith didn't utilize those documents to flesh out the Stewart combat story is a puzzler.Along with that failing, the book is way too padded with material, some of it on postwar developments, that add nothing to the 'Jimmy Stewart at war' story. All that padding often makes Stewart a bit player in a book devoted to him!In short, Jimmy Stewart deserved better. Reading this book, you can't help but admire and like the guy. He was a class act. At the same time you wonder exactly what happened on all those missions but you never get \\"the rest of the story!\\"An optional purchase."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot is a great book.

I am a WWII buff and anyone with the same interest should also find this book an excellent addition to your collection. It should be of interest to Jimmy Stewart fans as well as anyone wanting to get an inside look at this dangerous job as bomber pilot and those who rode along in those machines."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"I am glad I didn't pay attention to some of the reviewers of this book. Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down. The author used a lot of back ground information to give credence to what General Stewart accomplished during WWII, which I found very useful. He also mentions at times how he was involved with the war. In my opinion, this is an outstanding piece of work about the rarely mentioned military life of a true American hero. I am just sad I never knew about this part of his life before. This man never mentioned or bragged about his distinguished military career. He was just proud to have served his country. He makes me proud to be an American and proud of this great country."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"The story of a man who had it all and risked it all to do what he thought was his duty is one we can all learn from.

Jimmy Stewart was a patriot and a very capable airman. This book reviews his combat experience in World War II, leading first a bomber, and then a group or wing of bombers. Jimmy was a capable officer and planner, and sometimes a daredevil (buzzing the tower three times). Since he was so much an older figure than the rest, he commanded with respect. I found this book to be informative about JS's war experiences and some of the stories of his leadership. Although good in this respect, I did not get an overall good feel for the actor and his experience during this time.I think this is an OK read about Jimmy Stewart. He was a hero, actor, and airman. His principles taught to him by his hardware salesman Dad were evident in his leadership of young airmen in World War II."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"If your looking for a book about Jimmy Stewart and his acting career this is NOT the book you want.

It is an important tribute to a man I have always admired very greatly, both for his acting and his wartime service, with which I was already familiar. But in many ways the book is more a summary of the author's experiences with and views on the 8th Air Force's bombing campaign against Germany than a detailed account of Jimmy Stewart's actions during the war. I too would have liked more accounts of the missions he flew. Even if he was very reluctant to talk about his wartime experiences, there would have been accounts of his missions in the official records. All in all, however, I enjoyed the book, mainly because I have so much admiration and respect for Jimmy Stewart and am glad to see his wartime service made known to a wider audience."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"If you know anything about Jimmy Stewart, you either love the guy or not.

Instead Stewart enlisted prior to the Pearl Harbor attack as a private and at war's end was a full colonel. His rapid rise as an aviation officer, bomber pilot and commander had nothing to do with his movie star persona but everything to do with his love of country and flying. Although not explicitly stated it was apparent that Steward could of served with distinction in a non-flying military capacity. Steward insisted that he fly as a bomber pilot and is credited with 20 combat missions. Upon returning to Hollywood after the war Steward said he wanted to get back in pictures but no war movie.Certainly this book is about Jimmy Steward illustrious military career but it is also an insightful look at the U.S. bomber operations in England during WW2. The author quotes extensitively from letter, diaries and books to provide the reader with a \\"you are there\\" look at aircrew operations and the inherent dangers of flying bomber missions over France and Germany.This book is not a detailed analysis of every aspect of Stewart's wartime service. It is a broad brushed overview and a tribute to a patriotic individual who used his skills and personality in the service of his country.Numerous photographs of Steward, his military buddies, aircraft and family complement this excellent book."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"Well written, easy to read of a private side of Jimmy Stewart rarely seen. Mr. Stewart was the epitome of the citizen-soldier who rose up thru the ranks to have a distinguished military career, seperate and distinct from his acting. He did this no for personal gloy, but because he felt it was his duty to serve.He could have easily avoided military service due to his age, and due to his Hollywood connections. But instead, he accepted being drafted and asked no special treatment. After training as a bomber pilot, he seeked out and accepted an assignment to a unit preparing for movement overseas. Once deployeed, he flew numerous missions and served in key staff ssignments that were critical to the war effort.After World War II, he remained active in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, and became a jet pilot, and finally retiring at age 60 as a Brigadier general.If you are a fan of Jimmy Stewart, read this book to learn about an unseen side."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","review":"World War II writing at its best from a man who was there. Starr Smith does an outstanding job of capturing a side of Jimmy Stewart that many Americans have never known. There are lessons in this volume on service and leadership that our present and future generations can and should learn and put into common practice.Stewarts skill as a pilot and leader are well documented by this book and it should be required reading for all ranks in all branches of the American military.This book spells out in the course of a life why so many of us choose to serve this great nation of ours."},{"Title":"Novell's Certified Web Designer Study Guide","review":"***The Good:***This book will help you pass the Novell CWDs exams, and may be the only study guide suitable to do so. Even if you are an experienced web developer, many questions on the exams are based on how Novell recommends you do things, i.e. the Novell way. In that regard, this book is indispensible for those wanting to pass the exams, since you will not get this information anywhere else. The chapter ending questions, while not verbatim from the exams, do a very good job of preparing you for what you'll see on the actual exams, so much so that you almost can skip the chapter entirely and just fill in the blanks with answers from the back of the book, and study that. I don't recommend this approach, but that's how preparative the questions are; don't skip them.***The Bad:***If you are not already an experienced web developer, this book will not make you one. There are a great many tidbits and cool tricks an experienced developer can pick up to expand his knowledge base, but this book is too small to be a comprehensive study of all the technologies it covers. If you are new, start with something else. There's not enough here to even make it on my reference shelf.***The Verdict:***If you want to pass the exams, BUY THIS BOOK!

Noyed, although the cover does give the game away. This is the fourth volume in the &quot;Alphabet Friends&quot; series, which devotes one 24-page volume to each letter of the alphabet. The idea is of these volumes is to give beginning readers a fun way of mastering letter recognition by telling an entertaining story highlighting a single letter. In &quot;Daisy, My Dad, and the Letter D&quot; a young girl tells us about what she does each day which involves lots of things beginning with the letter &quot;d.&quot; On every page words that feature the letter &quot;d&quot; are highlighted, with miniature color illustrations above the text (rebus drawings of a desk, dances, dirt, etc.), and color photographs. The ultimate goal is for young children to eventually be able to read them books for themselves, and with the simple, solid approach that Klingel and Noyed use, this should be quite possible.The first thing young readers learn in this book is the difference between the capital letter &quot;D&quot; and the lowercase letter &quot;d.&quot; We then see how &quot;d&quot; can come at the beginning of words like &quot;dog,&quot; in the middle of words like in &quot;panda,&quot; and at the end of a word such as &quot;food.&quot; The back of the book contains Fun Facts about dance, dirt, and dogs, as well as suggestions for young kids to read more about those topics in books appropriate to their age level. Young readers will soon discover that the letter &quot;d&quot; is not highlighted every time it appears at the start of a word so that they will be able to discover some on their own. Which is just another reason that young readers will be inspired to learn to read this book by themselves."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I was thrilled to see that Green Darkness is available through Amazon. For years, I have searched secondhand outlets, purchasing any copies I could find as gifts for friends. I am down to one tattered copy now. I recommend the book to anyone who wants to know more about the Tudor period while reading an intriguing story that becomes a haunting memory. The two main locales -- Ightham (pronounced &quot;item&quot;)Mote and Cowdray in Midhurst -- are real places in England that can be visited today. I always advise friends to read the book first to maximize their experience when they see Ightham and Cowdray. And remember, I said it was a haunting story. Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks so. A guide at Ightham told me she never stays there after dark."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Years after reading this book it stands out vividly in my mind as one of, if not the most, powerfully emotional books I have ever read. Anya Seton is a vivid storyteller; it makes the reader so empathetic to the characters, you feel as if it could be one of your own past incarnations."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, I'm now 38 and have just re-read it after 23 years, it still has the power to immerse me into the story. It is a masterful telling of history and yet the personal lives of Stephan and Celia as well as the rest of the characters are so real, this book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This book, which I read for the first time when I was a young teenage girl, first introduced me to the concept that we travel through time with some of the same souls. From the first few pages, I was totally emersed in the story and I remember feeling very empty when the book was finished. I wanted more. Anya Seton really draws you into her characters lives, their thoughts and feelings. I have been looking for a copy of this book ever since (I gave my original away, years ago, not knowing the impact it would have on me later). If anyone can help me get another copy, I'd sure appreciate it."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This is an older book that I have read several times, and will always be a big favorite. It is full of real history, with real people and fictional characters blended so well you have trouble telling where reality ends and fiction begins. The love story, through reincarnation, alternates between the present and a time of religious and political turmoil 400 years ago. There is a blending of love, hate, war, intrigue, religion, science, and history. I have recommended this book to many, many book loving friends and every one loved it. My old copy is falling apart, and I think it is time to try to replace it. If you like love stories and history, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed with it. I truly liked the idea of the book (reincarnation and karma- two things I strongly believe in), which is the only thing that prevented me from rating it with one star.The characters were not real, I didn't felt as though I knew very much about how they were feeling and that some things were ridiculously elaborate (Julian is from Italy- we get it! I think that is mentioned at least 300 times. Yet his marriage gets one sentence when it happens and a paragraph later?? Would that not be slightly more important thank knowing that he's from Italy?)Worst of all, I felt like there was hardly much of a love story-- which is what the entire book is supposed to be based on (or that was my interpretation, at least.) It didn't seem to me that Celia and Stephen loved each other all that much (come on, she \\"forgot\\" about him SEVERAL times- you don't forget about the person you're truly in love with!) and Celia and Richard seemed to hate each other. They seemed to hardly know each other.Overall, very disappointing. If you want to read a real love story- go for Outlander by Diana Gabaldon instead."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This is such a good book. It is as excellent now as it was when it was written 30 years ago."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I enjoyed the book, especially the middle part (the majority of the story) about the first Celia and Stephen the monk. They had a truly sad ending, my heart especially broke for the fate of Stephen. Maybe it is just me, but the last part of the book just didn't flow well for me, but I can't put my finger on why. All in all an enjoyable read, but it definitely isn't Katherine, which all lovers of historical fiction should read -- that one deserves 10 stars at least."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This is a wonderful book about karma and past lives. It takes place in the 1960s, England and in the 1500s. This piece brings in historical facts, although the author does not note which are acurate and which are made up. It is a long book, over 500 pages, but a quick read. I finished it in a couple of nights. A definite page turner. If you like &quot;Knight in Shining Armour&quot; by Jude Devaraux you would love this piece. It is a similiar concept only better (if you can believe that). This was a beautiful and sad love story, not a bodice ripper."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager!I never returned the book to the libary, just could not part with it!(I did pay for the book!)Green Darkness remains one of the best books, if not the best I have ever read in my life.My G-d what a good read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If I could give it 10 star's I would."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Celia and Richard Marsden are recently married and living in England in 1968. During a weekend get together with friends Celia Marsden slips into unconsciousness and her mother's friend, Dr. Akananda, a doctor who believes in reincarnation, realizes the only way to help Celia is to have her relive her past life that is haunting her. Thus the reader is transported back 400 years ago, during the reign of King Henry VIII's children, a tumultuous time in England, and learns the story of a servant girl Celia Bouhn.Green Darkness, tackles reincarnation, mysticism, forbidden love, fate as well as beautifully descriptive detail about England as it truly must have been in the 1500's. While off to a slow start the author builds the story until you can wait no longer to find out the resolution - it finishes strong. A great historical fiction novel, filled with lively characters, Green Darkness is a truly beautifully written story.Words of advice: It's a pretty dense book and starts out slow. Be patient it is worth it to get to the end! And if you enjoy this time period I would recommend The Autobiography of Henry VIII with notes by his fool Will Somers, by Margaret George."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"GREEN DARKNESS was the first historical fiction tale I ever read. I picked it up entirely by accident as a young teen, being somewhat of an insomniac, and finding a black cloth-bound thick book written by a woman on the bookshelves in my parents' den, I decided to take a chance one night.That sealed my fate, I've been a fan of history, historical fiction, and historical non-fiction ever since. GREEN DARKNESS is a medieval love story laced with the paranormal, with interwoven plot lines from the 1970s-present. (This is a reprint of a book originally published sometime in the 60s or 70s--I would guess 70s, though I've lost my copy.)A newly married man and wife begin to experience marital trouble after dabbling in the occult. The narrative shifts from their story to that of two young people in the 1500s, as you find out that the modern couple are the reincarnated souls of the 1500s couple. Murders, suicides, intrigue and plagues entertain you while this story of star-crossed lovers plays out.I highly recommend this book to readers of this genre. Don't let the reincarnation plotline throw you off--the book is far more focused on personal relationships than on paranormal subject matter."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness was well written with excellent period descriptions of Tudor England. You not only read a description of royal life but, life for the common people. The main character, Celia, goes through such a roller coaster of fortunes and takes us with her All aspects of life at that time are examined. There were interesting speculations on reincarnation. If some of the characters seemed cruel, well this was a cruel time. I can see how some meddlesome neighbor or someone with a grudge against an ordinary person could send them to the stake or the Tower based on an allegation.Here is the \\"but\\" part of my review. Celia, the heroine, was not a likable or interesting character. As one young reviewer pointed out she persisted in her pursuit of a character who had rebuffed her numerous times. She is more like a half baked Isolde than a tragic heroine. It went against common sense as well. Even someone of mediocre intelligence has a modicum of pragmatism to move on; heartbreaking as it is. The modern day heroine Celia only inspired indifference. I didn't care what happened to her. In fact it was the secondary characters, the Mother, the Aunt, the Italian Doctor, and the Hindu doctor who were well drawn and sympathetic characters. I found myself asking, \\"why are you going to such lengths for this person?\\" Often they put themselves at great physical and emotional risks for the sake of Celia.I read Anya Seton's other book \\"Katherine\\". I was somewhat let down by this book. It is still well worth reading."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I didn't expect much from this book when I first picked it up- I liked the art on the cover and the way the old pages looked. It sat on my shelf looking pretty for a few months before I actually decided to read it, but once I actually did I couldn't believe I hadn't read it before.Green Darkness is one of those books that makes you late because you don't want to leave it. There's something about the way Seton writes her characters that's tangible: as long ago as it was written, as long ago as the events are placed, whether the characters charm or appall you the way they're written you can understand their hopes and plights and pains. The story deals with the interaction of past lives and consequences on the present, all of this is explained by many of the other reviewers well enough. But as much as you know what's going to happen in the book you're just compelled to keep reading and see it for yourself. It's painful what happens, but it really is all right again in the end.I expected nothing from this book when I bought it and ended up reading the last two thirds of it in a single nine hour session because I just couldn't bear to put it down again. I've rarely been touched this much by a book about characters I've never heard of before and I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I too read this book at age 15 - and have not forgotten it - I have read it more than twice since (in the last 25 years) and I have enjoyed it every time. I know this book had an impact on my studies - I have a masters in British History - with a concentration in Tudor/ Stuart history, and I can directly relate my interest in that period to reading this book. I highly recommend it - even for those NOT interested in history - but just in possibilities..."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"My folks have an enourmous amount of books and when I was bored I'd pluck one off the shelf at random and read it. They had a paperback version of Green Darkness. I must have been about 14 when I read it and it knocked my socks off. Ms. Seton artfully weaves the two doomed lovers Celia the beautiful, bastard child of bastard noblemen and Stephen a Benedictine monk during the fanatical protestent reign of the &quot;boy King&quot; Edward into a luridly beautiful web of tormented passion so intense that it must be reconciled.This is not your run of the mill time travel romance. It deals more with past life regression and karmic debt. Green Darkness is a beautifully written, historically accurate altogether wonderful book.If the powers that be are reading this. PLEASE reprint it someday soon. I have a copy that I've read more than a dozen times. The only things that holds it together now is Scotch tape and a prayer."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This story was especially interesting because it included paranormal experience... but also included lots of factual history. I especially enjoyed the way the author wrote words in order for them to be read in the various accents of the people. It made the spoken words of the characters really come alive and seem real. I also liked that there was definate resolution at the ending, and the author explained who was who from the past and current lives (although the reader will probably have a good guess for this). The story moved along quickly and it was a very enjoyable and memorable read!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Suddenly, after 25 years, the recollection of this book took hold of me. I'm forever grateful for the experience. I was 16 when I read this unbelievable story and coupled with the Cronicles of Narnia, (what a contraditon!),it was this reading experience that made me love the written word and to this day, I feel fortunate. Far too many will live without knowing and appreciating a really good book; a really worthwhile escape; and real passion. They will never know the the wisdom and the knowledge brought to someone who enjoys reading; recognizing the humbleness of realizing how much they still have yet to learn. This book, if my recollection dosen't deceive me, married passion and education. I know that it profoundly impacted my life because it showed me the value & joy of reading, and I'm forever thankful."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I came to Canada on four vacations, 1973, 1975 ( I was 28, started art classes in september on the Royal Academy in The Hague and had never been further than the touristic Monschau in Germany and Dinant in Belgium) 1977, 1980. Quickly felt at home in Winnipeg, browsing second book shops and got to know Cole's Bookstore. Pockets were cheap. Had never head of Anya Seton before, but got attracted by Green Darkness'es alluring cover. At the deep of night, when my elder sister's family dreamed, I met all the characters in the book one by one as if they came to me in person. I could feel them agonized by their powerlessness against their natural inclinations,hereditary shortcomings and uncertainties. Nothing seemed to be able to turn fate, and only in future was there a chance to redeem. They were captives of their lives, like I was a prisoner of this book: it only let me go but at the end, like the characters in the book !"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I can't decide if I liked this novel or not. Was somewhat interesting, once you got to the 16th century - all the 20th century characters, including the main characters were annoying.Was confused and distracted by all the secondary characters in the 16th century as well. Would not consider this a romance, beings Stephen/Richard is hardly in the novel - this is more Celia's story in which Stephen is not around for most of the book - her interactions with many historical figures of the time were unbelievable due to her station in life - and her interaction with Thomas Wyatt (executed by Mary for starting rebellion to replace her with Elizabeth) was absolutely ridiculous, even for fiction.Bought this book and Katherine together based on recommendations and reviews, not sure I want to try Katherine now..maybe if I am between other novels.."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I just thought this book was sooo ridiculously boring. I basically bought it because it was recommended on Amazon and got great reviews and thats why I had to write this review because I just didn't understand all the rave reviews. Basically this book was sooo boring I couldn't even get past page 100.

My mother had handed me an old paperback lent to her by a friend and said, with tears in her eyes, &quot;you must read this&quot;. I started reading and did not put the book down until I had finished. I passed that old book on to a friend as well, and have not seen another copy since!

It's a good love story, I guess. But, it's the reincarnation theme that made the love story memorable to me.

It sounded so intriguing, but within the first 15 pages I felt like I'd been duped. I will say that the inner story that is set back in Tudor times was intriguing, but the out story was horrible. The writing was stiff and contrived, none of the characters were likable, and in all the behavior of pretty much everyone seemed unbelievable.

While I enjoyed 'Green Darkness' very much, I think 'Katherine' is the better book. Both novels share the same qualities of sound research, attention to detail, vivid descriptive power and historical imagination. Anya Seton had the ability to take events about which relatively few facts are known and build them up into a compelling drama. But as I said, I don't think 'Green Darkness' reaches the standard of 'Katherine' and here are the reasons why. First,the theme of reincarnation led to some problems, such as the framing of the Tudor narrative with two sections set in 1968 - while there is nothing wrong with this as a device, the 1968 setting simply wasn't as convincing as the historical one. Also while it was easy to connect some of the 20th century characters with their Tudor identities, others were supposed to be the same person and yet didn't seem to bear any relation to each other. I felt there should have been more explanation of the premise on which the story was based - although the book caused me to think about the idea of reincarnation more than I ever had before, I still didn't understand some points, such as why the doctor/guru has to sacrifice his physical health for helping Celia come to terms with her past life? Second point - the characters of Celia and Stephen are definitely underdeveloped compared to the hero and heroine of 'Katherine' - which is a pity because I found Celia an endearing heroine and would have liked to go more deeply into her point of view. Finally, the dramatic death of Celia - which is the idea on which the whole book is based and which the reader expects from the start - should have been given more weight and power. Having said all that, I far preferred reading 'Green Darkness' to yet another version of the life of Elizabeth I or Mary Queen of Scots about whom so much is known. It proved to me that Ms Seton is not a 'one-book' writer and I will go on to read more of her work. And yes, I want to visit Ightham Mote at the first opportunity! One recommendation - if you enjoy 'Green Darkness' then you would probably also like 'Lady of Hay' by Barbara Erskine."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Seton's Green Darkness makes for a frustrating reading experience.On the one hand, the characterization and, at times, writing style, are highly uneven, fluctuating to the point that I would put down the book for weeks at a time, unwilling to finish. On the other hand, Seton's depiction of Roman Catholic-Anglo Protestant sectarianism is multi-dimensional, well-crafted, satisfying. In the end, I finished the novel, which I would be willing to give another chance, perhaps in part because some of the better-written reviews here on Amazon speak so persuasively of GD's and Anya Seton's merits.Many of GD's selling points--historical British setting; religion, folk belief, and mysticism; forbidden love; depiction of historical conflict--number amongst my favorite elements in fiction. The main conceit--newly married American woman relives a portion of her \\"past life\\" in 16th century Egnland, where she was a young girl (Celia) in love with a Catholic cleric--is a promising one.Seton's deft treatment of sectarianism--not so much its causes but its manifestations in the ideologies of \\"average\\" people--is enough to make GD worth reading. Seton offers us multiple characters, each representing different levels of religiosity, piety, prejudice, apologetics, unbelief, or ecumenicalism. She gives us Ursula, a Roman Catholic loyalist whose devotion relies on a rudimentary but earnestly-conceived understanding of theological tenets (laypeople in that age did not often have first-hand knowledge of doctrinal issues), as well as on the folk belief of the day. Her kinswoman (girl, rather) Celia is, for me, a more compelling mixture of childish misapprehension of religion, superstition, misplaced religious fervor, and, towards the end of the book, agnosticism bordering on unbelief. Celia clings to Catholicism for very different reasons than Ursula (including, perhaps, Celia's association of Stephen with Catholicism) and this contrast is compelling.Julian is meant to be our closest approximation to a neutral; as a lapsed Catholic and man-of-the-world who has studied non-Christian religions, and as a non-Anglo European, Julian observes with a slightly jaded eye the sectarian violence unfolding around him.Sir Anthony is an interesting portrait of piety without self-awareness. He believes that he Believes, and it is this very insistence on his religious credentials that blinds him to his own inconsistent application of Belief. He may after all be convinced that his religious expediency (switching denominations to suit the politics of the hour) is itself a form of piety, in that it preserved him in secret service to the \\"one true faith\\" of Catholicism.A number of minor characters add layers to Seton's presentation of sectarianism, for example, the Protestant officer sent to check up on Sir Anthony's household. His interior monologues dismiss Catholicism as a jumble of superstitious rituals, yet the officer deals fairly with Anthony, refusing to abuse his power as an agent of a newly Protestant realm. Seton could have further diversified her analysis by giving us Protestant characters with equal depth and importance to the story, but I think she has done a fine enough job illustrating the complicated nature of Belief and its relation to (or dismemberment from) sectarianism.Sadly, Seton is less adept at convincing us of several key points on which the plot hinges. Her treatments of Stephen and Celia are but the two most glaring examples of the poor characterization that plagues the novel. Stephen is inconsistently defined for us, unevenly displaying genuine piety, indulgent self-righteousness, worldly ambition, and almost unholy pride. I say \\"unevenly,\\" because, as Colleen McCullough has proved in her excellent characterization of Father Ralph (\\"The Thorn Birds\\"), it is quite possible to convincingly portray a \\"man of God\\" battling a driving thirst for worldly prominence and power.Stephen's early aversion to Celia is understandable, especially in light of his era's medieval-residual Madonna/Whore interpretation of the female character. We can allow that he feels a surface attraction to Celia, and that he is disgusted by his carnal urges, and determined to do away with the perceived source of them. What is far less easy to understand is his alarmingly abrupt acquiescence at the end, when we are given to believe this ambitious and self-important young cleric is suddenly eager to rush into the arms of a woman who, by all indications, would be his professional and spiritual undoing.I don't believe Seton means Celia to be a sympathetic character. At least, I hope Celia's unpleasantness was planned by the author, and not a by-product of inept characterization. Although her religious psychology interested me, Celia's self-interest seems more childish and less delightfully calculating than that of, say, Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara, who exemplifies how a character with strongly negative traits--selfishness, vanity, overweening ambition--can endear herself to readers.Every character suffers from bizarre fluctuations in motivations, actions, and reactions. I want to stress that by no means do I advocate authors' use of one-note, stagnant characters without complexity or self-confliction. I don't even bother reviewing books with characters like that. But Seton could have found more subtle ways to showcase, say, Julian's ambivalence toward Ursula and Celia, than having Julian feel rushes of warm affection for the duo in one scene and, in another scene, violently despising the very sight of Ursula, to the point that he goes out of his way to hide from her.Look carefully at her treatment of several characters--Magdalen, Anthony, Ursula, Julian, Celia, Stephen--and decide for yourself whether Seton is engaged in multi-layered characterization or a fragmented, scene-by-by-scene approach that ascribes wildly varying motivations and reactions to the same character without sufficient evidence allowing for the sudden change.Finally, Seton's prose style is as inconsistent as her characterization. I am frankly surprised that Philippa Gregory--whose vastly superior historical works I have enjoyed since 1990--has written in mild praise of Seton. Seton's style can be hackneyed (witness the many \\"hissed,\\" \\"whispered,\\" and adverb-laden dialogue tags), yet once in a while she'll sprinkle in a statement of surprising insight. Her addiction to literally-rendered and thus almost unreadable dialect is most unfortunate, and I'm very glad only a few characters hail from Scotland and the North Country.In the end, I was disappointed by Green Darkness' generally uneven level of quality, but Seton's thoughtful depiction of sectarianism in 16th century Britain is enough to recommend the novel. I intend to read other of Seton's works, and return to Green Darkness with, perhaps, further perspective on a book so well-loved by so many."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"*Spoilers*Having read and loved three other novels by Anya Seton (Dragonwyck, Katherine, and Devil Water), I have to say I was very disappointed with what I read of Green Darkness. I borrowed this book from my local library on Friday and read all of Part One and some of Part Two that same night. I think I only got that far because I so desperately wanted to like the book. For the next two hours, I skimmed through four-hundred-odd pages of dragging plot and caved and read the ending.Instead of finding myself liking this novel, I have left it with the feeling that this was one of the most melodramatic pieces of literature I have ever encountered. The themes of reincarnation and past love are intriguing, but the way Seton uses them in the plot drove me batty. Spoilers ahead. Don't continue if you don't want to know the plot. Celia and Richard were doomed lovers in a past life during the Tudor period (Edward/Mary/Elizabeth as opposed to their father, Henry VIII and his father). They managed to find each other in the present (1968, I believe) in a world populated by millions of people because their reincarnated selves have been haunted by the tragic ending of their Tudor romance. And they have also managed to surrounded themselves with the present-day counterparts of people they knew in their past lives, right down to the villain-ess who discovered their forbidden love in the 1500s and whose present-day counterpart still harbors an intense dislike for present-day Celia. All a little too convenient.Oh, and then there's the fact that Richard's being driven into an introvert/bit of a maniac by his past self and Celia is hovering on the brink of death. And only by reliving their past lives can they both be saved. If I read right, Celia is legally dead at one point; the doctors at the hospital demand her body be taken away because they need the bed and space for people who have recently been in a car accident. But the magical Hindu spirit doctor brings her back to life? What is going on here?!To end, this is not the novel I would recommend people to start with when discovering Anya Seton's work for the first time. Instead, I'd recommend Dragonwyck: not nearly as long or dragging, a believable plot, and characters you can actually relate to."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I am a huge fan of Seton's work.

Since then, I've gone through many copies and read it numerous times, and each time I've read it, it's like a visit with an old friend. Since I personally believe in reincarnation, which is the main theme of the story, I find it even more enjoyable.Unlike some books where the reader is left wondering what happened to certain characters, this book ties up all the loose ends, leaving the reader with a sense of completion.Ms. Seton's devotion to her subject, and historical research in writing this book are admirable and when I visited England in the 1980's I visited Midhurst, where the main part of the story takes place, and stayed in the Spread Eagle Inn, where the main character, Celia, lived during Tudor times. I guess that's part of the joy of this book - that so many of the places really exist, they are not made up by the author. Some of the characters in the Tudor period of the story existed as well, though of course the story Ms. Seton has spun about their lives is her own.Though it can be described as a historical romance, there is a lot of history here, and philosophy, and it's not all hearts and flowers.Over the years I've purchased many copies of this book in used book stores and given them away to friends who always come back and say \\"this is the best book I ever read\\".

Time has certainly not diminished the capacity of this well-written book to entertain the reader.This is a tale of star-crossed lovers and reincarnation. It is a story of passion and love that transcends time and is really two stories. One takes place in the twentieth century and the other in sixteenth century Tudor England. Combining history, romance, and suspense, it will keep the reader turning the pages.When, after a whirlwind courtship, titled Englishman, Richard Marsdon, marries Celia Taylor, a young American heiress, it seems to be a fairytale romance. It had simply been love at first sight. While living in his ancestral home with Celia, however, Richard seems to change, withdrawing from Celia emotionally. Celia finds the change almost incomprehensible, but she, too, is having her own issues with her strange sense of deja vu. All things came to a head when they throw a house party, and something happens that causes Celia to hover between life and death.As luck would have it, present at the time is a medical doctor and master of mysticism, Dr. Akananda. He senses that Celia must relive her past in order to understand and survive her present. The book then segues into sixteenth century Tudor England, where Celia was a young and beautiful woman, working as a servant in a nobleman's home. It explores her life and the passion that was to dominate her, body and soul.Of the two stories that emerge, the more interesting one takes place in the past, as the author vividly brings to life the religious tumult, political strife, and jockeying for position and power that characterized Tudor England.

Reader: bare with the story because it is something really worth thinking about in the end. Does our soul really bounce back from one lifetime to the next until it fulfills its duty to stop the reincarnation? This story will help answer that. I love the angst-love deprived story between Celia and Stephen. Celia (de Bohun) 14 years old, and Stephen Marsdon, a Benedictine monk. Yes, they fall in love despite Stephen's vow to the Catholic Church; they just fall in love, and as a result of their love affair that took place four hundred years back, their past catches up with them at the current time where only Stephen (Richard Marsdon) and Celia can resolve."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This is by far one of the most wonderful works of historical fiction that I have ever come across.

Twenty-six years later I've yet to find a novel that deals with past lives' effects on future lives as intelligently, AND include a love story. My only complaint is that the regression scenes are a bit sketchy,with the action focusing mostly on the Tudor period. There could be a bit more follow-up on how Celia's and Richard's marriage turned out. But the Tudor period scenes are wonderful. Celia's and Dr. Akananda's spirit journeys are interesting, with the 20th-century Celia acquiring inner peace and Dr. Akananda paying off his past-life debts. I just wish there were more novelists who would work with the subject of reincarnation."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness was a haunting book that spanned from Tudor England to the 20th Century. In the first part of the book, we are introduced to Celia and her husband. We quickly discover that there is something in their past life that causes conflict in their current life. In the second part of the book, we are taken back to 16th Century England during the reign of King Edward and we are introduced to another Celia. It's mildly predictable when everyone in Celia's 16th Century life resembles everyone in the first part of the book.However, the historical narrative is rich in detail as we see the throne change from Edward, to Mary, to Elizabeth, and we encounter all of the religious upheaval in England. The battle of Catholics vs. Protestants is prevalent throughout, but the real conflict lies with Celia and the monk, Brother Stephen. Even though I knew the outcome of the tragic 16th Century story, I was surprised at the execution.The last part of the book, which took us back to 20th Century, was more of a disappointment. It felt rushed, and although Seton wrapped up the past-life plot, it was lacking something. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but was a bit relieved when it was finished."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Like everyone else it seems, I read this years ago and it stuck with me.

All in all, I was glad I stuck with it because about 3/4 of the way thru it became a bit more interesting. Being a Christian, I do not believe in reincarnation -(maybe that is why I didn't quite jive with the storyline), but it still wasn't the passionate, gripping love story I thought it was going to be. I was thrilled when Stephen finally broke down and knew he could not live without Celia and made plans to run away to France with her. That was when the story picked up for me and it was getting good, but that thrill was short lived because in the next couple paragraphs they were both dead!!!ARGH!!! The writing itself -the accents, and dialog were fantastic - as expected with Seton's books, but the story itself was pretty odd and dull.

I would put it nearly on par with other \\"romance\\" novels in terms of lack of story depth & character interest.

At first I thought the Hindu was Celia's mothers husband- but to no avail! They just seem to be very fond of each other and have some obvious chemistry.This chemistry was something I found incredibly lacking in Celia and Richard. Richard was distant at times, as needed. But even when he was somewhat nice to his wife there seemed to be no connection. Something that irritated me as this is claimed to be somewhat a romance novel.The story itself just seems dragged and over told, I got to around page 120 and still could not admire the plot or characters, I eventually had to put it down.It proved to be slow and not attention grabbing to me, but it was clear that the author knew her stuff when coming to the historical parts.

I don't know exactly what was making me so reluctant to begin it. For one thing, the story takes place in two time periods: the late 1960's in an historic English manor home and in 1550's Tudor England during the reigns of King Edward VI and Mary I. I love stories about Tudor England, but this was my first one to also include the element of reincarnation. While I personally don't believe in reincarnation, it does make for a fascinating facet to a story. I love how everything in the present is tied into the past.While I didn't feel alot for the 1960's Robert and Celia, I was sucked into Seton's description and story of Stephen, the monk torn between his vows to serve God and the provocative Celia, and Celia's longing for the man she couldn't have. While the novel is short on romance, I could feel the tension between Stephen and Celia in a way that seemed tragic and kept me turning the pages of this novel. Although, we know what happens to Stephen and Celia, the horror of it when we finally reach the climax, leaves you with a haunted, uneasy feeling. The title \\"Green Darkness\\" sums up the mood of this novel.I've never read a book quite like this one, which is always a good thing in my opinion. I love a good novel where I'm left thinking about it for days after I've read it. While Green Darkness is certainly not for everyone, I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something out of the ordinary.I've now been pleased with two of Ms. Seton's books, I loved \\"Katherine\\" and \\"Green Darkness\\" for different reasons, and I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This was my last shot at reading an Anya Seton book after being so enthralled by Katherine. I think the frame story of Richard and Celia was the most interesting, but it was the smaller part of the book in comparison to the flashback.

Overall the book is a decent read but is certainly not thrilling."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I read this novel about 30 years ago. I felt the urge to read it again.

I don't agree with the bad reviews given by many here because there wasn't gobs of Outlander type sex between the two characters or that the main characters didn't 'get together' at the end. Stephen and Celia did get together, in their next incarnations as Richard and Celia. The whole premise of this story was that they had to work things out from their past lives so they COULD be together in the next. If they had 'gotten together' in their previous lives why would there be any conflict/story to tell? This is not a cheesy romance novel. There's so much more to it than that. Perhaps it is the fault of the publishers for billing it as such. As far as liking Celia, I don't think we're supposed to like her. She has to be shown as flawed and why there are karmic dues to be paid. Whether you believe in reincarnation or not, it is the theme of this story. Dr. Akananda and Master Julien have to sacrifice for Celia to pay their own karmic dues. It is inferred that in a previous incarnation in ancient Greece. Dr. A./Master J. abandoned Celia and Ursula. This is his chance to make up for it. Celia did try to move on-she had schemed to win approval to marry a rich titled young man when Stephen reappeared in her life which led to her decision to give him the Water Witch's potion. Would Stephen have renounced his vows if not for that? There are many layers to this story.

But Celia keeps having glimpses of a different Celia's life that took place in the same area, but during the Tudor period.The vast majority of the book takes place in Tudor England. Current Celia is forced to relive her past life so wrongs from that time can be righted in this life. I read a lot of historical fiction and the Tudors have really swamped the genre lately so I am always wary of another book about Henry VIII, Mary, or Elizabeth. This one I actually found to be quite fascinating. It focuses on Anthony Browne, a minor noble who happens to be Catholic. The book does an excellent job of showing the religious turmoil of the period from a more average person's perspective and from the perspective of a lesser noble. Browne's star fades while Henry VIII's son, Edward, is on the throne but then flourishes with Mary. When Elizabeth takes the throne, Browne and the country are once again turned about and forced to conform to this new power. Instead of showing the politics and major players of this turbulent time, the book really just shows how unstable everything was and how that affected the country. I hadn't read anything that took this particular perspective and I really enjoyed it.It is hard to directly pinpoint what I didn't like about this book. I feel that some books I have trouble putting down and some I have trouble picking up. This was one of the latter. It might have had to do with the characters. I didn't find any of the characters in the Tudor period to be extremely sympathetic. In the modern time period I liked most of them and that carried over so that I did feel sympathy for their past counterpoints but I wasn't crazy about any of them. This could also stem from the fact that you know the ending for past Celia and Stephen (as Richard is named in the past) before the story begins and so I didn't let myself get too attached. Whatever the reason, I had trouble getting myself to read this book. It was very well written and the period details are really well done. I also like the premise of karma and paying for mistakes made in past lives. I will definitely read other books by Anya Seton, I just don't think this one will be my favorite."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I do believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls, and love good historical novels, so I was happy to come across a copy of this. It begins in 1968, in England, where Celia Marsdon is greatly troubles by angst that cannot be understood, and her husband Richard is becoming extremely abusive. Celia's mother has a friend, a Hindu doctor, Akananda, with a deep understanding of the laws of karma and past lives, who helps her get release from the troubles of a past life.We are then taken to England of the Tudor period beginning in the reign of the sickly Edward VI and through Bloody Mary to the canny Queen Elizabeth I.Celia de Bohun is a innocent but coquettish young beauty who unknowingly becomes caught up in the intrigues of the court and church. she is married off in a loveless marriage and is passionately drawn to the young priest Stephen who is torn between his love of Celia and his vows to the church. The saga ends in tragedy through the machinations of two jealous and malicious villains, but the journey to the past enables the 20th century Celia to find resolution in her current life.A very fleshy passionate, vivid and well written work.A Gothic cross between parapsychology and historic romance."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I read this book when it first came out. Loved it and have re-read it a number of times. Powers that be -- please create a spot in \\"Kindleland\\" for this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This was a well researched historical novel, but with a paranormal/reincarnation start and end, adding to the interest and somewhat preparing for the plot line.It does start out in 1968, then you're transported to the Tudor era from 1552-1559, giving accurate as possible locations, people, living conditions, attitudes and events of the period over a portion of Europe as well as England.I read it 1st in the late '70's and became a permanent fan of Anya Seton. Reading it again was just as big a pleasure."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. I can't figure out why there are so many bad reviews, especially the ones claiming boredom! This is one of Anya Seton's MOST engrossing!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Great read!! Admit a little slower than I expected but once it took off...a real page turner!! I reccommend this book; a great summer read!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"a vivid portrayal of Tudor England with all its drama, intrigue, and grisliness presented at the fore of the tumultuous story of passion doomed from the start, and reincarnated for redemption. Ms Seton has quite expertly maneuvered the love-hate relationship between the seemingly staid monk, Stephen, and the in-so-many-ways-as-yet naive and seductively beautiful, young Celia amidst the raging political and religious conflict following the death of Henry VIII.England finds itself in dangerous vacillation as the throne passes from the temperamental, protestant Edward, to the zealously catholic Mary, and then again to another protestant in the form of the wily Elizabeth--the people at turns changing their religion to suit the one reigning at court to save themselves from prosecution, and oftentimes, death.In the center of the story is Celia, the \\"past self\\" of another Celia introduced in the beginning of the novel, set in the 1960s. The tale unfolds with the chilling narration to a group of modern-day aristocrats of an unidentified woman mercilessly walled-up alive in one of England's oldest dwellings. What follows then is the account of a dangerously alluring girl named Celia whose life in 16th century England is paved foremost with unbridled lust for a Benedictine monk, combined with hardships, despair, terror, and even witchcraft in the furor that is the Tudor dynasty. Her blind and fervent desire for Stephen has landed her often in dire straits as she becomes \\"fair game\\" for men drunk in lust at the site of her beauty, that which ultimately brings forth her demise.I applaud Ms Seton as she brings closer to home the various political struggles that the court of England went through, the effects of which trickled down to the masses, in due course defining their way of life. Yet, she managed to stray away from lengthy (and what, to some, may become boring) descriptions of far-reaching political cause and effects, whilst heaping her prose with lively, often subtly menacing, sometimes edge-of-your-seat scenes. Her characters have depth and realistic emotional conflicts they themselves have had to go through--even so far as giving the English monarchs a different dimension precluded from the history books--without overshadowing the real premise of the story, and without veering away from the main character of Celia. I dont think she could have made her novel work if it was any shorter or longer--it had the perfect take off point to set down the events that led to the violent death of the young woman. Even her approach on reincarnation was believable, and was, in fact, instrumental in adding vibrancy to the deep-seated turmoil some of the characters felt and had to overcome.on par with philipa gregory, anya seton is definitely a master storyteller. Green Darkness is a wonderful historical fiction with a deft mix of drama, love, and suspense. a satisfying read..."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"While I had a hard time accepting the theory of reincarnation, this story is very interesting. My favorite part is the reinactment of 16th Century England and the chaos of that time."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness is, to date, one of the two best books that I have ever encountered. It is only matched in my eyes by another of Anya Seton's works, Katherine. Rich in forbidden romance and spiritualism, the novel takes readers on a journey that questions what we believe to be both moral and possible in our world. It follows the lives of a troubled couple in the present day, who readers slowly comes to discover, were actually the reincarnation of a forbidden love affair that took place ages ago. By examining their tortured past, they come to discover the love that still exists and is hard-pressed to fade.I could not put it down or go to sleep until I had finished. A copy of the novel will always remain on my bookshelf as one of my most respected possessions. Ms. Seton had a true gift for capturing the intensity and struggle that permeate the deepest of loves in such a way that the reader can actually experience the feelings firsthand, without ever having to leave the chair."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"After many, many recommendations, this was the first Anya Seton book I read. This story of reincarnation has been in my possession for many years so I don't know why I had procrastinated for so long. I had even picked up a hardback edition when I visited the bookstore capital of the world, Hay-on-Wye in Wales last year. Somehow, I knew once I read it that it was going to become a keeper. At any rate, I am sorry I didn't read it earlier, because I certainly savored every page.The first portion of the book is set in 1968. American heiress Celia Taylor has married Richard Marsdon after meeting the young British nobleman on a cruise. They are blissfully happy and living on his Sussex estate when, during a visit to nearby ruins of a cathedral, she experiences some rather bizarre visions and her husband begins to be rather distant. Then, after a visit and tour of Ightham Mote, a manor house in the next county, she rather mysteriously faints. Her friend Dr. Akananda is worried. And he, but only he, knows what is going on. When Celia lapses into a catatonic state after hosting a dinner party, her future is very much at risk. It appears she needs to relive the events of her prior life before she can find happiness in the present.At this point, the next 400+ pages of the book is set in the 1550s beginning with a visit of the young King Edward VI to the estate where Celia, now 15-year-old Celia Bohun, is living with her aunt Ursula. There she meets Stephen Marsdon, the young monk who has become the house priest for the estate, albeit covertly in the now protestant country, as decreed by Edward's father, Henry VIII. Celia is immediately smitten.The book is intricately detailed with history of the period and characters meet and have conversations with Edward and then Mary and other historical figures of the time as the political and religious structure of the country has gone from Catholic to protestant and then back to Catholic again.It is interesting to discover who the counterparts of the dinner guests of Celia and Richard Marston in 1968 are in the 16th C. It is clear early on that Ursula is Lily (Celia's mother) and Julian, the Italian physician, is Dr. Akananda. Some of the other characters aren't as apparent until later and it would be seen as a spoiler to reveal them here.A small warning, don't do as I did and put names of some of the secondary characters into an internet search engine. Doing this with one character revealed a major spoiler nearly 100 years before the book told of it. It was also very interesting to discover that two of the secondary characters were ancestors of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. So, for those who want to know more about the historical figures - major and minor - of the 16 C., I urge you to do so but wait until the book is completed.Even though some of the details were a mystery, the eventual outcome of Stephen and Celia was pretty much known from the beginning. That said, the next to the last portion of the book where their 16th C. destinies are played out is some of the most dramatic of the entire book.I'm not much into re-reading books - but this one is certainly going on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I've read this book two or three times in the last few years and have forced all of my friends to read it also. The book incorporates all of the elements of romance and intrigue. It deals with such topics as forbidden romance and the kind of love that is so intense and powerful that it is only temporarily hindered by death before it transcends into the next life. The character Celia is the perfect mixture of innocence and seductiveness. The story line follows her as she grows into womanhood and you fall witness to her falling in love for the first time with the one man whom she can never have. The novel is set in England during the 1500s whose own tale of royalty, deceit and religious turmoil makes for a fascinating story unto itself. The novel is a little lengthy but well worth the effort. You'll never be able to put it down once you begin to read and it will leave you with a story that will haunt your dreams and that you will never forget."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"In the 1960's, young Celia Marsdon travels to England to visit the ancestral lands of her husband, Richard Marsdon. Once they get there, things get strange--Richard begins acting like an utter jerk, while Celia begins to have strange fits and visions. Celia's mother has befriended a Hindu guru, Dr. Akananda, and it is he who figures out what's wrong with the young couple. The troubles of the present time can only be solved by revisiting a tragedy from the past.And so the older story begins, in the reign of Edward VI, as lovely young Celia de Bohun and her loving aunt take up residence with a grand family as \\"poor relations\\". Celia is a fascinating and \\"real\\" character, full of contradictions and human failings. She is headstrong and impulsive; dreaming of true love but entranced by male flattery; innocent but coquettish. She creates a scandal when she falls in love with the family chaplain, Stephen--who in turn desires Celia but does not want to break his vow of chastity. They part--but never forget each other. Time passes; Edward's persecution of Catholics gives way to Mary's persecution of Protestants; the family fortunes rise and fall; sympathetic characters harden into detestable ones (I weep for you, Magdalen!). Anya Seton draws us deeply into her world, filled with schemes, ambition, and lies; and with ghosts, madwomen, superstitions, and a particular, notorious Celtic witch. And when Celia and Stephen finally meet again, nothing can stop the power between them. It ends tragically, and we cry; we've been so sucked into the Tudor story that we forget we're headed back to the 1960's to resolve it all.One gripe: It always gets on my nerves when authors of historical fiction insert modern beauty standards into their novels. I didn't like the treatment of the overweight girl, Mabel. This story is supposed to be taking place in a time when \\"pleasingly plump\\" was a compliment and not a euphemism. Had Mabel really lived, I doubt she would have been thought of so derisively. However, this gripe is sort of offset by the kudos I must give to Seton for having a sympathetic gay character in her novel--especially considering the date of publication. Even current romance writers (who should know better) still tend to assign homosexuality to the most depraved of villains. So, I grumble about Seton's treatment of the overweight, but I'm impressed with her treatment of the gay man in the story.Overall: An enthralling story. Starts slow, but by the time you get to the halfway point, you won;t be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"'Green Darkness' was recommended to me by a friend and I loved it. This is the first Anya Seton book I have read, and I enjoyed it so much that I hope to read all of her books.'Green Darkness' portrays the life of a young girl in the mid 1500s. Ms. Seton captures the time so well that, while reading it, the reader will feel that he or she is actually there at Cowdray Castle, agonizing over whether to become Protestant, or to remain Catholic.'Green Darkness' starts out in 1968, in London, England, with an American girl, Celia, and her fianc&eacute;, Richard, driving through the countryside, stopping occasionally to look at old castle ruins. While in a particular castle, Celia gets a strange feeling that she had been there before, though she had never even been to England, much less to a castle ruin. Richard tells her to disregard the feeling (typical!) and go on with life. Celia tries, until Seton magically transports her back to the sixteenth century living the life of a beautiful, young, medieval, orphan girl living with her Duchess aunt.If you love historical fiction you will most definitely enjoy reading this book. By Anya Seton's mystical story telling, you will be transported along with Celia, and find yourself as out of your time as is she.I enthusiastically recommend 'Green Darkness' to you, as a friend, especially if you need to get away from it all!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Just like some people go to the same vacation spot each year, reading \\"Green Darkness\\" has become my own personal little tradition from the time it first came out in print, sometime in the late 70s.In fact, I've read my way through three incarnations of this book - wearing each one out to the point where I had to discard a badly tattered copy and then purchase another.When I need a mental break, I immerse myself in the world of Celia de Bohun and Brother Stephen...\\"reliving\\" the misery and splendor of the 16th Century again and again, hoping each time that their story will not end in heartbreak, yet knowing that, in another life, they'll meet again.A wonderful story, and even more thrilling to me when I discovered that many of the characters, like Anthony Browne, Geraldine, Maggie, and a few others really did exist.One of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Having read Katherine, I wanted to get my hands on another Anya Seton novel. Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance, historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer, that the magic hadn't ended. Despite its rather large size and intricate story, the novel ended too soon for me. (I like big books, but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) I finished this gem in three sittings. The novel's setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife, the American heiress Celia Taylor, to his estate in Sussex, England. There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers, all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. But something strange begins to happen between them. Celia is experiencing deja vu, as though she'd been there before. This happens the second she enters the castle. At the same time, Richard becomes restless and moody. Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles, and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. There are many twists throughout the novel.I have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done. Celia and Stephen's love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time. This novel brought me to tears by the time I finished. The building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable. Celia is a very complex heroine. She is proud and innocent, but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it, especially when Stephen is involved. Stephen is a tall, dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion, but his attraction to Celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him. This part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result. The part in which Celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel. It has a mixture of eroticism and innocence, for it is the first time Celia sees Stephen's nude body. The romance is indeed wonderful, but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable. We experience all of the things that occurred during Tudor England, from Henry VIII's reign passing on to Queen Mary and onto Queen Elizabeth I. I have been reading quite a lot of historical/biographical novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure. You feel the time period and the events that took place in those times. The most insightful things for me were those centered on Queen Mary's persecution of Protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on Celia's love for Stephen. The ending is one of the best endings I have read. Green Darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own. The story is quite intricate, not an easy read by a long shot (I find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex), but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed. There are numerous characters in this novel, but I never felt like I had to keep up with them in order to remember them. Each character serves his or her purpose and I loved them (or hated them if they were villains). The one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on Mabel's weight. I thought plump women were considered prettier in those times. And Celia (the twentieth century one) sounds a little too British for an American who'd set foot in England for the first time. Other than those negligible details, Green Darkness is perfect. Anya Seton was a great author, one of the best in her time. I think I like this novel more than Katherine. I wonder if Anya Seton and this novel inspired Jude Deveraux to write Remembrance (which I read at the same time as this one), which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century. Anyway, Green Darkness is one of the best historical/paranormal novels out there and I cannot recommend this memorable gem enough!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I've read most of Anya Seton's books, but this is the one I turn to again and again over the years.It is beautifully written, and the story and characters are memorable. You don't have to be a sentimental softie to be moved by Celia and Stephen's story. It grabs you almost from the start and doesn't let you go. It's easy to understand why Ms. Seton chose to tell it.I was in my early teens when I first read it (close to 30 years ago), and I love it as much today as I did back then. You might not know it by reading a lot of today's fiction, but plot, dialogue and characters still matter to a lot of readers. This book has them all."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I had read Green Darkness a long time ago (almost everybody here read the book a while back!). Anyways, since then I have read hundreds of other novels, but for some reason I have never been able to forget this novel.I still distinctly remember the main protagonists, and Ms Seton's style of writing had such a marvellous quality of taking you back to the Tudor Era, making you feel that you were a part of that period. I have read many historical romances since then, but rarely do I feel transported back to the time about which I am reading.Anyways, this is a wonderful book, and if you ever get your hands on it, read it and KEEP it. I am sorry I didn't!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I picked up Green Darkness at the library many years ago and loved it. Frankly, I'd forgotten how delightful the story was until one of my friends recommended it. She said it was one of her favorite books ever. Knowing that it was an old favorite from my teenage years, I bought a hardcover copy from Amazon and reread it. Many books simply don't stand the test of time - but this one sure does! One of the best &quot;time travel&quot; books ever. It begins in the late 1960's with contemporary characters, but magically transports the characters into a former incarnation in the mid 1400's. The historical research is impeccable. I really felt like I was back in the time of King Edward/Queen Mary. The plot moves at a page-turning pace - and I was so absorbed in the characters that I even dreamed about them. I truly hated for the book to end.If you like historical fiction, sprinkled with adventure, mystery, and mysticism (especially reincarnation) then you won't want to miss this book. You'll need a hardcover so it doesn't get battered when you share it with your friends. Just be sure you get it back, because even more pleasure comes from re-reading. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a book I came back to read after a number of years had passed, and will, I'm certain, reread again sometime in the future. Seton's treatment of the workings of reincarnation are excellent, yet smoothly folded within the story of the principal couple whose forbidden love and its consequences throw them together in a contemporary lifetime. And not just them. Many others around them have returned this lifetime and play a part in resolving the injury previously suffered. One, who is our guide, a soul whose connections to two characters and need to resolve a failure to aid them from an even earlier time. Anyone who wondered about some of the tenets of theosophy will find this book a great primer. (Seton explains in a foreword that she learned many of the ideas the plot moves on through her mother her was a theosophist.) When I first read this book, I was young and completely immersed in the love story. Today, older, I still enjoyed that story but I truly appreciated the wonderful details that gave a feel for what it was like to live through this tumultous period of English History. There are many books on the experience of living during the reigns of Henry and Elizabeth--here is a chance to get a view of what it was to be a lord, lady, or commoner when Edward and Mary each went to extremes to enforce their view of what religion should be in England!! Think of this book as an investment--if you love historical novels with a bit of the fantastic, you will be reading this book many times and urging family and friends to do the same! (It is among a few of my books I WON'T lend out.)"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Actually I would give Green Darkness 3.5 stars rather than 3. Anya Seyton has created a very atmospheric and tragic period novel, but I feel that she could have focused the story more on the emotions and anguish of two lovers. The novel has alot of potential and started out pretty good. However Celia and Stephen come across at times as as rather 2-dimensional characters. It is a good read if you like lengthy descriptions."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I loved Katherine, would rank that among the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. So when I finally read Green Darkness, I was anticipating something great. Wow, I was wrong. The book is just...weird. The reincarnation stuff is very bizarre and just doesn't fit to me. I am a history nut, and find the historical aspect of this book very unbelievable. I would give it one star, but for some reason I felt compelled to read the whole thing. Something must have kept me going!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Although I seldom read the same book twice, like many other reviewers, I have read & re-read Green Darkness many times since first discovering it in the 1970's. The characters, especially the ones living in Tudor times, are so realistic that I actually miss them each time I finish the book. I also love how the past & present characters mesh in the end. If you love Green Darkness, too, I encourage you to click the link above which asks the publisher to make a Kindle edition of this book. I would LOVE to have a copy to keep since I have given every other copy away to friends after reading them and I encouraged those friends to share this great book. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"The storyline and narrative structure of Green Darkness is very different from other books I have read. Green Darkness starts out in 1968 with a house party. The hosts, Sir Richard and Lady Celia Marsdon are newlyweds but their relationship is anything but blissful, as Richard has turned cold towards his new wife in recent months. Several strange events lead Celia to enter into a catatonic state. One of the guests, an Indian doctor, realizes that Celia and Richard had known each other in a past life and the only way to rescue Celia is to revisit that past life so that she can resolve old conflicts.The novel then turns to Tudor times, beginning with the reign of Edward VI and ending with the early part of Elizabeth I's reign. It explores the forbidden relationship of the orphaned Celia de Bohun and the Monk, Brother Stephen Marsdon against a backdrop of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation as well as strict Tudor social mores. Romance readers might complain that the romantic moments between Celia and Stephen are few and far between. However, in the context of a forbidden relationship in the 16th century, I don't think the scarcity of romantic encounters is all that surprising. I think a lesser writer would have given them a torrid affair lasting years, but Seton created a relationship that bordered on obsession, with Celia's unwillingness to control her longing for Steven, the one man she really couldn't (or shouldn't) have. For much of the novel, the relationship is a backdrop and drives key events in Celia's life. Towards the end of the Tudor section, Celia's recklessness in pursuing her relationship with Stephen leads to tragedy and torment for both herself and Stephen, which causes the unhappiness of the modern Celia and Richard. After the tragic ending of the Tudor story (which is well-foreshadowed in the first part of the book), the novel returns to 1968 and the conflict between the modern Richard and Celia is neatly resolved.It took me a while to sink into the novel. I would give the first portion of the book only 2 or 2.5 stars. The Tudor section, however, is fantastic. I felt that in the Tudor part of the book, Seton found her comfort zone as a writer of historical fiction. The action moved swiftly, the historical settings were well created, the characters believable and human, each with real flaws. I would give that section (the bulk of the novel) 5 stars. The return to the present - the last 40 or so pages of the novel - felt like an after thought and in my mind, the story I cared about already ended with the section on the Tudor period.I think I would have liked the novel better without the element of reincarnation. At least for me, I couldn't really develop an attachment to the modern characters and I really didn't care what happened to them. On the other hand, Green Darkness would have been less unique and perhaps less memorable - perhaps like a Tudor version of The Thorn Birds. Perhaps the novel would have been more effective had the first 1968 section been shorter and the medical crisis situation cut out - maybe having Celia revisit her past through hypnotherapy? - with brief interludes cutting into the Tudor period to remind the readers about the modern cast of characters and reinforce the reincarnation element. Although Seton does cut into the Tudor element by giving Celia de Bohun visions into her future self 400 years later, those brief reminders don't really enhance the broader plot.All in all, Green Darkness as a whole might be my least favorite Anya Seton novel (I've also read Avalon, Katherine, and The Winthrop Woman). However, the Tudor portion of the novel was very good, and that section alone was nearly as enjoyable to me as Katherine."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I recommend this book for rainy days and Mondays! Honestly, and like a few other reviewers, I had a hard time getting into it at first so I put the book away until I felt in the mood for it again. But when I started it a second time I barely put it down. I loved the historical information about King Edward and his circle of men, the political intrigue with the Dudley's(more men), Bloody Queen Mary and her personal life/expectations with men... and I never stopped questioning what was in the minds of the men in the book who thought that a casual tussle with a girl/woman was a common choice for passing the time rather than a consensual thing. I especially learned a lot about the struggles between the English Catholics and Protestants. This alone was worth the read.As for the romance... what romance? Oh, the one between the obsessed, foolish, stalker teen girl and the repressed and inexperienced priest with the hot body that turned everyone on, even that Italian doctor.... Oh yes, this book addresses it all. But, hey, this is a story and it doesn't have to be realistic, it just needs to be interesting, and this one is. I didn't expect most of what happened in the story, so it was a continual surprise for me from beginning to end. Nor did the synopsis on the back cover tell me much of the real story.Read this book if you like historical novels, or if you ever fell in love with someone you could never have, or you discovered you had a sensual power over the opposite sex without ever really trying, or you want to know what life might have been like for a fairly normal person in 16th century England during a time of royal upheaval, fear, and distrust. Fix yourself a cup of hot tea, curl up for a well written story, let go, and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I first read Anya Seton's Green Darkness several years ago -- I don't remember exactly when, sometime in the early 90s -- and although I have a vague memory of it as a \\"good book\\", it didn't make a strong impression on me. (Oddly enough, the thing I remember most is that \\"gillyflower\\" was an old-fashioned name for carnations). I just re-read it, as part of my current endeavor to read (and re-read) all of Anya Seton's books.Many of the things that other reviewers have criticized about this book, simply weren't a problem for me. For instance, the complaint that the romance between Stephen and Celia isn't strongly developed. It is true that for a book touted as a romance there isn't a lot of interaction between the two of them; I think that Green Darkness can be considered a \\"romance\\" only in the loosest sense. However, I don't consider this a shortcoming in the book. Rather than make Green Darkness simply a love story that focuses on two people, Seton has woven a much larger historical story, a tapestry that incorporates many characters with their own stories within the larger story of the book. Simple love novels are a dime a dozen. However, a truly historical romance that immerses the reader in another time and place are rarer, Seton has done an excellent job of that in this book. The reader is truly drawn in to the historical context of the novel (difficult accents and all).Also, I think the lack of interaction between Celia and Stephen works because it is a more realistic depiction of how such a relationship might have actually developed in Tudor England. A modern writer may have incorporated many more trysts between the two lovers, having them flout convention to be together. However, Seton's Celia and Stephen embody the culture and conventions of the times in which they lived. Throughout much of the book, it is almost as though the relationship is one-sided, existing only in Celia's imagination; which would be typical of a young, impressionable teenage girl. Later in the book the reader realizes without a doubt that Stephen truly is drawn to her, also, but that it is his religious vocation which holds him back. This, too, is reflective of society in Tudor England.Another common criticism of this book is that the characters of Stephen and Celia were flat, under-developed and unsympathetic. However, I found them to be as developed and dimensional as any of the other main characters in the book. Indeed, it could almost be argued that Stephen and Celia are just barely the \\"main\\" characters at all; the others in the book play as big a role in the story as they do. I did not find Celia to be unlikable -- she was a young, emotional girl who was trying to control her own destiny through the very limited means available to a woman in 16th century Europe. That Stephen's character seemed for the most part to be cool and restrained was a realistic depiction -- a monk living in that time and place, struggling with the things he struggled with, certainly would have kept those struggles on the inside and maintained a cool, composed and \\"holy\\" demeanor on the outside. It is perhaps because we are given fewer glimpses into Stephen's mind and thoughts than we are the other characters in the book, that he comes across as cold and unfeeling.All that being said, this is not my favorite work of Seton's. I suppose I should have foreseen that by the fact that it didn't make a lasting impression with me the first time I read it, although The Winthrop Woman -- which I first read 30 years ago -- made an impression that has lasted to this day. Although Green Darkness is one of Seton's two most popular books (the other being Katherine), I find it less pleasing than her earlier works. This was almost Seton's last book, written in the 1970s, and her style has taken on a coarseness that is off-putting. Two examples of this are the passages dealing with Crazy Bess' drinking blood, and Simkin's homosexuality. Both of these were disturbing to me, even more so since they were completely unnecessary to the plot of the story. In her earlier writing days, Seton would have been more constrained and, if these elements of the story were even mentioned at all, they would have been only implied or hinted at (think of how she dealt with certain aspects of Nicholas Van Ryn and his family in Dragonwyck). I think that such restraint made her earlier works much finer. If she had written Green Darkness 20 years earlier in her career, it would have been a much better book."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness was one of my all time favorite books having read it about 30 years ago. This year I chose to do a re-read, something I rarely ever do; now I know why it's not a good idea to mess with memories.According to my copy, an original 1972 copy, this is a story of a great love that spans from 16th century to the present day and a brilliant reconstruction of the Tudor period; only part of that is true.Green Darkness mixes a story of reincarnation and its roots in a love story from 500 years earlier. The problem for me this time around is I didn't find the love story all that interesting.Celia and Richard Marsdon are recent newlyweds and have come to Richard's family ancestral home; soon the two are acting very differently to each other and during a weekend house party Celia collapses and is hospitalized. While Celia slips deeper and deeper into a catatonic state, one of her guests, Dr. Ankanada, very familiar with past life regression believes this is the only way to help Celia and so we journey back in time to the story of Celia Bohun and Father Steven Marsdon.The bulk of this story takes place 1552 and 1559, a time of huge upheaval in English history, with the succession of three monarchs, Edward I, Mary and Elizabeth I. The country goes from Protestant to Catholic and back to Protestant in that short time frame. The affect on the \`regular' people as well as the nobles and churches is depicted very well and I love the attention to historical detail, much better than some of the more recent historical fiction of this time period I have read. This was without doubt the best part of the book. The problem is the love story between the monk Steven and Celia, a poorer relation to Sir Anthony Browne of Cowdray castle. Celia lives here with her aunt and Steven is the house priest, living in hiding at the start of their story. For being what is the entire lynchpin of this story there was actually very little to the romance and I actually didn't much care for the two star crossed lovers. Steven was often too sanctimonious and Celia was a selfish and foolish young girl, I felt no connection to either of them. After the ending of their story we are back to the present (1968 in the book) and the resolution of Celia and Richard's story, which was rather abrupt and a little too perfect.While I enjoyed the writing, I found the book a little too long, and some of the most important elements of the story seem to happen so fast and are over with in just a few paragraphs. This is not the great love story I remembered, it was just average and ultimately brings the overall rating down. So here is my advice: be careful when going back to an old well loved book, time may change your perspective and tarnish a memory."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I am currently re-reading Green Darkness (lost track of how many times). I searched for years to find the original issue, and finally did several years ago. This is absolutely one of my all time favorite romance books. I am glad to see it being re-published for new readers to discover."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I read Katherine and immediately ordered Green Darkness (after research) to be my next novel from her list. I am a huge fan of the Tudors and enjoyed the time travel. While I do not believe in reincarnation, I did not mind this aspect too much. I loved the romance between Celia and Stephen! I loved her portrayal of King Edward, Queen Mary and Elizabeth, and the Montagu family. I loved this book! While I liked Katherine better, I would recommend this novel and had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness was a best-seller back in the early 1970s when it was first published, and it's just as good a read today. It is the story of Celia, a young American woman in England who suddenly suffers a mental and emotional breakdown triggered by a visit to an old manor, where she had been murdered in a previous lifetime. In order to bring her back to the present, the physician attending her takes her back 400 years to relive this tragic life."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Anya Seton's characters and settings are haunting in the very best sense of that word. You care about her leading women and the lives of those they effect. Green Darkness has a very unusual point of view which will attract today's spiritual seekers.I only wish there were more books by Anya Seton available. She was a remarkable talent."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I love it all and have since I first read it back in the 1960's.. I have loved Green Darkness and all of her books."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"There are a fair number of digital text errors. That is to say, the words didn't convert properly. Not a huge deal but it is a little irritating. In retrospect, I wouldn't pay for that shoddy work if I knew. The book is fine and actually deserves more time spent in the process of converting to digital format."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I read this over 30 years ago and remember vividly how much I enjoyed it.

This is my all-time favorite book, and I'm thrilled it's been re-released so others can enjoy it. I've read it several times.

The history, the twists and turns, written smoothly and easy to follow, I just couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to pick up back up again!I really think everyone should give it a read :)"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"My absolute favorite book on the plantet, I now am the owner of two because I was sent two instead of Dragonwyck which is my second favorite book in the whole world."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"When young American Celia Taylor marries Sir Richard Marsdon and moves into his English manor in 1968, she begins to experience some strange occurrences, including feelings of deja vu and whole periods of time that she has no memory of and appears to be someone else to witnesses of this. Others, including Richard are also acting strangely. Only Hindu doctor, Dr. Akananda recognizes what is going on when Celia collapses and enters a comatose state. He sees that forces from their past lives are working on them in the present and the only hope for a cure is to let the mind go back to the Tudor period and try to right some of the wrongs that occurred there in order to move forward into the future.Keeping in mind this book was written when 1968 was the present day, it's fair to overlook some of the out of date comments associated with Dr. Akananda's mystical yoga practice and the exoticness of him being from India. That aside, I'm not sure why I waited so long to read this book! I loved the Tudor parts; fantastic! Anya Seton has a great way of illuminating the scenes through the eyes of the characters instead of just using well known historical facts.While the pace was somewhat slow and I had a bit of trouble connecting with the \\"modern day\\" sections, this was still a great read. I have two other Anya Seton books, Katherine and Dragonwyck sitting on my shelf that are moving up on the reading list!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Green Darkness has been one of my favorite books for many years. I use to have a hardback copy but made the mistake of loaning it to someone and never got it back. I was so pleased to find it on amazon. got it at a great price and prompt service too. thanks amazon!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"It was in ok condition.The front cover was torn.But it is readable and thats what matters the most.The part that was torn was easily taped and I must say this is a really good book.It's a great read that has all the making of a great book romance,mystery,suspense,and so much more.I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"In my opinion, this book wasn't quite as good as Katherine. It started off slow, and didn't pick up until the time travel back to the 16th century. But Anya Seton's command of the period of which she writes is commendable.Celia Marsdon is an American who marries a member of the English aristocracy. Richard Marsdon lives in an area of England which is quite charming to Celia and her family members- manor houses complete with medieval-period ghosts are just one of the attractions that England holds for them. When she visits one of the medieval manors one day, Celia gets the odd sensation that she's been there before. A mystic named Akananda, a friend of the family, says that he feels as though he has met Celia and her mother in a past life- bringing to mind the idea of reincarnation, which is, or course, the whole theme of the book. He believes that Celia must relieve her past in order to make sense of the life she currently leads. It soon becomes quite clear that Celia's marriage is in trouble- Richard becomes more and more withdrawn, and Celia finds herself unable to handle changes. A visit back to the mid-16th century, when Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth were monarchs, is the highlight of this book. At this period in time, the Marsdon family is still Catholic (which it would be until the 18th century), despite the fact that two of the above monarchs were Protestant. As you can imagine, this will create great tension as Anya Seton captures the struggles the Marsdon family will go through.This is a well-written book, although it does have its flaws, such as speech patterns. Even back in 1968, I imagine that Americans wouldn't have said things like, \\"I feel sort of queer,\\" \\"How frightfully intellectual you're getting,\\" and \\"I shouldn't want to live here, give me a convenient flat [as opposed to \`apartment'] in Eaton Square every time,\\" just to name a few. It seems that, although Anya Seton lived in Connecticut for a while, she completely ignored American slang. Anyways, that's a minor point; its neither here nor there. In sum, I liked this book for its clear, straightforward prose, and likeable characters. I also recommend reading Katherine, if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who knows I enjoy historical fiction. Well, yes... I will give the author credit in period research. However, her thesis is based more in mysticism which, regardless of your religious views, does not complement the facts. (I realize astrology has played a very important role historically and this is not my point of contention.) What remains is a love story, in which the underdeveloped characters do not induce much sympathy in the reader. Added to this we have the 'guru' doctor who mends the broken hearts from the previous life, but we are never told how. All in all a tedious read."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"This book is rich & delightful - I have read it several times, and each time I learn of a deeper thread, a nuance that whispers, & a renewed respect for the author. With her unusual and wonderfully eclectic background, the book resonated several issues surrounding the human condition all at once, like an orchestra where all the instruments are playing their separate, yet interweaving and crucial parts, leaving the listener/reader with a sense of archetypal satisfaction that can only be found with such a master at her craft. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I received this item well packaged and in good time.This book is a very good read. In fact, I ordered several by Anya Seton based on this book, and they were all good."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"A difficult read, but if one persists, they will discover this to be a wonderfully strange and historical romatic novel."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Not an easy read. I found the first 100 pages of this book almost unbearable! Had I not enjoyed Anya Seton's book \\"Katherine\\" (which is one of the best books I had ever read) so much, I would have put this one down & never finished it. But since it was an Anya Seton novel, I decided to keep reading to see if it got any better. Well, it didn't. I was very disappointed in it. If you do want to read a good book by Seton, than I suggest \\"Katherine\\", a novel about Katherine Swynford, the second wife of John of Gaunt. This book is impossible to put down and one of my absolute favorites!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I find all the gushing reviews surprising, to say the least. Ms. Seton does a good job describing Tudor England. It's clear that she did a tremendous amount of research, to good effect.But to call this book a \\"romance\\" is surely false advertising. The Richard/Celia pair of the 1960s are hardly a lovey-dovey couple, even before all the unpleasantness begins. Seton's own choice of words points this out: she describes their first meeting with \\"dismay.\\" At no point in the book does Richard show anything more positive than a mild interest in his wife. Otherwise he is cold, surly, and uncommunicative toward infatuated, dim-witted Celia.And then the night of the party! He gets angry at Celia, drags her to another room, and RAPES her. Again, Seton's own word. Blaming it on angst from a past life is inexcuseable, in that time or this.The pair's former selves, Stephen/Celia are likewise baffling as star-crossed lovers. Stephen's internal monologue, up until the very end of the story, demonstrates contempt and disgust toward Celia--only in part because of his vows. He just doesn't like her. But we're supposed to believe that he'd throw away his entire life for her?But they're equally unappealing characters, so maybe they are made for each other. Tudor Celia, though, should more properly have been called Mary Sue. She's just the specialist special who ever specialed.It just doesn't add up. Take the Richard/Stephen and Celia/Celia out of it, and it would have been a really good book."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"So, I read Kathrine and totally loved it, great romantic story. Now, I have never written a book review on Amazon before but I just finished this book and I am COMPELLED to voice my anger! haI was eagerly awaiting reading this book, the story appealed to me i love romantic stories and i love the idea of reincarnation. However, this look was COMPLETELY lacking--Flat! I gave two stars because i liked the idea, and some parts i enjoyed. But overall, horrible. There was no development of the \\"MAIN\\" characters! The fact that their interactions in the 16th century can at most amount to a full two pages; which that in it self made me pissed off and want to hurl the book across the room because i was so disappointment in its \\"LOVE\\" story. it's a good historical fiction, well detailed, almost too much. I found myself skimming about 80 percent of the 16th century to get to the sentence or two about Celia and Stephan.Oh, even writing this review makes me angry at how disappointed i am in this book! such high hopes, only to be let down! Well, I guess i always got the Outlander series, Thank god for those books! Great historical fiction and much better romantic story!"},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"Having read Katherine, and loved it, I was anxious to begin reading this one, especially after all the good reviews it's gotten. Unlike Katherine, the heroine is not the least likeable. I kept on reading thinking it had to start living up to its hype. It never did. The history was probably the best part of the book but I wasn't looking for a history lesson. Very hard to understand how so many people liked it enough to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Green Darkness","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this novel. I found it to be extremely droll, stilted, contrived, totally unsuspenseful, and completely dry. The love story was BORING, the lovers interacting twice in the whole escapade, which utterly contradicts the claim of the author of this being a \\"gripping love story.\\" I was wondering why this did not appear on the New York Times bestseller list if it was so \\"magnificent\\", and now I know. I am really surprised to read any reviews here over two or three stars."},{"Title":"Artificial Intelligence and Scientific Method","review":"This book is interesting in that it attempts to cast questions of the scientific method into the language and concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), instead of in terms of philosophy, as is usually done. The two main camps of philosophy of science, namely inductivism, represented by Sir Francis Bacon, and that of falsificationism, represented by Sir Karl Popper are both discussed in the context of AI. Two examples, one dealing with the discovery of the laws of planetary motion due to Johannes Kepler, and the discovery of sulphonamide drugs, are chosen to illustrate the author's ideas. The author asserts that these examples do not entirely agree with either Bacon or Popper. Kepler used an \\"intuitive induction\\" which involved human insight and creativity, which is quite different from the \\"mechanical induction\\" of Bacon. The discovery of sulphonamide drugs was a more \\"mechanized\\" process, but the author believes it was more of a \\"mechanical falsification\\" rather than Baconian induction. In addition, this discovery, he asserts, has introduced the concept of heuristics, which of course is ubiquitous in artificial intelligence.The author is certainly correct in his belief that Baconian induction, as outlined in the Novum Organum of 1620, has been applied only sparingly in the development of science. He believes that this is changing though thanks to the advent of machine intelligence. Indeed, the existence of machines able to recommend and design experiments, analyze the data from these experiments, and then formulate hypotheses to explain the data was reported just weeks ago in a major scientific journal. These machines were based on inductive logic programming in the guise of a language called PROGOL, which performs relational learning and was just getting started as this book went to press. The author does discuss relational learning in this book, and details algorithms for machine learning that are based on inductive rules of inference and background knowledge and data in these rules. He also discusses the role of testing and falsification in the actual process of using inductive rules of inference in order to produce the final result.The specific machine learning algorithms that the author does discuss are ID3 and GOLEM, with ID3 being a \\"top-down\\" and attribute-based learning algorithm, and GOLEM a \\"bottom-up\\" and relational learning algorithm. ID3 makes use of rules that take the from of decision trees, begins with simple and general rules, and these are then modified or refuted to produce more specific generalizations. The author discusses the role that these programs have in negating the Popperian assertion that induction \\"is a myth\\". Even more interesting is the author's belief that these programs in fact illustrate the \\"mechanical\\" principles of induction that Bacon laid down in 1620. In fact, he states that he has been unable to find an example of the use of Baconian \\"mechanical\\" induction in the history of science before the advent of these languages.Naturally logic programming and its main example PROLOG will arise in any discussion of machine intelligence, and it does so here. PROLOG as a language based on nonmonotonic logic is discussed in detail along with the \\"closed world assumption\\", this being done in order to construct a \\"new framework for logic\\". This framework involves viewing logic as made up not only of inferences but also a \\"control component\\", the latter of which follows either its own autonomous control decisions, or those provided by the programmer. PROLOG is viewed as a language that introduces control into deductive logic, and its development an example of a process that replaced \\"craft skill by mechanization\\". Generation (and checking) of proofs in mathematics is given as an example of this craft skill, having been done to date by trained mathematicians who have the \`craft skills' to carry this out. PROLOG is able to construct proofs via its control mechanism and has both a declarative and procedural interpretation. The author shows in what sense PROLOG can lead to what he calls a \`new framework for logic', and consequently as evidence that logic is really empirical, and not \`a priori' as is typically assumed. The empiricism of logic was argued in another context, namely that of quantum mechanics, but the author believes that \`quantum logic' has failed to support the empiricism of logic. PROLOG, he asserts, is a better example of the empirical nature of logic.The author also addresses the possibility of constructing a detailed example of inductive logic, which he believes was not done in traditional circles of logic, these being concerned mostly with deductive inference. After discussing the history of the divergence between the schools of deductive and inductive logic, he expands further on his paradigm of logic as being \`inference + control' in showing how ideas from conformation theory can be used as a control mechanism in deductive logic. To illustrate just how this could be done, the author draws on the work of J. Cussens, A. Hunter, and A. Srinivasan in a class of nonmonotonic logics called \`prioritized' logics. These authors show that a prioritized logic will allow the inference of formulas that are \`most preferred\\", with preferences being accomplished relative to some preference criterion. The author shows how to use relative-frequencies to estimate conformation values. What is most interesting about the work of these three authors, and the author points this out emphatically, is that it may permit the differentiating of one system of logic from another using experimental criteria in the context of a particular application. The author discusses how these authors were able to carry out the empirical testing of different systems of logic using the GOLEM programming language. An explicit example in bioinformatics is discussed, and the author concludes from this example that the choice of logic will depend on the interests of a particular user. Empirical evidence can thus decide on the logic used in a domain, and this choice may also depend on the requirements of the user.I did not read the last chapter of the book, so its review will be omitted."},{"Title":"52 Ways to Protect Your Teen","review":"I was given a copy of this book several months ago, and just finally got to reading it.

I love this book"},{"Title":"The Hymns Of Orpheus","review":"The first clue that this translation isn't what it should be is the fact that the poems all rhyme. You can't translate Greek to English accurately and expect it to rhyme. He also chose to translate the names of the Gods either into their English words (like Heaven) or their Roman names (like Saturn) rather than leave their Greek names so you can figure out exactly who he means (Like Ouranos). He confused Hecate, Selene and Artemis, calling them all Diana at one point or another and I think there's a point where he translated Dione as Diana as well. The final result- you spend more time trying to guess who the poem is about.Further, despite the title's promise of a \\"preliminary\\" dissertation, there is more commentary throughout the book than poems, though the commentary doesn't help much in figuring out who the heck he's talking about unless it contains snippets of Greek which is sometimes helpful.In short, there is little to no value to this book."},{"Title":"The Hymns Of Orpheus","review":"This very old translation of the Orphic Hymns is venerated by those who genuinely know the teachings of Orpheus and Plato. Thomas Taylor translated a vast number (many many volumes) of Hellenic texts, some very difficult such as Proklos. Amongst these texts, the Orphic hymns are some of the very few that he translated into verse. The original hymns are poems. Taylor did two things which were typical of scholars of his time who were translating poetry: 1) he rhymed the lines, and 2) he used the Roman names for the deities. He has been criticized in our time for both of these, which were simply conventions of HIS time. (The language of scholars from that period was Latin) The amazing feat of Taylor is that somehow, despite the demands of rhyme, he very accurately kept the spirit of the text and the meaning as well. This author has acquaintance with scholars in Greece who, in English, prefer Taylor's translation for this very reason. Taylor was immensely learned and this can be seen in his notes to the text. However, if you want real evidence of his abilities, read some of his prosaic translations. If you read these with an open mind, you will be humbled. Taylor was a giant."},{"Title":"The Hymns Of Orpheus","review":"Taylor's understanding of Platonism and classical Hellenic paganism is underrated. His translations were influential on William Blake, Shelley and William Wordsworth. In American editions they were read by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott, Mead, and Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy."},{"Title":"The Hymns Of Orpheus","review":"I do not believe the current Kindle edition of this book was ever actually reviewed by a human who understands e-books.

I cannot tell for certain because they all show up as \\"???????\\" In the e-book. In some pages half the content appears as these question-mark words - useless!Secondly the process that produced this e-book for some unfathomable reason retained page numbers in the text content.

The author seems more intent on repeating his weight, height, eating habits, and the fact that he is a Texan than on relating anything very meaningful or engaging. Self indulgence doesn't equal insightful reflection, nor do the frequent cryptic phrases add anything but confusion. And the attempts at philosophy are sophomoric.Having said that, I was able to finish the book because I too have logged several thousand miles astride a variety of bikes, most recently on a Honda Valkyrie, &quot;The Dragon&quot;. Meyer would also have us believe &quot;The Dragon&quot; is his nickname for the bike, but a visit to the Valkyrieriders website can clarify some history. Sorry, big guy, the book didn't work for me.Do yourself a favor: pass this one up and read DETOURS by Richard La Plante."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"The only book I ever threw away....this guy is so full of himself...\\"big great texan\\"....barf! story was not so bad if you can get beyond the I am a big tuff guy!"},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"Life is a road, was, at least, a quick read. The author takes us along for a year or two of his riding experiences, most of which describe the same type of thing the same way as he did in the first set of stories. He is also fond of very short two word sentences that lost me more than once and I found myself re-reading to understand what the heck he was talking about. His constant refrence to his bike as &quot;The Dragon&quot; got wearisome as well as his droning on about being &quot;one with The Dragon&quot; eulogies that felt like they would never end. However, some of his stories are fun and he's a nice guy although many of his tales are not in the least believable, such as the naked girl wandering in the desert, then going for a long ride on the back of the bike story. Yeah Right! A few of the chapters are written with a lot of humor, which is where he excels and should do more of. And at the very least, if you are motorcycle obsessed, it is centered around motorcycles. Or if you are intimidated by hitting the open road, then at least you can live vicariously through these pages."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"I wish the book could have gone on longer.

Will eat ANYTHING, but makes multiple stops to find Diet Coke.[Update]Since I initially wrote this review, I have purchased two more books in the series and loved both of them. I gave away all three books to other riders and couldn't wait for them to be returned. So I purchased all 4 books this time to keep in my library. They are great quick escapes that capture the spirit of what it means to ride a motorcycle."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"This is one of those books that you either love or hate, either it touches you and makes you long for the open road and the adventures beyond the next \\"twistie\\" or you throw up your hands in disgust and consider it wasted time.This is not a novel, on the surface its a simple set of small narrations of what happened during a trip: I took road x, stopped and had x for dinner, slept in motel x, etc. For many people this is all they get from it and its not terribly exciting.For others, those who have the travelling \\"bug\\" this is a thrilling narrative of the romance of the open road. What it feels like to leave work on a friday, all strung out and hit the \\"twisties\\" and stop at small places where people call you \\"hon\\" and to begin to put your priorities back in order.Mr. Meyers feelings towards his ride and his enjoyment of the open road, the desire to just start riding, pick roads at random and see where you end up... more importantly his ability to enjoy things that others avoid, like riding in the middle of a storm or right through the middle of a dust-devil..appeal to me, its something that people either understand or look at you funny about. If you understand then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"O.k. I have just received my copy of &quot;Life is a Road&quot; and finished reading it. I figure now is a good time to review this book and what I got from it.Having known the author for many years and being mentioned in the book a couple of times I may not have a completely unbiased opinion concerning &quot;Life is a Road&quot;. Of course, like most people, I don't have many unbiased opinions on many subjects.The question of why I would read &quot;Life is a Road&quot; is simply answered in my case. I did not want a 300 pound biker, who occasionally smells like an ox, sitting in my living room sticking a book under my nose every 3 minutes saying &quot;Read this, read this!&quot; So it is a matter of simple self defense when looked at in that light. The question of what I got out of reading the book is not so simply answered.Even though I experienced most of the trips described in &quot;Life is a Road&quot; I still gained insight into the larger world around me by reading the book. Although I was there (in varying states of exuberance - boredom - awe - misery - delight etc...) seeing the events from the authors point of view made me re-evaluate some of the ideas and concepts I developed along the journey. Two people seeing the same thing can have completely opposite reactions. A case in point is the 75 mile dust storm we encountered in far west Texas during the Hell and Gone trip. My reaction to the event was &quot;Well hell, now I have to breath and taste sand for an hour or so.&quot; Danny's reaction as expressed in his book is one more of wonder. It did not strike me as a wonder of any kind during that ride, but looking back on it through the descriptions, and through the eyes, of the author made me realize what a wonderful experience it was. Amazing how two people can be so much alike and so totally different.Like the author I am an avid motorcycle rider. Long distance ridding is a true joy in itself. For me the journey is an opportunity to pit myself against the road and nature, as well as see new things along the way. For the author it is an opportunity to once again experience the vibrancy of life that a soul of true passion craves. We each take something home with us at the end of each journey, in my case photographs and stories. What the author brings home from his journeys is superbly revealed in &quot;Life is a Road&quot;. Unlike my photos, which can never truly depict the scope and depth of their subjects, the stories in &quot;Life is a Road&quot; does an amazing job of letting the reader feel and see their subjects.Even if I had never ridden a motorcycle, reading this book would have given me something new. So, what did I get from reading &quot;Life is a Road&quot;? A whole new outlook on motorcycle journeys - and guide posts on what to look for on the next journey.The main point the book brings across is one I have known for many years - the journey is the point, not the destination. It is easy to forget that at times and it is nice to be reminded in such an entertaining way.I would recommend this book to not only motorcycle riders but also anyone who has the urge to journey out into the larger world."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"I read this book almost non-stop. If you ride a motorcycle, it's a must read. If you don't, read it and find out why the rest of us ride! Humor, adventure, a little sureal, something for all.

I had the pleasure of meeting the author, and getting him to autograph my copy.This winter, I finally got around to reading the book while on a trip (family death). Daniel's writing style, insight, ability to find something good to write about in his riding adventures... all contributed to making a nice couple of evenings (during an unhappy time) for me. The book's stories brought smiles, laughs, and longings to return home (to ride) to my soul.I've had the pleasure of quietly observing Daniel's kind hearted contributions to the lives of fellow motorcyclists and their families (internet forums). A kind word, or a signed copy of his book sent to them (to help them along a difficult path).Daniel Meyer's writings will not only provide you with spirited entertainment, but will show you the better side of motorcycling, and the people who enjoy riding them. It may even tug at your heart strings and cause you to long for some \\"time behind bars\\" (handlebars, that is)."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"It wasn't bad, just not my sort of thing.The cover (at least of my edition) bears the legend \\"a novel by Daniel Meyer\\". It's certainly NOT that. It could be argued that it's a collection of short stories, but it's really not that either... mostly just vignettes of motorcycling with no real plot lines, with some of what might be poetry thrown in.I think by \\"novel\\" the author means that it's fiction, which at least some of it almost certainly is. We are, for instance, asked to suspend disbelief when a very attractive lady, found naked, barefoot and alone in the woods at night (which she doesn't bother to explain over hours of conversation, and is apparently never asked) later produces a personalized calling card. Not \\"calling card\\" as a euphemism or metaphor, a real, physical card. The fact that authors, unlike movie directors, don't have \\"continuity\\" departments doesn't mean that they couldn't sometimes benefit from them.I read it through, and enjoyed a few parts of it, but it doesn't gel as literature or fiction, nor does it really convey much about the experience of motorcycling.. at least as I experience it. Despite the somewhat pretentious title, there's very little in the way of pondering motorcycling's nature, beyond expressions of exuberance. Well, there is a great deal of exuberance involved, but there are also depths that go untouched here.In fairness to the author, capturing much about the experience seems nearly impossible for any writer.. but I keep hoping."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"Daniel Meyer is not merely a motorcycle owner, he embraces the highway from the back of a Honda cruiser, with gusto and passion.

Feel the wind in your hair!"},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","review":"Never mind that I haven't been on the back of a motorcycle in over thirty years, I greatly enjoyed Daniel Meyer's \\"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle.\\" He has a keen eye for detail and a great talent for keeping the reader engrossed in his delightfully rendered stories. Do you like travel and adventure? Do you enjoy passion? Do you like to laugh out loud? You'll find all that and more within these pages. Not only is Dan an excellent prose writer, you'll find some amazing poetry to ponder over, as well. What I like most about his writing is that it comes across strong and clear that Dan knows that life is for living, and he does it well. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Oracle DBA 7.3 to 8 Upgrade Exam Cram (Exam: 1Z0-010)","review":"Great book! The &quot;Exam Cram&quot; title is very appropriate.

While reading the book I found many (minor) typos in text, source code, questions, answers (most of them as consequence of misuse of COPY/PASTE or writing example of code on the fly) which I found annoying at least.

I thought the stories in the book were extremely tedious, especially the Spanish woman's and her daughter. The amount of detail is overwhelming and for what? What's the point of all that rambling about their relationship? It might have been useful to the reader if there was a tie in with the ultimate fate (i.e. the death) of this or any other character in the book. But there isn't! Wilder fails to connect anything in any kind of meaningful way, which leaves the reader with a terribly hollow feeling about the long slog he has made with the author. The concept is a good one: do we live and die by accident or by plan? That's the 64 dollar question that Wilder asks. But neither he nor Brother Juniper is in any kind of a position to deal with it. The book only ends with some tiresome platitudes about love and so forth. The year this novel was published must have been a very lean year indeed to warrant a Pulitzer Prize for this tedious, tiresome and very overrated piece of literature."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in 1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, &quot;Why did this happen to those five?&quot; Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers &amp; we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I had to read this book for a sophomore english class and all I can say is what a very, very uninteresting book.

If I was the author of this book I'd tell myself to get a grip on the real world."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"When I began this book I thought it was going to be fairly interesting.

However as I so painfully read on about these five people's lives I too wished I had fallen off of a bridge. Wilder's writing style is the kind where you have to read the sentences over and over because they are 1) so incredibly boring and 2)so incredible hard to understand. I hoped as I read on that there would be some kind of powerful ending that was all worth reading for since the original purpose of the book seemed deep and intriguing. However, I was left with another boring ten pages and paragraph about love to smooth over the rest of the book.

This must be a work for a narrow audience, probably fellow writers.

Anyone who wants to develop her/his spirituality will find it satisfying and heartwarming to think about this story.If you have never read this book, you are missing an opportunity to be able to discuss this story with others. Even people who have read relatively little great fiction have usually read The Bridge of San Luis Rey.The story has little wasted verbiage, and gives you plenty to think about.

After a bridge collapses in Peru, killing five people, a priest begins to explore their lives in hopes that he might find some indication of why God chose these five people to die. In doing so, he explores one of life's great questions. He arrives at no clear answer, and yet his intellectual journey leaves the reader with a sense that life is not without meaning. For while we may not be able to explain why these lives ended so abruptly, or whether God even played a role in their fate, we see that each led a unique, special existence. In the end, the moral of this story is abundantly clear - that life is short and must be cherished."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books. I remember after first reading the book that it did not strike me as a particularly good book. It just seemed okay. but after putting it down I found that it stayed with me much more than any other book I've read.And that's the subtle beauty of this work. Like most of Wilder's early material, this is not a plot-driven book at all, but rather is a philosophical exploration veiled in story. Now there is enough plot to keep people turning the pages if they are being forced to read the book, but the story is never the point.The novel begins with a bridge collapsing in Lima, Peru in 1714. Five people die in this collapse and a monk goes about collecting all the information he can about these people so that he can prove definitively that this apparent tragedy actually furthered God's plan for the world. The bulk of the novel is taken from his studies and allows the readers to glimpse several very memorable characters and their lives.Now the characters are not particularly likable, at least at first, but the majority of the time, we see a transformation in their characters.Wilder once commented that this novel was about the \\"sufficiency of love\\" and that certainly shows through. His writing exhibits something of a dispassionate beauty that is truly his own, and the novel's form itself is enough to attract interest. All that being said, this novel would not be a bestseller today and will most likely not appeal to the average reader. But for those who are looking for a particularly heady novel (balanced by its brevity) should definitely pick up this book. And those who have to read it? Just give it time: it gets better with age."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I sense that Thornton Wilder's THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY is no longer fashionable in literary circles. The literati of today are too hip, edgy, jaded, and ironic - too self-conscious -- to acknowledge the merits of a novella that lyrically poses profound questions of human existence and ends up with a homily about love. Have we as a culture or a species moved beyond THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY? I fear that we have, but hope that we haven't.The novella begins: \\"On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travellers into the gulf below.\\" A Franciscan, Brother Juniper, becomes obsessed with the question, \\"Why those five?\\" He reasons, \\"Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan.\\" His faith predisposes him to the latter, but imbued with the hubris of rationalism he also believes the question \\"Why those five?\\" surely must have a mathematical, scientific, sensible answer. So he resolves to study the private lives of the five who were plunged into the gorge in order to \\"surprise the reason of their taking off\\", to ascertain why them. After six years of research Brother Juniper published an enormous book, but it was pronounced heretical and the Inquisition ordered that both it and its author be burned in the Square. It is left to Madre Mar&iacute;a del Pilar, the Abbess of the Convent of Santa Mar&iacute;a de las Rosas, to divine, at the novella's end, \\"the only survival, the only meaning\\" of life.THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY is an extended parable. Regardless of whether or not it ends up communicating a lesson a reader can take to heart, the book is worth reading for the intricate way the tale is constructed and for Wilder's rich prose, which is both aloof and intimate in its intellectual sensuousity. It is quite an achievement by an author who was then only thirty.* * * * *I once met Thornton Wilder, briefly, when I was a laborer doing work at his house. He was a consummate gentleman. I am posting this review under the listing for the old Washington Square Press paperback, because that's what I have - 41st printing from December 1967, 45 cents. I regret taking so long to get around to reading it."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Wilder's book is one of the most thought provoking ever written. It brings to life many of the questions, doubts, fears, and outlooks that all humans share and does so in a way that is not condescending or cheap. This is a novel of ideas and faith, and one that will make every reader look at his or her place in the world."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Reyis a beautifully-written story. It begins with the collapse of the eponymous bridge (an Incan relic); five individuals fell to their death as a result and a local priest who witnessed the event subsequently investigates the lives of these five individuals in an attempt to make sense of the tragedy. The life stories of these five people are described in artful and artistic prose; many a line or description begs to be read aloud, some simply for their musicality and lyric qualities and some for the magnitude of the seemingly-simple truths they espouse.A few of my favorite examples:- \\"Like all the cultivated he believed that only the widely read could be said to know that they were unhappy.\\"- \\"Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan. Some say that we shall never know and that to the gods we are like the flies that the boys kill on a summer day, and some say, on the contrary, that the very sparrows do not lose a feather that has not been brushed away by the finger of God.\\"- \\"Now he discovered that secret from which one never quite recovers, that even in the most perfect love one person loves less profoundly than the other. There may be two equally good, equally gifted, equally beautiful, but there may never be two that love one another equally well.\\"Not surprisingly, I loved the story - I always enjoy good writing and usually enjoy stories about the quest for meaning in seemingly random events."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder won the 1928 Nobel Prize with this concise novel about the tragic collapse of a bridge in Spanish Colonial Peru in 1714. A Catholic Friar named Brother Juniper witnesses the tragedy as he was about to cross the 100-year old bridge when it collapsed, killing all that were aboard. Brother Juniper then sets out to learn all he can about the lives of the five victims. He also seeks to determine whether their tragic end derived from luck, fate, or devine ordination. Together with Brother Juniper we come to know and care about the five victims (Dona Maria & Pepita, Estaban, Uncle Pio & Jaime). Clearly there are parallels in these pages to the tragic hand of fate that sometimes strikes people we know, leading so many of us to ask why? Ironically, Brother Juniper's six-year quest about the tragic causation leads to his own demise as a heretic.We read this book as high school freshman and liked it's easy-reading style. I remember enjoying the book's presentation of life in Colonial South America, but as a teen not entirely understanding its examination of those dark questions about fate, luck and tragedy. Some readers praise this novel as masterful; others find it more worthy than outstanding. Whatever your view, the author never quite answers the central question with iron-clad certainly. But then, what human ever has?"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A classic novella, written with exemplary simplicity and grace. An Inca footbridge suspended over a canyon in Peru collapses in 1714, killing five people who were crossing at the time: an elderly Marquesa, her sweetly unassuming orphan maid, a young man of many skills mourning the recent death of his twin brother, an aging Svengali with his fingers in every pie, and the illegitimate son of the Viceroy. A contemporary monk investigates their lives in an attempt to discern the hand of God in the event, whether as a punishment for wrongdoing or an early welcome into heaven. Following in his footsteps, Wilder emphasizes rather the interconnectedness of their lives and their effect on those they leave behind: the Marquesa's daughter (recipient of her beautiful letters), the famous actress Perichole, the Viceroy, a swashbuckling sea captain, and the self-sacrificing Abbess of the convent in Lima. His conclusion: \\"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.\\"Wilder won the Pulitzer Prize for this brief novel in 1928; it is still worth reading today, for its gentle wisdom, which is timeless, and for its style, which combines classic balance with Midwestern common sense. Here he is at his more formal, describing the Marquesa's letters: \\"The Conde delighted in her letters, but he thought that when he had enjoyed the style he had extracted all their richness and intention, missing (as most readers do) the whole purport of literature, which is the notation of the heart. Style is but the faintly contemptible vessel in which the bitter liquid is recommended to the world.\\" And here he is speaking the thoughts of the youngest of the five people killed in the accident, the Viceroy's little boy: \\"Uncle Pio had just overtaken a friend of his, a sea-captain. And just as they got to the bridge he spoke to an old lady who was traveling with a little girl. Uncle Pio said that when they had crossed the bridge they would sit down and rest, but it turned out not to be necessary.\\"Although most of the novel is imaginary, the Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, given their real names. But in fact they lived a half-century later than when Wilder places them. And their son survived, to become one of the signers of the Peruvian Declaration of Independence in 1821."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Ever since man conceptualized the idea of a god, he has been wondering why this god has acted in a certain way, often times in a way that was detrimental to the lives of the god's most ardent believers. Trying to explain why man has to suffer needlessly because of the capriciousness of a deity has been the pursuit of eons of poets, philosophers and theologians - an effort that usually results in either platitudes or the literal and/or figurative throwing up of hands. Perhaps A.E. Housman might have had a clearer vision when he remarked that \\"Malt does more than Milton can to justify God's ways to man.\\" That Thornton Wilder's consideration of this age old question could have been published right in the middle of the debauched 1920s might seen a bit odd, but the overwhelmingly positive reception that The Bridge of San Luis Rey enjoyed (as well as winning the Pulitizer Prize for 1927) clearly shows that the question is truly a timeless one.Given the complexity of the question being considered, Wilder's book is audaciously simple: a short parable that interweaves case histories of the five individuals killed, when the bridge of San Luis Rey fails, with the flawed ruminations of Brother Juniper's scholastic attempt to prove theology an exact science. By setting his novel in 17th century Peru, Wilder gives his story both an exotic background and a historical context, a decision that allows him to create a unique setting, almost medieval in atmosphere, in which the powers of state and church (through the Inquisition) hold complete sway over his characters. Wilder is as careful with his prose as he is with his setting. The three case studies are written as simple parables in a style that is reserved and graceful; these are in contrast to the generally ironic tone of the commentary.Although Brother Juniper tackles his study with the zeal of a PhD sociology student he is not to be trusted: he thinks he sees \\"in the same accident, the wicked visited by destruction and the good called early to Heaven,\\" hardly an earth shattering conclusion. But what the good Brother lacks in scholarly traits, he does make up for it by his descriptions of the three case studies of the Marquesa de Montmayor; the twin, Esteban; and the self styled sophisticate, Uncle Pio. What each of these characters have in common is that all are endowed with the admirable gift of love, although it is the form of love that proves to be their downfall. The Marquesa has an oppressive love for her daughter; Esteban is tormented by the death of his beloved twin, Manuel; and Uncle Pio confuses love for beautiful women and language with a dictatorial control of his ward, the beautiful Camila Perichole. In each case the love that they exhibit is selfish and controlling, not the loving generosity that is required to love humanity truly. It is the Abbess Madre Maria del Pilar who sums up Wilder's thesis - \\"love is the only survial, the only meaning.\\"Despite the artistic strenghts of the novel and the seriousness of the subject, I just could not get into the book, no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps it was Wilder's use of parable to tell his story or perhaps it was the palpable sense of detachment that pervades the novel (the reader gets the feeling that he is looking at a painting rather than reading a novel) that bothered me. Regardless, I finished the novel without much of the positve feelings that many other readers experienced."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder's 1927 masterpiece is a contemplative and delicately mournful work, brilliant in the simple power of its prose. Battling with God, fate, or destiny- particularly the God of the Catholic faith - is a facet that has preoccupied many authors, including Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, and Wilder brings his own unique vision to that individual struggle, viewing it with a mixture of bitterness and faith. He approaches it through the lens of a very human but very haunting question: Why did those people - those people in particular - die? So often throughout the novel it seems that someone else should have died - the close friend or relative or mentor of one of those who fell to their deaths, rather than one of the actual victims. Each of them - a brilliantly intellectual but half-mad matriarch, an intelligent, lonely orphan with a future, a sailor with nothing left to live for, and a old, multi-talented man with the crippled son of a great actress in tow - has reached some sort of turning point in their lives, and is going to make a new beginning. Why then should they die? The book does not provide an answer - not in that way. Rather, Wilder's answer to death, and perhaps in a way to the sacrifices exacted by death or God or whatever he considers the dominant force - is love. \\"Love...the only meaning.\\"The characters are brilliantly drawn and sketched, particularly The Marquesa de Montemayor, a woman risen from peasant stock to become a noblewoman, but whose life is wasted in hungry, desperate longings for a daughter who despises her. From this hunger springs a series of brilliantly witty and profound letters which will be the wonder of every generation after her, while in between the writing of them the Marquesa plunges into drunkenness with the regularity of clockwork. Uncle Pio, similarly, a man born with a knack for life and success and the even rarer knack of loving beauty and talent without hungering for the woman who possesses them, is a character who burns with originality and pathos. These two, along with Esteban, the twin who is inwardly dead, are the three around whom the book is centered, with the other two, the young Pepita and Jaime, acting as supplements to them; the more obscure pair among the quartet of victims. The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a hauntingly beautiful exploration into the meaning of life and of death, full of tenderness and subtle ironies, and reminiscent of both Brideshead Revisited and The Bridges of Madison County in its gentle pathos. Not a book to be missed."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"i have read this book several times over the years. it is a classic. i gave this copy as a gift. book arrived promptly, in good condition."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"An early gift from Thornton Wilder in 1927. Five vignettes. Interconnected biographies. External appearances, internal echoes and guiding questions from the narrator. What makes a life meaningful? The flow through time? Communication? Success? Personal evolution? Character? Giving? Love?? The stories take place in Lima, Peru and reflect the Spanish culture and shadow of the Catholic church. The characters are unusual in their details, but they reflect everyman type experiences. The roles of chance, choice, God and fate are portrayed vividly. This is a quick read, but it leaves a trail of characters, memories, flavors and questions."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Five people are killed when a small bridge breaks in Peru.A priest investigates the lives of the five people to try to understand why these five were killed.Each person has a story and each story is beautifully unexpected.Brilliant."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"An Inca bridge suddenly collapses for no apparent reason, and five people plunge to their deaths. A monk thinks to investigate with the goal of determining whether the deaths of these particular people (out of all the people who had crossed the bridge) were a part of the divine plan or merely random events. And in the end, he is unable to decipher any reason for what has occurred, and winds up being burned to death by the Church for heresy (the rationale for this is not explained) along with his book (there was another copy, however, which survived).Sounds a bit contrived, doesn't it? Especially as Thornton Wilder had never visited Peru where the action is centered, he only did so years later, and is therefore talking about a setting and culture of which he has a second hand understanding at best.As a work of imagination, however, the stories are first rate. The characters' motivations are highly imaginative, a mixture of strength and weakness, and they are dissected in clinical detail. The writing is lovely, not a word wasted, allowing a 100-page narrative to convey more substance than many far longer books. The Pulitzer Prize seems well deserved.What is the conclusion on the divine plan vs. random events question? The closing comment - likening the bridge to the love that connects the lands of the living and the dead - suggests this may be the wrong question. Perhaps the striving and caring in life is more important than the specifics of what human beings do or don't achieve."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Although I am familiar with Thornton Wilder's plays, this is the first novel of his that I have read. I will be reading more! \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" has been turning over and over in my mind since I finished it a few days ago. I still don't know what to fully say about it. Essentially the novel is asking if there is a divine providence in our lives, or is it merely the acts of our own will. I have read reviews that argue vehemently that the book comes decisively down in one camp or the other. I am not sure I agree. I think Mr. Wilder is saying that regardless of whether it is human or divine, love is the central theme that makes life bearable, important, and worth toiling through. Whether the love is divinely or humanly inspired is beside the point. I have to say, I find that idea very uplifting.The style of the text is a little difficult for the casual reader to get into, but once you have read four or so pages you adapt to the manner in which Wilder composed this piece, and it flows very nicely. I read that Wilder worked very hard to make the narrator of the text a detached persona, one not emotionally involved in the story. This works wonderfully for the novel, because the fate that befalls five characters when a bridge collapses and sends them all plummeting to their deaths is delivered with a very dry, matter of fact, and objective sense of the event. The details of their personal lives are revealed to the reader in much the same manner, and a big theme of the novel comes through as a result. The emotions that we feel towards these characters as we get to know more and more about them are constructs of our own personal reactions to them, and they are varied reader to reader because of what we bring to the book ourselves. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" seems to be saying that human life is valued in the eyes of the individuals who have some emotional connection to it, and that is much more important than trying to place an individual life in the great cosmic scheme of things. The greatest value in our lives is in how we are loved by others seems to be what Wilder is saying in the very ambiguous, and very brilliant, final ten lines of the novel.Or he could be saying something completely different. That is the goal. What we as individual readers bring to this text is what gives it meaning. To that point, this novel is a favorite of two friends of mine, one an avid atheist and hater of religion, and one as devout and evangelical as they come. Again, what we bring to this work seems to define it, and Wilder wanted that to happen.The current edition has a lovely forward by Russell Banks, and some great information about Wilder and his work on the text. Both are helpful in making the experience of reading this novel even richer.\\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" has shoved its way into my top five list. It is perfect for discussion and book clubs. The Pulitzer Prize it won in 1928 was well deserved."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Beautifully written and magically told.

The descriptions of these people, their thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which they live their lives are clear and carefully layered, and I grew to like all of them very much.

It was 1714. It had been made by the Incas with thin slats. A little red-haried Franciscan, Brother Juniper, from Italy did something about the rent in the bridge of San Luis Rey. Brother Juniper wanted to determine why the five people who died had been fated to lose their lives on that bridge. He wanted to experiment, to explain the ways of God to men. He spent six years investigating the lives of the victims.The Marquesa de Montemayor was separated from her daughter, the Condesa, who lived in Spain. She learned her daughter was expecting a child. In time she made a typical Peruvian pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Maria de Cluxambuqua. Even before the Incan civilization the ground was holy.Esteban and Manuel were foundlings. Twins, they invented a secret language for themselves. The language was a symbol of their identity with one another. Their unity was broken by a love of women.Uncle Pio was active, but nothing made him rich. He came from Europe. He traveled with a cafe singer, the Perichole. Uncle Pio never ceased watching Camila, the Perichole. She became impatient with acting and wanted to become a lady.A new bridge of stone was built. Brother Juniper's book was held to be heretical.

Though seemingly unrelated at first, they are in fact indirectly related to Camila Perichole, a former Peruvian actress.Upon reading, I had initial fears that TBOSLR would depict the predictable 20th century existentialist world, where \\"God's plan\\" is synonymous with \\"panacea\\" and that each of our lives is purposeless. Though I will not reveal the ending, Wilder steeres clear of this conclusion.Wilder's masterful accomplishment rests upon his proficiency in theatre.

Thornton Wilder addresses this question in this short but pungent novel about five victims of a Peruvian bridge collapse in 1714.Whatever the point, it's something Wilder admits is difficult to discern. That stays just as true for those who read \\"The Bridge Of San Luis Rey\\" as for those who don't. Wilder writes from a perspective of faith, but at the same time doesn't try to offer any firm conclusions. He even disparages the efforts of a priest in the novel who tries. I think it's this gentle give-and-take in the undergirding philosophy that gives \\"Bridge\\" the right amount of play for readers today to handle - a sense of being directed without ever being led.The novel breaks down into three short stories, each dealing with one or two of the five victims, along with a brief prelude and postscript concerned with the efforts of Brother Juniper to answer the question: Why them? The stories don't make clear until their endings who are the victims and who are the survivors, except that the latter are often victims of the bridge's collapse in their own longer-lasting way, left as they are with memories of people they loved and didn't value enough when alive. It's all more than a bit depressing and sobering in much the same way as Wilder's famous play \\"Our Town.\\"Two of the stories, of an aging widow who is the subject of much mockery in her own time but proves a legend for generations to come, and of a court operator who comes to grief from the one person he comes to love, are quite affecting, more so for the way Wilder writes of them, in a kind of inexact way that has the quality of a hazy myth. The third story, about two twins and their own separate grief at the hands of love, feels less essential to me. Maybe this was Wilder's way of injecting himself into the story, as Wikipedia indicates his own story was much like that of the twins.For me, the weakness of \\"Bridge\\" is the feeling at times of plowing through a field of worthy epigrams stitched together by characters and plots that are by themselves not especially engaging. \\"Time keeps going by,\\" one character says, ironically just before it is about to end for him. \\"You'll be surprised at the way time passes.\\" Wilder's gift for capturing deep insights in a sentence or two is never in doubt; I just found myself not caring as much as I wished.But the novel does work its way to a point of sorts, a fittingly fuzzy one that nevertheless offers more of a sense of hope, and perhaps Hope, rather than doubt. That I liked and admired. It was no easy thing to write such a novel in the 20th century, that this one won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928 probably had something to do the way it pushes so bravely against the current of literary opinion of its time.Give it points also for getting across a deep story within a short number of pages. A longer novel that took more time fleshing out its characters and setting might have made it better but more easily could have spoiled its lasting interest. You come to this book with your own ideas of life and the destination you end up reaching has more to do with you than him. Wilder seemed to have been comfortable with that result, and there's a sense of grace in that if nothing else."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"We all have a worldview (don't we?) which influences just about everything we encounter. Literature is no exception. Perhaps that is why I thought the main point of Thornton Wilder's outstanding The Bridge of San Luis Rey was so obvious.In many of the reviews I've read, people have stated that Wilder leaves the main conclusion up to the reader. I must disagree. The final line, so quoted by many of the reviewers, makes it all very clear to me. \\"All those impulses of love return to the love that made them.\\" Perhaps, had Wilder capitalized the second \\"love\\" more would have drawn the same conclusion as I. That love is, of course, the love of the Father.This short book is rooted in Christian realism -- summed up in that final page. Life and God's ways as they pertain to life, are a mystery to the believer. Seemingly saintly people die far too early in inexplicable circumstances-- a bridge that has lasted for centuries one day breaks under the weight of an old woman, a cripple, an old man, a young girl, and a young man. But the \\"why\\" is not for us to know. We all must live in the comfort that it is His will that reigns, not ours, and that the love which sustained us in this life will see us to the next.Perhaps Brother Juniper found his answer. I know I recognized mine."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The book has not suffered from time or from an idiot technicolor movie with a cast of excellent actors and directors who felt it necessary to revise the novel.The book is a stylistic masterpiece. The pacing is perfect and the point of view is instructive.The introduction and after-word are useful as well.Read the book; skip the movie."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This novel, perhaps more than any other in the history of American literature, asks \\"Can bad things really happen to good people?\\" On one day in 1714, the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, sending five people falling to their deaths. Brother Juniper, one of the witnesses to the tragedy, seeks to explain how and why this could have happened. The bulk of the novel, a concerted effort on the part of Juniper to justify the ways of God to man, is a carefully woven portrait of their interconnecting and overlapping lives, loves, successes and failures leading up to the day of the bridge collapsing.The Marquesa de Montemayor, whose daughter treats her with supreme indifference, has just seen her move away to marry her husband, a Spanish Viceroy. She copes mainly by writing beautiful, elaborate letters to her daughter and son-in-law. The Marquesa becomes reclusive and introspective, and asks the local Abbess and proprietress of an orphanage for the company of one of her girls. Pepita comes to live with her and provide much-needed companionship. On learning that her daughter is pregnant, the Marquesa makes a visit to the shrine at Santa Maria de Cluxambuqua. On her return to Lima, accompanied by Pepita, we learn that they are killed on the bridge. We later learn through Brother Juniper that the letters she wrote are gems of the Spanish language and are canonized and anthologized for schoolchildren to learn ages and ages hence.Another story revolves around two twins named Manuel and Esteban (Wilder himself was a twin whose brother died in childbirth) who, also under the protection of the same local Abbess, grow up to become scribes. Soon Manuel is taken in to compose letters for the extraordinarily talented stage talent who goes by only \\"the Perichole,\\" who is in romantic cahoots with both the Spanish Viceroy and a local bullfighter (see Offenbach's eponymous opera, as well as the short story by Prosper Merimee). After Manuel dies of an infection, Esteban is enlisted to assist one Captain Alvarado on a long voyage, partially in order to pay for a present for the Abbess. On the way to buy the present, Esteban crosses the Bridge of San Luis Rey and his fate befalls him.Uncle Pio, the Perichole's assistant, maid, and general counselor, has an interesting life of his own. Growing up as a diplomat, theater impresario, and Catholic shill during the Inquisition, he finds Micaela Villegas (see the historical personage of the same name, whom Wilder has only slightly fictionalized here), whom he trains and refashions in his own image, turning her into the best-known Peruvian actress of her time. After having become thoroughly disillusioned with the theatre and her success, she wishes to enter into proper society and wishes to never talk to Uncle Pio again. After some hesitation, the Perichole allows Pio to take her son and give the curious boy the proper education that he deserves. Leaving the next morning, they are the last two victims of the bridge.Looking for one common thread to tie all of these disparate lives together, the reader is drawn over and over again to fact that they all see confounded by their personal searches for love and meaning. As much money or success they attain, we see lives beguiled by angst and beset by circumstance. By no means, and Brother Juniper would certainly have noted this in his book, do we find people who \\"deserved\\" to die.But the Bridge of San Luis Rey has a sixth victim, one who didn't fall hundreds of feet into the ravine below: Brother Juniper himself. Having written his book full of the most diligent and ingenuous research in an attempt to find out why God would let this happen (was it punishment for evil? Or was God just indifferent to human suffering?), the Catholic Church finds his book heresy and they burn him for it. What was so heretical? Perhaps that he would be so presumptuous as to explain God's plan for the world.As far as the form and structure of the novel are concerned, the first and last chapters, the only places where Wilder allows himself philosophical divulgence, are a little too cordoned-off for my taste, rendering the deeply resounding questions of theology and meaning merely peripheral. I feel that interlarding them into the lives of the five characters would probably have better achieved what was most likely one of his goals in the first place - to meditate on questions of fate, free will, chance, and mortality. Finally, while to pen, at the age of thirty, a novel this succinct and full of impact is an accomplishment in itself, I feel that tripling or even quadrupling the size of the book would have made the characters more realistic. But if that were the case, of course, it would not have the wonderful quality of being told to you as a griot would tell it, as the scintillating moral fable it is."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is Thornton Wilder's most famous novel and rivals his play Our Town as his most famous work. It is certainly his prose masterpiece and, though it does not belong with the truly greatest novels, is excellent overall and exemplary in many respects.The central idea is brilliant, perhaps the best out of the hundreds or thousands of books I have read in terms of plot and otherwise - a bridge collapses, killing everyone on it and leading an onlooker to investigate their lives for some kind of divine meaning behind it. The book is thus not a novel in the usual sense so much as a series of interlocking short stories. The stories are very good in themselves - interesting and extremely readable; they could stand alone with slightly altered endings. Characterization is strong, but some may be dismayed by how the stories end just as we begin to make a truly emotional connection - but this is after all the point. The characters were all at an important point in their lives when the bridge fell, perhaps even life-changing ones, but their plans were cut unexpectedly and tragically short. Perhaps they would have succeeded; perhaps not. The point is that they - and hence we - will never know; the transition is deliberately jerky in order to let us feel the magnitude of this, the sadness of what could have been.However, Wilder's artistry truly comes into play when he makes them all mesh in the central conceit; his execution is seamlessly deft. It is a remarkable technical feat and interesting enough in itself to carry a book, but its highly thought-provoking nature is the real strength. One can only wonder why such tragedies happen; is it simply chance - bad luck, if you will - the inevitable statistical result of a universe without a benevolent god or any other controlling force sympathetic to humanity? This might be the expected conclusion of a twentieth century novel, but Wilder - dubbed an unfashionable optimist by one critic - is significantly more ambiguous. He cleverly makes the observer a religious figure understandably determined to see God's Providence. Despite diligent striving and sincere faith, he cannot do so to his satisfaction, and he is to a large extent a figure of ridicule. However, Brother Juniper is also sympathetic in being truly genuine and honestly searching, and he certainly does not deserve his punishment; his narrow-minded and unfair execution is another shot at religion, but it would be wrong to put the novel with the great agnostic/atheist works. Wilder deliberately leaves the question open; Juniper may have been nave, but there is no proof that he was wrong. Other characters in any case take solace in love's redemptive power, which is depicted as stronger than death - sufficient for meaning in life and continued optimism regardless of Providence's existence or non-existence. This common secular conclusion may disappoint the religious but has rarely, if ever, been put forth so movingly and powerfully. The book's final paragraph is one of the most beautifully lyrical and sublimely poignant ever written - so great that the book is worth reading for it alone and would be worth the wait even if one liked nothing before it. Whether we agree or disagree with the conclusion, its thought-provoking nature is notable, and the final paragraph will stay with us for a long time - likely forever.This brings up another of the book's great strengths - remarkable prose. Wilder writes with incredible beauty and precision, somehow managing to reach great poetic heights and infuse considerable meaning in under two hundred pages. This has some of the loveliest writing to be found anywhere as well as vivid characterization, detailed historical narration that makes an unfamiliar world seem truly alive, and even strong, well-done elements of diverse styles such as satire.All told, while missing the indefinable something characteristic of the greatest novels, this is an excellent one with wide appeal, and anyone who likes classic literature should check it out."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A brilliant book. Wilder richly deserved the Pulitzer that this book earned. Short, at 133 pages in this edition, it is uniformly excellent. Wilder's sharp wit and turn of phrase are unmatched. The book's theme is powerful and resolved in an unexpected and profound way. Brother Juniper, a thoughtful friar, witnesses the collapse of a rope bridge over a gorge in rural Peru in 1714 and the death of the five people walking along it. He views this event as an opportunity to prove the existence of god and, finally, to elevate theology to the rank of the hard sciences. Juniper instinctively believes that there must be a divine reason for those five to have been chosen for death. He senses god's powerful, latent hand in the bridge's collapse and commits himself to learning all there is to know about the victims in order to discern the plan and prove god's existence. Who were the victims? What were their lives like? Why did they die?Juniper's conclusions are, of course, inconclusive. He never found the pattern, but remained convinced that it was there, just that he was too poor an intellect to see it. Such questions, naturally, were anathema to the church of the age and Juniper and his book were destroyed for heresy. Readers who focus on the same questions as Juniper are doomed to be just as frustrated. Wilder is far too insightful to let Juniper have the last word, for ultimately, it is not Juniper who stumbles upon the meaning of the five deaths, but the survivors -those who loved the victims- as well as the reader. What the five had in common was that they were human beings, with tender sides and flaws and significant unrequited loves. There is nothing remarkable here, we are all built that way. After their deaths, the Abbess whose orphanage was home to two of the victims realizes that the meaning lies in the lives themselves, in the love the victims shared with those near to them. That there is no immortality, not even memory or good works, so that what matters is the fleeting existence of goodness, and therein lies god's grace. Love is a powerful and immediate force, not a point for theological debate. \\"Many who have spent a lifetime in passion can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday.\\"Wilder's prose is smooth and polished and yielding of aphorisms: the six attributes of the adventurer (a memory for names and faces, the gift of tongues, inexhaustible invention, secrecy, a talent for chatting with strangers, and a freedom from conscience); or an observation that \\"the public for which masterpieces are intended is not on this earth.\\" Every line is adept, every page a wonder.While Wilder wrote the book in 1927, it is perhaps a perfect inquiry into 17th century baroque worldviews and the rationalist philosophies they spawned. The baroque had reached Spain, if not Peru, by 1714. Its fascination with death and the brevity of life (\\"carpe diem\\" and countless reminders of the inevitabiity of death) resound her, as do its emphasis on vanity, and theater as a metaphor for life. Lima's theatre, its actresses and audiences, are central to the book. And it is only when the beautiful actress is struck by tragedies that she reaches her resolution in grace. Juniper himself embodies that strange blend of baroque scientific materialism and divine idealism of an age in which Descartes could prove the existence of god while Newton demonstrated god's machinery in motion.Wilder's solution is much more satisfying than Descartes' or Juniper's. Wilder may have been baroque in his cynicism, but he was decidedly 20th century american in his hopefulness. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" is a stunning book."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A short, sweet novel. Greater minds than mine awarded it a Pulitzer Prize, so I won't blabber on about its quality. Wilder wastes few words, inserts no extra padding, to tell his story. This lacks the action sequences and suspense of Tom Clancyish pulp, but does sneak up on the intellect, leaving the reader expectantly looking for the subtle connections that weave the characters together.The manifest story is simple. Five people have fallen to their death in Peru, and Brother Juniper seeks to prove the goodness of God by evaluating their lives to demonstrate exactly why bad things happen. Gently satirical, Wilder consigns poor Brother Juniper to a fitting end, for the chutzpah of attempting to decipher the mind of God with a moral calculus. Juniper has forgotten his Master's admonition, to \\"judge not.\\" Hidden from Juniper's attempt to make sense of tragedy lay connections that he could never imagine, longings, love unrequited, and loneliness unimaginable. In the end, we learn, not WHY bad things happen, but the power and beauty that can rise from the ashes of tragedy.Wilder tells snippets of stories, weaving lives together, in a way that goes unnoticed at first, then becomes subliminal, and finally explodes into consciousness at the end. While these lives and their interconnections are somewhat contrived, they effect a transformation, both of the story-line and the reader by the end of the book. Well worth reading a second time.&lt;P..."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel takes on the daunting task of exploring whether or not there is a plan behind why we live and die - and how. The debate rages around the incident of the Bridge of San Luis Rey snapping one day, sending five people plummeting to their deaths. Brother Juniper, a Franciscan missionary, witnesses the tragedy and determines to make it the test case in an experiment he has long sought to complete: to prove that the victims were either impious and therefore punished or pious and therefore being whisked away to Heaven to stand beside God. It is a radical study in his time, and its inherent questioning into the nature of the world will ultimately see Brother Juniper mislabeled as a heretic by the church.The character studies that make up the bulk of the novel (which is really more of a novella given its brevity) are uniformly intriguing, and it is there that \\"Bridge\\" truly shines, in addition to Wilder's superb use of language. His portrait of the Marquesa, her servant Pepita, Esteban and his twin brother Manuel, and the Perichole are awe-inspiring glimpses into lives that feel full and true to life - an even greater achievement considering the short amount of time Wilder spends on each of them in order to move the plot forward. If it is more difficult to get a handle on other characters like the Archbishop, the viceroy, Jaime, and the enigmatic Uncle Pio we can forgive Wilder because they still fit the larger scheme of the novel and add to its compelling plot. What emerges from their intertwining lives is the realization that human lives are often too complex to be accurately affixed with such extreme labels as \`good' or \`bad'. Each has marks for them and against them, making an experiment like Brother Juniper's impossible to complete. There are too many shades of grey to see things as black and white as the missionary would like them to be.In addition to this main theme, Wilder expertly weaves in questions regarding love, family, and faith. And while I greatly appreciate his refusal to come to any definite answer, one does wish that Wilder had put more into his presentation. In his exploration of this tragic event and its implications he does little more than present evidence for the reader to interpret as they see fit, and the problem there is that they will come away with whatever preconceived notions they may have had regarding the subject perfectly intact. Wilder brings no new insights to the central question and he makes no poignant arguments for either side. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" is, then, essentially a test case for the reader to apply their own theories to. There will be no earth-shattering revelations to make them reconsider their position, and as good as the novel is in all other respects, I wish that the debate as Wilder presented it had more meat. It certainly isn't lacking in substance, but just a touch more flavor would have been greatly appreciated.Still, I would highly recommend this book to any lover of literature and anyone who is trying to find their own answers to the question it poses. Wilder's novel takes on additional significance in the wake of 9/11 that makes it even more relevant to modern readers. To read that \\"The bridge seemed to be among the things that last forever; it was unthinkable that it should break\\" is to revisit the stunned disbelief that has permeated the years since that tragedy.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The hardest books to review are your favorites. This is my fifth attempt on this one.The Bridge of San Luis Rey concerns one of the primary questions of human existance. Does God have a plan for our deaths and is there a reason we die? (Pretend that was only one question.) This novel is certainly the best to explore the topic. It is vastly insightful and gives its insight within a powerful narrative.The novel begins with the collapse of the bridge of San Luis Rey which kills the five people crossing it. Brother Juniper witnesses the catastrophe, and he decides to use this opportunity to study the reasons for death. What follows is the story of each of the persons' lives who died. In each story you find a connecting bond: love. Each had been touched by love. The stories together reaveal simply that. Everyones' life matters because of love, and the dead are still connected to the living by a bridge of love.What I've written about the novel is really too simplistic. The Bridge of San Luis Rey is only a very short novel, but within those pages is a multitude of insight which cannot be explained in a short review (especially without giving away too much of the book). I think that I'll just conclude this rambling review by saying that this is a beautiful little novel which deserves a place among the very top novels of last century. I also think that in wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, The Bridge of San Luis Rey could gain importance by giving the people affected insight into the tragedy and comfort them."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"If you have ever wondered what would have happened had you left your house a few minutes earlier this is a book for you. Would the day have been different? Or would your life have been different? Maybe not, but in our minds we make connections about coincidences all the time. The beauty of this book is that it attempts to get at the heart of connections and why a particular group of people happen to all be on a bridge at the time it collapses. The best part of the book is the monk going in search of the people's past because -- being a man who believes in predetermination -- he wonders if indeed the people were fated to be on the bridge at that moment. Those who call this book boring simply don't get it. And those who call it unrealsitic don't have much of an imagination. This book is fiction at it's best because it has the ability to make us actively think about the connections in our lives. And amazingly for all that heady stuff it can be read in one day!"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Perhaps better known as a playwright (OUR TOWN and THE MATHCMAKER), Thornton Wilder presented a fast-paced world with a stately novella which proceeds at its own tempo--oblivious of modern demands for mindless action and soulless dialogue. Required high school reading as far back as the 60's, BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY still exerts its ingenuous literary charm upon thoughtful readers. Our throw-away society begrudges spending time to consider the deeper questions of life. The Why's of our existence--or mass disaster--prove too mentally stressful to validate such effort.Conscientious Brother Juniper undertakes an exhaustive examination of the lives of five persons. Although their curiously interrelated lives are not apparent at first, they all died simultaneously while crossing an ancient rope bridge in 18th century Peru. So why should we concern ourselves with the conicidence and obscure destiny of non English-speaking people 200 years ago? Determined to prove to himself (not to mention to atheists and skeptics) that a divine hand masterminded (or simply permitted) the sudden death of five travelers, the earnest friar struggles to juxtapose these ageless questions re the role of God in human life. Is fate merely indifferent to our petty struggles for fame, power and self-esteem? Were these five singled out because of the way they had lived? Were they being punished or rewaded for their earthly sojourns? Or was the fatal unraveling of the rope but a regretful mechanical catastrophe?Wilder's theatrical experience is revealed in several sections of this novella--where we discern true Scenes and Acts. In fact, he permits increasingly long dialogues between his prime characters in successive chapters. Even his secondary charaters possess remarkable qualities as supporting actors, who appear in several lives. If the bridge which spans the chasm (a metaphor for Life or perhaps Ignorance?) parts without warning, which two landmarks of mortal existence cease to be connected? Individual responses will vary, according to the reader's temperament and moral development.

For him, the accident is an opportunity to show that we are all part of God's intelligent plan, not victims of random, meaningless events. His study of these five lives takes many years to complete and fills volumes. In the end, of course, he falls short of his purpose. But his research shows something else. It shows how God's love is expressed in our world, sometimes through worthy and sometimes through what appear to be unworthy messengers. It also shows that no one is so alienated from God that he cannot be reached. Eventually, Brother Juniper suffers for his pretensions to expose the operations of God's will.Besides its deeply affecting exposition of the theme described above, The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful evocation of life in 18th century colonial Peru. Thornton Wilder's writing is just exquisite. In one scene, a selfish woman undergoes a transformation and spends the night composing an important letter to her daughter. Before dawn, she goes to the door upon her balcony and looks up \\"at the great tiers of stars that glittered above the Andes. Throughout the night, though there had been few to hear it, the whole sky had been loud with the singing of these constellations.\\"The 1975 Pocket Book (Washington Square Enriched Classics) edition I have includes an interesting reader's supplement with illustrations and notes."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"\\"On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travelers into the gulf below.\\" When Brother Juniper witnesses this tragedy first-hand, he resolves to find in it scientific evidence of God's plan.

Short, beautiful, and nearly perfect, THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY earned Thornton Wilder the first of his three Pulitzer prizes.The lives of the five victims of the bridge are thoroughly recounted leading up to the moment they all came together to cross the bridge. Brother Juniper came up with his conclusions regarding the tragedy, but ultimately, he was not satisfied with his results. He did, however, realize that he learned least about the victims in question in speaking with those that were close to them. It was these very survivors, however, away from Juniper's questions and after the friar's execution who ultimately did find some answers.I was moved by the final conclusion of the book: that out lives are transient and unremarkable but to those whom we love and who love us, and our very existence dies with those that cared for us. \\"...almost no one remembers Esteban and Pepita but myself...

As I read through the second part, Marquesa de Montemeyor, my expectations were slowly changing even more. By the beginning of the third part, Esteban, my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable.I came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion's struggle with faith. By the first few pages I came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean, at this point I was scared of being bored. As I started to read part two I began to realize it wasn't about this Brother Juniper at all but the people in the accident. Throughout parts of the first chapter I have to admit I did feel bored, but near the end it caught fire and I was wowed by the first part's finish. This reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it, for that's what each part was: a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge.The story of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winner is that a bridge (the finest bridge in all of Peru) snapped and five travelers fell to their death. Brother Jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was God's will. This man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen. Basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life.I would say the way The Bridge of San Luis Rey was written was, generally, not exceptionally appealing to me. It was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events. Using this method though, there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry.The book also seemed slightly tedious at times. Certain sections were difficult to get through but as I pressed on I felt a certain gratification, in knowing that I was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get.Despite these downfalls (which had their upshots as well), the meaning of the book made it for me. The characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death, which was a death too early for all of them, there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments.In total I would suggest the Bridge of San Luis Rey but only if you're willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up.

Wilder makes his point about love, but it is not a blinding revelation for most of us. (Sadly, I note the presence of that old sure-fire combination . . . boldly proclaim the power of \\"love\\" while decorously diminishing the power and plan of the Living God, and the critics will treat you exceedingly well).So in spite of the window dressing, this book is not about God at all. Rather, it is a humanistic piece.This book contains NO action. That can be ok if there is some element of suspense, heartbreak, comedy (even subtle wit), or other emotional stimulus to make up for it. There isn't. You can read this book in one sitting and your pulse will never move off of a pleasant 70 (unless you fall asleep).

I take this approach each and everytime when reading a classic. After all, it is only their opinion versus mine. I am no Yale graduate, but I have read hundreds of novels and would like to think of myself as a well read individual, qualified to give a valid opinion. Try as I might, despite the intriguing story line, Pulitzer prize, and rave reviews, The Bridge of San Luis Rey was a huge disappointment for me.One reason, to be honest, is that I am not huge fan of most stream of conscious novels because I don't they just don't captivate or enthrall or produce sufficient enough emotions inside of me for them to be interesting or memorable. Faulkner is the only author I would consider amazing at the stream of conscious style. I get restless with the jumbled words and fragmented story (mostly lack thereof) because this style of a novel isn't about stories it is about a person's thoughts and sometimes a person's inner thinking is just not that riveting as is the case here.I love great description, moving and fleshed out characters, power, intrigue and solid story lines. This novel has none of those qualities. Perhaps I should be more open and celebrate stories I don't and can't get immersed in but I want to remember a novel to consider it great no matter how fancy and flowery the language might be. The story is about a bridge that collapses in Peru without warning sending five random people to their deaths. It is an accident of corrosion and nature and not of anything done by man. It all happens by pure coincidence. A man from a distant witness this event and becomes obsessed with the lives of those who died in order to determine whether or not they died by chance or divine intervention.Sounds interesting I know. I thought the idea seemed fascinating but it is not. There are chapters dedicated to three of the five characters and a preachy afterwards that spins itself around in circles. It is slightly confusing but that isn't the issue here. My favorite novel, The Sound and the Fury is very confusing and rewarding but this novel is only the former. I found it hard to focus and in the end I felt I knew very little about the people who died and I certainly didn't care about them. And shouldn't I have with such a searching plot line?There were no solid arguments for chance or divine intervention. Just a lot of words and a lot of needless fluff. For me, to consider a novel a masterpiece I at least need to remember it when I am done reading and with this last sentence The Bridge of the San Luis Rey has already faded away from my mind which is busily anticipating the next novel up on the top 100 list which has a better chance than not then being better than this one is.Grade: C-"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The bridge of san luis rey was a great book.

At times the story is heartbreaking. Esteban being torn from his twin and the hopeless love a mother holds for her daughter. However, always there is the beauty of the language that Wilder uses to convey his story and meaning to his readers. The lives of the characters within are all intertwined in one way or another and it is fascinating to discover how."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This is a great piece of American 20th century fiction.

For instance, many people have come to the exact opposite conclusion I came to by the end of the book. These people state that Wilder states that there is no plan from God that determines the fate of people and it is ridiculous to think such. However, that is drawn solely from Brother Juniper's findings, and Juniper is not given the knowledge we are given in the novel and therefore comes, in my mind to an incorrect assumption. For instance, no one but God can know anything about the conversions that each character has before his or her death- these are very important to the story. Nor could Juniper see the effect the deaths would have upon the survivors (some say this is Wilder inserting hope into the ending of the novel- I think it is proving part of God's divine plan). Thus my conclusion was that God does have a divine plan for the world- it is not just hopeless chaos- however, humans, no matter how driven to prove it can and will never be privied to God's guiding hand. I obviously do not know if I read to far into it, and in doing missed the point- because I can see relevance in the other theory, though I don't like the message."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a short, exquisite meditation on life and the meaning of our existence. This winner of the 1928 Pulitzer Prize centers on the collapse of a bridge in 18th-century Peru that takes the lives of five people. A priest who witnesses the event wonders about the five who die. Why were they chosen? Was there a master plan or did the event occur simply at the whim of God. Being a religious man with a desire to place theology amongst the sciences, he sets out to empirically prove why the event happened by learning about the lives of those who perished.Wilder's prose is a wonder to read, near perfect in its pace and pitch. But this is a moral fable, with the conclusion that love is the meaning of it all. And with the novel consisting of almost exclusively characterization, this novel has almost no chance of finding appreciation among the masses today, who need a fast-paced plot and don't liked to be preached to. This probably explains why Wilder, a courageous writer who pushed the boundaries of literature, is under-appreciated these days. That's a shame; we could all learn something from his books. And if nothing else, if we're insistent upon learning nothing from our literature, we could sit back and enjoy the beautiful writing."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey takes place during the early 1700's.

I don't believe this book attempted to say anything, in and of itself. One is tempted to read the last line of the novel and attempt to extract its meaning. Don't do that. Although it reads like a declarative, it is not. When one writes, one likes to wrap up with a beautiful line, and Thorton Wilder has done just that; but it is not THE statement. How could it be? It contradicts so many things that have come before.Okay, so if you haven't read the novel, you're totally confused. Simply put, however, this novel is beautiful, insightful, and has a depth that is uncanny considering the leaness of the work. If you've read it once, and it took you 5 hours or so (which is reasonable), I assure you, you have missed a great deal. Read it again. It is that kind of book. One can, and perhaps should, read this novel sporadically over the course of a lifetime and be surprised by what is new within it every time. Certain songs are like that, and movies too. Art of course. Anything with depth. That being said, however, don't be scared off if you only wish to spend 5 hours and nothing more. The characters will stay with you, and you will be glad to have taken the time.

Or when you drive by a car accident on the highway, does it occur to you that if you had been only a few minutes earlier, you might have been involved in the wreck? &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; is a novel that wonders about these things -- whether our lives are governed by the randomness of fate or whether we &quot;deserve&quot; what happens to us.It is the story of five people in Peru who, one day, are crossing a rope-and-plank bridge which suddenly collapses, spilling them into a chasm. A studious monk named Brother Juniper witnesses the catastrophe and determines to learn about the lives of the victims and find out whether they were &quot;chosen&quot; for this fate or whether it was just a matter of innocently being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The victims are a noblewoman named the Marquesa de Montemayor, who was returning from a shrine where she was praying for her pregnant daughter; the Marquesa's orphaned and loyal maid Pepita; Esteban, a suicidal young man who was despondent over the recent death of his twin brother; a man called Uncle Pio, who liked to nurture his interest in women, Spanish literature, and drama; and a little boy in Uncle Pio's care named Don Jaime. All these people's lives were connected in some way to a vampish actress named Camila Perichole, whose presence in the novel provides links between the characters and events.Brother Juniper tries but fails to correlate the lives these people led with their deaths. Unable to conclude that God unconditionally punishes all sinners and rewards all saints, he is promptly burned as a heretic. He smiles as he dies, knowing that his own death ironically refutes the beliefs of his accusers."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"man spends his life trying to prove the existence of god. he does it by exploring the lives of dead people, not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Strange writing style, very sad depressing story.

The question of why lives end when they do isn't exactly an easy one to answer, especially in a book as short as this one.I would recommend this book to anyone. As for the comments made by early reviewers who believe that is a classic 'for adults only', you're very wrong.

Having said that, the characterization is to me nonsensical. All of us know a someone whose objects are difficult to fathom or who lives on the cusp of reality; but in this story we're introduced to a half dozen such, lives that supposedly interact with one another and whose self-understanding is all too suddenly transformed before or after the tragedy. That \\"love\\" is the only human survival may satisfy during sunlit hours, but it is cold comfort in the midnight of the soul."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder is perhaps best known for his play, \\"Our Town,\\" which is the staple of high school drama groups and this book, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. I first read the book in high school, now more than 40 years ago and sadly chose it for its length - a short assignment! Some of the negative reviews of the book seem to be from these young, first time readers - I would have been among them on my first reading. Almost certainly you need some maturity (read: life experiences) to fully appreciate Wilder's wonderful, dense, evocative prose.The year was 1714, the \\"Sun King,\\" Louis XIV was still on the throne in France, and Peru was an established colony of Spain, when the bridge collapsed. One of the sub-themes of the book is the relationship of the colony with the mother country, Spain, and Peru's efforts to mature, in terms of the cultural and social life available. The central strength of the novel is Wilder's incisive portraits of four individuals: the physically ugly, lonely noveaux-riche, the Marquesa de Montemayor; Estaban, the sole survivor of twin orphans; and Uncle Pio, the wheeler-dealer who \\"trained\\" the actress Perichole. The first three fell to their deaths when the bridge collapsed, along with two others, Pepita, the assistant of the Marquesa, and Jaime, the son of Perichole. These two are not characterized in detail, and thus might be considered so much \\"collateral damage.\\"Examples of Wilder's succinct and meaningful prose are, in terms of the Archbishop: \\"A curious and eager soul was imprisoned in all this lard, but by dint of never refusing himself a pheasant or a goose or his daily procession of Roman wines, he was his own bitter jailer.\\" Has schadenfreude ever been better defined that the reaction of the population to the knowledge that the glamorous actress Perichole had become disfigured by smallpox: \\"...henceforth any attention paid to her must spring from a pity full of condescension and faintly perfumed with satisfaction at so complete a reversal.\\"?The overall framework of the novel is the search for meaning in this accident, faithfully pursued by a Brother Juniper who investigated each of the characters and their connections with their relations and friends. For his efforts, the Catholic Church burned him at the stake for \\"heresy\\" since his conclusion was that it was \\"God's will\\" that they were chosen to be called \\"home.\\" Wilder's own conclusion is equally unsatisfying: \\"There is a land of the living, and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.\\"It was humbling to realize that Wilder wrote this book, with its intense character sketches when he was still under 30. The weakness, despite the Pulitzer, was the overall framework and his facile, trite conclusions as to meaning, in a universe devoid of same, despite our best efforts. Overall, a much better book to read in one's 60's than when one is 16."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Wilder's slender masterpiece is one of those delicious books that takes a central philosophic question and evenly divides the answer: Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But if it were only that, it would be pretty boring. Luckily, in telling the intertwining tales of the people who fell with the bridge on that fateful day, Wilder shows an exquisite delicacy of touch, very close to poetic, and a fine sense of where to elaborate in a story and where to simply summarize (would that many of our best authors today show that sense and not just churn out the pages). Also remarkable is Wilder's ability to be evocative. One gets a real sense of Lima, Peru, in the early 18th Century, the clear mornings, the quiet nights, and without all the unattractive bedbugs of an author like Saramago.No matter what your predilection is for fiction, you will not fail to be touched by \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey.\\""},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thorton Wilder explores chance and destiny in his classic novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey.

This book is only superficially about the ordinary aspects of a few barely intersecting lives. It really speaks more deeply of love and personal agony and human commitment and the powerful bonds/struggles within relationships. Every word rings true... and I often wanted to rewind the cassette and hear a sentence over again. This beautiful book needs to be read, slowly. However, listening to Waterston's gentle, compassionate voice really brings the characters and their tragedy to life.

The language is beautiful, and Waterston brings to the reading of it a surprising, effortless range of voices, from an aging, tentative prima donna to a gruff sea captain to a rich, spoiled contessa. But it's Wilder's ideas, his musings on the butterfly-wing-fragility of life, which make this book a classic. The last couple of pages are as gentle, timeless and moving as anything ever put on paper (thus the title of my review above)."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This short, brilliant novel attempts to answer the question \\"Do we live by accident and die by accident, or live by plan and die by plan.\\" A well-traveled, primitive bridge in Peru collapses one day in the early 1700s, sending five people to their deaths. Brother Juniper, a Spanish friar, is sent to investigate; he reveals to us the life stories of the five victims. The five people represent a mixture of the proud, the contrite, the sick at heart. Brother Juniper is convinced their deaths are a just act of God, for which he is condemned by the Church and burned at the stake. Countering Brother Juniper's view is Wilder, who believes that the answer to the question is not decidedly accident or plan, but an ambiguous combination of the two. Above all, he claims, is the love that was involved in each person's life: this love \\"will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. There is a land of living and a land of dead and the bridge is love.\\"Wilder develops his theme and characters superbly; the characters whose lives are lost at the bridge are beautifully fleshed out. In fact, \\"beautiful\\" might be the best word to use to describe the book - it's almost poetic, especially in its concerns with love. Wilder won a Pulitzer for this, his second novel.

The movie was so completely worthless that I felt obliged to read for myself Thornton Wilder's book on which the movie was based.This is the conceit of the novella: five people die when a rotten footbridge over a Peruvian gorge collapses, and a naive priest searches for a thread of divine meaning in the five deaths. Wilder's theme is \\"learn at last that anywhere you may expect grace.\\" This message is is proved not only in the lives of the characters, who bless each other in unusual and unexpected ways, but also in Wilder's intimate prose. The style is remarkably similar to that of Marquez and the other poetical latin novelists - and very effective for tranforming colonial Peru into a mythical dream.The Bridge at San Luis Rey is too lovely and restrained - too lacking in tension and tragedy - to be a great novel. But for me it was a refreshing interlude between larger novels that are more challenging and more deceptive."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The story takes place in South America in the 1700s, as five people die when a rope bridge fails and they fall to their deaths.

Run through with touches of the always-surprising magical realism which appears in Wilder's more fabulist works, it showcases his trademark sympathy for characters while never indulging in excessive sentiment.

The execution on this premise is so-so. The characters he chooses are all very depressed people with calamitous lives that touch upon one another. The book is seriously depressing. In addition, the pace is at times glacially slow. It was difficult to finish. The one saving grace is that here and there Wilder writes an utterly brilliant passage. But invariably these passages are set in such dark and uninteresting contexts that you wonder if they weren't penned separately and sort of forced into the story at specific junctures.But even for these passages the dullness and moroseness of the characters' stories hardly makes reading this book worthwhile.

Had I read this before I read the South American Boom writers I might have had more appreciation for it.I checked Wilder's bio and could not find any time spent in Peru or South America prior to (or after) writing the book unless it was during his Coast Guard service. Perhaps its weakness is fundamental: that it is an impression of rather than the actual experience of Latin America. At the time it was written, it may be the closest English speaking readers could get to this type of cross-cultural literary experience. Now readers have a variety of authentic voices to chose from.Wilder has created a good book, but is not a great book. I understand that it is on some lists as a great American classic.

The plot is given by other reviews here, but the conclusions are uncertain - and what do you expect? These are the questions we grapple with for most of our lives - usually without an answer. Apparently, brother Juniper concluded that the five people who died on the bridge did so by coincidence - but was it, really? For three out of five, death coincided with either lost love, or a determination to reacquire one. The two poor children got there somehow; their stories are not completely developed. The most beautiful short passage is in the end of the book: the people are dead, and soon even the memory of them will be gone - but they have loved, and this was enough. It sounds romantic, but I don't think it is - the love was fraternal or parental - including Uncle Pio's, although he was not Camella's \\"biological\\" father.

It attempts to address the time-worn dilemma: Why do bad things happen to good (or, perhaps, not so good) people? Five travelers plunge to their deaths in a tragic accident, and a local Franciscan, Brother Juniper, seeks to use rationally based methods to resolve this unanswerable question.At the outset, Wilder makes clear that the good brother's investigation is misguided, and his conclusions are ridiculous. \\"He thought he saw in the same accident, the wicked visited by destruction and the good called early to heaven.\\" Nevertheless, we are treated to a trilogy of stories examining the lives of the five victims and those who love them.Each of three stories differs in its portrait of the characters, but all are epigrammatic in style and elegant in tone. My favorite of the three is the first, about the mortifyingly ugly and emotionally distant Marquessa de Montemayor (modeled after the historical Madame de Sevigne, a famous writer), who sends beautiful letters to a daughter who has fled the nest and who will never return a mother's love. A young helper, Pepita, is an orphan placed with the Marquessa to acquire \\"worldly experience\\"; she feels abandoned by the abbess who raised her and longs \\"for the dear presence, the only real thing in her life.\\" Both the Marquessa and her helper are so preoccupied with what they don't have that they recognize all too late the joy of each other's presence.Readers who think Wilder is going to help us discover the solution to the randomness of deaths are trying to find depth in the shallow waters under a collapsed bridge. The \\"point\\" is as simple (and, in some ways, as frustrating) as the book itself: \\"It seemed to be sufficient for Heaven that for a while in Peru a disinterested love had flowered and faded.\\" That is, instead of focusing on the reasons for their deaths, Wilder celebrates their lives--and especially the love that each of the five experienced, however briefly, while they were on earth."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This was the first time I ever read Thornton Wilder. He is master of the written word. While reading the novel I felt as if I could be reading a dramatic play (rather watching one unfold before my eyes).

I won't go on to say how much I loved the ending, I'd have to give a spoiler and I don;t want to ruin this great read for anyone! Let's just say that I could feel the threat of tears at the back and corners of my eyes. The last 3 sentences, I think, are wonderful and leave the reader thinking. It did for me anyway.

I guess i disagree with others who state that it is not the conclusion the book reaches, but rather the stories of the five people before the conclusion. For me, the stories of these people at times did drag, however, Wilder does an excellent job tying it in at the conclusion of the novel. Throughout the book you wonder how Wilder will finish off the novel, proof that it was God's plan to take these five, and until the last 5 pages, you are left wondering. However, i believe if you look back at all five characters and the people they left behind, God's plan is definetly revealed.

A must-read."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"&quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; is a novel to which I have returned countless times since I first read it in high school years ago. Astonishingly modern, it is hard to believe it was published in 1927! Ideal for any lover of historical novels (or of history itself), Wilder's beautifully crafted tale interweaves the lives and fates of diverse characters and speaks eloquently to the universal human themes of grief, loss, love, friendship, compassion, and man's quest for the secrets of eternity. This is truly a book that grows with one - - returning to it at any given time of your life will yield new insights and passages to treasure. Truly one of the masterpieces of American Literature."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I have not read much philosophy in life, but what I haven't studied or marked, is made up for in The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Like many readers, I was more acquainted with Thorton Wilder's plays, i.e. The Matchmaker and Our Town, etc... This novel is equally good as his plays. The core question that the book asks is why? Why did the bridge collapse with the specific five people on it? Were their lives conducted in a fashion that warrented death? Or, was death a blessing? Were these five people being rewarded and their souls/spirits being elevated to a godly netherworld? There are so many questions that can be posed as a result of this remarkable novel/novella.It is true that the prose is difficult to read, but if the reader takes his/her time, it is a book that is definately worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a marvelous book, which leaves a ton of room for interpretation and discussion. It is a fictional story about a bridge between Lima and Cuzco, Peru that breaks while five people are traveling across it. The plot focuses on the lives of the five people who die due to the bridge.Some of the book gets a little tedious at times; the lives of several of the people are uneventful and uninteresting. With most of the characters, though, the reader really creates a bond. Many of the protagonists also have common qualities with the reader. To be able to understand and sympathize with the characters really makes the story come alive. As for me, I know what it was like to act, to love, to have a loss, to feel anger or happiness. I had experienced many of the events that took place in the characters lives. This really made me unite with the characters.Thorton Wilder made this book very philosophical; after reading it I got a very good look at life. The question is posed at the beginning- did these five people deserve to die? Did they die merely because they were \\"bad\\" people and the iron hand of G-d came down and punished them? After looking into the character lives, the reader can decide weather by accident they died, or by intention. This question applies to all deaths. Car accidents, plane crashes, or any number of ways that people die; did they deserve it? The unsolvable mystery is discussed in The Bridge of San Luis Rey. And although the topic seems depressing (and it is sort of depressing), it is really satisfactory to be presented the topic in such a remarkable book.Whether I found myself crying or smiling, I enjoyed the book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a quick read and a stir of the mind."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This is a great book, and I have enjoyed reading the reviews also. A lot of people really liked the book and thought about it. I think the review by &quot;richard_t&quot; from South America is beautiful, and it made me understand the book better. Thanks."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This slim little novel employs a fairly typical literary technique--a random event, in this case the collapse of a bridge in Peru--results in the death of five people. The novel explores the lives of the five, which touch each other in subtle ways. The ultimate question asked is whether God \\"planned\\" that this particular five be on the bridge that day to meet their fate. I don't think that question is answered, but a more profound one--whether each person's life is unique and meaningful--is answered with a resounding YES. The unabridged audio version of this book is excellent. Sam Waterston reads clearly and simply, and conveys a tone of respect for each of these diverse lives. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Literary pundits have remarked that the definitive 9-11 novel has yet to be written that captures all of the human experience and themes that day delivered. I'd like to suggest that the novel, in fact, has already been published--in 1927--and that most Americans have actually read it in high school but with the usual Teflon affection that deletes it from memory. This would be Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, which conceives an event that marks just 5 deaths but reverberates through its characters and their land much as 9-11 scars contemporary Americans.The book opens with a fictional event: on the 20th of July 1714, in Peru, a high rope bridge over a gorge, originally constructed by the Incas and used daily with confidence by generations of Spanish settlers, collapses. Those killed while crossing at that moment were a lonely noblewoman, her young servant, a young man about to go out into the world as a seaman, a little boy and his mother's avuncular mentor. In the wake, a Catholic churchman, Brother Juniper, seeks to make religious sense by examining the lives of the dead to ferret out why they were either punished by or called to God. The anonymous 20th century narrator states that what is known of the event, those who died and those they left behind, is known because of Brother Juniper's meticulous records, even if his intentions compare to blaming the tragedies of 9-11 and Katrina on the victims for having been sinners attracting the wrath of God. Between the records of those lives and the narrator's completion of the story, this becomes a powerful statement of what it is to be human, and to restlessly seek love and meaning.To read this now is to be struck by the silky clarity of the prose, the anonymous narrator's ironic distance, and the profundity and universality of its vision."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This review is not about the novel itself but about the quality of its Kindle edition by ePenguin.There are quite a number of spelling mistakes in this edition - as if the text had been scanned in very quickly and not been proof-read carefully enough.

Here is an obituary of the author that describes his work and the influence he had on a generation of readers.Page Smith, an iconoclastic historian and prolific author of books on subjects ranging from the lives of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson to the history of the chicken, died August 28, 1995 at his daughter's home in Santa Cruz, California. He was 77. Dr. Smith taught American colonial history at UCLA until 1964, when he became the first provost of Cowell College at the University of California at Santa Cruz.An author of wide appeal, Dr. Smith wrote books that were both praised by scholars and read by a wide public. His unusual ability as a writer was first recognized in 1962 with the publication of his two-volume biography of John Adams.Smith's study of Adams which earned him the Bancroft Prize for historical writing. In 1976, Samuel Elliot Morison described Smith's bicentennial book, A New Age Now Begins: A People's History of the American Revolution as &quot;a great and magnificent work.&quot; Both books were main selections of the ook-of-the-Month Club, as was his wide-ranging, The Shaping of America.His most controversial work was The Historian and History(1964), a witty indictment of American historians. Championing a story-telling approach to historical writing he argued that &quot;great history has always been narrative history, history with a story to tell that illuminates the truth of the human situation, that lifts spirits and prospects to new potentialities.&quot;Although Smith enjoyed tweaking academic historians, he had impeccable credentials himself. He completed his undergraduate work at Dartmouth College in 1940 and after serving as a company commander in World War II, he earned a doctorate at Harvard University. He taught history at U.C. Santa Cruz until his retirement in 1973."},{"Title":"A New Age Now Begins: A People's History of the American Revolution ( Volume One )","review":"This is a time in which American ideals are challenged by the reality of a modern, hostile world and internal struggle, so it seems like a good idea to examine our history. The best place I know to do so is Mr. Smith's excellent history of America. Massive yet very approachable, it brings to mind Simon Shaara's novels. Smith, one of our great historians, never succumbs to the academic's temptation to footnote and reference every fact. He writes beautifully, in a manner that brings history alive. By all means look for and treasure a copy of all 8 volumes of this ambitious project. It is sad that it is long out of print, as I know of no better history of our republic. If an editor reads this review, I emplore you to republish the entire set.The first 2 volumes are a narrative history of the revolution, followed by books on the early republic, then the Civil War, the rise of industrial America, it's emergence into the world, and finishing with the Depression and the New Deal. Mr. Smith is a true scholar, so there are plenty of facts, but they are never dry or uninteresting, and they are presented as a story to be told, rather than a point to be made. Take a year off from other reading projects and take this 7 kilopage project on. You might consider reading Manchester's The Glory and the Dream to finish off with the history of America since 1932, and put it all in perspective. I strongly recommend you read this entire series and get a new appreciation for our country and a truly fine author."},{"Title":"A New Age Now Begins: A People's History of the American Revolution ( Volume One )","review":"I'm in the process of reading 1776 by David McCullough and I was reminded of A New Age Now Begins because both authors are really able to bring to life the revolutionary period.For a long time I thought American history was dull and boring until I read A New Age Now Begins. The sweep and detail of this work in truly amazing. What I enjoyed most was the number of resources that Mr. Smith sites. There are diary entries from the very famous to the common soldier. It gives you a full perspective of what was going on and what people were thinking and doing during this very difficult time in our history.I took this book with me when I visited Yorktown with my parents and read out loud the passages dealing with the final days and hours of the siege. Standing in the fields where the action took place and reading Mr. Smith's narrative made me feel like I was actually at the battle.This series brought to life to me the history of America.

The author decribes in detail her life before anti-semitism and how it started to change. Her story is emotional and touching.She was born Celia Landau and changed her name to Lucille. She and her sister Karin were the products of a very close knit family completely torn apart by the Third Reich. Her father gets sent off to a labor camp and a year later they are delivered a box of what supposedly contains his ashes. Eventually Celia, Karin and mother are sent to the Lodz ghetto where surviving is difficult and their mother eventually dies of starvation. Celia's account of this is very sad and moving. She then tells a story of a tender love affair with Szaja in the ghetto, and befriends an elderly couple named Jules and Julius who ironically after liberation, she winds up marrying their son when she moves to New York.She and her sister Karin are then sent to Auschwitz. Poor Karin is so devastated and having trouble surviving day to day after losing both her parents. Celia's heart is again broken when Karin is not chosen in the selection and is loaded up into a truck and never seen again.Celia is only weeks away from death when Auschwitz gets liberated. She goes into detail her life after the camps including her testimony during war crimes trials that helped put many of the SS in prison.She also tells her experiences of going back to Europe in 1991 for the first time since she left. The hostility and indifference against Jews was still alive.This book is highly recommended. Well written."},{"Title":"From Ashes to Life: My Memories of the Holocaust","review":"As a child in Hamburg, Germany, Celia Landau led a cultured and privileged life. Her father Benjamin had a study full of books and frequently entertained renowned visitors, including philosopher Martin Buber and Rabbi Paul Holzer. This began to unravel when the Nazis came to power. In the summer of 1934, the family traveled to a German spa in Bad Schwartau. As their visit ended, the spa's owner gleefully announced that Hitler would deal with the Jews. The next fall, nine-year-old Celia's grades began to falter as former school friends labeled her \\"Drechtjude.\\" In 1937, the family were forced out of their condominium at Hohe Weide 25. In October, 1938, her father was carted to prison, then deported to Dachau. In February 1941, a Gestapo agent delivered his \\"ashes\\" in a cigar box.Eight months later, Celia, now 16, was deported with her mother Sala and sister Karin to Lodz. Here they shared an unheated room on Zgierska Street with Julie and Julius Eichengreen and five others. As the vast majority of Jews were shipped like cattle from Lodz, the couple made Celia promise, if ever she went to New York, to find their son, who had left Europe years earlier. On July 13, 1942, Celia's starving and sick mother Sala died.Before being herself deported to Auschwitz in August 1944, Celia starved and scraped to survive, and lost her sister Karin as well. Her one friend from that period, Elli Sabin, traveled with her in the final transport from Lodz to new horrors. Here she came face to face with the dreaded Dr. Mengele, slaved for some months in an outdoor construction site at the Neuengamme subcamp and in the Blom and Foss Shipyards. In October, she was transferred to Arbeitslager Sasel. Here, to gain access to important files, she promised to transfer her family's house in Altona-Luna Park outside Hamburg to an SS guard. The ploy worked, and she memorized the names and addressed of 42 Nazi guards.In March 1945, Celia Landau was again transferred, this time to Bergen-Belsen, the disease-ridden camp where Anne Frank and her sister died of Typhus. Fortunately for Laudau, a month later, the camp was liberated, on April 15, 1945. Here she told a British major of her exploit, and was swiftly introduced to Lieutenant-Colonel J.H. Tilling, of Britain's War Crimes Investigations unit. When friends Elli, Hela Dimand and Sabina Zarecki corroborated her story, the British swiftly transferred Celia Landau to Hanover Germany, where she helped bring 17 Nazis to justice.Her assistance to the British War Crimes unit gave Celia new opportunities. What she did with them is but one of the things that makes this book fascinating. This is the story of an extraordinary woman who sought revenge only through her own good deeds.The one thing missing from this book is what gave her the courage to go on. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"From Ashes to Life: My Memories of the Holocaust","review":"This is by far the best personalised account of the Holocaust I've read to date. Celia manages to convey the horrors and degredation experienced by the Jewish people living through the Holocaust, and yet still manages to temper the account with a constant almost irrepressible sense of hope.I've visited Bergen-Belsen several times, and seen the official documentation and memorials, but From Ashes to Life really brought it all into perspective.This is a book that provides a factual first hand account of what actually happened, and doesn't pull any punches, but it still emminently readable by everyone.I had real difficulty putting From Ashes to Live down once I'd started it, and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"From Ashes to Life: My Memories of the Holocaust","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down.

Using Elli's idea, we tried to sleep with our heads on the belly of the person behind us. At least the closeness kept us warm. There was nothing left of our personal belongings or of our former selves. I saw myself as an animal and realized that I would probably not leave Auschwitz alive.\\"(p98)- Lucille Eichengreen* * *With her wits, her perseverance, and a great deal of luck, Lucille Eichengreen not only survived Auschwitz, but also Bergen-Belsen, the Lodz ghetto, and several labor camps. In the process she lost her father, her mother, and her young sister. When the war ended she assisted the British authorities by identifying forty members of the SS and others who were subsequently tried and sentenced. She immigrated to the United States and lived a long prosperous life, doing her best to forget the nightmare of her youth. Fifty years later, after returning to the \`scenes of the crimes', she produced this stirring memoire.Once I began reading this book I couldn't put it down. But then I had to ask myself why her story was so attractive. Why would an American like me, who knows precious little about the Holocaust or Judaism for that matter, find her account so riveting? Is is just the horror? Is it the angst and mixed feelings of confronting her former tormentors? Perhaps it is the triumph of her survival and eventual prosperity after the war - a happy ending. These are all the components of a great story made even greater by the fact that they are true. But there is something more - something that weighs heaviest on my mind. It was an observation she made fifty years after the fact:\\"I was shocked and saddened to learn that the Jews of Hamburg were apparently still afraid of anti-Semitic incidents. They were still worried about drawing attention to themselves, still being looked upon as outsiders, still being abused. I had hoped that the lessons of fifty years ago would have brought change. I had expected an open acceptance of Jewish culture and religious practices. Instead, I encountered a double disappointment: many Germans, young as well as old, continued to demonstrate anti-Semitic ugliness. And the even greater disappointment was that the Jews still played by the Germans' rules, sacrificing in the process their dignity and self-respect as human beings.\\"(p197)- Lucille Eichengreen* * *America, and the world, has gone through some tremendous social changes since the terror of the Nazis and the Holocaust. I like to believe that despite all the missteps, we are moving in the right direction. If we are, it will be with the guidance of stories like this one, captured in the memories of people like Lucille Eichengreen.Five stars!"},{"Title":"From Ashes to Life: My Memories of the Holocaust","review":"Cecelia Landau first learned about antisemitism when she was only eight years old. Vacationing with her family, she overheard a man telling her father that Hitler would \\"take care of the Jews.\\" As a young child, she was full of questions, pestering her reluctant father to explain what it all meant.That was 1933. Soon after, the lovely childhood Landau had known began to crumble. Restrictions were placed upon Jews like the Landaus, until it was almost unbearable to function. Of Polish background but living in Germany, the family found that neither country was willing to help or protect them.Before long, Landau's father was taken to Dachau, and she, her mother, and little sister Karen taken to the Lodz ghetto. The teenage Cecelia would be the only one to leave the ghetto alive -- although, considering she was heading for a succession of several concentration camps, whether that was lucky or not remained to be seen.Against all odds, Landau managed to survive the war, working for the British in the aftermath and doing everything she possibly could to get out of Germany.

His stories take us from the Spanish battlefields of the Penninsula campaign, through Russia (and the retreat), the Battle of Waterloo, and a fanciful failed rescue of L'Emporer from St.Helena.THese are stories of dashing doo and have all the Doyle hallmarks of Honor and Gentle-Manliness. One has to keep in mind that these stories were written eighty to one hundred years after the actual battles. Many of the people he wrote about, had been known to people of his parents age. So that Doyle had great insight into how these people thought and acted.The reading (I listed to the tape read by Bolen) of the stories prevents me from commenting on the character of Etienne Gerard. Some of the comments are very drole and may be Doyles way of making the Colonel less conceited that he comes off on tape. As it is, he has little of Flashy's insight into luck and cowardice and is totally consumed by his own abilities (very french indeed). The Flashman suceeds often in spite of himself (and is the first to admit it), Gerard always suceeds because he is the best swordsman, the best horseman, the greatest......(fill in the blank).The stories are worth reading for their marvelous description of the life of the cavalry in the early nineteenth century, and the romanticism of that time at the fin de siecle."},{"Title":"Sip and Solve","review":"These are fun puzzles, but a little too easy.

Techniques that may work well at lower traffic levels can fall apart once the server heats up. Killelea takes a pragmatic approach to performance tuning with an emphasis on actual testing and measurement rather than overplanning, mathematical modeling, and simple yet expensive solutions.While bandwidth is steadily increasing, latency stubbornly refuses to decrease. The speed of light isn't changing anytime soon, so addressing latency, especially on the Web, is a high priority. The other parameters of performance are throughput, utilization, and efficiency.

Lucky for us, Killelea provides free scripts you can use to measure the performance of your web site at his own site patrick dot net.There you'll find scripts you can use on your Unix server to measure, monitor, and debug any performance problems you're having. Killelea also provides a web-based version of his analysis.cgi script that breaks down the components of web site response time into DNS, connect time, server silence (load), transmission (content size), and close time. Type in your URL and up pops a graph of transmission times, broken down into the above components, complete with a bottleneck analysis and some recommendations.Speaking of bottlenecks, when it comes to web performance, smoothing out bottlenecks is the name of the game. If your server is low on memory excessive swapping can occur. If you spawn too many processes without mod_perl on board you've got a problem. Killelea's tools and prose show you where the slowdowns occur, and how to fix them for maximum speed.Everything from low volume sites (1-10,000 hits/day) to high (over 1 million hits/day) can benefit from this in-depth book. Techniques that may work well at lower traffic levels can fall apart once the server heats up. Killelea takes a pragmatic approach to performance tuning with an emphasis on actual testing and measurement rather than overplanning, mathematical modeling, and simple yet expensive solutions.While bandwidth is steadily increasing, latency stubbornly refuses to decrease. The speed of light isn't changing anytime soon, so addressing latency, especially on the Web, is a high priority. The other parameters of performance are throughput, utilization, and efficiency. This book will help you fine tune them all to make your web site sing."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"Published in 1998, this book is one of the best for web performance testing, covering the technical basics for everything you need to know in order to really understand performance tuning. It includes such required information as definitions of various performance metrics, and what those should be in the real world, and moves along through networks, hardware, and operating systems. It goes to great pains to cover a variety of systems, including Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and a variety of web servers.Michael CzeiszpergerWeb Performance, Inc.

As far as addressing specific servers, you're better off getting documentation written for your server. But again, some good general information is here. I specifically found the information on traffic analysis useful. Any software package will pump out numbers, but I wasn't always clear on what they meant in terms of ideal hardware and software performance.The one drawback is that the book was written over two years ago and is in need of an update. CGI and Java are covered, but it's short on performance information for other dynamic content."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"O'Reilly and Patrick Killelea make a great team. Patrick covers tuning from the ground up, both on the browser and on the server. While he is slanted towards Unix (particularly Solaris) the concepts he presents are invaluable on every platform.Shops not familiar with tuning, high availability and load balancing will get a good education very quickly and be well on their way to tweaking server configurations and IP stacks.If there had been a section on advanced concepts (more in-depth on clustering, balancing, etc.) it would have rated 5 stars!A &quot;must-have&quot; reference for even the most seasoned Webmaster."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"Web Performance Tuning is the place to start if you're in charge of a web site's performance. It at least introduces all of the issues you are likely to run into. It could be improved by more detailed information on one particular web server, say Apache, and more information on assuring reliability, but as a place to start in improving web site performance, it's the best book out there."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I haven't finished it yet, but it's very interesting, complete approach, methodological and comprehensive.

In conclusion JUST BUY THE STUPID BOOK!"},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"Pragmatic and opinionated in the best of old-time O'Reilly style, this book is a colorful guided tour by an old-hand.The thing is, if you need this book, your website is probably a high-traffic professional/commercial site. And in these days this means (1) dynamic content, (2) database, (3) a content-management/templating system, (4) user identity tracking. Perhaps even interface to legacy client/server systems. Unfortunately, this book goes only as far as CGI, Java, and general DB issues. Messaging middleware is briefly considered. Distributed OO (CORBA, EJB) is discussed and dismissed (a luxury in real world). No coverage of other popular dynamic web technologies (e.g. ASP, ColdFusion) or content-management systems. In particular, a serious discussion of trade-offs between performance and content/workflow manageability would ground the whole discussion in real life.And the architecture chapter, while very insightful, is simply too thin. After all it is much better and easier to plan for performance from the start, then to try tweaking an existing system. The chapter discusses architectures of varying complexity - &lt;i>without including a single diagram!&lt;/i> Complete case studies along the line of the mod_perl white paper .... would be invaluable - perhaps broken down by type (e.g. news/portal/B2C) where unique usage patterns will drive unique architecture and optimization.Despite the tilt towards monitoring and diagnosis, this is still a very valuable book in an under-served but important area. Generous references enable the reader to explore individual topics further."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"&quot;Web Performance Tuning&quot; delivers a comprehensive overview of the factors that affect Web performance and what you can do about them. While the book presents a few tips for faster browsing, the majority of the text is devoted to Web server tuning. The explanations are clear and informative, and will let Webmasters get to work right away, assuming, unfortunately, that their servers are running either Solaris or Linux. The author provides virtually no specific coverage of other UNIXes, or of Windows NT or Mac OS server platforms; Microsoft IIS is discussed only once in the entire 350-page book. While the book's general concepts and explanations will be useful to most Webmasters, many of the specific details the author presents do not translate well to non-UNIX platforms.The book's first section, Preliminary Considerations, is an outstanding analysis of the relationships between bandwidth, latency, server memory, CPU speed, traffic levels, user expectations and cost. Along the way, the author highlights the extreme gap between real-world performance requirements and the artificial numbers generated by benchmark tools. He notes that a full T1 line can only carry 33 hits per second (at 4K each), and that a million hits per day translates into a peak server load of only about 25-30 hits per second. These real-world numbers are then contrasted with the hundreds or thousands of hits per second usually quoted by vendors, which the author refers to as &quot;benchmarketing.&quot; Refreshingly, the author then describes how to create practical benchmark scenarios for your own Web servers, and how to use them effectively.The second section, Tuning In Depth, briefly discusses Web client tuning, and then addresses the details of network, Web server, and CGI tuning. The author explains each issue, makes specific recommendations, and supports them with relevant facts and calculations. Each chapter ends with a concise &quot;key recommendations&quot; section, which condenses the chapter into a few memorable one-liners - a great feature for the busy Webmaster. The recommendations run from very general guidelines to very specific suggestions, such as &quot;Use separate disks for log writing and content reading.&quot; While some of the discussion applies only to UNIX servers, most of the recommendations apply equally well to other platforms.Finally, the book includes Appendixes with specific tuning tips for Netscape Enterprise Server, Apache, and Solaris' 2.x TCP/IP Stack. Although much of the same material is available on the Web (with updates), the printed reference and the author's comments are valuable resources to have handy if you use these products.This book should be considered required reading for all present and future Webmasters; it is the most clear and direct discussion of real-world Web server performance published to date. However, this book's UNIX-centric view skips over some important issues facing today's Webmasters, such as Web database performance and the tuning of non-UNIX Web servers. The book does not mention FileMaker or Access, or middleware products like Tango, Lasso, or Cold Fusion. And while the tuning guidelines will be helpful to most Webmasters, the book does not provide any specifics for optimizing Microsoft IIS or WebSTAR. It is a bit surprising to see all of these popular packages omitted from this very recent book. Ultimately though, every Webmaster who reads this book will learn new ways to improve server performance and many of them will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book is both a great reference and superb introductory guide to the essentials of tuning a web site. All the elements are covered, with chapters on client hardware, network protocols, and server software to name a few. How each element affects performance is discussed along with a description of tools to monitor and tune performance. The chapter on content should be required reading for anyone putting together HTML pages no matter how large their site. The prose is readable and each chapter is nicely summarized with several concise &quot;Key Recommendations&quot;. Unless you are building your own web site from scratch, you won't have to know everything in this book, but you may want to anyway, if for no other reason than to know who to blame when your web site is not performing well.As the web is changing every day some of the information is dated, especially the chapters on running server side applications. The chapter on CGI is decent, but the chapters on database and Java tuning are cursory and best covered by books dedicated to those subjects. There is nothing on active server pages. Also a chapter on balancing security versus performance would have been welcome, and hopefully will be included in a second edition.There is definitely more about UNIX than NT in the book. This doesn't matter when doing hardware and network tuning and Microsoft certainly does not help with their license restriction on the publication of IIS benchmarks. The reality is that there are more web servers running UNIX or Linux variants than NT. However, with the rapid proliferation of active server pages more should be included on NT in a future edition.Getting usable information on performance tuning is sometimes very difficult. Such information is usually gleaned sparingly from Usenet groups or expensively from consultants. &quot;Web Performance Tuning&quot; is a solid guide with a lot of information condensed and indexed that would be difficult to find elsewhere. It is definitely remaining on the easy to reach side of my bookcase."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"In general a very good high level look at web server tuning as well as network tuning. We haven't had any good references on this until now.The book isn't particularly UNIX centric, just slanted towards higher performance servers running on high availabilty UNIX platforms. NT still doesn't fit the bill and the author isn't afraid to state it. It might have been nice if the author had gone into more depth on clustering, but just the sections on specific tuning for CGI and Java make this book worth the purchase price. Especially nice is the author's stress on portable solutions over proprietary lock in solutions. Since the technology in the web arena is likely to change radically in just the next few years it hardly makes sense sacrifice portability for a slight speed increase."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"In response to the review below stating that the book was too Unix-centric, you have to understand that O\`Reilly is a publisher that specializes in Unix, Linux, and open-source.

The numbers also seem out of date for a book published in Oct 98 (100Mhz PC processors being top of the line in this book)Not much material here on optimizing NT or NT hardware, which would be nice.If you've never optimized a system, the info here might be useful, otherwise most of it isn't new."},{"Title":"Web Performance Tuning: Speeding Up the Web (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This is one book with wide appeal because it is useful to anyone that uses the Internet; so if you are reading this review - chances are very good that you will find this book of some use. The subtitle sums up the book very nicely... it is full of tips to help you speed up the web, regardless of how you usually go about using it.I've had the pleasure of owning both copies of Web Performance Tuning and I must say the second edition was quite a dramatic rewrite, adding over 100 pages of new and updated information - it was about time for an update considering the age of the book.Of course, if you are both a web user and a web developer you will derive the most benefit as pretty much everything in the book will apply to you to some degree. Part I focuses on detailing the problems that can occur, and only the first chapter has any useful information for anyone who is simply the web visitor. But if you've got any interest in knowing about server and connection failures and monitoring web performance then it would be worth taking a look at.Part II of Web Performance Tuning actually looks at how you can improve your web experience; starting from the browser and working all the way through to the technologies that power the web. This makes it easy to follow as well as to help identify exactly where any major problems you may be experiencing are caused.For those wanting quick answers to their browsing or server problems, then you will find help in the form of questions you might want to ask yourself right at the start of the book.

It was well worth the trouble, and the postage costs of having it sent across to the UK.There's a matchmaking mama; but she's the hero's mother. There's a debutante, but no ordinary simpering miss. And there's a hero, but no stiff aristocrat. Instead, when the hero first meets the heroine, he insists that he has no intention of standing on ceremony with her; they treat each other very informally and he encourages her to behave in a very unladylike manner on occasion. Which is fine... until the house party starts. Suddenly they have to behave very properly with each other, there is no further opportunity for private conversation, and its all downhill for their relationship from there. Here's where the angst sets in.And it's very well written; we feel for both characters through the trauma of misunderstanding - and even more so when the private dinner which was supposed to resolve it all goes horribly wrong!A great book; shame Joy Freemen hasn't written many since."},{"Title":"Suitable Match: Nove of Regency England","review":"I just finished rereading Joy Freemen's A Suitable Match 15 years after the first time I read it. I worried that it wouldn't stand up to my memories. Some books I once loved don't do so well the second time around, as I have more and more titles with which to compare them, but happily this wasn't one of them. The Earl of Sherworth, in his mid-twenties and happy in his bachelor life, goes to aid in planning and hosting a party for his beloved stepmother's granddaughter, who, through various cirumstances, he hasn't met before. Knowing he won't go if he suspects her matchmaking designs for the two of them, his stepmother leads him to believe that Vescinda is staying out at her father's estate out of misguided love for her cousin Freddy, who the earl knows is not,as Bescinda hopes, working hard to complete his education at Oxford before settling down on the estate, which Vescinda is overseeing in the meantime, because her widowed father is too busy living wildly to manage it. After a rough start, and despite the efforts of a beautiful neighbor who believes herself irresistible to the earl--which she definitely is not--Sherworth and the formerly perfectly dignified Vescinda become comfortable friends and enjoy informal good times, including horseback outings and a private, starlit waltz, until a crowd of guests for the house party arrive. Each doesn't want to share the other's company but can't find enough privacy to talk things out, until Sherworth goes to some trouble to find an unusual private setting to declare himself. All would go well if not for a bit of interference and misunderstanding. Now normally I don't like books with big misunderstandings, but Freemen uses such creativity to form a believable misunderstanding that I didn't find it utterly stupid, as most big misunderstandings are. Fortunately the hero's tenacity, his stepmother's firm advice and concern for both parties, and the heroine's heart and sense of humor all lead eventually to a happy resolution.The other thing I enjoyed about rereading this book was seeing, as I didn't the first time around, the secondary romance develop between an older couple of major supporting characters. Their engagement caught me by surprise the first time I read A Suitable Match, but this time I saw the steps up to it.As one of the other reviewers said, this book combines humor and angst. The opening chapters took me some days to read, but the second half I devoured in less than a day, eager for the happy ending, which combined humor and embraces, and I wasn't disappointed. If you want a romance that is neither explicitly sexual nor insipid, with a vivid setting that plays a definite role in shaping events in the story (I've always remembered the special seaside pier in this book, with its unique qualities), try this one. I wish she'd published more books, but I've heard of only one other, I think called The Last Frost Fair, which, unfortunately, has never come my way. If it did, though, I'd read it on the strength of having enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Suitable Match: Nove of Regency England","review":"Vescinda Bancroft has been brought up to be and behave at all times as a lady. The Earl of Sherworth is an unconventional man of great passion, susceptible to bursts of anger. He disdains the dull pretense of prospective brides. When the two are thrown together in an attempt at matchmaking, they develop a rappour as friends and a passionate love for each other. Vescinda considers him like a \\"wild stallion\\" -- admirable for his strength and passion, but capable of using that strength to wound. He, in turn, has difficulty trusting women, and believing that Vescinda does not care for him, hurts her deeply. She decides that a marriage with no love is better than marriage to a man who will take her heart and break it. Sherworth cannot let her go -- will, in fact, do anything to keep her from going to someone else."},{"Title":"Lord Calthorpe's Promise (Historical Romance)","review":"From the back cover:Forced marriageLord Adam Calthorpe had been rash to promise to look out for a fellow soldier's sister when he was killed at the battle ofWaterloo.

Notation used for equations of motion and stability derivatives is non-standard. There is little in the way of solved examplesthat can illustrate the basic principles to a student. A reader easily gets lost in the myriad of confusing mathematical details, without grasping the physical fundamentals. Not a very useful textbook in an introductory course on flight dynamics and controls."},{"Title":"Airplane Flight Dynamics and Automatic Flight Controls","review":"Dr. Jan Roskam is a genius. He is an incredible airplane designer. Have you seen the Piaggio P-180? It's a beauty! His book is very useful if he is your teacher, but other than that it's very complex. That's probably just due to the high standards that he holds for everything. Never did I know there was so much to trim diagrams. I'm still kinda lost on them though."},{"Title":"Airplane Flight Dynamics and Automatic Flight Controls","review":"This book appears to have been hastily put together from sketchy classnotes. As one of the previous reviewers pointed out, I'm sure this will prove to be an immensely useful book if you also happen to be fortunate enough to be taking Dr. Roskam's course.The book does address some very important topics in aerodynamics and aircraft control theory. Unfortunately many key aspects are glossed over and the text is full of redundancies - for example, the definition of the aerodynamic center occurs at least 3 times. The same typographic font is used for both the equations and accompanying text, making the textbook very difficult to read.None of this should detract from the fact that Dr. Roskam is undoubtedly a pioneering educator in the field of modern aerodynamics and aircraft control. I sincerely hope that some of his current or former graduate students will assist him in putting forth a more comprehensible edition of this important textbook."},{"Title":"Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP (Expert's Voice)","review":"I had been hoping that someone would come out with a good book on NTP, so when I saw Apress had such an offering, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on a copy. And while having read the book I came away with a better understanding of the protocol itself, I wish the book had done better at covering the implementations of the protocol. Plenty of \\"what\\", but not enough \\"how.\\"The book is divided into two parts. The first part is short (about 40 pages) and presents Sam, a being who dwells in the center of the Sun and is impervious to the effects of time. Sam takes us on a tour of the various ways in which humans have attempted to make sense of time through scientific means such as classical mechanics, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, and superstring theory. Sam also muses on philosophical approaches to time, and the advances of time-keeping through human history.This first section is thought-provoking and enjoyable to read. Thinking about how NTP implementations on intergalactic networks of the future will have to take into effect things like time-dilation affecting starships travelling at near light-speed to synchronize clocks throughout the network is a good stretch of the mind, for example. From a stylistic point of view, however, that enjoyment is dampened by the frequent shifting of tense between past and present in the section, which is distracting. Perhaps such can be explained away as the character Sam isn't constrained by such concepts of past, present, and future, but for those of us mortals who are under such constraints, the frequent shifting between tenses calls for better editing.The second section of the book consists of 3 chapters. The first offers a general description of the Network Time Protocol itself, describes the various packets that are transmitted in the protocol, and covers the historical development of the protocol. The next chapter covers NTP architecture including the various modes in which NTP can operate, security issues surrounding NTP implementations and a discussion of different NTP time sources. The final chapter of the book covers different deployment topologies and scenarios, and gives examples of NTP configurations on 3 common platforms, UNIX/Linux, Juniper's JUNOS, and Cisco's IOS.The first 2 chapters of the second part of the book are very good, and are useful for anyone trying to better understand the NTP protocol itself, and the various issues related to deploying NTP on networks of any size. The \\"theory\\" and fundamentals are well covered here. Unfortunately, the final chapter of the book leaves something to be desired. I would like to see a more thorough discussion of various configuration scenarios, with a lot more examples than were given. Instead only a few examples are given for each of the 3 platforms, and the surrounding discussion is rather shallow.To be fair, the author explains the situation in the following words at the end of the book:\\"This book could have been larger! It could have catalogued every NTP implementation on every conceivable networking device and operating system since the protocol's inception. But ironically, in that case the effort would have suffered the ravages of time and never reached the printed page. Thus, what's behind you represents a compromise that time forces all writers to make.\\"While I agree that to exhaustively catalog every NTP implementation in existence would be fruitless, I really think the author and editors could have done a better job than the handful of pages devoted to configuration on the 3 platforms (UNIX/Linux, Cisco, Juniper). I think a chapter dedicated to each of the 3 platforms offering some deeper discussion and more examples of different types of configurations would be ideal.As a final note, I wish the various algorithms used by NTP to do the actual time synchronization were given more attention. Perhaps the algorithms used aren't specified in the RFCs, but it would be nice to see a few examples of what algorithms are commonly used.Overall the book is good. If you're thinking of deploying NTP in your network you'll find plenty of helpful information here and plenty of good reasons for doing so as well. But if you're looking for specific examples of how to configure, say, ntpd on a Linux machine, you might want to look elsewhere also."},{"Title":"Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP (Expert's Voice)","review":"The great thing about Rybaczyk's book is that it brings together in one volume information about the many aspects of NTP that's only available in fragmentary and diluted form from white papers, trade magazine articles, product manuals, web site postings, or on a few pages of networking books that are dedicated to numerous other topics and treat NTP as a sideshow. This book makes a great addition to any network administrator's library, especially given the growing need for synchronized and accurate time keeping on networks that continue to grow in importance and complexity. The first two chapters of the book spur one's creative thinking and give the reader pause for some reflection and laughter before getting into the nuts and bolts of NTP."},{"Title":"Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP (Expert's Voice)","review":"If you review the thousands of Internet RFCs, you'd be hard pressed to find a protocol that lends itself to philosophical overtones, save for one -- the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The nature of time is abstract, difficult to measure and highly subjective. Yet time is a critical element in everyone's life, and in the effective operations of corporate networks.\\"NTP is built on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite and is used to ensure accurate time-keeping with a trusted time reference. These references can be radio signals, GPS satellites, atomic clocks, Internet-based time servers and more. NTP is powerful enough to synchronize network clocks with millisecond accuracy.In Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP, Peter Rybaczyk merges the philosophical aspects of time with the nuts of bolts of the NTP protocol. The book is composed of two parts, the first concerned with the meta-philosophy of time, and the second detailing the inner workings of NTP. The attempt in part one to merge technology and science with philosophy is a daunting task, and most often does not succeed. The notable exception to this is Douglas Hofstadter's G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.Rybaczyk creates Sam, a fictional character who walks through the history of time. It is unclear who this Sam is -- whether he is supernatural being, or someone who got root on a time server. The author writes that the transcendental nature of time and the nuts and bolts of NTP are inseparable, but I personally found it difficult to determine what message part one was meant to convey. Fortunately, part one takes up but the first 34 pages.Where the book shines, and where most readers will find value, is in part two, which details how to effectively design, configure, deploy and operate NTP. Where part one is conceptual, part two is extremely practical. Chapter 3 opens up with a comprehensive overview of the what, how and why effective time-keeping via NTP is needed.The book details from a business perspective why synchronized and accurate time is a universal need. From transactional integrity, airline departures, sporting events, job shift changes, to FedEx pickups and more, nearly every activity requires time synchronization to work at peak levels. Effective network administration also requires time synchronization for network login procedures, directory synchronization, backups, and routing stability to work accurately.From an information security perspective, password and digital ID synchronization, log file accuracy and auditing, and access control security are just a few of the areas where correct time can mean the difference between success and failure.Where time synchronization is crucial, though, is in the realm of digital forensics. An otherwise painstaking digital forensic process might be worthless if time-related evidence from network devices is not correctly synchronized. If network devices are not correctly synchronized, you can basically forget about using them in any type of legal case.Attorney Ronald Coleman, partner and computer law litigator at the New Jersey-based Coleman Law firm explains that in a computer law case involving serious discrepancies in network log times, the prosecution would conceivably drop the case. Similarly, a civil case to recover damages from an attacker is seriously undercut by these seemingly innocuous timing mistakes. \\"The network managers' lack of diligence at ensuring that the time was synchronized on their systems,\\" explains Coleman, \\"opens them up to serious questions in front of a jury as to whether the logs and the system data are reliable at all -- especially with a gap of more than a couple of minutes, which might be explained away by which clocks were being relied on.\\" In fact, an error of this magnitude would make the entire network administration suspect. That could be a disaster, Coleman says, where the network tracing record plus the human beings who sloppily set the automation in motion are going to be the chief sources of evidence against the alleged computer criminal. \\"A snafu such as seriously unsynchronized logs is just the sort of opening that could raise the level of doubt needed to undermine the other side's case.\\"Chapter 3 concludes with an interesting look at the cutting edge of time protocols, specifically the Interplanetary Internet. The Interplanetary Internet project is an attempt to synchronize computer time within the realm of deep space. NASA will in due time establish a deep space infrastructure whose purpose is to support the communication needs of multiple missions. Such an infrastructure would require time synchronization, but within a radically different framework from what exists today. The Interplanetary Internet and its underlying time synchronization are intended to solve that.Chapter 4 brings the reader back to earth and provides vital information about how to design an effective NTP architecture. The key to designing the most appropriate NTP architecture for a given infrastructure is to first understand the different modes that NTP devices can operate in. The chapter details the five different NTP modes, the mode categories, and gives configuration information about each mode.The chapter also provides information about NTP security. While NTP versions 3 and 4 provide added security (including symmetric private key cryptography and support of the Autokey protocol), it is ultimately up to the organization to determine what level of NTP security they need. Those organizations that don't require accurate time won't need much NTP security. But for those organizations who business requires synchronized and accurate time, such issues will drive the implementation of how they deploy NTP and its security functionality.Chapter 5 details how organizational motivations (again, from a business perspective) will affect how you design your NTP architecture, and then describes several use scenarios. The book notes that designing an effective NTP deployment is a process that embodies four key steps: choosing a time source, deciding upon the NTP topology, determining the NTP features to configure, and then monitoring and managing the NTP operations. The chapter then goes on to describe various ways these steps can be carried out. The chapter provides a comprehensive overview on how to deploy NTP, be it on a dedicated time server, via already deployed products such as Cisco or Juniper routers, or on Unix/Linux/Windows file servers.It is important to note that NTP is just the protocol. The actual implementation of NTP requires separate software client and server applications. The book focuses on the protocol and does not get into any specific vendors, other than a few screen shots from the configuration menu of a Symmetricom time server.The author notes that on the surface, NTP is simple and almost inconspicuous, and overshadowed by better-known protocols such as HTTP, FTP and DNS. But once you start digging into NTP, you are dealing with one of the most pervasive elements of existence, namely time. Within NTP's scope, one could be dealing with atomic clocks, GPS satellites, clock selection, encryption algorithms and much more. So while at its heart, NTP may be a simple protocol, there is a complex infrastructure beneath it.NTP is one of the most fundamental, yet overlooked services in the TCP/IP suite, and time synchronization is one of the most overlooked areas in networking. Hopefully, a book such as this can spark a renaissance. For far too long, time synchronization has not been afforded due diligence, and the effects have at times been disastrous. A view of the archives of the Risk Forum digest attests to this fact.After a somewhat murky start in part one, Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP provides the reader with a superb synopsis of nearly everything he needs to know about NTP and effective time synchronization on his network, from an experienced implementer in the field. It is a fascinating look at one of the most humble, yet fundamental protocols on the Internet. For those who care about the correct time on their network, this book is required reading."},{"Title":"Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP (Expert's Voice)","review":"I once heard a Buddhist master, speaking of the nature of maya declare, \\"Time is not; space is not.\\" But when I have to catch a bus, I find myself much less interesrted in philosophy than in being at the bus stop at the same illusory time as the bus.Now, if you think that concept is a bit too commonplace to be worth mentioning, consider the consequences when said bus is carrying \\"passengers\\" traveling at the speed of light, such as the electronic denizens of our computers.As Elvis would put it, \\"There's a whole lot a shakin' goin' on in there.\\" And for a guy like me, whose tolerance for complexity doesn't extend beyond rebuilding a 1960 Chevy standard tranny, I think stuff like Network Time Protocol is a Godsend. Keeping track of differences in clock precision, different operation modes--server, client, host and peer, symmetric active, symmetric passive, broadcast, multicast, manycast/anycast, and a veritable multitude of variables determining the success or failure of the transmission and reception of a simple message could definitely affect your ability to get a good night's sleep. Praise NTP.But that's just the beginning. As Rybaczyk points out, there is more to this univese than us poor Horatios ever dreamt of in our philosophy. If we are ever to succeed in deep space travel, for instance, we will have a lot more than wristwatch consulting to keep us busy as we attempt to coordinate extraterrestrial events. Rybaczyk even joins forces with Pandora as he forces us to peer into the black box of life at the quantum level. \\"Different strokes for different folks,\\" they say. Well, how does one know when the stroke of, say 9 pm, occurs when the operational time frame is in billionths of a second and even the concept of a \\"second\\" is relative conjecture?Personally, I am content with \\"Que sera sera\\" and enjoying the modulating frequencies of a setting sun. But some of our species seems bent on other schemes. They would do well to study Rybaczyk's very first chapter, \\"Multiple Views of Time,\\" before burying themselves in untimely assumptions. Sam, Rybaczyk's protagonist, adroitly navigates the temporal stream, punctuating the story liberally with asides--humorous, informative, dramatic, zealous, some even a bit caustic--only to finally arrive at the conclusion that NTP lies at the heart of a possible future (silly concept) in which memory is shorn of its mystery, time is transcended, and the past, present and future are found to be mere figments of minds mired in mythical maya, mostly oblivious to Shakespeare's observation, \\"we are such stuff as dreams are made on.\\"Get Rybaczyk's book. Even if you have no professional interest in computing, read the first three chapters. Partake of the author's fantastic ability to draw analogies between everyday and historical events and the inner workings of the computers we have become so dependent upon.

It's no substitute for the reference documentation that comes with NTP software, but it does give a reasonable overview--the sort of thing that could be easily conveyed in a ten-page white paper, not a whole book.However, if you want a robust explanation of what NTP does to handle errors, clock drift, and communication problems, this isn't it. There are a few packet dumps, but the explanation doesn't say much about what the packets mean, and doesn't begin to touch on how the protocol actually works.I fund no outright errors in the book, just an extraordinary percentage of fluff.

In chapters 3 through 5, Rybaczyk covers the NTP topic in a well-rounded manner: from the design-related issues on complex networks that support mission-critical and real-time processes, to NTP configuration and maintenance. When coupled with a succinct and well-researched scan of multiple views of time (Chapter 1), and some dry humor related to the history of network administration (Chapter 2), this publication is a refreshing reading for a net admin pro and layman alike, especially those interested in the subject of time.

Under that assumption I was totally disappointed. The interesting/important/useful information from this book will fit on ten pages, all the rest is just padding. May be the title is wrong and should be NTP for dummies.You will learn much more if you read the David Mills page at www.ntp.org. even if you have to skip some parts because of complexity.Here are some of my objections:NTP deals with some important mathematical concepts that are key to understand the protocol. There is not a single explanation and just short definitions of key parameters/variables like root delay, root dispersion. Not even the explanation on how \\"reach\\" values are interpreted. You can do better with the \\"man\\" page of xntpd. Many readers avoid books than contain math and I understand authors avoiding math to please them, but on this subject if you really want to understand you need to use some math.The applications for NTP described on the book where the ones used ten years ago, but now the bar is much higher and for example the current interest is to see if NTP can help to conserve bandwidth in streaming audio and video applications by enabling intermediate routers to discard packages to old to be useful in decompressing the stream. Also VoIP conferencing applications may need precise NTP and this is not even mentioned on the book.There are more than 20 entries on the bibliography, and all of them for the first two chapters, the non-technical ones, and then there is not a single entry for the rest of the book.All the detailed, if you can call them that, examples are for cisco routers, no unix/linux,windows etc. Also the troubleshooting examples assume that you know the server is wrong, in fact is not a few seconds off, 10 years off. A real expert needs to deal when the servers are just a few seconds off (or less than that) and needs to determine which one(s) are wrong.In summary this book has some value as an introductory book, but the word \\"expert\\" on the title, the user level rating on the back cover \\"intermediate-advanced\\" and the other reviews on this site where misleading.

Lappen"},{"Title":"Operation Sea Lion","review":"Ian Fleming's brother Peter wrote this charming account of German amphibious invasion plans after Dunkirk, and Britain's plans to repel any invasion they might try. Fleming was peripherally involved in these plans, having been assigned during the dangerous post-Dunkirk period to preparing to wage guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines if the Boche took the beaches and moved inland, but this book is not a personal account but a broad history of the political, military, and psychological factors that went into invasion preparations on both sides, and the final German decision to back off.Contrary to other reviews, this is not a book about the Battle of Britain. In Fleming's chapter on the Battle of Britain, he notes that the subject is covered extensively elsewhere and he only gives it attention as it relates to the Germans' plans for what they'd do after they won that battle, and on why they decided not to invade. It's more about what might have happened than about what did happen.Fleming's favorite themes are the indomitability of the English mood at the time (which he amusedly puts down as much to cultural momentum as to courage) and Hitler's fatal misjudgment of it. He makes a convincing case that Hitler put off invading because he thought, wildly incorrectly, that the British were terrified and on the verge of making terms. He also persuasively posits that it was ironically good for the Reich that Hitler hesitated to implement Operation Sea Lion, because the invasion plan was doomed to fail. But Fleming's theses aside, this book is best read for his evocative and witty description of Britain's national mood between Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain -- a mood he underlines with illustrations drawn from the cartoons in contemporary Punch magazines. You can't help but respect the British and envy their courage after reading this entertaining book."},{"Title":"Operation Sea Lion","review":"If author Peter Fleming's commas were thorns, if his footnotes were barbed wire, and if his frequent obscure foreign phrases and literary allusions were broken glass, many a reader of \\"Operation Sea Lion\\" would be bleeding to death after the first twenty pages and retreating for good. (See other amazon reviews.)Somehow, Fleming needed three or four chapters to warm up before making his main thesis clear. It is that:(1) German plans in 1940 to invade Britain after the fall of France were uncharacteristically sloppy and uncoordinated.(2) Only Admiral Raeder, the head of the German navy, realized the incredible complexity of a huge cross-channel operation, and Germany's inability to carry it off with the limited resources he commanded. Raeder never quite told the Fuehrer.(3) Hitler, himself the chief proponent of invasion planning, vacillated repeatedly between believing in an outright invasion, on the one hand, or expecting Britain's impending political capitulation, on the other.(4) Germany's attacks on RAF installations and aircraft factories had Britain on the ropes by September of 1940, but, out of pique at the RAF's bombing of Berlin, it threw the Luftwaffe instead against metropolitain London, where they were more vulnerable to ground and air attacks and imposed far less military damage to the British war machine.(5) By 1941, the invasion was a chimera. The Luftwaffe was weakened, and Hitler's head had been turned by the prospect of taking the Soviet Union.Fleming takes far too long to get his story out. He wastes a lot of time describing (poorly and incompletely) British efforts to defend itself against invasion, and tells the German view of the story in a jumbled chronology, sometimes leading the reader to wonder what in the world was going on. Just in time, though, his choppy writing style finally improves (though he's still far to enamoured of footnotes for my taste).Before you buy this one, I'd do some more research, in amazon or elsewhere. The topic's important and instructive enough to warrant your time. It's dead certain that later books on Sea Lion had better access to archives and eyewitness than did Fleming, and will tell the tale more coherently."},{"Title":"Operation Sea Lion","review":"So much of what happened - for good or evil - during World War II in the West occurred because of what was in Hitler's mind. This overarching determinant of events is clearly seen in his thinking about invading the British Isles following the fall of France in 1940. In Hitler's strategic thinking, as Fleming notes, he \\"neither needed, nor wanted to conquer England\\" but \\"he wanted to eliminate her as an opponent.\\" Part of the reason Hitler failed to accomplish either purpose was due, of course, to the steadfastness of the British government headed by Winston Churchill and King George VI (Fleming is quite fulsome in his praise of the monarch during this period) and its people.But an even larger part was due to Hitler's ambivalence and strategic mistakes - lunging into Norway at a cost of 3 cruisers, 10 destroyers and 8 submarines and allowing the British to evacuate both Norway and Dunkirk. To this end, the author does a very good job of exploring \\"the twin mirages in Hitler's mind\\" - that the British would simply \\"capitulate\\" rather than fight on; and that in any case, its fighting capacity would \\"disintegrate.\\" Hitler believed \\"The British should have sued for peace but they did not\\" and that seems to have come as a great surprise to the Fuhrer.German intelligence, Fleming notes, was strewn with \\"errors and naiveties\\" but the British matched them with so many \\"flimsy or obsolete makeshifts\\" that it was good that the Germans never came ashore and put everything to the test. At the same time, their abortive plans to land 9 divisions on British soil during the first wave on S-Tag seems simplistically optimistic, even within the context of British weakness on land.The \\"protracted anti-climax\\" following the aerial Battle of Britain meant that the British had won and Hitler would call off Operation Sea Lion and move on to the even more grandiose invasion of the Soviet Union. There would be no German invasion of the British Isles, but as Hitler feared in his \\"Inselwahn\\" (or \\"island madness\\"), there would subsequently be an Allied invasion of the Continent.As this book makes clear, the summer of 1940 was truly a hinge of history."},{"Title":"Operation Sea Lion","review":"The true story of the Battle of Britain.

Hitler's half-hearted attempt at an invasion was bungled from the start. He didn't count on Britain being prepared.

Buildings are everywhere, and most everyone uses buildings of various kinds for various purposes. Yet how a building works is often a mystery. In this way, I think buildings are much like computers; most people who use them have no clue about the inner workings of them.Edward Allen takes us through the functions of a building without going into traditional architectural theory. This book is more concerned with the needs that buildings must fulfill, and how we can fulfull them. He discusses water, waste, heat, ventilation, lighting, accoustics, energy, structure, and more, first by explaining each particular concept, and then by examining how problems can be solved with the knowledge of those concepts.While this isn't a book on theory, neither is it a wholly practical book. That is, it won't equip you with the skills to go and build a house. But it will open your eyes to the various elements of buildings and building construction and you may think \\"Aha!\\" the next time you look at a building and observe a strange structural or design detail.

One does not need a technical background to get a lot out of the book. Edward Allen's skillful line illustrations also add a great deal. If I could not understand the technical description, the simple illustration helped me with the underlying principle.To give you an example of why this book is helpful to a non-specialist.

There are so many badly written, stuffy, elitist, and meaningless tomes on architecture, that this book stands almost alone. If you had to read only one book on architecture your whole life, then this is it. If you had to read two, then include &quot;How Buildings Learn&quot; by Stewart Brand."},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"I bought this book in the hope that it will be talking about Heating/Cooling, Lighting/Acoustics in some detail and touch upon other topics as well. The book however was disappointing because it covered too many topics without getting into significant depth for any of them. After reading the book, one can only be satisfied enough as after reading a magazine or sketchbook on the mechanics of architecture.Another point of contention is that the material presented is rather dated and the contemporary reader would want to know more about some of the issues that are becoming increasingly relevant for architecture today, like sustainability and resource consumption/climate change. Even the issues presented here have seen a lot more development and upgrades than are introduced to the reader.This review however should not discourage people who are interested in the practice of architecture and want to know more about the discipline. The sketches and diagrams are beautiful and the book would be a great resource for readers in high school who would like to know more about architecture before taking it up as a career choice. It would also be beneficial to students in the first semester in undergraduate architectural education who need to be introduced to the various aspects involved in putting together a building. But not beyond. There are other, so much better books out there for gaining knowledge about things in a contemporary setting. A highly recommended book is:Heating, Cooling, Lighting: Sustainable Design Methods for Architects. Apart from that, the bible of course is:Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings, 10th Edition. This one can get really technical at times though.So, consider your own expertise level and how much you want to know about buildings before ordering this one!"},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"A practical overview of the natural order of architecture. Explains what building do (i.e. Effects of outdoor environment, human environment and the concept of shelter). Explains how a building works (i.e. Various practical functions, providing water, removing wastes, thermal comfort, HVAC, acoustics, form, structural support, fire control, building expansion, etc.).This book sticks to the basics of what a building is all about. This is not a book about design princples and concepts (old or modern); the book stresses the practical nature of building construction/design and the interface with human beings and the environment.Excellent book for students, architecture professors, practicing architects, builders and people just wanting to know more about the principles of architecture."},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"Edward Allen presents a way of looking at systems and objects that should be valuable to designers in many disciplines. I bought this book AFTER I finished reading a copy from the library. I needed it in my personal library, next to Christopher Alexander's &quot;The Timeless Way of Building,&quot; Edward Tufte's &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,&quot; and Louis Rosenfeld's and Peter Morville's &quot;Information Architecture.&quot;"},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"The underlying premise of this book is that architecture is an imitation and application of the principles of nature. To build is not merely to impose our will on nature. It is to cooperate with nature.Shelter is a natural human need. Building is the art of meeting that need. It does so, according to Allen, by following the example of nature herself and applying her principles. An organic analogy runs through the book. Buildings live and breathe. A building, like a human body, is matter so arranged that it interacts dynamically with its environment and thus perpetuates the arrangement. Buildings, however, are highly dependent on human beings, whom they serve. The parts of buildings, e.g., the roofs, walls, windows and mechanical systems must work together with the other parts in such a way as to \\"survive\\" but most importantly to provide optimal human shelter. Buildings that outlive their usefulness \\"die.\\"My favorite passage from the book is a section entitled \\"People as the Measure\\" (pp. 169-171). Drawing on his extensive knowledge of the history of architecture, Allen explains how \\"people literally became the measure of buildings.\\" For example, the brick... was standardized in medieval times within a range of sizes and weights that could be easily manipulated by the left hand of the mason, leaving the right hand free to operate the trowel.\\" Allen cautions against bulk materials manipulated by machines instead of people: \\"[T]he finished product will not automatically display the human-scale texture that hand-sized components have and that occupants often subconsciously identify with.\\"This book was very educational for me, a Ph.D. in philosophy who has left academia to help run a construction business. I highly recommend it to new students of architecture or engineering or anyone who has amateur interest in those fields."},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"This is a book on how buildings are designed. It's not a book on how to design a building, that's the architect's job. It's a book on what the architect is going to do to design the building you want.The book contains hundreds of line drawings on the components of a building. This is how a wall is built, this is how heat circles around a room, this is how a truss structure holds up the roof, this is how electric power is brought into the house and distributed.This is not a book on how to design a house, you can put the bedrooms anywhere you want, you can have as many bathrooms as you want. This is the basic design of how the building does its job of providing the walls that make up the bathroom, keep it warm/cool, with water inside but kept where you want it.I consider this book to be interesting to anyone interested in the subject. I consider this book to be mandatory reading for anyone even thinking about building a house or having one built."},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"Historians and architects can each suffer a form of myopia which makes their work inaccessible to the layman. Allen avoids being too narrow while simultaneously managing to provide some depth and detail on the function of buildings and their subsystems. The tone is conversational without being breezy; the accompanying illustrations do a fine job of conveying the technical detail without becoming too - well, technical! The approach is relatively holistic as well, thinking of buildings as a compilation of systems, each explained in its own right, but also a part of the larger whole. A fine introduction to the topic; this might work as a great read before considering having a home custom-built or a remodeling project done; you'd be able to ask the right questions of the contractor and better understand how and why things proceed as they do."},{"Title":"How Buildings Work","review":"My son needed this text for his college class.

In 1967 he was one of five photojournalists who participated in a project called 'Concerned Photography', an assignment that assured his fame in the world of photography. What Freed elected to study on this assignment was the manner in which life in the United States altered with the Civil Rights movement, especially among African Americans. Freed questioned the dichotomy of expecting African American soldiers to 'protect the freedom' of their country by serving in Vietnam, while knowing that 'equality' was still unresolved at home. The Civil Rights movement suggested there was an equality at home yet that equality was a long time in developing. He took it upon himself to document the manners of life for African Americans in the USA, seeking out the realities of life in the housing projects, in the rural communities, in the streets of the big cities and in the still smoldering resentment in the small towns across the country, unable to see equality among the races. The result was a very important publication - the original volume of this book BLACK IN WHITE AMERICA - he published in 1968. It remains one of the more important documents of the gradual change in attitudes and in opportunities that followed Martin Luther King's dream and the formation of the new America. Freed was able to capture on film images that were homages to the strength of human dignity from every angle.After the surge in his popularity with the initial publication of this book, he went on to publish similar portfolios such as the 1970 'Made in Germany', the 1980 'Police Work', the 1997 'Amsterdam: The Sixties' and other significant collections. His approach to each subject was honest if not always beautiful, and his works grace museum walls throughout the world. This release of BLACK IN WHITE AMERICA, probably his greatest work, has just been republished. It is already a collectors' item.

Webber's wording is creative and current. His choice of metrical patterns makes these psalms usable with literally hundreds of tunes familiar to all who worship with these ancient Hebrew poems. I could wish Webber had versified the entire Psalter, though he has included most sections regularly in use in English speaking congregations. I warmly recommend using these settings to all who love to sing, and love to sing the psalms.

Various forms of Chant, whether it be Gregorian or Anglican)are hard for many to learn leaving most congregations to read the Psalms rather than sing them.This resource is an excellent resource for those who still wish to sing the Psalms during the Liturgy. Webber has revised the Psalter to make the Psalms read in a metrical form which allows them to be sung to many familiar tunes. To allow a variety of hymns to be used with the Psalms, notations such as LM, CM, etc are used so the musicians can choose appropriate tunes for the Psalm."},{"Title":"A New Metrical Psalter","review":"A good resource of Psalms and Canticles in metrical paraphrase, set to common hymn tunes.

I have been richly rewarded. Although the book is completely out of my field, it has some blinding insights pertinent to my field, which is that of saving mankind by actualizing the World Brain envisioned by H. G. Wells.This author, who earned the Nobel in 2000, has bridged the gap between biology of the mind, and psychology of the mind, but he has done much much more than that. This extraordinary book--perhaps I am alone in seeing this, but I believe it deeply--has finally articulated the connection between the health of the individual brain, and the health of mankind as a whole.Although much of the book is too technical for my limited political science mind, what I see quite clearly is that this book is the manual for saving mankind's brain by focusing on three connected realities: the food that feeds the mind; the experience that educates the mind; and the visual cueing that stimulates the mind.I have reviewed virtually all of the books on \\"wealth of knowledge\\" and knowledge as a catalyst for innovation and prosperity. What this book did for me was inspire a deeper sense of Hans Morgenthau's earlier focus on the population as the primary source of national power. I am reminded of George Will'sStatecraft as Soulcraftas I contemplate the responsibilities of government for the nurturing of its population.Here is the bottom line from this book as it applies to the future of mankind: the early years are CRITICAL to the ability to learn and innovate and prosper. Poverty will beget poverty UNLESS we work that triangle of food/water, experience, and visual stimulation (Note to the White House: Head Start).As I read through this book I was acutely conscious of its relevance to the increasing \\"insanity\\" of society (see my reviews ofRage of the Random Actor: Disarming Catastrophic Acts And Restoring Livesand also theDying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism.I do not review this book as a medical book, but rather as a social construction book. It helped crystalize in my mind the absolute ignorance of governments that fail to see that the minds of their individual citizens are the ultimate source of national power.One final note: the author speaks of the impact of behavior on the brain. I translate that into the good behavior of America as an impact on the world, and especially on hostile Islam and the Middle Eastern countries whose oil we have been stealing for over a century.I lament any inappropriate hyperbole here, but this book has really moved me. It shows so clearly how isolated our diverse academic and scientific specialities are from each other, how ignorant our governments are of the fundementals of mind and brain.Wow.

Vol. I : The 19th Century in Europe; Background and the Roman Catholic Phase","review":"Kenneth Scott Latourette (1884-1968) was an American historian of Christianity, who had been a missionary to China in the early 20th century; he is also the author of the comprehensive 1953 history,A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)andA History of Christianity, Volume II: Reformation to the Present. This volume was first published in 1958; the next volume in this current series isChristianity in a Revolutionary Age. Vol. II : The 19th Century in Europe; the Protestant and Eastern Churches.He wrote in the Preface, \\"Here is an attempt to narrate the history of Christianity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries... The period is one in which Christianity first became world-wide... Christianity had never been so widely influential as it became in the twentieth century... the amazing virour and world-wide spread of the faith would in itself make some such work as is attempted here imperative for an understanding of history and the current human scene.\\"He observes that \\"very few of those of the (18th) century who were adjudged worthy of canonization were in the higher ranks of the clergy... The list of recognized saints included no Pope of the period. Roman Catholics noted for their sanctity were from the rank and file, not from the official leadership.\\" (Pg. 73)He suggests that \\"Protestantism... stimulated the emergence of proposals for the improvement of mankind... begun and carried through by men and women who had been stirred by the religious revivals which characterized Protestantism. Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy were ... more resistant to alterations... anti-Christian movements were led by those who were from milieux in which the Roman Catholic Church ... was the prevailing form of religion.\\" (Pg. 174) He argues that \\"such developments as the (YMCA and YWCA) and the Salvation Army would not have come into being had it not been for the social conditions which arose from the Industrial Revolution.\\" (Pg. 214)He points out that \\"Marked as was the revival in the Roman Catholic Church, no figures emerged from it which in stature were equal to the greatest of the earlier centuries. No Pope made his will felt in Europe as effectively as had Gregory the Great and Innocent III. No theologians appeared with intellectual and spiritual power comparable to that of Augustine, Anselm, or Thomas Aquinas. No mystics were of the high quality of ... Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, or Francis de Sales. No founder of a monastic order or congregation would rank with Benedict of Nursia, Bernard of Clairvaux, Francis of Assisi, or Ignatius Loyola.\\" (Pg. 466)This series makes an excellent supplement to Latourette's 'A History of Christianity.'"},{"Title":"A History of US: Book 8: An Age of Extremes 1880-1917","review":"Joy Hakim forewarns her young readers that &quot;An Age of Extremes 1880-1917,&quot; volume 8 in A History of US, talks a lot about Economics, but also assures them that this time around it will not be a &quot;yawn.&quot; This particular volume looks at the United States at what we now refer to as the turn of the last century, what Mark Twain called the &quot;Gilded Age.&quot; However, the preface sets up the idea that this period was an age of extremes that saw business tycoons with great wealth and millions of immigrants living in poverty. While the Brooklyn Bridge and Panama Canal were being built Jim Crow laws were established in the South and the Indian wars ended in the West. Underneath this all Hakim reminds her readers that the United States is a nation of practical idealists and that in contrast to the Founding Fathers like Benjamin Franklin, the businessmen of the Gilded Age, such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, were unscrupulous rather than altruistic.&quot;An Age of Extremes&quot; basically breaks down into five sections. The first (Chapters 1-7) starts with the rags to riches story of Andrew Carnegie and other magnates, as well as a dreamer of a different type in L. Frank Baum. The second (Chapters 8-14) covers American politics at the end of the 19th century, contrasting Republican support for big business with the rise of the Populists and William Jennings Bryan. The third (Chapters 15-21) offers the flip side of the first, focusing on the plight of the working class. The fourth (Chapters 22-28) tells how the Gilded Age turned Progressive, beginning with the Muckrakers and ending with the emergence of Theodore Roosevelt on the national stage. The final section (Chapters 29-37) begins with America's imperialistic interests in the Spanish-American War and ends with Woodrow Wilson leading the nation into a World War to save democracy. In between, T.R. remains the dominant figure.As always, Hakim's book is richly illustrated with period photographs, paintings, editorial cartoons and the like, including a photograph of the Dakota apartment building seen from Central Park after its construction which will strike a chord with fans of John Lennon. The pictures reinforce Hakim's point that this period was a time of both prosperity and poverty, of idealism and corruption. The volume ends with the U.S. entering the First World War, setting up the revolutionary changes that would come afterwards in the Jazz Age. The strength of Hakim's volumes remains her ability to engage her young readers. This might be a good old-fashioned juvenile history text, but it has the energy of a CD-Rom or a great Internet website. The series is perfect for parents who are home schooling their children because Hakim &quot;talks&quot; to her readers as if she were teaching them in a classroom, anticipating questions and demanding that they look at history from the perspective of the people they are reading about in these pages."},{"Title":"A History of US: Book 8: An Age of Extremes 1880-1917","review":"Just what I was looking for.

What sort of history book offers no glossary and no notes? Answer: an unreliable one.Joy Hakim is working hard to sell her tale of history in this book, with comforting anecdotes and a great deal of glossing-over.This book particularly deals with the fascinating years when America grew really industrialized and began its climb to international economic dominance. This story is barely told, because Joy Hakim prefers to discuss innovators and industrialists only in terms of their greed. While hardly unique, it quickly helps the reader realize the one-sidedness this volume will present.But if rigorous individual success gets short shrift in this book, never fear! Because the violent labor movement and disastrous progressive policies are presented in the most comforting and soothing manner imaginable. Hakim writes with wide-eyed astonishment about \\"those\\" who might consider communism and international socialism \\"scary (p.91, 97)\\" (remember -- the ideologies of the governments that enslaved, starved, tortured, and murdered hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century). It's too precious the way she describes those who would overthrow capitalism and enslave Americans:Samuel Gompers: good-humored and no-nonsense (p97)Jose Marti: a poet, a man of action, cut out to be a hero (p. 103)Mother Jones: tiny, seemed like a nice old lady, a fearless soul (p.104) and an honored guest (p.110)Big Bill Haywood: powerful spirited and decent (p.110) idealist, mostly sincere (p. 111) big-hearted (p.113)Eugene Debs: gentle (p.111)Margaret Sanger: a woman with a cause (p.114)There's a great section in here that should be called \\"Lying for the Cause!\\" featuring Upton Sinclair and Ida Tarbell.Lastly, there is a tremendous lack of coherence when it comes to the term \\"democracy.\\" It is used in this book as a synonym for... well, pratically everything.democracy = America's founding ideals (p. 37)democracy = something you learn about in a labor union (p.91)democracy = the public (p. 119)democracy = the dream of freedom held by immigrants (.134)democracy = fairness (p.135)democracy = America's form of government (p.156)democracy = everyone is the same (p.163)democracy = reforming corruption (p.177)democracy = when people speak out (p.178)Good grief! Democracy is the (usually violent) rule of the majority over the minority, a system that does not recognize individual rights. In democracy, power resides in the government to carry out the will of the majority. Period. And although people DO use it as a metaphor for other desirable things they would want their society to have, those people can not change the fact that words means things. It is just as egregious when George W. Bush misuses the word Democracy as when Joy Hakim does it. Both should know better.

I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen. The book is written as a narrative with no bullets, highlights, underlined points or emphasis of any kind. The problem with this is the first time reader of American History needs to know what is important and what they need to focus on. They have no base knowledge of the subject and not all fact are equal. In addition, there is no glossary which is annoying for the students when creating flash cards for assessments. I am not going to go into the inaccuracies of the text (there are quite a few) or the obvious religious biased, but I think that a more structured book is appropriate for first time American History student.

I should start this review by saying that I am not sure that Zelazny could write a bad book. Non-Zelazny fans may disagree.Merlin is very clearly the son of Corwin. He is irreverent about the holy ghosts of Amber and Chaos. He hits his head against the rules (and sometimes even wins). Despite an overly-long sequence in a strange testing ground between shadows, Zelzany still infuses this book with the manic strangeness and humor that are part of what make him such a wonderful writer. As noted, virtually none of the Amber novels can be read stand-alone or out of sequence. You are going to have to read the books before this one to get the background. And you are going to have to read the ones after this to get an explanation.

Merlin isn't Corwin and has a lot more naivitie (may irritate some readers) but it's the hero going out into the world to find ... what? Himself? His father? Who's trying to kill him?

Although I still like the two books, Zelazny's normal fascinating stories slow down considerably when he decides to go this route. Merlin becomes trapped in a symbolic battle between the Pattern and the Logrus, and for most of the book we have no idea where Merlin's encounter with a land between shadows relates to the three plus books leading up to here.On the good side, things liven up quite a bit towards the end of Merlin's trials here. The magic and Merlin's pluckiness get fun again.Zelazny introduces a new type of character into the series in \\"Knight of Shadows\\". They become surprisingly interesting and sympathetic figures in the story, and I thought they were a very imaginative idea. I won't give more details about them, because that would spoil the fun. :-)As in all the Amber books, the volume cannot stand on its own. It is in essence the fourth 20% of one very long book, since Merlin's story starts on page one of book one and doesn't slow down until the last page of book five ... if you can even consider that to be the end.

Those who are allied with each other will not speak with each other. While their enemies somehow know everything. Most of the important action happens offstage, and promised explanations never materialize.So I would suggest you only read this book if you are a fan of the Amber series and have read the others that come before it."},{"Title":"Knight of Shadows (Amber Novels)","review":"Zelazny manages to break out of his own pattern for a bit and some of the fog that moved in during Sign of Chaos begins to dissipate. Caught between the maneuverings of the Pattern and the Logrus, Merlin finds himself trapped and sent on a knight's quest in which he is force to make choices that will change the balance between the two forces. Pattern ghosts haunt his passage, and Merlin is hard put to determine who is real and who is just a memory.The key to the remaining story is the imbalance between the Courts and Amber which may unleash a series of events that threaten all of shadow. Merlin grows increasingly frustrated with the unending interference in his own life which keeps him perpetually at risk. Surrounded by arcane signs, warring wizards, and exploding castles Merlin would just like to enjoy life for a while but his efforts at hedonism simply dig him in deeper.Knight of Shadows still follows the 'travel a bit then fight a bit' pattern, but gradually the busy field of characters is starting to make sense. With a sigh of relief the reader can relax and enjoy the twists in Merlin's adventures as more than one character performs a perfect turnabout just so we will have to keep guessing at the real villain right until the last confrontation."},{"Title":"Knight of Shadows (Amber Novels)","review":"I have read the entire series of amber novels and this book left more unfinished business behind than all the others.

I really enjoy reading them. I have read them all and keep reading them when i finish. I just can't stop thinking how good they are. I am hoping for another series. When I read the first five, I was blown away. That someone had the imagination to create such a magical world and call ours a shadow, was something I did not think possible. Not that I could have thought of it. Roger Zelazny, i believe, is the best author of science fiction/fantasy in the world. In the back of my mind, i always though that maybe he actually was someone from Amber. That he came here to tell a story about his life or his reletives.

Today, there are many who do not know the good news of Jesus Christ and His Church. They might never have heard the message or they think they know it already. Often this previous knowledge of Jesus Christ and His Church is a caricature. In addition to those who are unchurched, the Catholic Church in America is presented with the daunting problem of many Catholic who do not practice the faith.The Evangelizing Catholic is a good tool in facing the challenge of the Church. Many books in this field deal with the theory of evangelization. They look at the documents of the Church and do a good job of setting out the mission. While this is good, often they do not go to the next step of implementing the vision. This work lays out a sufficient justification for evangelization while also attempting to place it in the modern context of the individual Catholic and the Catholic parish. As a potential future pastor in the Catholic Church, I find this to be especially helpful. While one needs to apply it to each real life context, DeSiano is very careful to state that this is not to be a cookie cutter approach. I would recommend this book for all pastors in the Catholic Church as well as those in the parish who have a zeal for spreading the Good News."},{"Title":"The Evangelizing Catholic: A Practical Handbook for Reaching Out","review":"An easy to follow and undersatnd guide of a Roman Catholics obligation to go out and spread the word."},{"Title":"The Civil War in Nicaragua: Inside the Sandinistas","review":"This book is required reading for anyone studying Nicaraguan or Latin American History. It is one of the best books I have read on the Nicaraguan revolution. Roger Miranda was actually the chief of the Sandinista Defence Ministry, having someone that was so involved in the revolution makes this a very intimate and informative portrait of the Sandinistas.Not only is this a book about the Sandinistas, but it is also a book about what happens when power gets into the hands of people who do not know what to do with it. It is a book about men with good intentions who left a country worse of than it was.The information covered in this book could take up twice the legnth of it, and because of that the book is extreamly dense, it makes it hard to read. This is, a very informative, but not all that entertaining, book about Nicaragua."},{"Title":"How to Use Microsoft Publisher 2000","review":"Not only does this book only go over the very very basic steps on how to use this program, which I could have figured out how to use to program by doing this without the book, but is out-dated.

Bridges wrote the best-sellers &quot;Transitions&quot; and &quot;Managing Transitions,&quot; and when not authoring has been a management guru for a couple decades. &quot;Job Shift&quot; serves as a primer for managing your own career in what he views as a fundamentally new career marketplace.The main thesis of his latest book is that our country, and indeed ourworld, is currently in the midst of the Second Great Job Shift. The firstwas caused by the Industrial Revolution, when people transitioned fromvillage life to urbania. Along with this shift came a redefinition of thevery meaning of the word, &quot;job.&quot; In the village, it meant a task orproject, generally of finite duration and paid fee-for-service if paid atall. (The etymology of the word &quot;job&quot; apparently goes back to &quot;haulingdung.&quot;) In the Industrial Age, a &quot;job&quot; was actually a position in the hierarchy of a company, with a clearly-defined set of responsibilities and paid a salary. As long as one stayed properly within the confines of the job description, one could count on advancement up the organizational ladder.The current Second Great Job Shift, according to Bridges, is the Death of the Job, at least as it has been defined for the past two hundred years.The Information Age is forcing companies to move and respond more quickly to shifts in markets while at the same time allowing increased automation of information processing. Companies are replacing the traditional corporate structure with project-oriented organization. People are assigned to projects, and performance is evaluated based on the project's outcome, not on how well one fits into some job description.Bridges has recommendations for individuals, companies, and evengovernments for addressing and dealing with this Job Shift. While I'm not entirely convinced that I agree with all of Bridges' vision, his argument is extremely powerful and thought-provoking. It is certainly a different approach than I've encountered in other jobsearch books, and has a certain appeal just on that basis. I highly recommendit as a well-written source of ideas for anyone in the job market, even those who are happily employed. Instead of telling you how to write a resume or shine in an interview, Bridges looks at the overall job environment, and offers general advice on the mentality and approach needed to advance yourself. Reading this book in close conjunction with Bolles' classic &quot;What Color is Your Parachute?&quot; is a frightening, exciting, and empowering experience. Whether you end up agreeing and taking Bridges' advice or not, I think it is always helpful to get exposed to another way of viewing a problem.[Longer versions of this review have been previously submitted by the author to the Young Scientists' Network and Network for Emerging Scientists' online discussion forums.]"},{"Title":"Jobshift: How To Prosper In A Workplace Without Jobs","review":"In the era of downsizing and mergers, one hears far too many people bewailing what we've &quot;lost&quot;: job security, well-defined career paths, companies that feel responsible for the people who work for them, employee loyalty. Bridges offers a more positive perspective: &quot;work&quot; as we conceive of it was an artifact of the Industrial Revolution, with its view of workers as cogs in a machine; and, as that rigid structure gradually disappears, so will our present concept of &quot;jobs&quot; and &quot;careers.&quot;This was one of the first ripples in what has become a massive wave of books on the changing business world, including recent examples like &quot;Blur&quot; -- but it's refreshing, easy to read, and can change your whole view of what &quot;work&quot; entails. I think it's especially important for young people still in school to read it: don't waste your efforts preparing for a traditional &quot;career&quot; that may not be there five years after you graduate; focus on developing your talents, your skills, and your entrepreneurial spirit instead, because those are what will be worth the most to you in the future."},{"Title":"Jobshift: How To Prosper In A Workplace Without Jobs","review":"I first read this book some seven years ago as a text for a class intended to help graduating students prepare themselves for the world of work. Interestingly one of those graduates was intending to work in a start up business with digital cameras which he believed would emerge as the dominant force in the picture business. Probably telling the future is not a good business to be in.Here in Northern New Jersey everyone knew, and still knows, all about downsizing and organizational flattening and outsourcing. Since the collapse of the tech-bubble, many of those independent contractors are now looking for work and escaping the computer field alltogether in the face of falling wage rates, excess supply and new entrants from college who expect a lot less!Revisiting this book gives one the opportunity to rexamine it's claims and, not surprisingly, finds them lacking. To be fair, much of what the originator describes has come to pass but not in the way that he suggests.The main lesson that I come away with from this book is that markets are so powerful that the competitive environment determines the shape of the organization. Obviously, some would say but this is only half of the story. Combine the power of markets which is, after all, only the result of individuals exercising choices, with a proactive government and you get a pretty unstoppable force. If the dollar is high then imports are [inexpensive] as compared to domestic goods which puts intense competitive pressure on companies who then must cut costs. Add to the mix a policy of a free trade area as NAFTA and a competitive labor market and there is even more pressure on costs. Finally have a boyant stock market and increased wealth and you have lots of venture capital looking for profit. The result, falling unemployment with little inflation and downward intense pressure on costs leading to more business. The picture is muddied somewhat by rising benefits costs but they become a force against rising costs too,What I am describing is the pressure on business to focus on their core activities and float off internal activities which can be done by service companies contracted for the purpose. Wage bill too high - make workers contractors who then have to pay for their own benefits or better still get the states to introduce basic minimum health care schemes.This nirvana of the dejobbed economy never really existed. Sure there are more small businesses and self-employed, sure there is more flexibility among the workforce but there is also compulsion, workfare, for the unemployed as well as the requirement for many families to work two, three or more jobs to make ends meet.Hayek the Nobel prizewinner foresaw the person described in this book many years ago as did his mentor Mises. To be successful they argued the individual must market themselves as a self-entrepreneur. Very true.This book is an excellent description of a possible future in the light of developments in business at the time. The author is to be commended for the clarity of his thought and exposition. However, he ignores the bigger picture and the implications of a global economy and powerful, interventionist governments. Perhaps he would like to write an update to this book in the light of the events of the last seven years."},{"Title":"Jobshift: How To Prosper In A Workplace Without Jobs","review":"Bridges argues that you must make yourself relevant to the changing economy by managing your career as solo business, finding the unmet needs inside of your company and increasing your contribution to your company.The traditional workplace, where tasks are broken up into \`jobs' with specifically defined duties, is disappearing fast says author William Bridges. Many companies that try to cut costs simply cut jobs. However, more innovative companies are changing the way their employees work altogether. The trend has been to move away from work divided into specific tasks, to work based on teams and project work. People are brought together to work on specific projects and then break up when the project is completed. If this is happening at your company, you can apply for a job someplace else, but the chances are good that you're just exchanging one vulnerable job for another.The better answer, says the author, is to change your attitude towards work, forget about your job position and start looking for opportunities to fulfill your company's needs. Increasing your contribution to your company will also increase your value to the company.Treat everyone around you as a customer, and start looking for unmet needs. Think of your workplace as a market.Align your desires, abilities, temperament and assets with those of your company or find companies and projects that are right for you.Manage your career as an outside vendor, not as an inside employee. You must find products and services to sell inside your company to ensure your employment. Do market research on your own company.Manage your job insecurity by preparing yourself for constant change, and using new interpretations of work that will help you bring order to chaos."},{"Title":"Jobshift: How To Prosper In A Workplace Without Jobs","review":"This book should be read by everyone in government and anyone connected with making job policies. Bridges was ahead of his time when he wrote this book. He pointed out that the old way of working - mostly for large corporations - doesn't work. He was among the first to realize that job security is an illusory goal and he suggested realistic solutions.As we are in the early stages of the 21st century, this book seems more relevant than ever. Corporations create wellness programs that actually intrude on the personal lives of employees. They make hiring decisions based on an employee's impact on health care costs, not necessarily on productivity. Losing a job has huge consequences because we still tie health benefits to jobs - even with Obamacare. Bridges addresses these issues by proposing new ways to organize, such as guilds resembling craft guilds from earlier centuries."},{"Title":"Jobshift: How To Prosper In A Workplace Without Jobs","review":"I got the book for information on how to manage in a world where jobs are disappearing.

It is an amazing book - I look at it to lift my mood, which it never fails to do. Baby humans and baby animals always bring out that nurturing, sensitive, capable-of-awe part of me that can only be described as spiritual. The book is a nice, compact size. The pictures are bright and glossy. It is stunning to see baby animals negotiate all of the developmental tasks they need to master to become adults and survive on their own. When I look at this book, I can only breathe a prayer of thanks and adoration to the Creator for the vast variety of colors, textures, individual personalities, functions, and LIFE He created and splashed across the canvas of this Earth for His (and our) enjoyment. For this reason alone, conservation efforts to preserve species and habitats are well worth it.

However, how many people think to check the dimensions of a book? The title does reference MiniCube, but that's fairly easy to overlook, especially since this book does come in a larger format, which is also called a cube book. I assumed I was getting a small book, maybe 4-6 inches for height and width rather than a tiny book, 2 or so inches in height and width (though it is quite thick). Aside from my self-induced disappointment, the book is fine. The pictures are decent enough, though I can't say I was particularly blown away by them. I don't know if that's due solely to the small size of the images, which certainly does lessen their impact, or if it's because the photos themselves aren't all that special as far as this kind of nature photography goes. Certainly there are some really nice photos, but overall I'm left underwhelmed. I plan on giving this book to my 3-year-old son for Christmas as he loves animal photos.

This is the tale of a doll \\"family,\\" not related by biology but the simple fate of being thrown together. Although there are nominal mother and father dolls, the real head of the household is Tottie, a wooden farthing doll, wise beyond her childish appearance. The dolls' relative happiness and the way it is threatened by the appearance of Marchpane, an expensive, arrogant and, as it turns out, really malevolent interloper, makes for surprisingly gripping drama. Indeed, the tale of Marchpane's machinations and the tragic climax of the story may be too intense for younger or more sensitive children, for whom this book needs to be introduced with care. For the rest of them, and for adults who simply like a good story, \\"The Dolls' House\\" still exerts its considerable spell. Tasha Tudor's illustrations are a notable contribution as well."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"Fortunate to have read this book at the age of ten, I never forgot it.

If you are an adult who read it as a child, re-read it. If you've never read it, you will enjoy the drama about a family whose home and happiness are threatened and how they dealt with it. This is a must-read for all Godden fans. All her storytelling skills are used, deft foreshadowing, proper use of detail and strong dramatic scenes. It was written for children but it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys fine writing."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"Quite affecting. A very rich story of the \\"family-dynamics\\" in an antique doll-house. Perhaps best read to the younger child (under 10). There are some very complex emotions at play.

That's what happens in the fantasy where dolls talk, The Dolls' House, a book by Rumer Godden, who's also the author of Listen To The Nightingale.In The Dolls' House, a family of dolls owned by Charlotte and Emily Dane, two little girls who love to play with dolls, get a present. The present is a huge deluxe dollhouse that Tottie, a wooden farthing doll, used to live in. Tottie Plantaganet (the oldest child), Birdie Plantaganet (the mom of the family), Mr. Plantaganet (the dad), and Apple Plantaganet (Tottie's little brother), move into the dollhouse. Later, Marchpane, a nasty little stuck-up doll that thinks she is too delicate to be played with by those \\"silly little children that don't know how to be careful\\", moves into the Plantaganet's house and takes over.My favorite part of The Dolls' House is when Tottie goes to an exhibit for dolls only because it's funny-one of the many elements mixed together to form this wonderful book. There is also lots of anger, happiness, and action in this book. The ending is a little sad, but I love The Dolls' House anyway-I would rate it a 9.2 out of a full 10.The Dolls' House is perfect for 3rd graders, 4th graders, and 5th graders."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I am 8 years old.

The author, Rumer Godden does a remarkable job of narrating and explaining the time period of England and uses great detail to make the young readers feel part of the story. A family of mixed matched dolls is owned by two sisters living in England in the 1940's. The children's imagination and creativity bring the dolls to life in the story, but the dolls seem to come alive by themselves, too. The dolls are unhappy with their current living arrangements and are thrilled to receive a new, but very old doll house.

Yet, also, a story that is SO good, I can still remember it well...Just get this book, your daughter will love it!"},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"While I have always loved some of Rumer Godden's other books (including \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\", which is also about the \\"lives\\" of old dolls), I had mixed feelings about this book each time I read it as a child. The book is about a doll family, made up of several different types of dolls. The little girl doll, Tottie, is a wooden \\"farthing\\" doll of the type Queen Victoria played with as a child; the mother doll, Birdy, is cheap celluloid and a bit rattle-pated as a result. There is also a father and a little boy doll. As in \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\", the dolls long for a house of their own, but just when their dream is coming true their little-girl owners receive an elegant, haughty and expensive doll named Marchpane who looks down on the doll family and threatens to take over the dollhouse herself. This has the makings of a good plot, but unfortunately, it wasn't developed in a way that satisfied me as a young reader.Aside from just describing what the dolls do each day in their house, the theme of the book is that the most expensive and most beautiful doll is not necessarily the most worthy or lovable doll. The author makes this point by describing a doll exhibition visited by the Queen, who is happiest to see the little \\"farthing\\" doll that reminds her of her childhood, not the expensive Marchpane. The author makes this point again when a tragic accident occurs that makes the little girls realize that the most beautiful and expensive doll may not be the one with the best, most lovable qualities. This is a common theme in children's books, including other books about dolls (\\"The Best-Loved Doll\\" for example) but in \\"The Doll's House\\", it doesn't work as well. Perhaps this is because in books like \\"The Best-Loved Doll\\", it's the child who sees that beautiful and expensive toys are not necessarily the best or the nicest ones, but in this book, the little girls who own the dolls are actually bamboozled by Marchpane's beauty while adults (like the Queen) see the inner beauty in the cheaper dolls. I also was disappointed as a child to see that one of the \\"good\\" dolls was \\"killed off\\" in the course of the story and that the evil doll did not seem to get punished for her very bad attitude. In fact, she ends up in a situation that's actually preferable! If a doll had to be harmed or destroyed, I would have liked it to be the \\"bad\\" one.I think this might be a nice book for older readers with a sense of whimsy who are interested in the history of different types of British dolls, which the book gets into a little bit, but it just fell flat for me as a child. I know I tried several times to enjoy it because I liked \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\" so much, but it just ended up alternately boring and frustrating me every time, because nothing much happened till the \\"bad\\" doll showed up, then she disrupted everyone's lives and walked away without a scratch. Not the way children like to see the world."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"The Doll's House, by Rumer Godden, written in the era of my childhood & published 1948, as a work of great value, has taken my heart soaring into whimsical places and joy.

Emily and Charlotte entered Tottie (their servant doll) into The Doll Exhibit, where Tottie saw her old, mean roommate, Marchphane. They were talking about how Tottie lived in Marchphane's old house. Marchphane was mad and jealous that Tottie was living in her old house. Marchphane said she would get her house back. When Tottie got back to her house, Marchphane was there. Emily and Charlotte made The Plantaganet family Marchphane's servants to make Marchphane happy. However, Marchphane was still mean and rude to them. One day, Emily and Charlotte said, \\"Marchphane is too pretty to live in a doll house\\", so they sent her to a museum. The Plantaganet family was much happier after Marchphane was gone, and they all lived happily ever after.My favorite part was when Tottie and Marchphane ran into each other at The Doll Exhibit.

To the family's amazement, Emily and Charlotte become heirs to the dollhouse; however, they also inherit Marchpane, a porcelain and haughty doll. The family must overcome Marchpane's attempts to keep them out of the house, so they can live as they have always dreamed.The book appeals to young girls, rather than boys, because contains dolls (two of which are male) and dollhouses.

This author captures the magic of children's imaginations, and creates lovable and believable characters out of the unexpected;dolls! Definitely a recommended book for younger girls who still love to play, or for adults/young adults who want to reminisce on their childhoods.If you enjoy this book, here are some other great children's books that you might enjoy:All of a Kind Family (Sydney Taylor)The Egypt Game (Zilpha Keatley Snyder)The Animal Family (Randall Jarrell)The Light Princess (sorry forgot!)The Wheel on the School (Meindert DeJongl)Tales From The Three Penny Bit (Wendy Eyton)Half Magic, Magic by the Lake, The thyme Garden (Edward Eager)"},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I find it so odd that the reviews that are negative about Rumer Godden's Tottie, the Story of a Dolls House are coming from American readers. The US is the home of violent cartoons and other children's films that include agressive behaviour, so I expected readers from there to be a little tougher than they are!I read this book when I was seven, I read it with my daughter and have read it to my classes of 7 to 9 year olds. None of us have been traumatised by it. My pupils found the scene from the film Toy Story, where the creepy little boy 'kills' the toys, far more disturbing. I discussed the death scene with several groups over the years and, perhaps British children are less sentimental than their US cousins, but they always came up with stories they'd seen/heard on the News or parts of childrens' films that were at least as violent. As one bright 8 year-old said, 'Dying is the end of living and it happens to everybody. I'd rather think about it happening to a doll than to my Grandma.'Take out the death scene and there are other issues dealt with in this book to talk about with children. There is sharing and kindness. There's an introduction to the fact that the grown-ups, in the guise of Mr Plantagenet, are not always the most knowledgeable members of a family. There's the different attitudes to life and that being beautiful does not always mean being kind or pleasant. etc.On the negative side, this book is now a little dated and some areas need explanation to modern kids. Also, children do not depend as much on reading for entertainment as they did in the 1940s, so a modern young child may not read as well as in earleir generations, so, by the time the text is appropriate in terms of reading skill, the child may have developed a sense of being too old for doll stories.Tottie: The Story of a Dolls' House"},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I am a doll lover and love reading about dolls. I know I can always rely on a Rumer Godden book to give me a good story about our little friends. I was pleased with this one, her first, actually, and I was lucky to get it at a great price at a secondhand shop. Score!"},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"This story approaches dolls from the point of view of the dolls. An eclectic collection of dolls is housed together, and as can happen, when a star is introduced into their society, discord erupts.Doll lovers and Rumer Godden fans will enjoy this book, which though appealing is not sappy. The heroine is an antique wooden, jointed doll who almost seems like Jo March, were that character a doll."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I liked this book but I didn't love it. It was a good book. It did not have a lot of action. It was simply the story of a doll named Tottie's life. Parts of it were sad and parts of it were happy. Tottie, being a doll, is not the smartest. So sometines she has mixed feelings about things like once she thought that Emily and Charltte (her owner's) had btrayed her. Of corse they had not. I liked this book okey but not great."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like \\"Toy Story.\\" The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and \\"delicate\\" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child."},{"Title":"The Doll's House","review":"I'll have to ask my grandchildren what they think of this book.

(Ha)"},{"Title":"Fauquier County (Virginia publick claims)","review":"Although it has been over twenty years since the Shah of Iran fell from power, recent events have made that event significant once again. At the time that this review is being written, U. S. and coalition troops are fighting insurgents in Iraq and there is a serious international dispute concerning the Iranian nuclear program. There are reasons to believe that Iranian agents are operating in Iraq and actively working to promote the Shia cause in that country. The Sunni states of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait have expressed concern that an election in Iraq will lead to a Shia victory and a corresponding rise in Iranian influence in Iraq.To understand the significance of this, it is necessary to understand the history of the rule of the Shah of Iran and how he was toppled from power. Saikal starts with the emergence of the modern state of Iran and how it was dominated by foreign powers. Initially, Iran was dominated from the north by the Russian Empire and from the south by the British Empire based in India. Both carved out a section of influence, leaving a small central buffer state to be governed by the Iranians.The transformation from the Russian Empire to the Soviet one changed very little at first. The geopolitical forces that caused the Russians to look south did not change when the Soviets took power. These years of foreign occupation, which ended only with the end of World War II, had a profound impact on the Iranian psyche.While the foreign domination was less overt after the war, British oil companies had near total control over the Iranian oil fields, paying the Iranians very little. This led to the rise of Dr. Mohammad Mossadeq, who took power in Iran and nationalized the Iranian oil industry in an attempt to increase the Iranian revenue. In many ways, this was a premature move and the American CIA sponsored a coup that brought the Shah to power.As Saikal explains very well, in most situations, the Shah did have the best intentions for Iran. He embarked on a plan of modernization and gradually managed to eliminate the foreign control of the Iranian oil fields. There was a program of economic development that expanded economic opportunities for many Iranians and his foreign policy led to an increase in Iranian influence in the region. He embarked on a military buildup that was so substantial that in the last years of his reign, Iran was referred to as a \\"local superpower.\\"However, the Shah made many mistakes, and Saikal points them out. Some of those mistakes were minor, and in some cases inevitable. However, there were two major reasons why the Shah was ultimately removed in a popular revolt. The first was that he never eased the tight controls over dissent in Iran. SAVAK, his universally hated secret police, were answerable only to him and there was no domestic outlet to release political dissent. The second reason went back to his being installed in power by the United States. In order to consolidate power early in his reign, the Shah relied heavily on United States support, so much so that he often appeared to be an American puppet. The fact that he later moved contrary to American interests was not widely appreciated in Iran.The wide perception inside Iran that the Shah was an American puppet points out the incredible naivet&eacute; of many Americans. When the Shah fell, U. S. President Jimmy Carter was severely criticized for not speaking out more forcefully in support of the Shah. The critics somehow believed that such expressions of support could have kept the Shah in power. This was quite frankly stupid. Any strong expression of American support would have weakened the position of the Shah. The only thing that could have kept him in power was if his military was willing to kill tens of thousands of people in the streets, something that even the Shah's most hardline backers were not prepared to do. The revolt against the Shah was a democratic expression of the people's will and could not be stopped by the words of an American President.There are many lessons to be learned from this book, but the most significant are the ramifications to the Arab states in the Middle East. In particular, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, three pro-American monarchies that rigidly restrict dissent may be more vulnerable than they appear. I first read this book when it was published and recently reread it in order to gain some perspective on the current issues between Iraq, Iran and the United States. It was well worth it and I encourage you to read it as well if you want to obtain a deeper understanding of the situation in the Persian Gulf region. As was the case 25 years ago, a simple-minded approach to this region is a recipe for disaster."},{"Title":"Fauquier County (Virginia publick claims)","review":"I read this good book, here in Brazil. This book is a short, concise and easy to read book, about the last Shah of Iran.Ten excellents things of this book:1- It has informations about Iran's growing during years of Shah's government.2- It has informations about growing of American influence in Iran.3- It has informations about Land Reform.4- It has informations about the support of the Shah to women's rights.5- It has informations about the link between USSR and Iran.6- It has informations about the first oil shock and flow of tens of billions of US dollars to Iran.7- It has informations about Iran's defense budget. Between 27 and 29% of Iranian budget went to armed forces.8- It has informations about importations of food for the Iran. Brazil was (and remains) as one of the biggest sources of food for Iran.9- It has informations about Shah's external failures.10- At the lasts pages of this good book, there's many sentences writen about the main Shah's mistakes. This is the best part of this book.Even so, I can't give five stars for this book, because:1- This book follows the opposite way compared to the book \\" Jimmy Carter: The Liberal Left and World Chaos: A Carter/Obama Plan That Will Not Work \\" by Mike Evans. In this book, the Shah seems to be (almost) ever wrong. In the Mike Evans' book, the Shah seems to be (almost) ever right. Two opposites ways, with the same mistake. The Shah wasn't so good as in the Mike Evans' book or so bad as in this book. This book hasn't almost nothing about the external pressures to down the Shah. The histerical campaingn against the Shah did by BBC, The New York Times, Le Monde, etc. hasn't any place in this book. Mike Evans' book has enough informations about this fact.2-Yes, the Shah made a mistake after another mistake, in his last years of his (mis)rule, but this book forgets how these mistakes were did by following bad advices American hight autorities. As an example, there's informations about the Land Reform did by the Shah in 1960 decade, but when you know the terrible results of this Land Reform, there's just informations about importations of food for the Iran(see page 184), not why Iran became importanting so many food. The other even more terrible result of this Land Reform was the end of the class of land Lords that supported the Iranians Shahs for about 2,500 years. Without this class, the Shiite Clergy linked to a poor people and an economic crisis defeated the weakened and very sick Shah easily.3- This book has nothing about the Shah's end in Egypt, without no power, hope or friends. A page about the Shah's end would be a good thing in this book.4- This book never compares the Shah's failures, with the far worse defects of the Ayatollah Khomeini and his succeessors, in all things. Since the Shah's fall, Iran became a complete economic failure and a main supporter of Islamic terrorism. Compared to Khomeinist system, the Shah was like a lamb compared to a ferious tiger."},{"Title":"Fauquier County (Virginia publick claims)","review":"As Continental forces and Virginia militia units were engaged in winning independence, American quartermasters and provisioners struggled to provide these units with all the necessities of life, from meals and guns to meat, fodder for horses, the horses themselves, firewood, and every other type of material. Much of this was requisitioned from the civilian population and certificates were issued payable in either continental or state funds, depending on the units supplied, upon presentation to court authorities. Thousands of these certificates issued to Virginians were duly entered by the courts, and they provide a fascinating insight into the period of the Revolution. These \\"Publick\\" Claims booklets contain interesting and useful information about the contributions of ordinary people to the Revolutionary War. They provide some details of people's service in the militia or as guards for prisoners of war; they indicate where some bodies of troops were at particular times; and they identify providers of horses, wagons, cattle, grain, or other supplies. Much of the information in these booklets cannot be found anywhere else, which makes the surviving records particularly valuable. Also remarkable is the fact that records survived from virtually every county in the state at that time with the exception of the newly formed Kentucky counties. This makes the collection even more valuable in covering areas which heretofore in this time period have suffered from a lack of personal data. The \\"Virginia Publick Claims\\" are published by counties. In addition to a faithful transcription by Janice Luck Abercrombie and the late Richard Slatten, a complete index is provided for each county booklet.

Communicating, listening, forming concensus, agreeing on courses of action, making course changes, and celebrating progress should be pillars of leadership for any good corporate leader. Yet, for most they aren't.This book explores just why that is and provides concrete, real-life examples of successful confrontation. The book has an easy to follow format, and non-threatening steps for leaders to take. If the goal is more productivity, less turnover, and a happier work environment, then this is a wonderful place to start.Confrontation has such a negative connotation, normally, but here it is presented in the most positive light. It is nothing more than the meeting of two (or more) parties, face-to-face, to communicate about common goals, etc. I was really impressed that these activities surely can aid in communication outside the workplace. Try confronting a teenager about goals and expectations, and arriving at a commitment from both parties, with a means to guage results . . . and a means to modify the plan. Know what the consequences are when expectations are not met, and celebrate when they are.Seriously, follow these steps and guidleines and you can be a great leader, even in your own home."},{"Title":"The Art of Constructive Confrontation: How to Achieve More Accountability with Less Conflict","review":"This is a great book filled with bunch of great tips for leaders.

Chronology 2","review":"After having read the first volume of this expected series of 7 volumes I was triggered by the thesis of these authors that ancient Greek and Roman history did in fact take place in the Middle Ages. So I started studying medieval history of the Middle East - also known as Islamic history - to find out if the opponents of the ancient Greeks and Romans - the Acheamenid Persians, Sassanids, Scythians, Egyptians, etc. - also have their duplicates in medieval history. My search was disappointing: none of the many medieval Islamic dynasties seemed to correspond to the ancient middle eastern rulers.However, I did find a close correspondence between Herodotus' Persian kings and medieval events:- the defeat and capture of an Anatolian king - the Lydian Croesus - by the Persian conqueror Cyrus is identical to the defeat and capture of another Anatolian king - sultan Bayezid - by the Asian/Mongol conqueror Tamerlane;- the Persian conquest of Egypt by the cruel tyrant Cambyses reds almost exactly as the Ottoman conquest of Egypt by Selim the Grim (note the nickname!);- Darius the Lawgiver of the Persian Empire looks very much alike to Sulayman the Magnificent, the Lawgiver in Islamic history;- Xerxes, whose main claim to fame is to be defeated by the Greeks at the naval battle of Salamis, looks like Selim II (the Sot) whose main claim to fame is to be defeated by a Spanish-Italian alliance at the naval battle of Lepanto.I should have expected Fomenko et al. to arrive at similar conclusions, however, they claim that the Persian kings are the alter egos of the Angevin kings of Sicily whose biographies do not contain the exploits of the Persian kings.The similiarities I indicate lead to the conclusion that Herodotus must have written his Histories at the close of the 16th century. But this is extremely late, given that Herodotus is \\"the Father of History\\", so therefore all other \\"ancient\\" histories must have been fabricated even later. Yet, the founders of modern chronology - Scaliger and Petavius - laid their foundations also at the close of the 16th century and had the full corpus of ancient histories already at their disposal.It seems to me that Fomenko has to address these inconsistencies, maybe in the forthcoming 5 volumes?Another critique of their book is that the correspondencies between different rulers are often based on a superficial comparison of the biographies; upon a more thorough comparison many details appear that do not correspond at all.Finally, the authors rely heavily on the works of Gregorovius (1821-1891!!) - his medieval histories of Rome and Athens - as the source of medieval history; these works are - at least in the West - hoplessly outdated and have been superceded by more up-to-date works (for instance, Julius Norwich's trilogy on Byzantine history is not even cited)."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 2","review":"We all know the Biblical tale of Moses upon the fiery mountain. We also know the one about the cities of the plain destroyed in a fiery hailstorm.The believers school of thought accepts everything the Bible says without questioning, whereas the vehement atheists school of thought renounces everything the Book has to say as nonsense, absurdity and malignant spells and stamps it as \\"A Collection of Writings of Unknown Date and Authorship Rendered into English From Supposed Copies of Supposed Originals Unfortunately Lost.\\"The rational person tries to think of what the ancient author(s) could really be referring to. Volcanoes? But there aren't any active volcanoes anywhere in the Middle East - nor Northern Africa.However, there is an exception Vesuvius in Italy. It is at a considerable distance from Palestine, granted. There is one scientist who is brave enough to make the heretical presumption that the real events that became reflected in the Bible really took place elsewhere and some other time. Are the steps of the stoning crowd heard already?If not, it must certainly be stampeding the paper trail of Anatoly Fomenko, one of the world's greatest living mathematicians and the author of the presumptions cited above. The second of seven volumes in his monumental tractate entitled \\"History: Fiction or Science?\\" has just come out in English, and it's the most sensational thing since genetic engineering!For the first time ever exact science extracts from the Bible eventual dates and places where events of the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel have taken place. This volume delivers more in couple of chapters than biblical archeology in the past 200 years."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 2","review":"We can so far divide the New Chronology into the following three parts:a) The verifiable theory that proves consensual chronology wrong with the aid of astronomy, statistics and mathematics;b) The new chronology hypothesis based on a new understanding of known historical facts and the most likely logical explanation of the most obvious inconsistencies inherent in the official version of history;c) The history conjectures, that is experimental historical reconstructions based on assumptions that the authors believe to make sense in the light of their research and linguistic parallels - void of ironclad factual support to date.Fomenko's theory complies with the most rigid scientific standards as a whole:It gives a coherent explanation of what we already know.- It is consistent: independent lines of inquiry all lead to the same conclusion.- The predictions it makes are confirmed empirically.Fomenko goes by the following axioms:- Chronology is the basis of history;- Human evolution has always been linear, gradual and irreversible;- The \\"cyclic\\" nature of human civilization is a myth, likewise all the gaps, duplicates, \\"dark ages\\" and \\"renaissances\\" that we know from consensual history;- The accumulation of geographical knowledge as reflected in cartography is a gradual and irreversible process;- The chronological distance between a given manuscript and the events described therein is proportional to the amount of distortions it contains;- There is no \\"useless\\" information in authentic ancient sources.Why the mainstream historians do not shower mathematician Academician Dr.Prof Fomenko with thanks and laurels?The Russians:Because Fomenko asserts that there was no such thing as the Tartar and Mongol invasion followed by three centuries of slavery, providing a formidable body of documental evidence to prove his assertion. The so-called \\"Tartars and Mongols\\" were the actual ancestors of the modern Russians, living in a bilingual state with Arabic spoken as freely as Russian. The ancient Russian state was governed by a double structure of civil and military authorities. The hordes were actually professional armies with a tradition of lifelong conscription (the recruitment being the so-called \\"blood tax\\"). Their \\"invasions\\" were punitive operations against the regions that attempted tax evasion. Fomenko proves that Russian history as we know it today is a blatant forgery concocted by a host of German scientists brought to Russia by the usurper dynasty of the Romanovs, whose ascension to the throne was the result of coup d'&eacute;tat, charged with the mission of making their reign look legitimate. Fomenko proves Ivan the Terrible to be a collation of four rulers, no less. They represented the two rival dynasties - the legitimate rulers and the ambitious upstarts. The winner took it all! Over some 30 years of controversy, Russian historians have made a most remarkable transition - they were initially accusing the young mathematician Fomenko of anticommunist dissident activity and attempts to deface the historical legacy of Soviet Russia; nowadays the middle-aged mathematician is accused of adhering to \\"pro-communist Russian nationalism\\" and defacing the proud historical legacy of Great Russia.The Westerners:Because Fomenko blows consensual Russian history to smithereens, successfully removing a crucial cornerstone from underneath the otherwise impeccable edifice of World History. Fomenko adds insult to injury, wiping out one by one the Ancient Rome (the foundation of Rome in Italy is dated to the XIV century A. D.), the Ancient Greece and its numerous poleis, which he identifies as the mediaeval crusader settlements on the territory of Greece, and the Ancient Egypt (the pyramids of Giza become dated to the XI-XV century A. D. and identified as the royal cemetery of the Global \\"Mongolian\\" Empire, no less). The civilization of the Ancient Egypt is irrefutably dated to the XII-XV century A. D. with the aid of the ancient Egyptian horoscopes cut in stone. He was the first one to decipher and date all such horoscopes, coming up with mediaeval dates in every case. English historians rage at the suggestion that the history of Ancient England was de facto a Byzantine import transplanted to the English soil by the fugitive Byzantine nobility. To reward the English historians who consider themselves the true scribes of World History, the cover of the present book portrays Tintoretto's Jesus Christ crucified on the Big Ben.The Chinese:Because Fomenko wipes out the Ancient History of China outright. No such thing. Full point. The compilation of the so-called Ancient Chinese History is reliably datable to the XVII-XVIII century only. It is perfectly recognizable as the Ancient European history, reworked and transcribed in hieroglyphs as yet another historical transplantation, this time performed on the Chinese soil by the loving Jesuit hands. The Chinese are the next in line to go berserk. Chinese history is inevitably bound to get both more ancient and more eventful, proportionally to the growing involvement of China in the world affairs. Chinese historians will keep on finding valid proof of prehistoric Chinese spaceflights until the Politburo orders them to shut up.The Arabs:Too bad. Islam with all its key figures is datable to XV-XVI century A. D. Arabic historians may find consolation in the crucial historical role of the Ottoman Empire in the XVI-XVII century. The trouble is that this empire was initially a Christian state, with Hagia Sophia identifiable as Temple of Solomon, according to Fomenko! We can only guess if the acquisition of Alexander the Great (a Macedonian and a Christian) as the founder of the Muslim World Empire will make Fomenko's theories more acceptable to the Arabic mainstream. He certainly does not spare any holy cows at all, claiming The Stone of Qa'Aba in Mecca to contain the lost Arch of the Covenant.The Divinity:Despite of reiterated statement that his theory is all about chronology and not Religion, Fomenko stirs up a whole condominium of wasp nests. His collection of anathemas, fatwa, and other condemnations from all parties concerned is already considerable. Little wonder, considering that the history of religions &agrave; la Fomenko looks as follows: the pre-Christian period (before the XI century and JC), Bacchic Christianity (XI-XII century, before and after JC), JC Christianity (XII-XVI century) and its subsequent mutations into Orthodox Christianity, the Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, and so on.According to Fomenko we know strictly NOTHING about the events that predate the X century A. D.St Augustin was prescient when he spoke unto us: \\"be wary of mathematicians, particularly when they speak the truth.\\""},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?

Chronology 2","review":"This is the second volume in a projected 7-volume series. It's not quite as much fun as the first volume, where Dr. Fomenko outlined his radical historical theories. This is something of an appendix to volume 1, showing how the timelines of the \\"First\\" through \\"Third\\" Roman empires, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Bible are all reflections of events which took place in socalled \\"Medieval\\" times. The reason pre-1600 history tends to move in cycles of about 350 years (punctuated by Dark Ages) is, we are told, because there only is about 350 years of pre-1600 history in the first place.Since I went through the Columbia University's \\"Contemporary Civilization\\" program as an undergraduate, I was personally amused to see that two Classical Greek writers who were conventionally viewed as being ancient and historically inaccurate (though still great)-- i.e., Homer and Herodotus--- are viewed here as being relatively recent and accurate (as well as great.)Fomenko's timeline becomes even more radical in this book: for example, Fomenko now tells us that Jesus probably lived in the 1100s, not the 1000s. And he was Russian.We have a few volumes left before Fomenko gets around to British and American history."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 2","review":"I was somewhat astonished to see a preface concerned with compatibility of astronomy and history .Apparently, mediaeval and \\"ancient\\" chronicles refer to several spectacular solar eclipses accompaning the important events. The heavens validated thus the claim of the party that won the day and time-stampted it. Things celestial were in high demand in 16-17th cy, therefore the scolars \\"confirmed\\" ancient events with a remarkable astronomical phenomena; their learned astrology friends furnished an \\"exact\\" dating for vanity eclipse. This had been the prevailing agenda in the correspondence between the founding father of chronology Joseph Scaliger, a Jesuit, and Johannes Kepler, a fellow Jesuit and the founding father of astronomy.All this \\"science\\" had been approximate, and calculated dates scholastic and arbitrary, the reason being that both the model and data were way too crude. The Apollo missions would have missed the Moon if their trajectory calculation had been based on the Earth-Moon model of the XVI-XVII century.The astronomers knew about lunar tidal friction already in XVIII century, but could not calculate it. In the XVIII-XIX century they tried to use it for calculating \\"historical\\" data, coming up with a horrendous mess as a result. Actually, to make valid reverse calculations of solar eclipses giving precise time, place, phase and duration one needs an atomic clock, a laser, a satellite, a computer and a special software suite. Moreover, such calculations can only be reliable if the Earth-Moon system is stable during the period of research. Fomenko presumes it stable until proven contrary.Once properly recalculated with the aid of modern computers and software, all the \\"ancient\\" eclipses turn out to be mediaeval - or fake.In this volume Fomenko gives his final analysis of the eclipse tried described by Thucydides, dating them to 1039,1046 and 1057 AD, discovers the layered structure of this extremely rare authentic mediaeval manuscript, and attributes the events described therein to 1374-1387 AD. According to Fomenko, the \\"ancient\\" Greek Thucydides describes the Peloponnesian War as the conflict between the mediaeval Navarrans (Spartans) and Catalans (Athenians) in Greece!Fomenko does his best to disentangle the embroidered knots of history, putting his razor-sharp logic to good use. He delivers just as he promises in Volume 1: the Middle Ages are the same epoch as the \\"Antiquity\\", the Second and the Third Roman Empire become doubles, and the Roman Emperors duplicate the Biblical rulers of Israel and Judah to boot. Fomenko asserts that the famous reform of the Occidental Church in alleged XI century by \\"Pope Gregory Hildebrand\\" is the reflection of the XII century reforms of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus, who, in turn, identifies as Jesus Christ as a historical character as opposed to a mythical figure.Ah yes, the great \\"ancient\\" Homer actually lived in XIV century A.D.; and counted the Trojan War; This World War Zero happened in fact in the XIIIth century A.D., the casus belli of WW0 was the first round of division of the proto-Christianity and not the feminine vanity. Period. Let's call it an alternative History for the time being!"},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 2","review":"If you agree with Fomenko that Roman chronology is basically the foundation of the entire edifice of global chronology; you would also certainly agree that despite its numerous gaps and inconsistencies, Roman history is the best-documented field of ancient history, and thus a reference scale. But how well is the actual date of the Eternal City's foundation known?Firstly, Rome is supposed to have been founded by the Trojans who had to flee after the fall of Troy. Some claim Rome to have been founded by Aeneas and Ulysses shortly after Troy had fallen; others are of the opinion that there was an entire dynasty that ruled for 500 years between the fall of Troy and the foundation of Rome.Well, that's just an innocent 500 years long misunderstanding compared with what heretic Fomenko says, asserts, proves in his second volume: Second Roman Empire, Third Roman Empire, Biblical Kingdom of Israel, Biblical Kingdom of Judah, Holy Roman Empire are stories about basically same events, written from different points of view at different times. The underlying events have actually taken place during xii-xv cy. These histories have been written and perfected by multitude of highly talented humanist and clerical writers of xiii-xvi cy disguised as \\"ancients\\" with glorious names like Homer, Pluto, Thucydides etc..Chronology 2.0 beta..Historians are kindly invited to report the bugs."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?

Chronology 2","review":"This is the Second Book in Fomenko's seven book set. I'm not sure if the other books will ever get published in English. Can't say I'm sorry if they don't. This book is more interesting than book 1 which was mostly filled with charts. That doesn't make it better. This one goes into Fomenko's crazy ideas regarding history and why he thinks they make sense.A brief explanation for anyone not familiar with this book. Anatoly Fomenko is a Doctor of Mathematics at Moscow State University. Despite a lack of support from his colleagues (who consider his ideas on history nuts) he published a series of seven books in which he rewrote the history of the world based on his ideas of Statistics. As explained on the back cover of the first book, \\"Jesus Christ was born in 1053 A.D. and crucified in 1086 A.D. The Old Testament refers to mediaeval events. Apocalypse was written after 1486 A.D.\\" The Roman Empire and all of Classical civilization was invented by Jesuit monks who wrote in a remarkably short time all of Western literature and invented an entire civilization which people then immediately forgot never existed. All Classical buildings are simply medieval ones that have been misdated.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. Very sad. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what nationality was Fomenko again?). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and have existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many \\"Roman\\" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. I'm not sure where Latin came from but the Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.You don't even have to wait for the book to begin for the errors to creep in. The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any \\"facts\\" or \\"historical personages\\" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books (there are seven at last counting) are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA Untrustworthy Liars) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. Linguistically too he is a dunce since he views all languages as being mere corruptions of the original Russian. Linguistics after all, is not a science. Neither is Art, Archaeology, Sociology, Geneology, or Anthropology. Thus they are worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong..To cut history down to size he finds parallels and then compacts them into reflections of the same event. A few examples:Both Augustus and Constantine relied on the military to get them into power (page 12). Good point Dr. Fomenko. Good point.\\"Second Empire. 'Right after the death of Augustus, who had left no direct heir... the issue of succession arose immediately' ([767], Volume 2, page 412). A struggle for power begins. In face of the uncertainty concerning the identity of his successor, Tiberius, having acceded to the throne, had to fight other pretenders, Germanicus in particular, 'on equal terms'.Third Empire. Constantine I leaves no direct heir, but 'dividing the empire between his three sons and two nephews' ([327], page 438). Naturally, after the death of Constantine I, a furious power struggle had flared up. Constantine I had brought major confusion afoot, since he had specified no single successor to the throne. Constantius II, having captured 'Constantinople, exterminated the families of the two stepbrothers of Constantine' ([327], page 438).\\" (page 15)See how annoying these references are? I'll skip them from now on. Minor problems: Augustus specified his heir. It was Tiberius. There was no dispute from any other potential candidates since they were all dead. Germanicus was Tiberius' adopted son. The difference between that and three sons fighting for the throne is self-evident, especially since they just divided it anyway.\\"Belisarius is a military leader. Justinian is an emperor. The relationship is initially a benevolent one, but ends in a quarrel.Caesar is a military leader. Pompey is a number one public figure. Friends initially, foes eventually.Achilles is a military leader. Agamemnon is the 'principal royalty'. Friends at first, enemies afterwards.Valerius is a military leader, while Tarquin the Proud is the 'main king'. Hostile in the beginning; mortal enemies afterwards.\\" (page 195)Now let me try one: General McChrystal is a military leader. President Obama is a 'president.' The relationship is initially a benevolent one, but ends in a quarrel. Hey, that's kinda fun! Good thing there can't possibly be more than one person that vague and unconvincing comparison could describe.And my personal favorite: \\"Second Empire. A while ago Tiberius was adopted by Octavian Augustus ([767], Volume 2, page 412). Tiberius is known to have died being 'strangled with blankets.' In a sense, this death may be considered unexpected.Third Empire. Constantius II is the son of Constantine I. Constantius II, as historians tell us, 'died unexpectedly.'\\" (page 15)Death by blankets is 'unexpected' now? What gives? Seriously, how a dying 78 year old man being hurried to his death can be compared with a 44 year old man dying of an illness in the prime of life is beyond me.So now you see the problems with his comparisons. They're either hopelessly vague or they take one case and force it to fit another. So basically what Fomenko has shown is that human life is repetitive. Even that he can't do without messing with the evidence. And speaking of the evidence, there is something seriously wrong with his way of footnoting. In the bibliography at the back he assigns every book a number and then uses that number in the text. I don't know if that's standard for Russian Mathematical works but it certainly isn't for English historical ones. Or French ones. Or German ones.. Or Italian ones... And there's a good reason no one uses it, it's confusing. You have to go all the way to the back of the book and scroll through hundreds of books to find the one you want, only to find that it's in Russian anyway and hasn't been updated since before the Russian Revolution. There are actually a large number like that. 767 is from 1938 which makes it relatively new. I guess he didn't want to use any books he hadn't already read in childhood. This sourcing method is really frustrating when he gives non-standard citations for standard sources. For example: Plutarch. Fomenko states that Plutarch calls Sulla an Emperor. Since such an office didn't exist in the Republic I decided to look up what word he was mistaking for 'Emperor.' But the citation is this: ([660], Vol. 2, pages 137-138). If you look that up in the Bibliography you find: Plutarch, Comparative Biographies, Vol. 1: Moscow, USSR AN Press, 1961. Since I don't read Russian I have no way of finding that page. This is why proper historians use chapters and verse (like the Bible) to identify their sources. These don't vary with the translations. And while it's hard to judge from a title, that book doesn't sound like it's in Greek. Which means that he's basing his statement about a technical term on a book that translated that technical term for him. The point is that I can't check up on it since he does such a bad job with his sources.A few examples of Fomenko's bias and standards of evidence. Brutus is associated with a whole slew of people because Fomenko decides his name comes from 'brat' which means brother. The problem is that 'brat' is a RUSSIAN word meaning brother. He passes by that without question but he's basically assuming that Russian is the originator of all languages. That would be like me claiming Caesar was a sailor since his name is similar to the word 'sea.' It is decidedly typical of Fomenko's extreme nationalistic agenda to assume that everything revolves around the Russians. A minor example of his standards, but an amusing one for me, is his statement that Caesar was called Emperor on coins decades before that office even existed. This is particularly amusing for me since Caesar BECAME the word for emperor as did Augustus after his successor. The Romans never really developed a word for Emperor outside of using those two names. It'd be like claiming that Martin Luther King can't have been from the '60s since America wasn't a monarchy at that time. This is the same question I asked above from his references to Plutarch. The word he's probably referring to though is Imperator which means general, not Emperor. Eventually the Emperors would associate that word so strongly with their power that it would become impossible to untangle it but that was centuries in the future. Another possibility is that it refers to the title of princeps which means the first man of the state. While Augustus made that title a permanent feature of Imperial titulature it originally meant exactly what it said. The leader of the senate had been called the princeps senatus for ages. For Plutarch the options are autocrator (Greek for Imperator), Sebastocrator (Augustus), Kaisar (Caesar), or basileos (king). Since he doesn't say which word it is all that can be done is guess. Fomenko's Latin is apparently as bad as his translator's English.What this book consists of is basically a detailed explanation of the charts from the last book along with some new ones. These explanations actually make less sense than the bare charts themselves and show what a truly horrid grasp Fomenko has of the history he's trying to demolish. Starting at the beginning (p. 2) with the Romans his division of their history (which he treats as standard) makes no sense. I wonder if Russian historians divide it this way but I can't see any practical benefit so I'll dismiss it as more of his crazy ramblings. He considers there to have been three Roman Empires, one from 743-509 BC, the second from 83 BC-217 AD, and the third one from 270-526 AD. The first one makes some sense although why he divides them into separate empires instead of just periods of the same empire is beyond me. The first 'Empire' is what historians would call the regal period from Romulus to Tarquinius Superbus. This was back when Rome was ruled by kings in the mists of prehistory and myth. The second empire makes no sense. First off he starts in the late Republic and ends in the middle of the Empire without even seeming to notice the change. Secondly, the event he chooses to start off with (Sulla's rule of Rome) is not really the event that marked a new era so much as an attempt to hold onto the old one. Similarly Caracalla's death at the end of it doesn't really signify any changes although it is symptomatic of the difficulties that Rome was having. It should start with Caesar or Augustus and end at Commodus or Alexander Severus. The third empire makes even less sense. Starting with Aurelian makes a bit of sense I suppose since he began Rome's recovery, but again it was Diocletian who really set up the new model empire and not Aurelian. Ending it with Theodoric makes even less sense since he wasn't an Emperor of Rome but a successor king to the Italian peninsula. Apart from the first one these divisions are entirely arbitrary and pointless.So what's the first part of his long-winded justification say? Sulla equals Aurelian. Oh that's why he did it. Bravo good sir. Well done. Find two people renowned for their cruelty and force them to merge into one. That's exactly the kind of wooly thinking I've come to expect from these books. As usual Fomenko has forced a parallel without mentioning that he's changing things around to do so. Ignoring the fact that Aurelian's reputation for cruelty comes from theHistoria Augusta, which is just as pseudo-historical as this work, the simple fact of the matter is that the two have basically nothing else in common. Sulla's reforms vanished within a decade of his (natural) death while Aurelian's paved the way for his more successful successor Diocletian. Following this we again see Fomenko's number fudging. The most obvious example in this chart consists of his sticking \\"Strife\\" into his charts every time he feels the need to make things match. Either that or he thinks there were a large number of emperors with the name 'Strife.' Further examples include his use of Sertorius as a counterpoint to Probus. Probus was indeed a 3rd Century emperor but Sertorius was a Roman rebel, albeit a famous and not wholly despised one. Given the number of Roman armies sent against him it seems hard to believe that he was ruling Rome from all the way over in Spain. Diocletian and Constantius Chlorus is also radically altered. Again Fomenko has distorted the facts to make it fit by removing participants. Diocletian had three colleagues not merely one. What's more Constantius wasn't his main colleague but merely his junior partner. Maximian was Diocletian's partner in government and he ruled not from 293-305 but from 286. But using him would throw Fomenko's calculation off, especially given how much importance he gives to Constantius. He calls Constantius Caesar's double (p. 11) even though he did nothing to merit such a comparison. When Diocletian resigns he lists one of his periods of strife and says that Constantius conquers the Tetrarchy as Caesar conquers the Triumvirate. Both are wrong but to focus on Constantius all that he does to conquer the tetrarchy is die. Within a year of Diocletian's resignation he's dead so how he's able to posthumously conquer the tetrarchy is beyond me. Inasmuch as the tetrarchy was destroyed not conquered (which may be a translation issue) it was done by Constantius' son Constantine who spent not four years but twenty changing the tetrarchy into a monarchy. As for Caesar he didn't conquer or even destroy the triumvirate. It was never a formal system. When Crassus died in 53 and Pompey refused to grant Caesar a consulship in 50 the alliance ended. If anyone 'conquered' it it was Pompey who maintained his authority by denying Caesar protection from his enemies. So while I suppose Constantine could be compared to Caesar his father can't which ruins Fomenko's 'theory' by throwing the dates off. An amusing association is between Caligula and Julian. Caligula was a well-known sadistic tyrant (although Fomenko says little is known of him) while Julian was an (over)educated man who tried to bring paganism back. But of course they're the same person because they both wore the military sandals (caligae) which gave Caligula his name. The fact that all Roman Emperors wore such sandals while on campaign is skimmed over. Just so you can see what one of his charts looks like I'm copying this one out in full. There's a visual that goes with it but there's only so much I can do with text. It's somewhat better translated than the one from the last book so I do at least know who the people he's naming are, which just makes it easier to spot how far off he is.__________________________________________________________Fomenlo's Roman Chart (With Added Comments and Corrected Dates. Misspelled names are corrected in []):Sulla, ruled four years (82-78 BC)Aurelian, ruled 5 years (270-275 AD)-Sulla became dictator in 82 and resigned in 81 (1 year)-Correct (5 years)Strife, less than one year (78-77 BC)Strife, less than one year (275-276 AD)-No Strife at all (0 years)-Tacitus was emperor, though not for long (I'll give him his 1 year)Sertorius, 6 years (78-72 BC)Probus, 6 years (276-282 AD)-Famous Roman rebel in Spain. Did NOT rule Rome. Active from 83-72 (Active 11 years. Ruled Rome 0 years)-Correct (6 years)Strife, 2 years (72-71 BC)Strife, 2 years (282-284 AD)-Spartacus Rebellion 73-71 (3 years)-Carus ruled. No strife (Actually 0 years)Pompey the Great, 21 years (70-49 BC)Diocletian the Divine(?), 21 years (284-305 AD)-Pompey was never unopposed. Spent most of his time at war (Influential for 21 years)-Diocletian had colleagues. Only sole ruler for 2 years (Co-ruled for 21 years)Joint rule of Pompey and Caesar (first triumvirate), 11 years (60-49 BC)Joint rule of Diocletian and Constantius Chlorus (first tetrarchy), 12 years (293-305 AD)-Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar had loose alliance from 60 on. The reason that it's called a triumvirate is that there were three of them. trio=three viri=men. It was never an official term. Crassus died in 53 (7 years)-Diocletian ruled with Maximian from 286, Constantius and Galerius from 293. All ruled at same time. There was also never a second tetrarchy (Ruled with Maximian 19 years)Strife, 4 years (49-45 BC)Strife, 4 years (305-309 AD)-Civil War lasted from 52-46 (6 years)-Relative peace. More damningly nothing happened in 309 to validate a change from strife to non-strife. The date is chosen simply to match the first one (0 years)Julius Caesar, the conqueror of first triumvirate, 1 year (45-44 BC)Constantius Chlorus, the conqueror of first tetrarchy, 1 year (305-306 AD)-Caesar had been ruling since at least 48. Held Rome since 52. And he never conquered the triumvirate since he was in it (4-8 years)-Chlorus only just promoted to Augustus. Again, there only ever WAS one tetrarchy. And Constantius was a tetrarch till he died (1 year)Triumvirate, 17 years (44-27 BC)Tetrarchy, 18 years (306-324 AD)-Antony dead by 30. Who were the other two triumvirs supposed to be? (Octavian unopposed 14 years)-Tetrarchy died when Constantine killed Maxentius in 312 (6 years)Augustus, the conqueror of the second triumvirate, 41 years (27 BC-14 AD) or 37 years (23 BC-14 AD)Constantine, the conqueror of the second tetrarchy, 31 years (306-307[337?] AD) or 24 years (313-337) or 13 years (324-337) where 324 marks the death of Licinius-Killed Antony in 30, but if he counts the period of co-rule with Constantine they why not with Augustus who ruled (or co-ruled) from 44 BC-14 AD? (58 years including co-rule. 44 sole rule)-Doesn't the fact that he can have three different sets of dates for the same event, none of which match Augustsus, kind of show you how seriously messed up his process is? (31 years including co-rule. 13 years sole rule)Please note what he does here. Constantine overlaps with the last one but Augustus doesn't. He's just removed 17 years without comment. You'll see more of that in a bitThe birth of Jesus Christ in the 27th year of Augustus (0 AD)The birth of St. Basil the Great (the Great King) in the 27th year of Constantine (330 AD)-Probably off (Herod died in 2 BC) but it is the traditional date.-No way. Basil was born in 303. Constantine was still serving under Diocletian at that time. Also, \\"The Great King\\"? Where does that come from?Tiberius, 23 years (14-17[37] AD)Constantius II, 24 years (337-361 AD) or 21 years (340-361)-Correct (23 years)-Correct (24 years)Struggle between Tiberius and Germanicus, 13 years (6-19 AD)Struggle between Constantius II and Constance[Constans], 13 years (337-350 AD)-Germanicus rose to command in 14. Tiberius didn't rule till 14 either (5 years)-Constans is correct but he left out third brother Constantine II (13 years)Caligula, 4 years (37-41 AD)Julian, 2 years (361-363 AD)-True (4 years)-True (2 years)Strife, less than one year (41 AD)Strife, less than one year (363 AD)-Claudius succeeded immediately after. No \\"Strife\\" (0 years)-The \\"Strife\\" was Jovian's rule which he will list later (1 years)Claudius, 13 years (41-54 AD)Valentinian, 11 years (364-375 AD)-True (13 years)-True (11 years)Joint rule of Claudius and Pallantius within the \\"triumvirate\\", not more than 13 years (41-54 AD)Joint rule of Valentinian and Valens within the \\"triumvirate\\", 11 years (367-375)-Pallantius never ruled. Also, there was no triumvirate after Augustus. Fomenko has no idea what he's talking about (0 years)-Valens ruled from 364. Not sure why he changed it. 14 years is closer to 13 than 11 (14 years)Nero, 14 years (54-68)Valens, 14 years (364-378)-True (14 years)-True, but remember: Valens was only co-ruler. And a junior one at that (14 years)Joint rule of Nero with Burrus and Seneca, 8 years (54-62)Joint rule of Valens with Valentinian and Gratian, 11 years (364-375)-Burrus and Seneca never ruled (0 years)-Gratian didn't rule until after this time (0 years) Finally, a Match!Joint rule of Nero and Seneca, 11 years (54-65)Joint rule of Valens and Gratian, 11 years (367-378)-Seneca never ruled (0 years)-Gratian didn't rule until 375 (3 years)Galba, 1 year (68-69)Jovian, 1 year (363-364)-True (1 year)-I can't help but notice that Galba came after Nero while Jovian came before Valens. He's changing the order of dates again to make them fit. Also, he already listed Jovian's reign under a period of \\"strife\\" earlier (1 year)Strife, less than 1 year (69)Strife, less than 1 year (378)-True, though it lasted MORE than one year (1 year)-True, though again, it lasted MORE than one year. Gothic War not ended until 382 (4 years)Two Vespasians, 12 years (69-81)Gratian and Valentinian II (after the death of Valens), 13 years (379-392)-True (12 years)-Gratian died in 383 (4 years)Domitian, 15 years (81-96)Theodosius the Great, 16 years (379-395)-True (15 years)-True, though please note the comparison. Domitian was a persecutor while Theodosius was THE Orthodox Christian ruler after Constantine. Is this comparison one that Christian authors would wish to make? (16 years)Nerva, 2 years (96-98)Eugenius, 2 years (392-394)-True (2 years)-Eugenius isn't an emperor and 'rules' during Theodosius' rule.

Chronology 2","review":"Length:: 8:32 MinsNew Chronology is a theory validated by astronomical research and statistical analysis of ancient manuscripts that asserts: that Antiquity and Dark Ages are phantoms invented in the 16th 18th centuries. Human civilization is barely 1000 years old!New Chronology complies with the most rigid scientific standards:- It gives a coherent explanation of what we already know;- It is consistent: independent lines of inquiry all lead to the same conclusion;- The predictions it makes are confirmed empirically;New Chronology goes by the following basic axioms:- Chronology is the basis of history;- Human evolution has always been linear, gradual and irreversible;- The \\"cyclic\\" nature of human civilization is a myth, likewise all the gaps, duplicates, \\"dark ages\\" and \\"renaissances\\" that we know from consensual history are fantasy and hoax;- The accumulation of geographical knowledge as reflected in cartography is a gradual and irreversible process;- The closer in time is a given manuscript to the events described the less distortions it contains;- There is no \\"useless\\" information in authentic ancient sources.Fomenko asserts: There was no such thing as the Tartar and Mongol invasion followed by over two centuries of yoke and slavery, providing a formidable body of documental evidence to prove his assertion. The so-called \\"Tartars and Mongols\\" were the actual ancestors of the modern Russians, living in a trilingual state with Arabic and Turkic spoken as freely as Russian. The ancient Russian state was governed by a double structure of civil and military authorities. The hordes were actually professional armies with a tradition of lifelong conscription (the recruitment being the so-called \\"blood tax\\"). Their \\"invasions\\" were punitive operations against the regions that attempted tax evasion. Fomenko proves that official Russian history is a blatant forgery concocted by a host of German scholars brought to Russia by the usurper dynasty of the Romanovs. Their ascension to the throne was the result of conspiracy, so they charged these imported historians with the mission of making Romanov's reign look legitimate.Fomenko proves Ivan the Terrible to be a collation of four rulers, no less. They represented the two rival dynasties - the legitimate Godunov rulers and the ambitious Romanov upstarts.As Fomenko blows consensual Russian history to smithereens, he successfully removes a crucial cornerstone from underneath the otherwise impeccable edifice of World History. Fomenko adds insult to injury, wiping out one by one: the Ancient Rome: the foundation of Rome in Italy is dated to the 14th century A. D., the Ancient Greece and its numerous poleis, which he identifies as the mediaeval crusader settlements on the territory of Greece.The Ancient Egypt: the pyramids of Giza become dated to the 11th to 14th century A. D. and identified as the royal cemetery of the Global \\"Mongolian\\" Empire, no less. The civilization of the Ancient Egypt is irrefutably dated to the 11th to 15th century A. D. with the aid of the ancient Egyptian horoscopes cut in stone, like enormous Dendera horoscope that hangs in main entrance to the Louvre museum in Paris.He was the first one to decipher and date unambiguously all such horoscopes, coming up with mediaeval dates in every case.English historians rage at the suggestion that the history of Ancient England was de facto a Byzantine import transplanted to the English soil by the fugitive Byzantine nobility. To reward the English historians who consider themselves the true scribes of World History, the cover of the book \\"History: Fiction or Science?\\" portrays Tintoretto's Jesus Christ crucified on the Big Ben.Fomenko wipes out the Ancient History of China outright. No such ancient history. Period. The compilation of the so-called Ancient Chinese History is reliably datable to the 17th 18th century only. It is perfectly recognizable as the Ancient European history, reworked and transcribed in hieroglyphs as yet another historical transplantation, this time performed on the Chinese soil by the loving Jesuit hands. The Chinese are the next in line to go berserk. Chinese history is inevitably bound to get both more ancient and more eventful, proportionally to the growing involvement of China in the world affairs. Chinese historians will keep on finding valid proof of prehistoric Chinese spaceflights until the Politburo orders them otherwise.Islam with all its key figures appears as late as 15th-16th century A. D. as a branch of proto-Christianity. This is amply illustrated by imagery of Prophet Mahomet, archangel Gabriel, Heaven and Hell of this period. In today's Islam all imagery of the things living is taboo.Arabic historians may find consolation in the crucial historical role of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th 17th century. The trouble is that this empire was initially a proto Christian state, with Hagia Sophia identifiable as Temple of Solomon, according to Fomenko! We can only guess if the acquisition of Alexander the Great (a Macedonian and a Christian!) as the founder of the Muslim World Empire will make Fomenko's theories more acceptable to the Arabic mainstream. He certainly does not spare any holy cows at all, claiming The Stone of Qa'Aba in Mecca to contain the lost Arch of the Covenant.The history of religions according to Fomenko looks as follows: the pre-Christian period (before the 11th century and Jesus Christ ), Bacchic Christianity (11th to 12th century, before and after Jesus Christ), Jesus Christ Christianity (12th to 14th century) and its subsequent mutations (15th to 17th) into Orthodox Christianity, the Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism, and so on..Saint Augustine was quite prescient when he said: \\"be wary of mathematicians,.. particularly when they speak the truth.\\"Henry Ford once said: \\"History is more or less bunk!\\"Prominent mathematician Anatoly Fomenko not only proved it for a fact, but as true scientist tried to upgrade it into a rocket science.This book will change your perception of History forever!What if Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt were invented during Renaissance?What if The Old Testament was a rendition of events of the Middle Ages?What if Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086 AD?Sounds Unbelievable?Not after you've read \\"History: Fiction or Science?\\" by Anatoly Fomenko, the genius mathematician.Armed with astronomy and computers Anatoly Fomenko turns History into a rocket science."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"Unrelieved dreariness and misery. I kept on reading hoping the story would pick up and there would be at least one bright spot or two but there was none. There was no pleasure in reading this book."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"This is Joyce Carol Oates&#65533; second published novel. It is where she proved her ability to write a powerful epic as she would later do again in novels such as Bellefleur. It follows the life of Clara, a woman born to migrant workers in the midst of the Depression. She is born appropriately in the middle of a violent accident. Here we see the delicacy and terrifying indifference of human life swept up in a sea of natural transformation. Children, parents and friends die in this bleak Darwinian environment. It is part of the course and they must accept it as they move to the next field where labour is required. Clara grows into a defensive and powerful woman bent on carving a safe space for herself in this harsh world. She falls in love with a man named Lowry who is independent and intelligent. Through him Clara establishes a new life for herself. Only after the birth of their son, Swan (Steven), must she make the decision whether to join with a wealthy restricted life with a man named Revere or lead a life of tumultuous romance with Lowry. Through Swan, Clara attempts to realise all the desires for living which were denied to her in her restricted upbringing. However, Swan, intelligent and emotional, has desires of an entirely different sort. This is a compelling novel that knowledgably explores the multifarious stages of life: the tense exploration of childhood, the embittered compromises of adulthood and the difficult choices we must make to survive. It is a beautifully crafted work."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates revised and rewrote The Garden of Earthly Delights; this new version was just published in 2003 under the Modern Library 20th century rediscovered. (This was the author's second novel originally published in 1966.)The novel follows the life of Clara Walpole, born in a ditch to migrant workers during the Great Depression. She grows up moving from camp to camp, picking when children are allowed to pick, and going to school when required. There are four important men in her life, and no important women.There's her father. He loves Clara, but not her brothers, and not her mother. Her mother is worn out and dies leaving Clara to take care of her brothers. Her father brings Nancy into the household. He needs to have a woman. Clara learns about incest when her friend Rosalie's father is taken by the KKK. Terror reigns in the camp. The men think that they can do nothing, perhaps because they think it is a just punishment for getting his daughter pregnant, or perhaps because they fear the Klan.Shortly after that incident, Clara goes into town and meets Lowry, who takes her away with him. Joyce Carol Oates does the unexpected. She makes Lowry a decent sort of chap. Lowry sets Clara up in his home town. He gets her a job, and a place to stay. Lowry tells Clara that she needs to lie; she must tell everyone that she is sixteen years old. Otherwise, she will end up in an orphanage. Of course Clara is in love.Then there is Revere, both wealthy and married. And finally there is Clara's son, Swan.Interwoven with these men are four Claras. There is Clara the child, Clara the teenager, Clara the woman, and finally, Clara as worn out as her mother was when she died.I love reading Joyce Carol Oates. Although she is unique, sometimes she reminds me of Steinbeck, and sometime she reminds me of Stephen King. But, in The Garden of Earthly Delights, she reminds me of Barbara Kingsolver. If you enjoy great writing, and a terrific story, you will enjoy this book.I highly recommend The Garden of Earthly Delights."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"This book combines the best of all things Oatesian. If released as a new work today, it would blast through the awards committees faster than a Philip Roth masterpiece. This reworking of Oates's second novel seamlessly integrates the fire of her yuthful writing, full of her own personal experiences, with the seasoned mastery of her later writing style. This completely rewritten book is ultimately satisfying because there is nothing to overlook due to inexperienced enthusiasm (like many of her early works). If anyone is considering an Oates novel to explore her for the first time, to bring into a summer reading program for youth, or to round out a high school curriculum, this is your book. For anyone who already loves her unique style and phenomenal skill, going back to this early novel will satisfy your cravings like nothing else in the world. This is Oates at her best. Though her murder stories (Zombie and the Rosamond Smith serial killer series) and child abuse novels (First Love, Beasts, and You Must Remember This) provide more of her famous poignant horror, Garden of Earthly Delights carries the weight of John Steinbeck's East of Eden. You can't get better than this for mastery of the classic mid 20th century novel form."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"I believe I read this book some years ago, but forgot that I had, as Joyce Carol Oates has rewritten it. It is a wonderful story about migrant farm workers living during the depression, and what one of the characters, Clara, the daughter, does to get away from this miserable existence to a place where she feels she has some power. In essence, this book is the story of a woman who is realized by the company she keeps (the men in her life)...all of them are interesting characters, and bring out both of her worst and best values ...The ending is devastating, profound...and a surprise...Joyce Carol Oates has written a riveting story in her 30s, and has rewritten it so well, and so profoundly that you can't imagine not being part of the people and places she takes you into..."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"The plot was all right, but I was most impressed by Ms. Oates's lyrical use of language. She has the ability to transform the most mundane actions, feelings, or settings into something that seems really unusual or noteworthy just by describing it a certain way. I love the way the the main character, Clara, sees the world...it is very refreshing and unusual. I can't really tell if the awesome descriptions throughout the book are because of Clara's candid and innocent way of seeing the world, or because of Oates's special way with words. It's nothing big really. Throughout the book, she notes the little things, like how the migrant farm workers don't care how they look while picking fruit, and how they make weird faces as they think things to themselves or how they mumble sorta as they replay conversations that theyve had in their minds. But for me, it's the little things like that that make a book really come alive. This novel is full of really sweet quotes, and the language just really blew me away."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"This book has recently been rewritten by Ms. Oates. I am reviewing the original version. I suggest that you begin with this one, and move on to the revision if you like this edition.A Garden of Earthly Delights looks at life's challenges as seen by an exploited, powerless woman who lacks a religious foundation . . . but has a crude beauty and appeal that are irresistible to men. Through her eyes, we see the importance of being self-confident and focusing on the main chance . . . whatever that might be. In the process, her heart is darkened and her life damaged by the hard choices she has had to make. That darkness and damage seep out of her to contaminate those around her. In the end, a fresh young beauty leaves behind her a morass of rotting vegetation.The book has three parts. In the first part, we meet Clara Walpole who is the much-loved daughter of her father, Carleton Walpole, who is a rough and tumble migrant farm worker who drags his wife and family behind him like torn cobwebs as he focuses on his own pleasure. The family gradually disintegrates under the pressure of the hard living and Carleton's inability to provide loving support. In the second part, Clara develops relationships with two other men as a teenager after she leaves her family. In the third part, Clara devotes her life to her son, Swan (aka Steven), who must stake a life for himself in Clara's husband's family. Each of these parts is written like a novella, but the three are connected through Clara.The first part struck me as extremely fine writing of the sort that reminded me of John Steinbeck's novels about migrant farm workers. Unlike Mr. Steinbeck, Ms. Oates has a way of capturing only moments and events that crystallize our understanding of her characters and their lives. To me, reading this part was like occasionally glimpsing through a peephole into someone's life . . . but only at the most revealing moments. Interestingly, Clara often doesn't quite know what's happening since she has had both a deprived childhood and is a child. You as the reader have to interpret what is happening, which makes for a story element that makes the book read a little like detective fiction. This aspect of the book reminded me of William Faulkner's writing about the Snopes. If the book stopped with part one, I would have rated it as five stars and praised the book to the heavens. But I would have wondered what happened next to Clara.In the second part, we find out how a young teenager builds a life for herself through the aid of Lowry, the man who helps her escape from her family. To me, Lowry is the most interesting character in the book. Ms. Oates reveals his nature very slowly, and he brings many surprises to the story. Although deeply flawed as a person, he tries to do the right things for Clara . . . and ends up leaving her at a very difficult crossroads. From her experiences with him, she learns the duality of love/hate that comes to dominate her life. This part of the book is very fine and I highly recommend it.In the third part of the book, Ms. Oates seems to fall into clich&eacute;s. Everything is so foreshadowed that I felt like I could have written out the plot in detail before reading it. There were few surprises, and those were unimportant. I would have enjoyed the book much more if I had skipped this part. I would rate the third part as a two star book if it were a stand-alone. Unless you feel compelled to find out what happens to Clara and her son, I suggest that you consider skipping this part. Perhaps you could read the first 25 pages to see how it sits with you.As I finished the book, I came away thinking how important it is that those who are deprived of love and care receive attention from everyone else. One of the book's lessons, however, is that such attention must be effective . . . rather than simply well-meaning . . . or it will do more harm than good."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"In the character of Clara Walpole, Joyce Carol Oates creates the type of seemingly independent yet inexorably doomed heroine that would reappear in various guises in her many subsequent novels. The novel's title is, perhaps, an oblique reference to the garden behind the house where Clara lives alone with her son (\\"It was a large garden for just a woman to handle . . . But it was her garden . . .\\"). There's a hint of Virginia Woolf here; Clara has not only a room but also a garden of her own, and it's hers to till (or to neglect) as she sees fit. But, more famously, it refers to a famous triptych (triple-paneled) painting by Hieronymus Bosch that, when opened, reveals a crowded panoply depicting the progression of the world from creation and simplicity to temptation and luxury to damnation and ruin--and that alone should give a clue as to where this novel is heading.Oates presents Clara's overstuffed life triptych-style, each part named after three of the men in her life: her father, her largely absent lover, and her son. We watch Clara progress over the course of three decades from daughter in a large Depression-era family sired by an alcoholic migrant worker; to her escape with an unreliable dreamer; to a small-town store clerk with the possibility of betterment; to a self-sufficient housekeeper who is, nevertheless, a nominally \\"kept woman\\" and a town pariah of sorts. Having a place (or garden) of her own doesn't allow her to escape entirely from the expectations and strictures of society. She eventually instills her own thwarted ambitions in her son's future--and therein lies the novel's seemingly preordained fate, unveiled in a climax that, while somewhat expected, is still shocking. Here is Oates at her best, propelling the reader to an ending that manages to be both startling and entirely foreseeable.\\"Garden\\" is the first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet, yet the four novels are related only by their epic breadth and themes. I don't think they were conceived or marketed as a quartet until relatively recently; in fact, my 1992 edition of \\"Expensive People\\" mentions only \\"an informal, thematically (but not literally) integrated trilogy of novels\\"--a grouping that excludes \\"Wonderland,\\" the title novel of her alleged quartet. Earlier editions make no such claim for the books at all. In other words, you don't need to read the four novels in any particular order--nor do you need to read all four--to appreciate the power of each of them.Along the same lines, I read \\"Garden\\" in the version Oates heavily revised in 2002--and I almost wished I hadn't. The original novel was, after all, critically acclaimed and a National Book Award finalist, alongside such eminent selections as Chaim Potok's \\"The Chosen,\\" William Styron's \\"Confessions of Nat Turner,\\" and the eventual winner, Thornton Wilder's \\"The Eighth Day.\\" (The remaining finalist was Norman Mailer's politically shrewd but literarily hopeless Vietnam novel.) In such company, it must have been seen as a superb, groundbreaking novel written by a writer barely thirty and bursting anew onto the scene. What we have here is an excellent, mature novel by an established author in her sixties (and, in fact, Elaine Showalter notes in an introduction that Oates has introduced echoes of Oates's late novel \\"Blonde\\"). Oates is hardly alone among authors in the desire to re-conceptualize, revise, and reissue their novels (see: Henry James), and one certainly can't fault her for wanting to improve her early work. But there's nevertheless something to be said for reading the version that captured the attention of so many readers when it was first issued."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"One of the most intense and riveting novels in over a decade on the human condition, this masterpiece will have a memorable and perhaps lasting impact on some of the readers, especially in the times we live in today. Extremely powerful, and metaphorically-speaking, the story caused this reader at times to shield my eyes from the glare emanating from the pages. The subject matter addresses the plight of some of the casualties of the Big Depression, in this case the Walpole family and the cruel hardships that Carleton Walpole, the father, his wife and children, and many other migrant farm workers endured during that era. Oates addresses the consequences of these realities, the aftermath in the years to follow, and introduces us to Clara Walpole, with an in-depth portrayal of this young woman, who rises as a beautiful lily from the ravages of ruined soil and extreme poverty, and the complex men in her life, starting with her father, lover, husband, and her son, Swan. Born in 1938, Joyce Carol Oates, a recognized American literary lioness, may be termed as a 'Child of The Depression', and while deeply moved and fascinated by her complex novel, it occurred to this reader that her book must have involved not only immense research on her part, but also first-hand knowledge of some kind, and personal experiences of her own. This was later acknowledged by her in her concise afterword, as she chose to rewrite this second novel of hers in 2002. Beautifully reasoned with profound insight, \\"A Garden of Earthly Delights\\" evokes a harvest of conflicting emotions, and carries a strength and truth of its own that might be intimidating and certainly sobering for some of its readership in this particular day and age. It is simply magnificent and the work of a genius."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"Clara, the protagonist of Joyce Carol Oates's breakthrough novel \\"A garden of earthly delights\\" is asked at some point of her life why she wants to be different. To which she replies: \\"I guess I don't want to be different\\". This comes only after a pause for consideration, since the one who asked the question is a man with whom she wants to be involved. He is rich and she is a single mother - he can help her a lot. Her answer comes after considering \`he liked her the way she was'.This is one of the central points of Oates's ultrarealistic novel about reinvention of one's self in order to achieve a higher status, a better life. It is the first book of the \\"Wonderland\\" quartet which also comprises \\"Expensive people\\", \\"them\\" and \\"Wonderland\\". This is the second novel written by this writer to see the light of the day - the second of very many, since she is such a prolific author.From this novel, the reader can notice that from the beginning Oates has had a distinguished voice. The realism - of characters and situations - dominates the narrative. Clara's moving up, but she is not always conscious of her steps. Not until the middle section of the book, when she has a child, is abandoned by the baby's father and becomes lover of a married man does she realize the materialistic world that surrounds her.Clara is the main character of the novel, but each of the three sections deals with how she relates to the men from her life. The first one is her father - who loves her more than anyone else in his life. In the middle segment, the protagonist gives everything up to live with the man she loves. And, finally, in the third chapter of her life, how Clara her relationship with her growing son affects her life.When Clara asks herself if life \`is a sequence of accidents and nothing more', the reader know this is an irony from the writer. The narrative is seriously meditated, and, although not all events have a second meaning, most of them are more the mere accidents in the life of the characters. They resonate and acquire a deeper meaning, a sense or a need of changing - not always for the best."},{"Title":"A Garden of Earthly Delights (Fawcett Crest Book)","review":"I am a very big Joyce Carol Oates fan, however, I was a little dissapointed in this one. Don't get me wrong it was still a good read and included her trademark detailed description, as well as intricate character development. The problem for me was mainly the ending. It almost seemed like Oates could not think of a way to tie everything up neatly so she relied on an over used cliche to be done with it. If you are an Oates fan you will enjoy it simply to see how she revamped one of her earliest novels, but I would not suggest this one to those who are new to her work."},{"Title":"Install, Configure, and Customize Corel Linux","review":"Corel Linux is tough to upgrade because it was based on the Debian &quot;Slink&quot; release and now most Debian packages have been recompiled for the &quot;Potato&quot; release.

Daniel M. Dumych has brilliantly captured the late Victorian Era when the Falls were exploited for their money-making potential and raw power. He reverently shows how the first power project (Schoellkopf Station) was built and eventually destroyed by the collapse of the wall of the Niagara Gorge; the bustle and entertainment of Falls Street during the first half of the 20th Century; the awe as the current Niagara Power Project was constructed. This is a thoroughly enjoyable book for anyone who has grown up in Niagara Falls as I have, or for anyone who has ever visited the majesty of the cataract.

The morning before Rosh Hashonah, their Papa packed the car while Mama wrapped special cakes and cookies that Beni and Sara had helped to prepare. They couldn't wait to eat all that Rugelach, Mandelbrot and Strudel.They arrived at their grandparents with hugs and kisses, as always, but as Grandma lit the Holiday candles and said the blessings, Cousin Max tapped Sara on the shoulder and then shot a rubber band at her.Grandpa said the blessings over the wine (Kiddush) and raisin challah (Motzie) and everyone said \\"L'Shanah Tovah!\\" (A good, sweet New Year)The children fought with their cousins over this and that, including the wet plastic spiders that Max put on everyone's pillows. But the next morning after services, when the children beamed as their Papa blew the Shofar announcing the New Year, they thought about the things they had done in the previous year. In the afternoon, they took a walk to say Tashlich. They threw bits of bread into the brook, to get rid of their mistakes and start fresh. \\"This is for teasing Sara, and Beni,\\" Max said as he tossed his bread away. And he said sorry to his cousins.In the next and last five pages, the children learned the true meaning of Rosh Hashonah.The book includes a two-page recipe for raisin challah and a glossary of transliterated Jewish and High Holiday terms.A very cute story, but you're better off with Beni's Family Treasury: Stories for the Jewish Holidays, which includes stories for Sukkot, Chanukah, Purim and Passover as well.--- Alyssa A.

I loved the author's humorous, imaginative poetry, but never encountered her prose. I can't guess how I might have responded to it then, but this past winter I found these two books a sweet, old-fashioned delight. What surprises me as I think about them in review mode, though, is how much depth their characters have to offer an adult reader. We find good people doing what they believe to be best, and having it turn out badly (or at least imperfectly) because their &quot;good&quot; reasons contain hidden selfishness. We find flawed people living useful lives anyway, and those who love them accepting those flaws.That's what makes a children's book (so-called) timeless, I suppose. When a &quot;grown-up&quot; can also read it with pleasure and suspended disbelief, it's destined to endure beyond its author's lifetime."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"After reading Tarzan of the Apes, I immediately dowloaded the sequel. The cliffhanger ending at the end of the first one left me wanting more. The Return of Tarzan starts off with a slightly more civilized Tarzan, who has decided to visit an old friend in France.On his way there, he meets a young Russian countess whom he quickly befriends. After learning that her brother is a criminal, Tarzan feels a need to protect her, which gets him into a tight situation. After confessing that the situation was his fault, Tarzan decides to move on with his life and gets a job.After quite a few showdowns with Rokoff, the villain, Tarzan gets stranded in a familiar part of Africa. Meanwhile, Jane and her fiancee get stranded not too far away. After numerous confrontations with enemies, both new and old, Tarzan is at last reunited with the woman he loves.This book is just as good, if not better, than the first one.Tarzsn really grows as a character by overcoming personal prejudices and outgrowing his desire to kill needlesly. I also liked the more advenurous feeling of this one. From Chasing down the vilains, to finding the lost city of Opar, Tarzan accomplishes much more in this book than the first one."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Burroughs is at his best in this novel. It has it all- a hero who is broken, villians, action, it's just a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Now that I am retired I have the time to read some of the classics that I didn't read before. This is a good one."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"This second book in the Tarzan series was always my favorite of the lot, followed by \\"Tarzan and the Foreign Legion.\\" As another reviewer points out, it has a strong \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" vibe, although it predates that film by almost seven decades seeing as how it was first published in a pulp mag in 1913. The book edition came out two years later.Like \\"Raiders,\\" the story plays out seriously, but has a decidely cartooney air because so much adventure and coincidence are packed into the story. It's a fantasy adventure but it's just so thrilling, packed with jungle adventure, desert adventure, spies, cruise ships, lost cities, half-human races, treasure, Paris, love-to-hate villains and gorgeous women.I recommend \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" above the first novel mainly because everyone knows the basic origin tale and so it's kind of stale. \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" is the best place to start with the series. It's equal parts thrilling, captivating and just plain fun!"},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Ape Man! In this, the second book in the Tarzan series, we find Jean C. Tarzan...and, Yes, he is almost an honorary Frenchman...in Paris after rescuing Jane from a Wisconsin forest fire (TARZAN OF THE APES). While he does enjoy the nightlife there, drinking absinthe and smoking French cigarettes, there still beats the heart of a savage. This is most evident when he is attacked by apaches...violent members of the French underworld...and turns into a dangerous beast before their very eyes. There's nothing more than a good fight, except for the tender touch of Jane, to get Tarzan's blood flowing to all the necessary parts of his extremely muscular body.From Paris, he travels to the Sahara, where he learns to speak passable Arabic (which comes in handy later on), back to his beloved African jungle, searches for gold in the ruins of the fabled Lost City of Opar, and finally returns to the small house where he was born on the coast of Darkest Africa. Along the way he encounters more villains and blood thirsty humans than you can shake a spear at. Oh, and he does manage to once again save Jane from death, and fates worse than, along the way.Some here have said there were too many coincidences in this book for their liking. I rather enjoyed them as they took Tarzan from one perilous adventure to another seamlessly, while the reader is carried along with the Ape Man from cliffhanger to cliffhanger. This is escapist entertainment at its outrageous best. 5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"This is a great sequel of Tarzan of Apes; leaves off from the first one. I'd say it's a must read for anyone who enjoyed the first book because of the great story telling Edgar Rice Burroughs has once again done.

So, pick it up and read it!"},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"************ Warning, this review contains some small spoilers for the first book and this book ************This book picks up a couple of weeks past the end of the first book. Tarzan is alone without his love on a ship and he meets the main bad guy of the book. Half of this story takes place outside of the jungle and the latter half takes place within the jungles of Africa. Tarzan moves along from civilized to savage and back to ape. We finally find out how he ends up with Jane and we get to meet La and Opar.I liked the overall story and how Tarzan is characterized. The biggest complaint I probably have is how often he allows the bad guy to leave without exacting any punishment. You can just see that he will regret much of this later (though when you think about it, it does allow Tarzan to end up with Jane in a round-about way).If you read the first book, you need to read this one to get the full story. If you are not planning on reading the first and just taking this book by itself, it is a good story about Tarzan but not his best.As far as the Kindle version:I saw no flaws in the text. The table of contents (unlike the first book) is a real table of contents. Also, unlike the first book, this one does support the new page numbers for Kindle. I have an old paperback version of this book and though the page nubers did not match, I was able to use them find some text because it was within a couple of pages.Like my review of the first book, I see no reason to buy a different version of this book when this one is free and without any flaws I could find."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan is a fantastic character.

First published in 1913, this book is a work of genius. There is something about Burroughs' writing that is captivating, and this book is no exception. \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" is a highly entertaining volume.The book first starts with Tarzan on a ship going from New York to France. On this trip, he makes friends with a Countess and makes an enemy with her brother, a Russian. The Russian will attempt to cause Tarzan problems for the following months. After growing tired of France, Tarzan decides to return to Africa. However, his journey is beset with adventures in desert and wilderness.The story leads to Tarzan finding Opar, the lost outpost of Atlantis, in the heart of Africa. Although both the men and women of Opar are white, the women retained their beauty, while the men are more ape-like in appearance. From here, there are more adventures and peril.For great adventures, as you may have come to expect from Edgar Rice Burroughs, \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" will meet your needs."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"This is, to my mind, the best of the Tarzan series. If you like \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" then you'll love this sequel to \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" Like \\"Raiders,\\" \\"The Return\\" is chalk full of adventure. You name it, it's got it: desert adventure, ocean cruises, spy stuff, lost cities, beautiful women, Paris, jungle adventure (naturally), evil Russian villians, etc., etc. Okay, I admit that some of the coincidences in the story are quite unbelievable, but the writing and story are so captivating that you tend to pay it no mind. \\"The Return\\" is definitive proof of why Tarzan is perhaps the greatest adventure hero of all time! I would love to see this story made into a movie!"},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"That's not the whole story of course but it's an impressive part of it. Tarz renounces his family name,fortune and the woman he loves, giving it all to his cousin, and he does it all in Wisconsin! Yup, Wisconsin. Hurting from the ordeal, he heads off to Paris to forget about Jane. Wow, the Apeman in the City of Lights! So he spends time in Paris, almost has an affair with a Russian noblewoman, whups on her brother(an evil Russian spy), hangs out in art galleries and operas and eventually joins the French Secret Service out of boredom. All this is just the set-up for the rest of the novel. The book does seem to end too quickly but I think that has more to do with the serial/pulp nature of the story's publication deadline than any fault of the author. Tarzan and The Return of... are an entertaining 0ne-Two punch. Anyone who reads #1 should finish the experience by reading #2. I wish someone would make a film of this book, it's more interesting than the first one."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan is back in an adventure more in tone with the remainder of the series than the original Tarzan novel. Sinister villains, lost races and beautiful priestesses are a mainstay of the series and this book introduces the best of all. Sinister villain-Nikolai Rokoff who would compromise his own sister's honor for money. Lost City-Opar, the remnant of sunken Atlantis. Beautiful priestess-La of Opar, who passionately chases our man Tarzan through several adventures.Tarzan is marooned near his jungle home and gravitates from civilized man to savage man to ape man over the course of the story. His realization that not all Arabs are sneering villains and not all blacks are cannibalistic headhunters is a welcome relief from the stereotypes that are usual in the series."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"I had started out saying &quot;I'll just read one for a laugh,&quot; after going to the library with a friend on my way home from seeing Disney's new cartoon. My mom told me start with the first one but I could NOT stop there. I didn't think it was fair! Book #2 doesn't give everyone a happy ending but doesn't leave you complaining for the next month. After #1 leaves you with Jane engaged to Tarzan's cousin who now has his title, woman, and inheritance. This may sound odd but Tarzan also joins the French Secret Service! I may still laugh at the movies but I will never again laugh at the &quot;real&quot; Tarzan of the books! I don't think of Disney's show as Tarzan. It was fun, but it wasn't Tarzan."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"When I was a kid (thirty years ago) my dad had an old beaten copy of this book that my three brothers and I readr, reread and probably took worse care of than we should have. I remember the cover vividly- Tarzan fighting a lion, but dressed in what would be considered traditional Arab garb. Every chapter had it's own illustration- THE TREASURE VAULTS OF OPAR featuring Tarzan leaping across a wide chasm!I reread these books again in my teenage years and found this one to be my favorite. I think I enjoyed it even more than TARZAN OF THE APES.The story begins with Tarzan crossing the Atlantic after leaving Jane and her family on a train platform in northern Wisconsin (a region of the world I call home) and meeting, not for the last time Rokoff and Paulvitch, two Russian spies who make it their life's goal to humiliate and destroy the Ape Man. Their first meeting includes Tarzan spoiling a plan to blackmail a Count and Countess who quickly become Tarzan's friends.Later, in Paris, Rokoff and Paulvitch manipulate the Count into challenging Tarzan into a pistol duel, which Tarzan both wins and loses.Tarzan arrives in Africa again later, ignominiously tossed off a liner by the two mad Russians. He swims ashore and is immediately in his element again.Meanwhile, Jane and her father, along with Cecil Clayton (Jane's fiance') arrive ashore in Africa following a harrowing period on the ocean in a rowboat when their yacht founders.Tarzan visits Opar, the fabled city of Atlantians where he dukes it out with savage men and the beautiful high priest, La.How he and Jane reunite and Cecil's fate, as well as Tarzan claiming his birthright are all part of a story that you need to read to enjoy.Is Burroughs the greatest writer of the 20th Century? Maybe not, but he is one of the premiere storytellers. This book is one of the most satisfying of the series. It also sets up many adventures in the next dozen, or so, books. La, Opar, Paulvitch and Rokoff are all revisited.Take the trip- it's worth every second."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"In a way, Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Return Of Tarzan is his most exemplary work. That is to say, it contains the best examples of what works and what doesn't in Burroughs' fiction.First, what doesn't:1) If you have a problem with ridiculous coincidences, The Return Of Tarzan is probably not for you. I sometimes think \\"Serendipity\\" is Burroughs' real middle name. For example: in ROT, Tarzan is thrown overboard and swims ashore to the same spot on the west coast of Africa where he was born. A little later, Jane Porter, the love of Tarzan's life, is shipwrecked at the EXACT SAME SPOT.(Wait, it gets better.)Finallly, Paul D'Arnot, Tarzan's best friend, JUST HAPPENS to be patroling that same strech of African coast and JUST HAPPENS to decide to investigate Tarzan's birthplace AT THE SAME TIME that Tarzan and Jane are there.I mean, come ON.2) As Gore Vidal has pointed out, Burroughs couldn't write dialogue to save his life. For example, in ROT he has Rokoff, the novel's heavy, exclaim, \\"Name of a name!\\". Does anyone talk like this? Has anyone EVER talked like this?Next, what does:1) Burroughs is, as much if not more so than any writer of his generation, a natural born yarn-spinner. If I had to pick any writer, living or dead, to sit around the campfire with my friends and I and keep us entertained, Burroughs would probably be the one.2) Burroughs was absolutely gifted in describing action, fight scenes in particular. I think the great Robert E. Howard may have been his only peer in this regard.3) Burroughs probably gets more mileage out of the \\"fish-out-of-water\\" scenario than any writer I've ever read. My favorite example of this is a scene in which Tarzan, wild man of Africa, is depicted haunting the libraries and museums of Paris by day, and sipping absinthe(!) and smoking cigarettes at Parisian clubs by night. What a picture! Did he ever run into Ernest Hemingway? Now THERE'S an idea for a story!Upon reading The Return Of Tarzan, many would say it's a fairy tale, pure escapism.Well, thank goodness for that. Burroughs may not have been a peer of the Vidals and Hemingways of the world; nonetheless, we need him just as much."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"This is the book in which Tarzan gets Jane. (No, he didn't get her in the first book...only in the movie.)Interesting love triangle, made all the more interesting by Tarzan's wild adventures, some of them believable, some of them totally unbelievable, all of them capivating, exciting,and filled with action.You always know Tarzan, as other \\"good guys\\" of this age and genre, will win in the end, but sometimes you wonder how and if he will ever get there.Every chapter is like reading/watching one of the old serials movie theaters used to run between shows in the double featue on Satudays.Fun read. Good read. Go for it. You will feel like a kid again---and take it from this old man---that ain't all bad!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"maybe it's for the best that Burroughs did not in fact end it here.After reading _Tarzan of the Apes_, you realize that the story is not yet over (and if you haven't read TotA, it doesn't end the way you think it does).This book introduces Opar, lost city of gold with the beautiful and turbulent La, High Priestess of the Flaming God. We meet for the first time the Waziri, with whom Burroughs gets a bit subversive, for they start out as a bit of a stereotype, but soon become more than that.Tarzan gets mixed up in conspiracies, is pursued by a married woman, fights a duel, runs afoul of the police, quits smoking, travels with the Bedouin, and returns both to the jungle and to... Jane. Unfinished business with Jane, and with his cousin, William.And when this book ends, the Tarzan series could have ended, too, and it would have been OK. But of course it didn't end, and that's OK too, because some of those other Tarzan books are great fun."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Return of Tarzan is great escapist entertainment. Though it stands alone as a story, it is best to read after reading the first book (Tarzan of the Apes). The book reads like any entertaining summer movie, and has enough plot elements to fill at least a dozen films. Tarzan finds himself a french secret agent, an \\"Indiana Jones\\" gold hunter, an African King, and of course an \\"Ape Man\\". In all, he seems to posses just enough 'superhuman' ability and uncanny luck to get out of the most dire predicament.The story is always quick paced, and exposes the early 20th century view of \\"Western European superiority\\" while at the same time being sympathetic to many of the \\"savages\\"."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"It pretty much picked up the story from Tarzan of the Apes, which I enjoyed.

First appearing in the pulp publication \\"All-Story Magazine\\" as a complete novel in October 1912, \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" proved so popular that its creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs, wasted little time in coming up with a sequel...the first of an eventual two dozen! That sequel, perhaps inevitably titled \\"The Return of Tarzan,\\" was first seen in the pages of the short-lived pulp \\"New Story Magazine\\" (cover price: 15 cents); unlike its predecessor, it was published serially, in the June-December 1913 issues, and first saw book form in 1915. This is a tremendous continuation of the initial, now-classic story, and does what all good sequels SHOULD do: expand on what we already know while deepening characterizations...and leaving us wanting still more!The book is a direct continuation of the earlier novel, at the end of which Tarzan was seen nobly renouncing his aristocratic title so that his lady love, Jane Porter, could comfortably marry his cousin, William Cecil Clayton. Picking up scant weeks later, the sequel finds a despondent Tarzan mulling over his lot while on a steamer to Paris, where he resides with his good friend Paul D'Arnot. He becomes involved with the affairs of a troubled couple, the Count and Countess De Coude, while on ship and after returning to Paris; it seems that the Countess' brother, the cravenly Russian agent Nikolas Rokoff, will do virtually anything to blackmail the couple into giving him some top-secret government papers. After these episodes (and the book certainly must be deemed \\"episodic\\"), Tarzan becomes a secret agent for the French government (!), has some remarkable adventures in the desert of Algeria (again coming up against Rokoff), is thrown off a mid-ocean steamer by Rokoff and his henchman, Alexis Paulvitch, and fetches up in his native Africa. Once on his home turf, Tarzan's veneer of civilization is quickly sloughed off, as he rises to the kingship of a native tribe, the Waziri, leads them in battle against a band of ivory hunters, and discovers the Haggardian lost kingdom of Opar, along with its treasure horde of gold. As you can tell, the novel is just crammed with incident and adventure; Burroughs throws quite a bit into this one to guarantee the reader a rousing good time. And I have not even mentioned the trials that poor Jane and her party go through after a terrible shipwreck and marooning. Readers won't be bored, that's for certain!While no one would ever call Burroughs an elegant writer, he sure was a compelling one, and \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" really is quite impossible to put down. With two story lines alternating for our attention, and its chapters arranged cliffhanger fashion, the book is compulsively readable. It also goes far in deflating the charges of racism that have been leveled against Burroughs in the first book; here, the Waziri are portrayed in a very winning light, and Tarzan often ponders how much more decent they are than some \\"civilized\\" folks whom he has encountered (still, the book's Manyuema cannibals are naturally shown in anything BUT a decent light!). The novel features some lovely romantic interludes that should have the lady readers sighing, while of course dishing out enough gun battles, fights with wild animals, cloak and dagger antics, and lost-world elements to keep the most jaded action fan happy. And although Burroughs had never visited Africa--and thus could not impart the \\"Dark Continent\\" authenticity that H. Rider Haggard engendered so easily in his own books--his research goes far here in filling in the blanks; for example, who has ever heard of alfa (esparto) grass before, ropes of which are used to bind Tarzan in the Algerian desert? Put simply, the book is a gas, from start to finish.Still, it is a far from perfect affair, and Burroughs must be held accountable for several goofs that a careful reading will spotlight. Egregiously, he mentions that Tarzan's ape mother, Kala, had been killed by a spear that \\"found [her] vitals.\\" In the initial novel, however, it is clearly stated that Kulonga's spear merely \\"grazed her side\\"; rather, it was a poisoned arrow that did her in. The author tells us that Bou Saada, Algeria, is south of Sidi-bel-Abbes, whereas a quick look at a map will reveal that it is east. And he tells us that Tarzan's vessel was sailing \\"east\\" from Algeria to get to the Strait of Gibraltar, whereas that should of course be west. Perhaps worse than these oversights, which should actually have been caught by Burroughs' editor, is the overdependence on coincidence with which the author advances his plot. By coincidence, Tarzan's first assignment in Africa involves his enemy, Rokoff; by coincidence, the sheik who befriends Tarzan is the father of the dancing girl who later rescues him; by coincidence, Tarzan meets Jane's best friend, Hazel Strong, on a steamer at sea; by coincidence, the marooned Tarzan washes up on the African shore right at the cabin where he was born (!); by coincidence, Hazel bumps into Jane in Cape Town; and by two more coincidences, the lifeboats of the aforementioned shipwreck also fetch up on the African shore within five miles of Tarzan's cabin. Small world, and all that! The first Tarzan novel was also dependent on coincidence, but not nearly as absurdly so as its sequel. But you know what? The story is so entertaining, so much fun, and told with such dash and vigor, that none of these things seems to matter. While one part of the reader's mind is saying \\"Oh, come on!\\" the other part is making those pages flip, anxious to see what comes next. To demonstrate this point, I find that, despite having dozens of other books clamoring for my attention right now, I yet HAVE to read the second Tarzan sequel, \\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" next. Flaws and all, even after 100 years, these books CAN prove highly addictive...."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"It had been many years since I first read this book, and it was a pleasure to find it available on Kindle. Like most sequels, it was not quite as good as the first Tarzan book, but it was well worth re reading."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"I have read this book many years ago and still enjoy it today. You can't beat the price too (free)."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Few would ever claim that Edgar Rice Burroughs was a great writer at any point in his career, but it should be noted that he was an extremely poor writer at the start of his career. He improved immensely during those first few years, but re-reading his early books can often be rather painful. On the other hand, he did have a lot of very good ideas, and that is why his series are still remembered and still read today. This is especially true of Tarzan, in which he created an iconic character who is known by many people who have never even read one word of Burroughs' work. \\"The Return of Tarzan\\", the second in the Tarzan series which was published from June through December 1913 in \\"New Story Magazine\\" is a good example of the contrast of good ideas and poor writing.The story picks up where \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" left off; Tarzan had given up his legacy and the woman he loved and travels to Paris to see his friend Paul d'Arnot. On the way there, he makes an enemy of Nikolas Rokoff, and Rokoff becomes Tarzan's nemesis. In the first book, time and time again Tarzan took on Lions, but in this book it is Rokoff that Tarzan repeatedly faces, at least in the first half. That being said, Rokoff does make a bit more interesting of a foe, as he has different schemes, but it still becomes tiresome. As the action moves back to Africa, the Lions return as a repeated foe, though Rokoff is still lurking around.Another significant weakness of Burroughs writing at this time was his reliance on the amazing coincidence. When Tarzan is pushed overboard by Rokoff, he amazingly makes it to shore almost exactly where he lived before he was found. When the others are forced to abandon ship, they too find themselves within a few miles of the same spot even though they are split into two groups. The only slightly saving factor is they are completely unaware of how close they are to that spot.On the positive side, Burroughs has some good ideas. He makes Tarzan struggle with his barbaric ways when in civilization. His creation of the lost city is inventive and adds a different element to the story as well. This highlights one of the key differences between the Barsoom series on the one side, and Tarzan on the other. With the Barsoom series, Burroughs was able to create an entire world, but with Tarzan he was constrained by reality, and thus it is Tarzan repeatedly fighting Lions and other wild beasts. With the lost city, Burroughs is free to break away from the constraints of the known Earth.For the reasons given above, I don't think the first two books of the Tarzan series hold up as well as the first two books of the Barsoom series. Neither of the series has great writing, but Mars, as a setting, gave Burroughs much more freedom to invent and imagine then did Earth, and that played to Burroughs' strength. At the same time, one shouldn't judge these stories too harshly. They are still good fun if somewhat dated, and if one just wants some mindless adventure they can still fill that need."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Conquer My HeartInteresting tales within a story coming to an end. Tarzan gets bored in Paris and takes a job as an under cover agent to spy on a military person suspected of treason. The soldier is committing treason to cover a mistake. This spy game leads Tarzan back to the road of savage ape when a new enemy throws him overboard. Herculean strength once again saves Tarzan and he unites with Arabs who help rescue him and then a Waziri tribe that goes with him to find riches beyond a man's imagination. The city of Opar nearly costs the ape man his life, but he leaves with the knowledge of a secret exit/entrance and a high priestess that loves him. Due to a shipwreck, Tarzan discovers Jane has been taken to the deadly city of Opar. Of course he rescues her and finally they a married to live happily and with great wealth in England as Lord Greystroke. Some of the story bogs down in tedium writing.

R. Burroughs' TARZAN OF THE APES in 1914 inevitably led to what was the first in a long line of sequels, THE RETURN OF TARZAN. The first book introduced the forest god who is described so often in biological superlatives that generations of readers and critics have either thrilled to his near superhuman feats or have villified Burroughs for racist attitudes that if expressed today in a new work of fiction would be immediately classified as politically incorrect.Burroughs' strong point as a writer was to place his hero in a series of exotic locales, then watch him interact with the natives. In TARZAN OF THE APES, this exotic locale was Africa. In THE RETURN OF TARZAN it was first Paris, then the Sahara, then a lifeboat, finally culminating in a personal favorite of Burroughs, a lost city. By the start of this sequel, Tarzan knows his lineage as an English lord, but is determined to hide that since he truly believes that his cousin, William Cecil Clayton, would make a better lord and husband for his beloved Jane. Tarzan immediately gets involved with a married Russian countess and her issues with her criminal brother and her older husband. Partly as a consequence of his interaction with the villainous brother, Nicholas Rokoff, Tarzan is lured into a room where he is attacked by a dozen Paris muggers. The scene that details this mugging is one of the great chapters in literature that focus on this topic. Tarzan is described as a jungle Hercules that fights like some impossible combination of a raging gorilla with the speed of a panther. The muggers are quickly dispatched in a manner that has since become a trademark of his. The rest of the book shows Burroughs both at his best and worst. Burroughs simply has no ear for dialogue. His characters, with Tarzan being the worst offender, speak in the courtly pseudo-dialect that Burroughs thought all lower classes believed that all upper class folk used. Tarzan fondly recalls his childhood and his foster ape mother with a friend, D'Arnot: \\"To you my friend, she (his foster mother) would have appeared a hideous and ugly creature, but to me she was beautiful--so gloriously does love transfigure its object.\\" Further, readers are often annoyed at Burroughs' oversuse of coincindence to keep the plot moving. Then there is the racist element. His villains are invariably dark, swarthy, or black.In the lost city of Opar, the women priestesses are lovely, erudite, and white. The men are deformed, apelike, and black. The high priestess, La, tells Tarzan that only the most eugenically perfect men are selected to be mates for her priestesses. In this book, as in many others, Burroughs often has some high priestess tell Tarzan that he would make a suitable choice. Clearly, Burroughs' Tarzan series was meant to be entertaining, and any potentially disturbing polemics that do not ring as politically correct today can be dismissed as the style of a man whose books have had more of an impact on nearly every culture on this planet than any other author."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"I read these novels at least 3 times so far since I was about 13 and I'm 37 now.

It picks up right where thefirst Tarzan bookleft off. Jane is engaged to Tarzan's cousin and Tarzan is sailing back to Europe. Will Tarzan and Jane end up together? Of course, but there will be many obstacles before they get there. This is a solid adventure novel, which fans of old time pulp fiction will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Was Edgar Rice Burroughs a reader of Charles Darwin? Burroughs cites 'use and disuse' being the direct cause of Tarzan's heightened senses as well as a normal man's average hearing and vision. This is natural selection at work, obviously a reference to Darwin's Chapter Five: Laws of Variation. Great audio narrator in Shelly, too."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Despite the immense success that \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" was for ALL-STORY in 1912, when Edgar Rice Burroughs got around to submitting the greedily requested sequel to the same magazine a few months later, it was roundly rejected. Editor Thomas N. Metcalf suggested that the story lacked \\"balance\\", and Burroughs promptly took offered it up to the apparently less-discriminating people at Street & Smith, who published it without significant revision in NEW STORY, serialized in the second half of 1913. In the long run, the rejection and sale to a competitor was probably good for Burroughs' career; it was certainly good for his pocketbook in the immediate term, as he could now bargain for better rates in the cheap pulp publishing world that was his bread and butter as he got started on his fabulous career.But what may have served Burroughs financially may not have served him artistically, at least in this case; I'm inclined to think that Metcalf was right. I'm not sure that \\"balance\\" is the word I would use, but \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" does lack something. It's episodic where the original novel was mostly focused on one story, and we knew right away how the Porters' story would tie in with Tarzan's. Here we are presented with several episodes which might be considered to represent a \\"fall of man\\" of sorts; one improvement I think over the first book is that the satirical or critical elements that Burroughs worked into this series in particular are more in evidence. First Tarzan is a member of a somewhat effete French society, in which it is customary to duel over imagined wrongs; then he enters the military/diplomatic corps in North Africa, a step down in society but a more \\"manly\\" step back towards his true love - the wild; then he is cast among the Arabs, eventually becoming the chief of a black African tribe; falling then into the hands of a half-human, decayed civilization and finally back to his own anthropoid ape tribe. From there, he must face the reality of the choice between the woman he loves, and the life amidst the jungle.Really, it's a well thought-out idea; the problem for me lies not so much in the structure of the novel but in the particulars. Many of the sections and the characters strike me as too sketchily drawn, and the pacing particularly in the last third or quarter is just too frenetic to be as enjoyable as it could be. The City of Opar is dispensed with in a couple of chapters - the first advanced (albeit decayed) civilization that Tarzan has come across in the deep jungle, a city full of gold, and it's presented in a very slapdash fashion. Tarzan never stops to wonder at how the city could be so overflowing with the precious metal, nor asks the barely developed high priestess La. Overall I just have the feeling that Burroughs wanted to put too much into too little space, and he needed too many episodes to get across his basic back-to-nature theme.BUT - it's still a lot of fun, Tarzan himself remains a terrific character who is far more complex than he's ever made out to be in the generally awful TV and filmed versions, full of self-doubts as to his place in the world, his ability to get along in human society, to be the right man for the woman he loves; and the early sections are in general better realized and developed than the later ones - though even here there are some odd problems; how is it that the Arab girl who saves Tarzan and features in several chapters is NEVER NAMED?In sum, then, a decent sequel that wraps up the essential elements that were left hanging at the ending of \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\", that shows both Burroughs' flare for endless invention and some surprising psychological depths in his main characters, and his unfortunate tendency to underwriting and propelling his plots pell-mell without regard for narrative flow. A solid pulp novel that would be the envy of many of his competitors and imitators, but the master could and did often do better in his early career."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"That's not the whole story of course but it's an impressive part of it. Tarz renounces his family name,fortune and the woman he loves, giving it all to his cousin, and he does it all in Wisconsin! Yup, Wisconsin. Hurting from the ordeal, he heads off to Paris to forget about Jane. Wow, the Apeman in the City of Lights! So he spends time in Paris, almost has an affair with a Russian noblewoman, whups on her brother(an evil Russian spy), hangs out in art galleries and operas and eventually joins the French Secret Service out of boredom. All this is just the set-up for the rest of the novel. The book does seem to end too quickly but I think that has more to do with the serial/pulp nature of the story's publication deadline than any fault of the author. Tarzan and The Return of... are an entertaining 0ne-Two punch. Anyone who reads #1 should finish the experience by reading #2. I wish someone would make a film of this book, it's more interesting than the first one."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"\`Tarzan the Ape Man' ended in a Wisconsin train station with Tarzan now capable of speaking fluent French and English and apparently how to drive a car. Not exactly a stellar conclusion for the King of the Jungle. \`The Return of Tarzan' finds the jungle hero sailing to Paris drinking absinthe and smoking cigarettes. Not an encouraging start. Tarzan ends up crossing paths with a pair of thugs named Nikolas Rokoff and Alexis Paulvitch who are continually harassing a count and countess, also passengers on the ship. The first half of the book is nothing more than continual encounters between Tarzan and Rokoff in Paris and on the sea and it is dull and silly. Tarzan continues to threaten Rokoff and Rokoff continues to try and kill Tarzan. I cannot stress enough how cartoonish this is. One of the big complaints about the series is how Burroughs fills the stories with absurd coincidences to move the plot forward. About halfway through the book Rokoff and Paulvitch pitch Tarzan over the side of a ship and he manages to swim until he inexplicably comes across a wrecked ship out in the ocean which gives him the means to paddle all the way to the African coast and glory be he manages to land in the exact spot where he grew up. I'm not even sure why Burroughs chose to add this since he could have landed elsewhere in Africa without harming the plot. That is perhaps the most egregious coincidence but only slightly. Tarzan also just happened to run into Jane Porters best friend Hazel Strong on the ship before he was sent over the side.Lest there be any misunderstanding let me state that the first half of the book is a dud. The second half is like a completely different book. Tarzan becomes chief of an African tribe (naturally) which although more than a tad racist is an improvement for Burroughs as Tarzan actually gets along with the blacks even laughing with them and looking poorly on the whites with which he has spent some time. For Tarzan, the African natives are more his brothers than the refined whites. The rest of the book features a lost city of gold, beautiful women, misshapen brutes and human sacrifice. Yeah, this is what I wanted from Tarzan not that dull as dishwater first half. The second half is silly but at least it's silly in an entertaining way. I was so happy when Tarzan finally returned to his simian brethren as Burroughs tends to do well in writing these encounters although my possibly faulty memory seemed to be that the language of the apes was somewhat limited whereas in this book they appear to have a complete and sophisticated language which adds a bit more silliness to the book.The absurdity of the coincidence really do hurt the story. Not only do Tarzan and Jane BOTH find themselves in the exact same area of Africa where Tarzan grew up but by the end of the book even Philippe D'Arnot coincidently shows up as he just happened to be sailing around the same section of Africa. Add to this the amount of times Tarzan saves Jane at the last second and this becomes a book that simply cannot be taken very seriously which is a shame because the first book started with tremendous potential. I did have to laugh when Tarzan \`smelled' the whites from a few miles away which led him to the distressed Jane Porter. Let me add that Rokoff is little more than a lowlife thug and it's sad we have to see him again in the next book. This book, I would classify as middling as it is neither very good nor very bad. The second half is considerably better than the first half which is a shame because the ape man in polite society has tremendous potential but it's spoiled by the fact that Tarzan is written as indistinguishable from a proper English gentleman except for the times he launches into a rage when pushed into a fight. For a much better interpretation see the 1984 movie \`Greystoke' where Tarzan was actually portrayed as a fish out of water. Hopefully Burroughs will keep Tarzan in Africa for most of the remainder of the very long series."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"I must tell you that my husband is the fan.

When children show an interest in worthwhile reading, one doesn't hesitate to supply them with what they want."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"Like most people, I encountered Tarzan in movies, but only about a year ago got around to reading the first book. What a different experience. I don't think I've seen a movie that was very faithful to the novel. \\"Greystoke\\" got the tone and theme, if not the narrative. What's is essential to the books, and usually left out of the screenplays, is Tarzan's ability to live in the jungle, but to function in \\"civilized\\" society as well.The second novel (like the first) is essentially episodic. Tarzan, having renounced Jane Porter's love and his title, embarks on a series of adventures, including saving a woman's honor, surviving a duel, traveling to the Middle East as a secret agent, and finally finding himself marooned in the jungle he grew up, and discovering the city of Opar.Overall, the novel entertains. Tarzan remains a solid character. Occasionally, Burroughs' prose tends towards purple, and some of the dialogue can be stilted. There are also certain descriptions of the native African peoples which aren't terribly enlightened. However, the whole book is a blast."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"While I wasn't completely crazy about the novel, I did think it necessary to read after reading the original &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

The first book ends with too many plot lines unresolved not to find out what happens to them.However, that is probably the only good reason to read this book.Burroughs is inconsistent: William Cecil Clayton, known as Cecil in the first book, is suddenly known as William in this one. Characters simply drop out of the narrative. Olga de Coude, Alexis Paulvitch, Kadour ben Saden and his daughter, the faithful Abdul: All of these characters take a central role at one point or another to simply disappear without explanation.As for Tarzan himself, his dialogue is jarringly incongruous: \\"'Civilized ways, forsooth,' scoffed Tarzan. 'Jungle standards do not countenance wanton atrocities'\\" (p. 31). Tarzan seems to spend half the book soliloquizing and the other half getting elected king of something or other, only to go off and abandon his subjects without a word.The Return of Tarzan is not nearly as successful as its predecessor. If you read the first book, you'll want to read this one as well to find out how things turn out.

Tarzan being thrown overboard literally in the middle of nowhere, only to be find himself back on his native island, washed up upon the exact shore within mere feet of his beloved dwelling.3.

Tarzan raised by wild apes, is more human than most people who claim the title today."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"The Return of Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs is the second novel in about the Lord of the Jungle. As its predecessor, the book was first published in a pulp magazine during 1913 and only later published in book format (1915).The novel starts where Tarzan of the Apes ended, the ape man is recovering from his sacrifice at marriage to Jane Porter and goes to visit Paul d'Arnot in France. On the ship Tarzan becomes involved in the affairs of Countess Olga de Coude and her husband, Count Raoul de Coude while two people try to prey on them.The two are Nikolas Rokoff and Alexis Paulvitch and, as it turns out, Rokoff is the Countess' no-good brother. Tarzan denies the villains their scheme at every turn. In return, the Count finds Tarzan a job as a special agent in Algeria with the ministry of war. After some adventures, Tarzan sails to Cape Town and finds that Hazel Strong, Jane's friend, is one of the passengers. However, Rokoff and Paulovitch are also there and manage to throw him overboard.Somehow Tarzan manages to swim ashore to find himself in the coastal jungle where he was brought up. This time Tarzan ins smarter and befriends Busuli of the Waziri tribe which adopts him. Tarzan help the villagers defend themselves against ivory raiders and they elect him to replace their chief. The Waziri tell Tarzan where they obtain their gold, a lost city inhabited by beast-like men. The tribe takes Tarzan to the lost city where he is captured and condemned to be sacrificed to the sun god. The priestess is a beautiful woman named La, she speaks the language of the apes and tell Tarzan he is on the city of Opar.Will Tarzan escape?Will Jane marry Clayton?Will Rokoff get away with his evil schemes?As I was reading The Return of Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs several things struck out at me almost immediately: I have read this book before, Burroughs cannot write dialog, uses too much coincidences but Burroughs can sure spin a yarn and write actionThe moment I read the name \\"Rockoff\\" I knew I read this story before. I did not remember particulars and vaguely the storyline but I'm sure I read it somewhere around the tender age of 10 - where I was already a prolific reader. In this regard, reading this book was like visiting with a longtime old fried, reliving adventures from the comfort of your own home.Much of the dialog was ridiculous; no-one speaks or has spoken like that. Rockoff, and man whose as bad as they come, has the best lines (curses: \\"Name of a name\\") and d'Arnot is not far behind. I don't know if Burroughs meant that as an over the top adventure, or just make it kid friendly as is done these days but to my ears the dialog sounded wooden.There are coincidences galore in this novel. Tarzan just \\"happened\\" to swim to his childhood jungle, just \\"happened\\" to be locked in a room with access to a tunnel. Paul d'Arnot just \\"happened\\" to be in the area, just \\"happened\\" to investigate the seaside jungle etc. Once of twice to get out of a bind the author wrote himself into is fine and acceptable, but I just came up with five examples off the top of my head. Seems to me Burroughs employs the \\"just happened to\\" method way to often in such a short book.That being said, this is a fun book. The action sequences are magnificent and exciting, the story borders on the ridiculousness but Burroughs embraces that and guides the reader with an expert hand throughout. Sometimes one just needs a simple story, suspends belief and have a grand ol' time."},{"Title":"The Return of Tarzan","review":"This book is awesome.

In many and unfortunately most series of books, the sequels are never quite as good as the first novel. Not so in the Tarzan series.

The characters still exhibit the same personalities, the storyline is wonderful, and definitely not a letdown from the Tarzan of the Apes!!! A Great Read!!!! 5 stars from me!"},{"Title":"Pelham, or adventures of a gentleman","review":"Although not a great novel, this book is almost as entertaining today as it must have been in 1828. Like its narrator, Henry Pelham, the novel is clever, snobbish, and deliberately impudent. It's the story of an aristocratic dandy whose perfect poise and unabashed vanity set him up for a political career. Full of topical references to controversial figures such as Beau Brummell (who is portrayed in the novel as the exiled dandy Russelton) and Lord Byron, this was one of the most popular novels of the 19th century. According to several literary historians, &quot;Pelham&quot; was single-handedly responsible for inducing men to abandon the colorful costumes of the 18th century and switch to simple black suits (Pelham's own favorite outfit). Whether or not this novel really did change the face of fashion forever, it certainly became the bible of dandyism in England and France for the next several decades -- thus leading the way for the later (and more lasting) triumph of Oscar Wilde. Today, Bulwer-Lytton is mainly remembered for his ponderous historical fiction and his melodramatic writing-style -- immortalized in the infamous line, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night.&quot; But &quot;Pelham&quot; is something completely different -- a brisk, chatty, insider's account of high society in the years just after the Napoleonic Wars. It will be especially interesting to fans of Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; which depicts the same period in a more satirical way -- in fact, Thackeray wrote &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; partly in order to attack Bulwer-Lytton's glossy, worshipful portrait of high society."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"At last!

This is something I found absolutely necessary, and this book was the only real source of that information. However, the examples and code provided are all but useless. Furthermore, the Inline:: group of modules for perl... make almost all the examples and code in this book obsolete.To sum this up in two sentences: This book does not provide anything that you cannot glean from perldoc with equal efficiency or retention.

Some of the complaints about this book presented in other reviews are real however as I said before...this is the book I reach for most often. If you write perl this book should be in your reference collection. It deals with varied topics and Sriram does a fairly good job of linking them together.

You are not supposed to be reading it until &quot;Learning Perl&quot; seems really basic to you and when you are ready to make the progression from browsing &quot;Programming Perl&quot; (the Camel book) -a reference guide to ALL of Perl- to writing a real &amp; complex application. This book serves then as an introduction to several complex topics (DBI, data structures, Tk, OO, &amp; Perl C internals) and gives a better explanation in some areas where the Camel book falls short or becomes too complex (here the explanations are better, but don't expect full tutorials from A to Z). I warn you. It is the perfect companion to introduce you to a new subject while reading the online docs or other. You also might want to browse thru it if you are an experienced programmer with other scripting languages like TCL, Java or Python, since the comparisons at the end of each chapter is really excellent. As anything that was once considered advanced (and therefore, cutting edge), the book has aged. Things like the persistent data manipulation module presented in the book have since been improved upon by newer ones. Some of the TCL comparisons are not entirely fair anymore (although mostly still correct). Tom Christiansen's perltoot for OO included with Perl is a much better and thorough introduction than the one offered here. Also, if you are the type of programmer that reads every single little piece of documentation that comes with Perl, then well, you won't find anything new here --but some concepts that could have been unclear might be clarified here (the ideas presented are still correct, even if some of the code is not anymore)."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"Normally, I would not feel the need to review this book, had I not seen the review:&quot;Why are there so many good reviews for this book?&quot; by Eric Vogan (see above).I would like to add that it is a great book and that it has thought me a lot.Having mastered basic to intermmediate Perl, &quot;Advanced Perl Programming&quot; really took me further.But as the name says, this is &quot;advanced&quot; Perl programming, and not a beginner's book. So Eric, even though you are a C++ programmer, you have to go through the basics before you try to use this book. The Preface clearly says what you are expected to know before you start with this book.For beginning Perl programmers I would recommend the &quot;Perl 5 by Example&quot; and &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, both of which are an excellent entry point to Perl.But for taking your studies further, &quot;Advanced Perl Programming&quot;, among others, is a gold-mine."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"Compared to &quot;Programming Perl&quot; the explanations of references and complex data structures are worth the price alone.

It really shows.

But I've read them intermittently, as I do all technical works: a bit here, a bit there, pause a bit, try a bit of code, look up a chapter... etc.This book was different. Within 12 hours of getting it, I had read continuously through to the end of Chapter 7 (120+ pages), taking it all in voraciously. Somehow, this has picked up on every important cranny in the language I had skipped over as &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;too confusing&quot; -- with all deference to Larry, Tom and Randal.. It hits the spot with examples just where I need them, and with concepts and analogies that clicked into place beautifully.If you know about pointers, but puzzle about refs and typeglobs and $$this and \\\\$that and *somethingelse, if talk of aliases, closures, and variable suicide have made you feel inadequate... if the works of modules, objects and stuff like that still has you confused, this book is for you.The only problem: I used to think of myself as a tech writer... they still pay me for it.

The section on code generation using templates is great as well."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"I am unable to categorize this book. As the title says, this is about advanced Perl programming, but chapter 1-9 really belongs in &quot;Programming Perl&quot; (but are totally missing from it), and should really not be considered advanced (on the other hand, quite elementary, but since they appear nowhere else, you should probably consider this book a must read, if you are serious about Perl).The rest of the book is pretty random, covering various topics the author thought was neat, and wanted to write about. This is ranging from trivial use of CPAN libraries (Tk), to trivial Perl but involving knowledge from other disciplines (networking), to actual useful advanced Perl programming (persistence, template-driven code-generation, and the C programming interface). This part of the book is also highly recommended (and in fact the reason I bought it), but should have been much longer."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"The book does a nice job of explaining some of the obscure areas of Perl.

The topics are quite varied and the chapters are brief and not too verbose. I really think this format is helpful for new Perl Programmers, especially those without a strong programming background, who aren't familiar with these concepts.I really like the author's easy-going, no-nonsense style. He will tell you how something works without too much technical terminology, and also will admit when another language is better suited for something.Readers who find Larry Wall's &quot;Programming Perl&quot; book difficult to understand will find this book refreshing.

I bought it in order to improve my knowledge of Perl but in fact it's just a messy try to perform things you should never do with Perl ! What i've found in this book is for example &quot;How to use Perl for doing a job C or C++ already does more efficiently and in a neat manner&quot;. It compares the dirty features of Perl (object-oriented, supposedly &quot;advanced data structures&quot;, variables scope...) with those of other languages...If you need to do OO programming, use an OO programming language like C++ or Java, not Perl ! You'll certainly not learn OO programming with Perl. If you want to use advanced data structures efficiently, use C. But using Perl for doing such things is crazy : Perl is an interpreted language, meant to allow easy code writing, allowing the programmer not to deal with data structures intricacies ! This book shows you how to simulate all the interesting features of C, C++ and Java with a language not meant to do that ! It should be renamed &quot;Emulating efficient programming languages with Perl !&quot;Maybe the last part of the book dealing with the Perl internals deserves some attention but it is on the web anyway, like everything else for Perl (www.perldoc.org, www.perl.org ...).I would suggest &quot;Learning Perl&quot; as an introductory book and then go to &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Mastering algorithms with Perl&quot; for more advanced topics...but unless you absolutely need it in paper version, don't buy an advanced book on Perl.

He seems to have concentrated on the English part of the book as much as the perl part of it. :( Usage of words/phrases like &quot;kosher&quot;, &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; are irritating and convey the impression that the author wants to show off his command of English.Nevertheless, this is, as far as I can think, one of the most essential perl reference books for the serious programmer.

Also, some of the examples, particularly in the opening chapters, suffer from being a bit meaningless, e.g. code like $spud = \\"Wow!\\" -- er, right.That said, the opening chapters do contain some pretty useful material which wasn't present inThe Llamaand which you wouldn't want to slog throughThe Camelfor, including good stuff on references, closures, typeglobs, the symbol table, tied variables and persistence and serialization. There's also an introduction to OO with Perl.The middle part of the book contains 50 pages on Tk. Useful if you need it, I suppose. But is this advanced?The last part goes into detail in getting Perl to talk to C, and the internals of Perl. The latter is pretty interesting in a geeky sort of way, and definitely qualifies as 'advanced'. Not many other books about go into this level of detail.The first 150 pages of this book maintains its relevance for the most part, although much of it (e.g. references and objects) is no longer considered advanced, and you can find discussions elsewhere, e.g.Object Oriented PerlorThe Alpaca. The section on Perl internals is probably still of use if you're into that sort of thing. Elsewhere, however, the march of time and reliance on CPAN modules has reduced the vitality of the material.Worth picking up on the cheap for the earlier chapters."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"Reading this book will definitely increase your knowledge of Perl.

You should read Programming Perl first. Also, read Object Oriented Perl for more elaboration on that topic."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"&quot;Advanced Perl Programming&quot; says in the Preface that it has two goals: 1) &quot;To make you a perl expert&quot; and 2) &quot;to supplement your current arsenal of techniques and tools for crafting applications&quot;.If you want to buy this book because of the first goal mentioned above, you'll be decieved. Because the book doesn't cover all the issues in details to be able to make one a &quot;Perl expert&quot;. To achieve that goal, I recommend you to go for &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Object Oriented Perl&quot; and &quot;Mastering Regular expression&quot;. Those four all together will make a &quot;perl expert&quot; out of you. The book only meets its second goal, but only partially.Chapter 1 covers some basic data structure and introduces to references/pointers as they are implemented in Perl. The chapter is 22 pages only.Chapter 2, &quot;Implementing Complex Data Structures&quot; does show the implementation of some complex tasks using Perl's multi-dimensional data structures. It lasts about 14 pagesYou might find chapter 3, &quot;Typeglobs and Symbol Tables&quot; a bit usefull and more informative.Chapter 4, &quot;Subroutine References and Closures&quot; was the one i Just skipped over :)Chapter 5, &quot;Eval&quot; gives in depth explanation and the logick behind &quot;eval()&quot; and &quot;eval { }&quot;. Lasts about 17 pagesIn Chapter 6, &quot;Modules&quot;, i believe there's nothing much to discover. &quot;Progamming Perl&quot; gives all the information and even much more that Sriram covers his book. Lasts 13 pages.Chapter 7 and 8 cover Perl5's Object Oriented style and I found it pretty informative. I found it much better then that of &quot;Progamming Perl&quot;. But when it comes to this subject, nothing can win &quot;Object Oriented Perl&quot; by Damian ConveyChapter 9, &quot;Tie&quot; is about perl's built-in &quot;tie()&quot; function and its implementation. The chapter may serve as a decent reference. But couldn't do the job better than &quot;Progamming Perl 3rd editon&quot;, Chapter 14.I enjoyed Chapter 10 &quot;Persistence&quot; and Chapter 11 &quot;Implementing Object Persistence&quot;. They deal with Storable, FreeThaw, Data::Dumper, Adaptor modules. I don't know any of the books out there that cover these topics in details.Chapter 11 and 12 are about Networking. They implement IO::Socket module for developping network clients, and write a Msg module for implementing &quot;Messaging Tooklkit&quot;Some good Tk examples are available in Chapters 14, 15 and 16.The rest of the book is dedicated to Perl's Internals and extending Perl. They use SWIG and XS toolkits.So if the above sounds like what you need from the book, you can buy it, I guess. If you're just starting Perl, and not good at Perl's some advanced data structures, you won't gain anything from buying this book. Go with &quot;Learning Perl&quot; for getting started and/or &quot;CGI Programming 101&quot; if your goal is to implement Perl in Web progamming.Good luck"},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"Since receiving this book as a gift in June I have rarely consulted it, whereas I consult the O'Reilly Camel and Lhama books and the O'Reilly Perl Cookbook all the time.

Camel does.It has some stuff on Network programming that relates to threads, but nothing on a topic that I consider to be essential to moving past the baby Perl stage, namely how to start up processes, pipe to them, etc.So I would say that this book probably won't add much to your Perl library."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"This book has a lot of content that isn't well represented in other perl books.

Warning to the reader looking for advanced perl/Tk -- there isn't any in this book.

I have written my own code generator but the elegance of this one is remarkable.In conclusion, after reading through more than a third of the book, I can say that while it is not the best Perl book in existence (that honor properly belongs to the Camel), this book is worth a place on the shelf of a serious Perl programmer."},{"Title":"Advanced Perl Programming","review":"This book is not for the &quot;I know how to split a string in Perl so I am a hacker&quot; reader.

Many economics professors have never read Adam Smith, Ricardo, J. S. Mill, Walras, Marshall or Menger. Pareto's Manuel is another forgotten classic. It's influence on the economics profession is tremendous. This is probably the most brilliant and forceful presentation of Equilibrium economics ever put down on paper. But, oddly enough, it wasn't translated into English until 1971, over sixty years after it was first published.What I found most interesting about the Manuel is that the book is strongest precisely in those chapters that don't have anything to do with Equilibrium economics. Perhaps this is the reason why the book has been ignored. Pareto was something of an ultra-positivist. He believed that economics should be a science, which meant it had to be drearily quantitative. When the Swiss economist Leon Walras inflicted his equilibrium-based, mathematical vision of economics upon the scholarly world, Pareto became an eager convert. Soon he was not merely Walras' successor at Lausanne, but the world's most preeminent exponent of mathematical economics. Pareto, however, was not content to restrict his scholarship to concocting arid economical theories. He had too much learning for that. Besides being an economist, an engineer, a successful businessman, a manager of railroads, and a member of the Italian aristocracy, Pareto was also one of the great classical scholars of his age. A man of irascible temperament, Pareto could never bring himself to accept the insipidities of common opinion among academics and pamphleteers posing as experts. He saw too clearly that the humanitarianism and the childish faith in progress that dominated intellectuals of his age were based on nothing more than shoddy scholarship and wishful thinking. Eager to describe social reality as it really exists, Pareto extended his economic research well beyond the sterile equilibrium analysis that dominates the middle chapters of the Manuel. In the last three chapters, equilibrium analysis is all but ignored. What we have instead is some of the most clear-headed descriptions of economic reality ever put to paper. Pareto discusses social heterogeneity, income distribution, social circulation, population, social hierarchy, stability, capital, rent, savings, retailing, trusts and syndicates, monopoly, free trade, protectionism, and economic crises. What he has to say on nearly all these topics is extremely insightful, original, and extremely important. His sophisticated examination of free trade, which transcends the simplistic dogmas of free traders on one side and protectionists on the other, is alone worth the price of the book. Pareto is the most underrated of all the great social thinkers of the last two hundred years, and his sociology and non-mathematical economics deserve greater appreciation.Now if only someone would get around to translating Pareto's great work on social spolation, &quot;Les Systemes Socialistes&quot;!"},{"Title":"To Place Our Deeds: The African American Community in Richmond, California, 1910-1963","review":"Richmond, California became a World War II boomtown. And almost as quickly as it burst at the seams with shipyard productivity, population surges, and overflowing housing, schools, and day care needs, the boomtown deflated. To a San Francisco-centric mindset, Richmond is no more than a sprawling urban ghetto. But it's a community that deserves more than quick dismissal. As Shirley Ann Wilson Moore writes, &quot;This book examines the history of the African American community in Richmond during the critical transitional years of the first half of the twentieth century. It places the activities of black working-class men and women, regarded by some as unlettered peasants who were spatially and intellectually isolated from larger social currents, at the center of the nation's most profound, transformative events.&quot;Published dissertations generally have an awful density about them -- a frustrating compression of stats, dates, and repetitious topic statements. Moore's book is somehow magically void of this while maintaining its scholarly value and dignity. Richly supported by oral histories, the book is unique for telling a community story of California, the American WW2 home front, and the African American experience all at once.Moore's work is an insightful and appropriately succinct package encompassing the exodus of thousands of African Americans from the Jim Crow south to establishment of community, church life, self-sufficiency, war work, blues clubs, prosperity and stability in Richmond -- if not for all, at least for some instead of none.

I've figured out much on my own, but some things have remained a mystery. Windows 2000 Professional by Mark Minasi assumed I was familiar with way too much vocabulary. This book by Sharon Crawford takes the mystery out of a lot of little things. It scratches where I itch. Maybe after I master this material, I'll take another shot at Minasi or Pogue.It was especially gratifying to read on last page of the book (the colophon), \\"The book was designed and laid out ... on a Power Mac 8500 and Power Mac G3.

In addition to all the basics (and fundamentals), this text covered every communications tools which came with the OS, including: system maintainance, utilities, troubleshooting, and general networking. The manual even delved into the component interface of the operating system: with its analysis on how Windows 2000 Professional builds upon the interface kernel in Windows NT 4. All the security features, as well as all the factors which contributed to the performance and stability of the OS were detailed.This 'missing manual' is desirably analytical, without being too technical. It is a very straightforward book, which gives all the details, while at the same time maintaining its concise outlook. Both beginners and expert users of Windows 2000 Professional would be delighted by its dynamic analyses."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual","review":"The title clearly means that this is the manual that should have come with Windows 2000 Professional! It's not about OTHER BOOKS, it's about Windows 2000 Pro and is a first rate guide to the system. It's NOT advanced stuff but a quick reading of the book description -- ABOVE -- would tell you that. It is very easy to read and has many neat tips and tricks.If programs came with books this good, we wouldn't need to buy any others."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual","review":"The little red ribbon graphic on the cover of the book says, &quot;Mastering the Corporate PC&quot;. Since Windows 2000 is targeted at business users (Microsoft's offering targeted to home users at the time was Windows ME), I had expected more of an emphasis on the likely concerns of business users (i.e. networking, security, etc.) rather than how to use programs like Paint, Wordpad and Media Player. After purchasing the book, I discovered that most of the same information was available, organized in much the same way, on the TechNet section of Microsoft's web site. If Windows 2000 is your first exposure to any form of the Windows operating system, this would probably be an appropriate selection.

Rather than hunt my way through the menus, I picked up this book and had both my new system and home network set up in almost no time.This is the sort of book I may only need to refer to once or twice in my life, but the time it has saved me so far more than compensates for the small investment. If your time costs less than mine or you're looking for something more technical, it might not be for you, but for me it was perfect."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual","review":"The title of this book would lead you to believe (or at least it led me to believe) that it is a supplement to other books on Windows 2000 and that it would provide guidance on the use of the unique features of the Professional Edition.

He argues that consulting doctors about what our diet should be is ridiculous, since \\"the healthy want no doctors, and if they wish to know how to preserve their health, they must first study themselves, and then learn from others the means by which these have actually succeeded,\\" and warns the doctors that they too should learn from his principles, which offers \\"perfect health and true enjoyment of life.\\" He repeatedly instructs us that it is important not to consume anything that is disagreeable to our stomach, however agreeable it may appear to be to our palate. It is in this spirit that he writes his account of the philosophy of the stomach as \\"a seed of life strewn in the future.\\"His extensive empirical study of the stomach is resonant of the period in many ways, as his argument is based on a quantitative science as is echoed from his citation from Lavoisier, yet his argument from functions and teleology shows the kind of science done during the period, as Darwin would publish his book on the Origin of Species in the following years. His inclination to empiricism does not, however, reject a rational theoretical science, as he says at one point that \\"a man without grand theories will never arrive at a great fact.\\" Yet in the end, his commitment in the science lies in the belief often seen in the progressive thinkers that when the fact is found, \\"the theories must be relinquished or corrected without hesitation.\\" In sum, this book offers an alternative view on a rational ground to the currently predominant view that vegetable diet is healthier than and preferable to the exclusive animal diet.For more,([...])"},{"Title":"Magician's magic,","review":"Get this book.

I'm still looking. This book is a little too basic for me. To be fair, I haven't read the chapters on printing and JDBC.Some of the tips are helpfull but I find that reading the javadoc and the swing connection provides a great deal of more information. However, I'm looking forward to Geary's JFC book when it's released. His Java 1.1 AWT book was the best book about the AWT that I've read.I'm looking for a book that would explain how to design Java UI's from an architectural perspective rather that the details and placement of widgets.

In this book he tells the story of his days in France and with French troops as they collapse before the Germans. He attributes this not to the quality of the fighting men, who he regards as first class, but to the inferiority of their equipment and their strategy. Towards the end of the book he will speak with a young Free French officer Charles de Gaulle who had some years before written a book calling for the using of Armor in a new way. Unfortunately none of the French General Staff paid attention, while the German General Heinz Guderian did.Reynolds in the second part of the book shifts to reporting from England during the Blitz. He is a great admirer of the English character and determination. He notes that they all believe they will emerge triumphant from the War, even when they are being pounded from the air by the Germans.The book is incidental and anecdotal. It does not contain any real political or military analysis. It also does not provide any deep character description or analysis.It has a certain picaresque quality. And while it does have descriptions of what it is to be under fire, and the target of bombings it does not really provide descriptions of battle, or war- action.It is however an important document in showing what the English people were going through during the Blitz. And its historical role was I believe in arousing American sympathy for them.Today close to seventy years later it still reads well. A decent book by a decent person and very good reporter."},{"Title":"The wounded don't cry","review":"\\"The Wounded Don't Cry,\\" Quentin Reynolds; Crowell-Collier Publishing Co. (1941)\\"By Quentin Reynolds,\\" Q.R.; McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. (1963)[The following was originally a letter & later served as the basis of this compound review of \\"The Wounded Don't Cry\\" (1941) & \\"By Quentin Reynolds\\" (1963), both written by a renowned World War II journalist & author (1902-1965)]\\"Who knew there was a publishing house in Lafayette, Louisiana?\\" amused you.But the major league U.S. publishers also get the well-deserved rakes in the face after carelessly stepping on them - while piously pretending all along that their standards are superior (see my review of \\"My Dearest Friend, Letters of Abigail & John Adams,\\" Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2007).Just finished a Broadway theater reviewer's 1930s memoir, Ward Morehouse's \\"Forty-Five Minutes Past Eight\\" (the time of evening, decades ago, when the NYC theatre curtains rose & the shows began). Can't recommend it. Thin gruel. Literary grits.What also rankled was that if there was ever a book with the need for an index, this was it. In addition to the waves of pointless \\"laundry lists\\" (of actors, musicals, dramas, movies, etc.), WM also took it upon himself to type up the names of just about every American theatre & film critic.Again, dozens of names, in no particular order. Looked like the aftermath debris of an explosion at a pre-internet Yellow Pages print shop.[For a competent & humorous discussion of past Broadway critics, see \\"Opening Night On Broadway, A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre, Oklahoma! (1943) to Fiddler on the Roof (1964),\\" by Steven Suskin; Macmillan (1990). I hasten to add that, unfortunately, it was Steven who gave me the idea to buy FFMP8: \\"[These] are entertaining chronicles of early Broadway\\" (the other book is \\"Matinee Tomorrow,\\" which would probably sour me on Wednesdays for the rest of my life.]*****Onward, or maybe just sideways, to Quentin Reynolds' books.His 1963 memoir \\"By Quentin Reynolds\\" flat-out reveals him as a good-hearted, genial liar - since what he wrote in 1963 about his flight as a refugee to England in 1939, he had also detailed two years after the actual event, in his best-selling \\"The Wounded Don't Cry\\" (1941).The stories don't match.After fleeing the swift & victorious Nazi armies outside the gates of Paris, he then had a ton of trouble at dockside in England with the British authorities - simply trying to get off the Dutch freighter that had carried him & others refugees from France. Once off the boat, they were detained to an even further extent, despite the American ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy's request that they be released & allowed to return to London.All detailed, presumably in candor, in TWDC in 1941. Completely different story in 1963, in BQR.You'd think that the editor of BQR in 1963 would made it his business to read TWDC, which, in turn, would have enabled him to notice such a ridiculous discrepancy.And: No indexes!Reynolds's writing is competent, willing & entertaining - occasionally superb - but his credibility is in question. Buy them if you're a fan of 20th Century American journalism as it was practiced with zest in the poolrooms in peacetime & in the foxholes during the wars.Just remember that the title of reporter John Kieran's memoir was \\"Not Under Oath.\\""},{"Title":"The Landing of the Pilgrims (Landmark Books)","review":"It was very imformative.

B: the \\"God-fearing\\" Puritans, following the King Philip's War, proudly displayed Phillip's (Metacom) head on a stave at the entrance to Plymouth.

It also accounts accurately the peaceable and friendly relations they maintained with the Indians of that region, and their mutual treaty which lasted for nearly 50 years, until the time of King Phillip's War. The amicable relations which the Pilgrims maintained with King Massasoit and Squanto reveal the noble intentions of both parties. This is an essential part of American history and should be read by all students studying this period. Adults will enjoy this one too!"},{"Title":"The Landing of the Pilgrims (Landmark Books)","review":"A Response to The Landing of the PilgrimsLanding of the Pilgrims, is a book about the first settlers in the New World and their journey across the ocean in hope of religious freedom. It also tells the story of their good times, troubles, and hardships. The author, James Daugherty, vividly tells their story by giving evidence of truth through real documents and their journals. In my opinion, there is no better way to learn about them.This historical fiction book opens up in 1607 with the main character, William Bradford, as a boy, and goes through his life to the death. The reader learns of Bradford's fellow believers and their journey to Holland, life there, and their long pilgrimage across the great Atlantic, to America. The reader is also shown the hard work and effort put in by these people so that we can have what we do today.I think this is a good, well-written book that conveys the elementary message of the reasons and purposes the Pilgrims had in coming to &quot;New England&quot;. Daugherty makes the reader feel as if he were in Virginia over 350 years ago sharing the new knowledge and new experiences with Bradford and the early settlers. He does a great job constructing sentences and he really describes things very well. I think Daugherty did a good job with the details as well. He answered almost all the questions a reader could ask and he could answer about life of the early settlers. But I think he probably could have included more about what the pilgrims did for leisure and play. At one time he mentions that they worked six days a week and they worshipped most all of Sunday with just a little time for play. Perhaps they didn't do anything for fun during the week? If the latter is not the case than I wish he would have been more detailed in that area.One thing that I learned about was the charter companies and their contracts with the new settlers. The company provided them with goods and transportation and in return the Pilgrims would send them furs, fish, and other new products of America. The company worked like the modern day stock market.Overall it was a good book and very enjoyable. Considering it's length and content I would recommend the book to 5th graders. It could also be a good tool for learning how to write well-constructed sentences. I hope Daugherty has written other books like this one (only at a higher reading level). If so I will definitely read more of his work!"},{"Title":"The Landing of the Pilgrims (Landmark Books)","review":"We used this book as part of our Beautiful Feet Early American History study.

If you're looking for a pilgrim book, The Diary of Remember Patience Whipple is much better."},{"Title":"The Landing of the Pilgrims (Landmark Books)","review":"This book was an excellent book to read with my 8-year-old and 6-year-old over the Thanksgiving weekend. I liked the fact that it started 13 years before the Mayflower, giving background information about the Puritans time in England then Holland. Out of 150 pages, 23 of them took place before the Mayflower even entered the picture. Many books just very briefly touch on this background information.The book is very factual, with periodic quotes from the Pilgrim's writings, including their now-outdated spelling. The chapters were very short, usually 3-5 pages. I liked this in general, because it makes it easy to read just a bit, or to motivate myself to read \\"just a bit\\" more. It did occasionally make the story seem a bit episodic. I do wish there had been a bit more information about the Pilgrim's daily lives, especially the children, and also about their worship.On the whole, this is a good book to read aloud with the elementary set for Thanksgiving. It was a bit over my 6-year-old's heads at some points (mostly keeping track of all the Indian names), but not a problem for my 8-year-old. This would also be a good book for upper elementary school on up to read on their own. I would definitely recommend this book be in any homeschooling household."},{"Title":"The Landing of the Pilgrims (Landmark Books)","review":"Who were the Pilgrims? This book takes your readers back to the Puritan days in England, their migration to Leyden, and their many attempts to strike out for the new world.What did the Pilgirms find in the New World? Not Jamestown Colony, their intended destination. No. They found a wilderness with echoes of the Native Americans who had suffered and died from a plague four or five years before the arrival of the Mayflower. They found no way to feed themselves, being undersupplied and arriving in the winter. They found some Native Americans who attacked them, others who traded with them, and still others who could communicate with them. Some of the Pilgrims actually survived the first winter -- 51 survivors.How did the Pilgrims establish themselves in Plymouth Colony? Watch as they built houses, storehouses, fortifications. Watch as they organize hunting, guard, and trading groups, learn to farm. Watch as they see new ships on the horizon -- resupply ships? Not at all -- ships that bring new, sick colonists to be healed and fed; ships that demand what the colony has produced in order to pay the merchants who financed their trip.What were the relationships between the Pilgrims and the Indians? Meet the chiefs and warriors of the neighboring tribes, learn about their internal conflicts and leadership issues, and learn how the Pilgrims formed alliances and partnerships with some and fought others, while staying true to their founding ideals.How did the Pilgrims become prosperous? Watch as the colonist finally(!) overthrow the \\"communal\\" idea of distributing food, and instead adopt the ownership idea of private property to feed themselves. It meant the end of the starving time and the beginning of the strength of America.This book is told with a quick journaling style, occassionally quoting old diaries (and keeping old spelling and phrasing in those sections. It takes you into the mindset of the Pilgrims, and it gives a good look at how brave the colonists were.This book is for older children (upper grades) who can handle the language and understand the shifting perspectives. Children need a level of familiarity with the Pilgrims and other early North American colonies before they tackle this one.

He eventually found a good master who gave him the love and companionship he deserved. I think this book sends a strong message to people of all ages. Among which is to take care of nature and her animals. Humans and animals alike deserve to be treated with kindness. Secondly, is that of resilience.
