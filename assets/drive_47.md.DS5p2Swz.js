Working with only a fraction of the materials available to today's classical scholar, Fustel de Coulanges fashioned a complete picture of life in the ancient city, resulting in a book impressive today as much for the depth of its portrait as for the thesis it presents. In The Ancient City, Fustel argues that primitive religion constituted the foundation of all civic life. Developing his comparisons between belifes and laws, Fustel covers such topis as rites and festivals; marriage and the family; divorce, death, and burial; and political and legal structures. \\"Religion,\\" the suthor states, \\"constituted the Greek and Roman family, established marriage and paternal authority, fixed the order of relationship, and consecrated the right of propery, and the right of inheritance. This same religion, after having enlarged and extended the family, formed a stull larger association, the city, and reigned in that as it had reigned in the family. From it came all the institutions, as well as the private law, of the ancients.\\" As Arnaldo Momigliano and S. C. Humphreys note in their foreword, The Ancient City rightly takes its place alongside a number of pioneering works of the late nineteenth century that offered radically new inerpretations of ancient society and culture. Indeed, modern anthropology, as well as classics, owes a debt to Fustel de Coulanges, whose early insights in The Ancient City remain valid and provocative today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEVoAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Ancient+City:+A+Study+on+the+Religion,+Laws,+and+Institutions+of+Greece+and+Rome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Irreverent Guide to New Orleans, 4th Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h7xBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Frommer%27s(r)+Irreverent+Guide+to+New+Orleans,+4th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Change in Organisations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Whales Off New England","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=30YZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forest","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER ?  Rutherford brings England s New Forest to life  (The Seattle Times) in this companion to the critically acclaimed Sarum From the time of the Norman Conquest to the present day, the New Forest, along England s southern coast, has remained an almost mythical place. It is here that Saxon and Norman kings rode forth with their hunting parties, and where William the Conqueror s son Rufus was mysteriously killed. The mighty oaks of the forest were used to build the ships for Admiral Nelson s navy, and the fishermen who lived in Christchurch and Lymington helped Sir Francis Drake fight off the Spanish Armada. The New Forest is the perfect backdrop for the families who people this epic story. The feuds, wars, loyalties, and passions of many hundreds of years reach their climax in a crime that shatters the decorous society of Bath in the days of Jane Austen, whose family lived on the edge of the Forest.

The earliest mining activity in North America took place along the trail; local Native Americans mined a huge vein of turquoise that was visible on the surface. In the age of horses and wagons, the road ran through dusty Wild West towns, mining districts, and mountains, which were once roamed by thousands of prospectors with dreams of finding the mother lode. When mining became unprofitable, the inhabitants packed whatever they could into their cars and pulled out, seeking employment elsewhere. But a time came when people realized there was still potential in these old ghost towns. The buildings that once housed miners and the businesses that supported them are now occupied by art galleries, boutiques, and modern pioneers.

Fred Waitzkin depicted the joys and trials of parenthood with remarkable perception in Searching for Bobby Fischer, the inspiration for the beloved major motion picture. A New York Times Notable Book, The Last Marlin is another sweeping family saga, the tale of an adolescence spent navigating between two very different parents and the discovery of a lifelong passion for deep-sea fishing. Waitzkin s father, Abe, is both a prolific salesman the  Beethoven of fluorescent lighting  in the fifties and a frail man, driven to succeed despite his declining health, while his mother, Stella, is an eccentric abstract artist, once a student of de Kooning and Hans Hoffman, and a free spirit who resents her husband s dirty business tactics and conventional notions of success. As their relationship disintegrates, Waitzkin is torn between them. But soon he finds solace on the ocean. At first, fishing is a way to bond with Abe and irritate Stella but over the years it becomes a way of life. From the Long Island Sound to the drug-infested coastline of Bimini and the marlin-rich waters of the Gulf Stream, Waitzkin comes to believe that fishing is the answer to all his problems, even as he starts his own family. Hailed by Outside magazine as  a graceful fatherson memoir that artfully braids rich, disparate strands,  The Last Marlin is a tribute to the open sea, the solitude it provides, and the connections it fosters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OZbvDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Well-Appointed Bath: Authentic Plans and Fixtures from the 1900's (Landmark Reprint Series)","description":"Illustrated trade catalogs intended as practical guides for restoring and rehabilitating historic buildings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wnMFAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Well-Appointed+Bath:+Authentic+Plans+and+Fixtures+from+the+1900%27s+(Landmark+Reprint+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries","description":"The most famous conspiracy of silence in the history of antiquity is examined here by one of the three archaeologists entrusted by the Archaeological Society of Athens with the final excavations of the Sanctuary.

This powerful practice is illuminated by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in his commentary on an essential text based on the atiyoga dzogchen instructions of the outstanding nineteenth-century master Patrul Rinpoche. Three Words That Strike the Vital Point is the famous seminal statement by Garap Dorje that is said to encapsulate all the myriad dzogchen tantras. The key instructions on it by Patrul Rinpoche the verses known as \\"The Special Teaching of Khepa Shri Gyalpo\\" form the basis for the discourse in Primordial Purity. It explains that in dzogchen, when one has fully recognized that all the confusion of samsara is the expressive power of great emptiness, confusion is spontaneously liberated into the primordial purity of mind s essential nature.

He was appointed by Abraham Lincoln as a political general in the Union army, a move that successfully galvanized northern support and provided a huge influx of German recruits who were eager to  fight mit Sigel.  But Sigel proved an inept and ineffectual leader and, unfortunately, is most often remembered for his disappointing failure at the Battle of New Market and his subsequent loss of command. In his insightful biography, Stephen D. Engle provides the first complete portrait of this enigmatic leader and German standard-bearer, showing Sigel to be a disciplined, self-sacrificing idealist who sparked more pride among his fellow  migr s, aroused more controversy among Americans, and perhaps enjoyed more admiration despite his military shortcomings than any other Civil War figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mgUeCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Gielgud.","description":"Sir John Gielgud's career as an actor was perhaps the most distinguished of any of his generation, and, in a lifetime that spanned almost a century, he appeared in hundreds of theatrical productions and films, receiving virtually every honor given, including an Academy Award. Now, in this wonderfully insightful biography, fully authorized and written with first-ever access to Gielgud's personal letters and diaries, bestselling biographer Sheridan Morley not only traces the actor's fascinating career, but provides a fresh and remarkably frank look into John Gielgud the man, showing how his success as an actor in many ways came at the expense of his personal happiness. Born into a theatrical family, John Gielgud took to the stage as naturally as a duck to water, and almost from the beginning, those who saw him perform knew that they were experiencing something extraordinary. A determined actor, intent on learning and polishing his craft, he worked incessantly, taking on one role after another, the greater the challenge, the better. During his long and remarkable career, he took on every truly great and demanding role, including all of Shakespeare's major plays as well as many contemporary and experimental productions. At ease in both great drama and light comedy, he was blessed with a great range and a seemingly infinite capacity to inhabit whatever character he attempted. Basically a somewhat shy man offstage, however, Gielgud for the most part limited his friendships to those with whom he worked, and as a result the theater -- and later, film -- made up just about his entire life. That he was flesh and blood, however, was reflected in the fact that he did enter into two long-term relationships, the first with a man who eventually left him for another, but with whom Gielgud maintained a strong tie, and the second with a handsome, mysterious Hungarian who lived with him until he died, just a few months before Sir John. True scandal came into Gielgud's life only once. In 1953, just weeks after Gielgud had been knighted by the Queen, he was arrested in a public men's room and charged with solicitation. The British press had a field day, but Gielgud's friends and fellow actors rallied to his support, as did his thousands of fans, and the result was the eventual change of law in England regarding sex between consenting adults. While these and many other aspects of his personal life are discussed for the first time in this distinguished biography, it is Gielgud's career as an actor, of course, that receives the greatest attention. And while British audiences had the pleasure of seeing him perform in the theater for his entire life, Americans came to know him best for his work in the movies, and most especially for his Oscar-winning performance as Hobson the butler in the Dudley Moore film Arthur. As dramatic and captivating as one of Sir John's many performances, this authorized biography is an intimate and fully rounded portrait of an unforgettable actor and a remarkable man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HUdOdkY7_x4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grammaire Francaise (French Edition)","description":"A clear and concise review of the essentials of french grammar, the workbook compliments the main text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=myJcQgAACAAJ&dq=Grammaire+Francaise+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)","description":"Sumptuously illustrated in color and packed with information, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece is now available for the first time in paperback.

Jane tells the spectral story of the life and death of Maggie Nelson s aunt Jane, who was murdered in 1969 while a first-year law student at the University of Michigan. Though officially unsolved, Jane s murder was apparently the third in a series of seven brutal rape-murders in the area between 1967 and 1969. Nelson was born a few years after Jane s death, and the narrative is suffused with the long shadow her murder cast over both the family and her psyche. Exploring the nature of this haunting incident via a collage of poetry, prose, dream-accounts, and documentary sources, including local and national newspapers, related  true crime  books such as The Michigan Murders and Killer Among Us, and fragments from Jane s own diaries written when she was 13 and 21, its eight sections cover Jane s childhood and early adulthood, her murder and its investigation, the direct and diffuse effect of her death on Nelson s girlhood and sisterhood, and a trip to Michigan Nelson took with her mother (Jane s sister) to retrace the path of Jane s final hours. Each piece in Jane has its own form, and the movement from each piece to the next--along with the white space that surrounds each fragment--serve as important fissures, disrupting the tabloid,  page-turner  quality of the story, and eventually returning the reader to deeper questions about girlhood, empathy, identification, and the essentially unknowable aspects of another s life and death. Equal parts a meditation on violence (serial, sexual violence in particular), and a conversation between the living and the dead, Jane s powerful and disturbing subject matter, combined with its innovations in genre, shows its readers what poetry is capable of--what kind of stories it can tell, and how it can tell them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=btsREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Greek Concept Of Nature (Suny Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline Theories of Advanced Mathematics for ...

Roger Lewinter believes that in the realm of art,  the distinction between life and death loses its relevance, the one taking place in the other.  Whereas Story of Love in Solitude is a group of small stories, The Attraction of Things is a continuous narrative (more or less) of a man seeking (or stumbling upon) enlightenment.  The Attraction of Things,  states Lewinter,  is the story of a being who lets himself go toward what attracts him, toward what he attracts beings, works, things and who, through successive encounters, finds the way out of the labyrinth, to the heart, where the bolt of illumination strikes. This is the story of a letting go toward the illumination.

After dispatching his victims, police allege he left their bloodstained bodies and crept back to the neatly kept room in his mother's apartment. Sleep my little dead... The taunting, bizarre letters alleged killer Heriberto Seda sent to the police and the New York Post were full of strange symbols and mysterious references to the Zodiac. For six terror-filled years, the Zodiac killer ruled the night, claiming nine victims in his homicidal rage. One of the biggest manhunts in New York City's history was unleashed...and still the body count rose. When would the terror end? Police claim his lethal fury finally exploded one summer afternoon. After shooting his own sister, he held her boyfriend hostage and kept scores of heavily armed police pinned down in a ferocious firefight that finally ended with his surrender. But it was only when an alert detective recognized a symbol drawn on Seda's confession as similar to the personal signature used by the Zodiac Killer in his letters, that investigators concluded that the madman they had arrested was in fact the notorious Zodiac Killer. Author Kieran Crowley, an award-winning New York Post reporter who covered the case from the first grisly shooting and cracked the psychopath's secret code, reveals the exclusive inside story and finally solves the biggest remaining mystery of the case.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hI-RlFX37M8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passenger to Teheran","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F-DNuBVVOUMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Face of the Tiger","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wallpaper From Space","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spanish History since 1808 (Hodder Arnold Publication)","description":"The history of Spain has been revitalized since the death of Franco in 1975 and the restoration of democracy.

But nothing prepared her mind, body, soul, and spirit for what she experienced on the frontlines of the Iraq war as a member of the Bravo Surgical Company. Known as the \\"devil docs,\\" they followed directly behind the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force as they entered Iraq at the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. Right along with the Marines, Commander Ruff, the only female nurse anesthetist at the front, and the rest of her surgical team learned to endure the brutal conditions of the desert while regularly confronting questions of life and death. Working in temperatures well over 100 degrees in full MOP gear, Ruff and her team set up mobile hospital tents in the sand wherever needed. As Black Hawk helicopters brought in steady streams of the wounded, they found it impossible to maintain standard sterilization procedures, and clean up often amounted to just shovelling the blood-soaked sand out of the tent. During surgery they often wore lighted helmets so they could continue operating if the generator failed and donned gas masks when warnings were issued. These horrific conditions, coupled with the gruesome images of shredded bodies and the cries of wounded children, became Ruff's world. This is her story of the war, up close and personal. It is a story of sacrifice, survival, and courage, movingly written by a woman unconditionally dedicated to the life-saving mission of the United States Navy Nurse Corps.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BTRlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hero-Surfing","description":"Adventure on the high seas!

Giddins argues that from novice to grandmaster, a player's basic task when choosing a repertoire is the same: he needs to select openings that suit his playing style and that he can play with confidence. The repertoire should not require more memory work and study than he is capable of, or has time for.

At the same time, it is a spiritual memoir of a man whose innovative system of cultivating the earth reflects a deep faith in the wholeness and balance of the natural world. As Wendell Berry writes in his preface, the book  is valuable to us because it is at once practical and philosophical. It is an inspiring, necessary book about agriculture because it is not just about agriculture.  Trained as a scientist, Fukuoka rejected both modern agribusiness and centuries of agricultural practice, deciding instead that the best forms of cultivation mirror nature s own laws. Over the next three decades he perfected his so-called  do-nothing  technique: commonsense, sustainable practices that all but eliminate the use of pesticides, fertilizer, tillage, and perhaps most significantly, wasteful effort. Whether you re a guerrilla gardener or a kitchen gardener, dedicated to slow food or simply looking to live a healthier life, you will find something here you may even be moved to start a revolution of your own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Uo1tTcpDmkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interpretation: Techniques and Exercises (Professional Interpreting in the Real World)","description":"Only added for successful withdrawal","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ce0FMzKFchwC&dq=Interpretation:+Techniques+and+Exercises+(Professional+Interpreting+in+the+Real+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white unicorn;: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Early French Cookery: Sources, History, Original Recipes and Modern Adaptations","description":"A scrumptious introduction to the cuisine of wealthy French medieval manors revives a host of practical but delicious recipes from the Middle Ages, all adapted to the modern kitchen.

The Rahway's steam and diesel locomotives supported local commerce, provided passenger service, and carried a vast array of goods to and from local businesses. It connected the area with larger railroads, such as the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Lehigh Valley, and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western. One of the shortest yet most prosperous of American railroads, the Rahway Valley helped transform a rural region into one of New Jersey's most vital and populous areas. The Rahway Valley Railroad presents the story of this colorful short line with rare, vintage photographs of locomotives, passengers, stations, and train crews. It recounts how the Rahway Valley evolved from the New York and New Orange Railroad, linking Union County towns with Newark Heights (Maplewood), in adjoining Essex County. Images in this book include passengers riding Rahway Valley trains to picnics, church outings, and Springfield's world-famous Baltusrol Golf Club. Readers will learn how this feisty little line competed successfully for many years against the trucking industry and the interstate highway system during a time when many small railroads were dying out. The Rahway Valley Railroad tells the distinctively American story of a proud short line that competed with forces larger than itself and faithfully served the local merchants and residents who now remember it so fondly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K_yN6p12rhsC&dq=The+Rahway+Valley+Railroad+(NJ)+(Images+of+Rail)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thistle Soup (Summersdale Travel)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","description":"Chronicles a young woman's rise to the top of the fashion world of nineteenth-century France and England and portrays life in a period couture house","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VWZrlFGbUxYC&dq=Banners+of+Silk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buttissimo (Gay Erotic Art Photography)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o0HQOAAACAAJ&dq=Buttissimo+(Gay+Erotic+Art+Photography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Out with C++, Standard Version 2005 Update Package (4th Edition) (Gaddis Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Psalms translated and explained","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The preaching event (Lyman Beecher lectures)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Classics from the New Yankee Workshop","description":"The master carpenter presents thirteen new projects, including a rocking horse, an Adirondack chair, a corner cupboard, a pencil-post bed, a garden bench, and more","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G5I_PgAACAAJ&dq=Classics+from+the+New+Yankee+Workshop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portrait of the Canadian Rockies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Using Your Money Wisely: Biblical Principles Under Scrutiny","description":"Nearly 80 percent of all divorced couples between the ages of 20 and 30 list financial difficulties as the primary cause of their separation.

We evolved over a period of millions of years to survive in small tribal families on the wild grassy plains of East Africa. Now the way we live has nothing to do with that time and place, but the mental tools that were developed to survive on the savanna have remained unchanged. These instincts were wonderfully adapted to the environment that shaped them. But that world, the world that made us, is gone. Now these same instincts are causing us to destroy the world that we made. The threats we face are of our own making, and we can unmake them. If people learn how we have come to this point, we can restore our hope for the future. NWNM describes the way our minds have evolved, and offers suggestions for how to cope with who we are in the world we live in now. Recent decades have seen remarkable progress in many areas. For example, while not overlooking the abject suffering of millions of people, it is nonetheless true that there has been unprecedented alleviation of poverty and disease for the world's poorest people. There are so many promising and astonishing advances in medicine, technology, and the social and physical sciences that if we give ourselves a chance to survive, our species could enter a golden age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a6VlzgEACAAJ&dq=New+World+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The language of the self: The function of language in psychoanalysis","description":"Wilden expands and amplifies the text with extensive notes and a commentary that places Lacan's work in the context of contemporary thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3RoAEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+language+of+the+self:+The+function+of+language+in+psychoanalysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saber & Scapegoat","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When Romeo Wrote Juliet: Your Inspirational Guide to the Art of Writing Love Letters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9r-nkQEACAAJ&dq=When+Romeo+Wrote+Juliet:+Your+Inspirational+Guide+to+the+Art+of+Writing+Love+Letters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Topaz Man Presents: A Dream Come True","description":"A collection of favorite love stories features the tale of a woman who travels back in time to the New Orleans of 1844 to meet her dream lover, and four other powerful and passionate stories.

Storytelling is an even rarer skill. A genuinely comic vision is beyond price. The Ordways has all three.   Time On the annual graveyard-working day in Clarksville, Texas, families come from all over East Texas to pay respects to their loved ones. The Ordways are one such clan, and in this eloquent and original novel, our narrator recounts the story of how he and his kin arrived in this magical land where the South meets the West. The tale begins with his great-grandfather, Thomas Ordway, who lost his sight at the Battle of Shiloh and vowed to quit Tennessee forever. He crossed the Red River into Texas and stopped on the edge of the featureless prairie, a landscape too mystifying even for a sightless man. Years later, the narrator s grandfather, Sam Ordway, was forced to leave the forest behind when his three-year-old son, Ned, was kidnapped by a neighbor. Sam scoured the vast state of Texas in search of Ned but never found the boy. The mystery of what happened to him and what his long-hoped-for return might mean to the Ordways brings William Humphrey s brilliant second novel to its rich and satisfying conclusion. A masterful blend of comedy, tragedy, and history, The Ordways is great American fiction in the tradition of William Faulkner and Mark Twain.

Smart organizations create a win-win situation by building membership programs that engage individuals in social change and assure long-term financial success for their organization. Successful membership programs provide individuals with valuable services, a place in a community, and advocates who work on their behalf. In return, members provide organizations with volunteers, expertise, credibility, future leadership, political clout, word-of-mouth support, financial assistance, and a team of readily available loyalists.

Written for both new and well-established organizations, this book is grounded in proven marketing techniques. It gives managers and executive directors the information and tools needed to understand their current members and attract new ones, and it walks organizations through the process of linking program goals with membership goals.

Both are fabulously wealthy media magnates who have entered politics. And both have a possessive passion for football. Berlusconi owns Forza Milan and, as many fans note with mixed feelings, Thaksin recently attempted to acquire a 30 per cent stake in Liverpool FC. But there is more to him than football. He became Thailand's prime minister in early 2001 after a landslide election victory in which he promised to 'think new, act new' to transform the country's economy and politics. Since then, Thaksin has been highly popular but also highly controversial. Two long-standing observers have described him as 'the best prime minister Thailand has ever had' and 'another grubby businessman'. This is the first serious study of Thaksin in English. It examines where he comes from and what he is trying to do. The authors, an economics professor and independent author, have written several other books on economics, politics and current affairs in Thailand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bPjRk3FMEJwC&dq=Thaksin:+The+Business+Of+Politics+In+Thailand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Servomechanisms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=46M1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Servomechanisms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","description":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God brings profound new insights to the Trinitarian doctrines of \\"orthodox\\" Christianity. With clear and precise documentation, the book shows how these doctrines migrated into early Christianity from Greek philosophy. The various aspects of Trinitarian belief are isolated, linked to their Greek sources, and carefully analyzed to show they differ radically from biblical teaching. The writings of early church fathers, portrayed in their historical context, show that during the second century, theological concepts taught in Platonism were adopted as Christianity struggled to end Roman persecution. Emperor Marcus Aurelius, a famous Stoic philosopher, was putting Christians to death because their belief did not conform to the Hellenized religion of the day. The book shows that the early Church Fathers sought to save their people's lives by redefining the Christian God in Greek terms. Their efforts brought metaphysics to Christianity and ushered in concepts like the Trinity. After presenting the historical setting in which these philosophical errors were embraced as Christian doctrine, the book compares orthodox Christian theology today, called \\"classical theism,\\" to biblical teachings. The book identifies how Greek phillosophy has influenced major atributes of God taught in classical theism. The book constitutes a major challenge to those who accept the tenants of classical theism but do not know the many aspects of their doctrine that are based on Greek philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r01XxQEACAAJ&dq=How+Greek+Philosophy+Corrupted+the+Christian+Concept+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Our Own Image: Treasured African-American Traditions, Journeys & Icons","description":"A unique scrapbook provides a visual celebration of black social and cultural history, from World War II to the present, by recreating African-American traditions and family life with simple, poignant stories of family reunions, worship, weddings, funerals, barbecues, and other events, accompanied by photographs, programs, movie posters, and ticket stubs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=85QJAAAACAAJ&dq=In+Our+Own+Image:+Treasured+African-American+Traditions,+Journeys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom","description":"Offers counseling on sane living in today's world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dtd_XaGvcLUC&dq=The+Delany+Sisters%27+Book+of+Everyday+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slim Naturally: Advanced Weight Loss System","description":"?? 55% OFF for Bookstores!

This book, written by first-time author James Morgan, was born out of his real-life experiences of growing up poor in a steel town in the Midwest. Never having met his father and raised by a struggling single-mother, James became a byproduct of his environment. In this book, he shares the psychological techniques, mindset shifts, and practical tools he used to get his life on track and out of the victim mindset. He shares in a way that anyone can use to take back control and ownership of their life, no matter how disempowering their current or past circumstances may seem. In his authorial debut, James walks the reader through a poignant narrative on how to shatter the illusions of the victim mindset once and for all, and step into their true power as a master of their circumstances. As the name implies, this book is highly transformational and is the result of decades of James's personal trial and error before he found his true calling in life: becoming a family-focused licensed therapist and counselor. Today, James helps families grow stronger by harnessing the power of accountability while finding relief from blame, guilt, and the traumas of their past. His mission is to help people around the world achieve inner mastery over their lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xJVeEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","description":"Authored by the editor of the leading travel magazine for people with disabilities, Emerging Horizons, this second edition of Barrier Free Travel continues to be the definitive guide to accessible travel for those who use a wheelchair, walker, or cane or have any physical ailment that may slow down their gait.

This is the focus of The Six Sigma Journey from Art to Science, which explains the Six Sigma process in a very understandable and easy-to-read manner. the book is a fictional novel which follows the main character as he implements Six Sigma in his company. it chronicles the deployment of Six Sigma along with the real events that happen as companies implement Six Sigma, including the people who oppose it, what is needed to make Six Sigma work, and the many successes and the failures along the way. Through the use of examples and the lives of the characters, the reader gains an understanding of not only the technical aspect of Six Sigma but also the human side. Because the book is more motivational than technical the reader gets a much better understanding of why Six Sigma is successful. an ideal book for any company looking to get started in Six Sigma, or those experienced in Six Sigma hoping to better educate employees on the process. I 'know' all the people in the book -- the true believers, the cynics, the 'supporters' who give lip service only, those truly committed and involved, and those looking for ways to make the initiative fail. I know them because I have worked with them, trained them, counseled and suffered with them, as they worked so hard to do the right things for their companies. a very worthwhile, non-technical book for executives, managers and people just wanting to get an understanding of what Six Sigma is all about and some of the hazards and complexities of implementation. - Michael D.

The book reveals how the behind-the-scenes clique which really rules Germany is plotting to undermine the peace, split the United Nations, and convert military defeat into actual victory. Written by two journalists who have won an international reputation for their expos s of fifth-column activities and worldwide fascist intrigues, this book offers thoroughly documented, indisputable evidence to prove that Germany s undercover apparatus is at work in the United States today, laying the groundwork for a post-war secret offensive against America. The book disclosed how German spies and assassins are already carrying out their new assignments in the United States, as throughout the rest of the world. The Plot Against the Peace is a book that names names. Among the vitally important disclosures discussed are how Germany is secretly preparing for the continued post-war operations of the Nazi apparatus; the real story behind the German factories of death; the clandestine building of German hidden arsenals in Spain, Argentina and other countries; the plot for maintaining a Nazi-Junker officer corps in temporary exile abroad after the war; who are the  real brains  behind the German international network; how the Germans have smuggled funds, diamonds and other valuables into the United States to finance their post-war machinations; and what the German plans are for disuniting the United Nations, inciting international turmoil and thus making impossible the fulfilment of the Allied peace aims. The authors have left nothing to the imagination in their account of the hitherto untold secret history of Nazism, and in their description of the character and deeds of the German General Staff. But, as the authors write,  Those facts had to be recorded and they have to be read.

But Katherine cannot escape her past, as Michael Graves, a fellow Irish  migr  in Spain, forces her to reexamine all her relationships: to her lover, her art, and the homeland she only thought she knew. The South is a novel of classic themes of art and exile, and of the seemingly irreconcilable yearnings for love and freedom to which Colm T ib n brings a new, passionate sensitivity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fj2ARq1nbZIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Intertextual War: Edmund Burke and the French Revolution in the Writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, Thomas Paine, and James Mackintosh","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wild Man Island","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fog Magic (A Puffin Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","description":"Like tentacles on a vast octopus, the firsthand investigations in The Blood Bankers all lead to one core.

A rogues' gallery of international criminals owes its existence to the dramatic growth of the underground global economy over the last two decades. Our world is being reshaped, often in sinister fashion, by wide open capital markets and an international banking network that exists to launder hundreds of billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. Here is an inside look at globalization's dark side the new high growth global markets for influence-peddling, capital flight, money laundering, weapons, drugs, tax evasion, child labor, illegal immigration, and other forms of transnational crime.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bcIuBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories For Children","description":"Isaac Bashevis Singer is known for his mastery of storytelling - but it was not until 1966, at the age of sixty-two, that he published his first children's book, Zlateh the Goat, a Newbery Honor Book and instant classic. Singer went on to write many stories for children, most of which are included in this volume, along with a brief introduction and a special epilogue, \\"Are Children the Ultimate Literary Critics?\\" The collection presents exuberant and timeless tales for children rich in fantasy and deeply rooted in the lost cultural tradition of his native Poland.

Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women's protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AHMuHpRYTeQC&dq=An+Interpersonal+Approach+to+Child+Therapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Temporary Husband (Fairytale Weddings Trilogy) (Larger Print Harlequin Romance, No 3433)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents Stories to Be Read With the Door Locked","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xKUSuwEACAAJ&dq=Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents+Stories+to+Be+Read+With+the+Door+Locked&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow","description":"Chronicles the history of the laws enacted following the conclusion of the Civil War that segregated the South into white and non-white segments, discussing how they were established, justified, and finally dismantled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b6kqyvZK2bQC&dq=American+Nightmare:+The+History+of+Jim+Crow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oneness View of Jesus Christ","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ydusPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Oneness+View+of+Jesus+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Till Death Do Us Part","description":"What is the marriage law?

In fact, according to bestselling author Craig Groeschel in Altar Ego, you need to take your idea of your own identity, lay it down on the altar, and sacrifice it. Give it to God. Offer it up. Why? Because you are who GOD says you are. And until you ve sacrificed your broken concept of your identity, you won t become who you are meant to be. When we place our false labels and self-deception on the altar of God s truth, we discover who we really are as his sons and daughters. Instead of an outward-driven, approval-based ego, we learn to live with an  altar  ego, God s vision of who we are becoming. Discover how to trade in your broken ego and unleash your altar ego to become a living sacrifice. Once we know our true identity and are growing in our Christ-like character, then we can behave accordingly, with bold behavior, bold prayers, bold words, and bold obedience.

Wayne Muller's luminous new book gently guides us to the place where we are already perfect, already blessed with the wisdom we need to live a life of meaning, purpose and grace. He starts, as do so many spiritual teachers, with simple questions: Who am I? What do I love? How shall I live, knowing I will die? What is my gift to the family of the earth? He then takes us deeper, exploring each question through transformative true stories. We meet men and women--Wayne's neighbors, friends, patients--who have discovered love, courage, and kindness even in the midst of sorrow and loss. And through them we glimpse that relentless spark of spiritual magic that burns within each of us. Woven throughout are contemplations, daily practices, poems, and teachings from the great wisdom teachings. Page by page, we become more awake to the joy and mystery of this precious human life, and to the unique gifts every one of us has to offer the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vVBwAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Practical Xilinx Designer Lab Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dj73v5TzQOkC&dq=The+Practical+Xilinx+Designer+Lab+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Huenefeld Guide to Book Publishing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_-ZAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Huenefeld+Guide+to+Book+Publishing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jean Auel","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ?

Whatever obstacles she faces, Ayla finds inventive ways to lessen the difficulties of daily life, searching for wild edibles to make meals and experimenting with techniques to ease the long journeys the Zelandonii must take while honing her skills as a healer and a leader. And there are the Sacred Caves that Ayla s mentor takes her to see. They are filled with remarkable paintings of mammoths, lions, and bears, and their mystical aura at times overwhelms Ayla.

Since the inception of the Library in 1906, nearly 1200 unique volumes have been published, constantly placing the world's greatest books before a large public. A few of these titles proved unpopular and were never reprinted. But most were reprinted dozens of times, packaged in numerous ways, and benefited from updated editorial work and book design over the last century. Terry Seymour has studied and researched every aspect of this great mass of books. He now captures and distills this knowledge in A Printing History of Everyman's Library 1906-1982. A critical feature, of course, is to update the various collecting factoids that have emerged since 2005 when his Guide to Collecting Everyman's Library was published. The meat of the new book, however, is the Bibliographical Entries section. Each volume that has ever been printed receives its own entry, detailing every printing, each dust jacket variation, any new introductions, updated scarcity numbers, and all relevant notes. Typically an entry contains at least six lines of information, but often much more. In essence, each entry is a story written exclusively about each volume. Armed with this resource, collectors and booksellers can know reliably everything about the Everyman's Library volume that sits on their shelf or is ready to be purchased or sold. They will see how a book fits into the total printing history of that title, and be able to describe and value the book with precision. To further enhance the value of this book, color images illustrate all of the key collecting points. An extensive index of editors, translators and artists is now included. Not just a solo effort, the Printing History has been vetted by other expert collectors, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DbUp4qfbE_sC&dq=The+rights+of+man+(Everyman%27s+library,+718A)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Infant and Child in the Culture of Today: the Guidance of Development in Home and Nursery School","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bright Minds, Beautiful Ideas: Parallel Thoughts in Different Times","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pornography And Silence - Culture's Revenge Against Nature","description":"A masterwork of feminist ideology, brilliantly exposing pornography as the antithesis of free expression and the enemy of liberty In this powerful and devastating critique, poet, philosopher, and feminist Susan Griffin exposes the inherent psychological horrors of pornography. Griffin argues that, rather than encouraging expression, pornographic images and the philosophies that support them actually stifle freedoms through the dehumanization, subjugation, and degradation of female subjects. The pornographic mindset, Griffin contends, is akin to racism in that it causes dangerous schisms in society and promotes sexual regression, fear, and hatred. This violent rift in Western culture is explored by examining the lives of six notable individuals across two centuries: Franz Marc, the Marquis de Sade, Kate Chopin, Lawrence Singleton, Anne Frank, and Marilyn Monroe. The result is an extraordinary new approach to evaluating sexual health and the parameters of erotic imagination. Griffin reveals pornography as  not a love of the life of the body, but a fear of bodily knowledge, and a desire to silence Eros.

Many have adopted a narrow vision, focusing on only one aspect of ministry. But in today's environment of faith-based opportunities many Christians are eager to start reaching out to their world with both Good News and good works, and therefore they are searching for appropriate ways to integrate both into their ministry. In Churches That Make a Difference, best-selling author Ron Sider and his coauthors give those involved in community outreach a comprehensive resource for developing holistic ministry--a balance of evangelism and social outreach. Illustrations and helpful organizational tips detail the how-to's of an effective holistic ministry. Case studies that show how different churches across the United States reach out to their communities provide a variety of ideas and practical applications. User-friendly tools are included as well for congregational studies, surveys, evaluations, and community assessments. The authors draw on extensive experience with church ministries and faith-based organizations as they share the life-changing vision and biblical mandate for living the whole gospel. Church leaders will be encouraged in their process of developing and maintaining a holistic ministry, and local churches will rediscover a passion for loving the whole person the way Jesus did.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8v17JqM_8l0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bobby Robson","description":"Silver Linings examines an historic and unforgettable period in the history of England's national football team. In his eight years as England boss, Bobby Robson was celebrated, derided, Diego-ed, and everything in between. His team missed one European Championship, self-destructed at another, were cheated out of Mexico 86, and then, just before he left, came within two kicks of a World Cup final. On this journey he had managed the good, the bad and sometimes the ugly. But through it all he maintained his belief not only in himself and his team, but in the notion of England. Faced with an unprecedented level of media hostility, Robson's team were inconsistent and frustrating, but at their best few could match them. Alf Ramsey may have won football's greatest prize in 1966 but no other England manager could equal the sheer drama of Robson's eight years in charge. Set against the backdrop of a vicious newspaper circulation war and the rise of hooliganism, this is the story of how Robson managed to deliver the seemingly impossible: hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sJj_zQEACAAJ&dq=Bobby+Robson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New York Times Guide to Alternative Health","description":"A resource for anyone interested in alternative healing covers herbal remedies, acupuncture, homeopathy, massage therapy, Chinese medicine, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hrh6nq3NjbAC&dq=The+New+York+Times+Guide+to+Alternative+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stochastic Control Framework for Real Options in Strategic Valuation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Behavioral Statistics in Action","description":"Written for students taking their first course in psychological statistics, this text uses a clear and friendly style to provide an abundance of worked examples, visual displays, interim concept quizzes and other means of reassuring students uncomfortable with maths that they are indeed making progress in the course.

Artfully combining sports journalism with social history and sharp pop culture references, The Mavericks explores 1970s football when a cult group of footballers delivered flair on the pitch and flamboyance off it. Cocky, coiffured strikers meet David Bowie and Alvin Stardust; Gola boots exchange kicks with A Clockwork Orange and The Likely Lads; Admiral sock tags, platform heels and kipper ties mingle with cod wars, Harrods bombings and three-day weeks. In this, Steen recreates the early Seventies, the era when football joined the vanguard of English youth culture. This personal account revolves around seven Englishmen who followed in the trail blazed by football's first tabloid star, George Best  Stan Bowles, Tony Currie, Charlie George, Alan Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Peter Osgood and Frank Worthington. Proud individuals amid an increasingly corporate environment, their invention and artistry were matched only by a disdain for authority and convention. Their belief in football as performance art, as showbiz, gave the game a boost, and elevated them to cult status. During their heyday, nevertheless, they were largely ignored by a succession of England managers, none of whom were able to assemble a side competent enough to qualify for the World Cup finals. Against a backdrop of increasing violence on the field and terraces alike, of battles between players and the Establishment, this book - now featuring a new Foreword and Postscript - examines an anomaly at the heart of English culture, one that symbolised the death of post-Sixties optimism, the end of innocence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0lXXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triumph","description":"This is a comprehensive, visual history of the motorcycles from Britain that were bred in the US and Canada.

On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge seized power in Phnom Penh. In the three years, eight months, and twenty days of their government, they made a tabula rasa of Cambodian society and culture, forcing the people to evacuate the cities and move to the countryside. They instituted a total collectivism based on the doctrine of \\"Pol Pot-ism,\\" the Cambodian version of fundamentalist Maoism. Assembled in this collection are the sayings that make up a \\"newspeak\\" uttered by the Khmer Rouge cadres: slogans, maxims, advice, instructions, watchwords, orders, warnings, and threats.

While studying metaphysics and other related material(s) I found that my Africa was full of metaphysical teachings and tales of strange beings that come at night and visit the secret society members. Many of the stories conveyed by people in other countries didn't 'match' the stories I found in other countries, save the physical descriptions of the beings...So with that I wrote this book to tell other oral accounts of the metaphysical / spiritual beings, and women's history that is not heard here in the United States. What are your credentials for undertaking a book of this type? I have done a lot of field work and traveled to record the accounts of other peoples stories concerning 'other world beings', and women's true history. I've been to secret sites (and don't ask me where), talked to Shamans, Marabouts, and Bokors...All over the past ten years. Who is the book written for? UFO researchers, Book clubs, Art Bell listeners (millions of them), scholars of the metaphysical studies, and xenophobes? How does your book differ from others of its type? For one, it is not 'channeled', or remote 'viewed' that's why it's so short and to the point.

As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling - indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving - out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing, she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method, fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists; and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n6eiH3iPVKYC&dq=Cognition+in+Practice+:+Mind,+Mathematics+and+Culture+in+Everyday+Life+(Learning+in+Doing+S.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I-75 and the 401: A Traveler's Guide from Toronto to Miami [With *]","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fifth Column (Complete Works of Ernest Hemingway)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The White House an Historic Guide","description":"Describes the mansion's history, its architectural significance, and its contents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRyazgEACAAJ&dq=The+White+House+an+Historic+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Once Had a Master","description":"In his previous books, such as the S&M classic Mr Benson, Preston explored power exchange in all its battered beauty.

Benchmarks for Science Literacy takes this one step further. Created in close consultation with a cross-section of American teachers, administrators, and scientists, Benchmarks elaborates on the recommendations to provide guidelines for what all students should know and be able to do in science, mathematics, and technology by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. These grade levels offer reasonable checkpoints for student progress toward science literacy, but do not suggest a rigid formula for teaching. Benchmarks is not a proposed curriculum, nor is it a plan for one: it is a tool educators can use as they design curricula that fit their student's needs and meet the goals first outlined in Science for All Americans. Far from pressing for a single educational program, Project 2061 advocates a reform strategy that will lead to more curriculum diversity than is common today. IBenchmarks emerged from the work of six diverse school-district teams who were asked to rethink the K-12 curriculum and outline alternative ways of achieving science literacy for all students. These teams based their work on published research and the continuing advice of prominent educators, as well as their own teaching experience. Focusing on the understanding and interconnection of key concepts rather than rote memorization of terms and isolated facts, Benchmarks advocates building a lasting understanding of science and related fields. In a culture increasingly pervaded by science, mathematics, and technology, science literacy require habits of mind that will enable citizens to understand the world around them, make some sense of new technologies as they emerge and grow, and deal sensibly with problems that involve evidence, numbers, patterns, logical arguments, and technology--as well as the relationship of these disciplines to the arts, humanities, and vocational sciences--making science literacy relevant to all students, regardless of their career paths. If Americans are to participate in a world shaped by modern science and mathematics, a world where technological know-how will offer the keys to economic and political stability in the twenty-first century, education in these areas must become one of the nation's highest priorities. Together with Science for All Americans, Benchmarks for Science Literacy offers a bold new agenda for the future of science education in this country, one that is certain to prepare our children for life in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SKb94qXqOnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabbi's Northern Adventure: From the Heights of Alaska to the Golan Heights","description":"Rabbi Haber recounts his extraordinary experiences, from his service in the USA as Air Force Chaplain stationed in Alaska, through his current position as Chabad Rabbi on the Golan Heights.

Romantic stages were used in the productions of many of the most prominent actor-managers of the period, including Madame Vestris, Charles Kean, Wilson Barrett, Henry Irving and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. This work shows how the emphasis placed on the visual elements of Victorian productions--the spectacular romantic settings and historically accurate costumes--revolutionized the position that stage designers held. They emerged from anonymity, becoming recognized and highly-praised collaborators in the creative process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rs--wAEACAAJ&dq=Romantic+Stages:+Set+and+Costume+Design+in+Victorian+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Called unto liberty;: A life of Jonathan Mayhew, 1720-1766","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANMcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Called+unto+liberty%3B:+A+life+of+Jonathan+Mayhew,+1720-1766&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quest 64 (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"It's One O'Clock and Here Is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography","description":"One of the most beloved radio show hosts of the 1940s and 1950s, Mary Margaret McBride (1899 1976) regularly attracted between six and eight million listeners to her daily one o'clock broadcast. During her twenty years on the air she interviewed tens of thousands of people, from President Harry Truman and Frank Lloyd Wright to Rachel Carson and Zora Neale Hurston. This is her story. Five decades after their broadcast, her shows remain remarkably fresh and interesting. And yet McBride the Oprah Winfrey of her day has been practically forgotten, both in radio history and in the history of twentieth-century popular culture, primarily because she was a woman and because she was on daytime radio. Susan Ware explains how Mary Margaret McBride was one of the first to exploit the cultural and political importance of talk radio, pioneering the magazine-style format that many talk shows still use. This radio biography recreates the world of daytime radio from the 1930s through the 1950s, confirming the enormous significance of radio to everyday life, especially for women. In the first in-depth treatment of McBride, Ware starts with a description of how widely McBride was revered in the mid-1940s the fifteenth anniversary party for her show in 1949 filled Yankee Stadium. Once the readers have gotten to know Mary Margaret (as everyone called her), Ware backtracks to tell the story of McBride s upbringing, her early career, and how she got her start in radio. The latter part of the book picks up McBride's story after World War II and through her death in 1976. An epilogue discusses the contemporary talk show phenomenon with a look back to Mary Margaret McBride s early influence on the format.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8_ugBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living in Truth: 22 Essays Published on the Occasion of the Award of the Erasmus Prize to Vaclav Havel","description":"What was life in the Soviet Union really like? Through a series of true stories, One Day We Will Live Without Fear describes what people's day-to-day life was like under the regime of the Soviet police state. Drawing on events from the 1930s through the 1970s, Mark Harrison shows how, by accident or design, people became entangled in the workings of Soviet rule. The author outlines the seven principles on which that police state operated during its history, from the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and illustrates them throughout the book. Well-known people appear in the stories, but the central characters are those who will have been remembered only within their families: a budding artist, an engineer, a pensioner, a government office worker, a teacher, a group of tourists. Those tales, based on historical records, shine a light on the many tragic, funny, and bizarre aspects of Soviet life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3tlZCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The blind men and the elephant","description":"Using a familiar metaphor, the creator of True North's Mastering Projects Workshop and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Project Sun Workshop shows readers how anyone can transform a fuzzy project assignment into a meaningful, satisfying experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2-AUXEP8v30C&dq=The+blind+men+and+the+elephant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Corporate Communication","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Police Sergeant Examination (Barron's How to Prepare for the Police Sergeant Examination)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders","description":"In a thought-provoking essay on the new world of business in the aftermath of September 11th, an international business and policy expert argues that business leaders must help manage the critical balance between ensuring security and encouraging prosperity, tackling such issues as national security, deregulation, fighting terrorism, and Third World economies. 35,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mHXHwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Politics+of+Fortune:+A+New+Agenda+For+Business+Leaders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The M16/AR15 Rifle, 3rd Ed.

Generals, safe in their headquarters behind the lines, sent millions of men to their deaths to gain a few hundred yards of ground. Writers, notably Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, provided unforgettable images of the idiocy and tragedy of the war. Yet this vision of the war is at best a partial one, the war only achieving its status as the worst of wars in the last thirty years. At the time, the war aroused emotions of pride and patriotism. Not everyone involved remembered the war only for its miseries. The generals were often highly professional and indeed won the war in 1918. In this original and challenging book, Dan Todman shows views of the war have changed over the last ninety years and how a distorted image of it emerged and became dominant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ziHQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In praise of Aldus Manutius: a quincentenary exibition.: An article from: Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-8cxAQAAIAAJ&dq=In+praise+of+Aldus+Manutius:+a+quincentenary+exibition.:+An+article+from:+Papers+of+the+Bibliographical+Society+of+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The song of God: Bhagavad-Gita","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","description":"Heart-stopping adventure on the wild side of Seattle!

On the surface they may seem to differ greatly, but what appears on the surface is not always religion. Go beneath it, and one finds invariably the same sense of helplessness before the cosmic mysteries, and the same pathetic attempt to resolve it by appealing to higher powers.\\"--from Treatise on the Gods H. L. Mencken is perhaps best known for his scathing political satire. But politicians, as far as Mencken was concerned, had no monopoly on self-righteous chest-thumping, deceit, and thievery. He also found religion to be an adversary worthy of his attention and, in Treatise on the Gods, he offers some of his best shots, a choreographed cannonade. Mencken examines religion everywhere, from India to Peru, from the myths of Egypt to the traditional beliefs of America's Bible Belt. He compares Incas and Greeks, examines doctrines, dogmas, sacred texts, heresies, and ceremonies. He ranges far and wide, but returns at last to the subject that most provokes him: Christianity. He reviews the history of the Church and its founders. \\"It is Tertullian who is credited with the motto, Credo, quia absurdum est: I believe because it is incredible. Needless to say, he began life as a lawyer.\\" Mencken is no less interested in the dissidents: \\"The Reformers were men of courage, but not many of them were intelligent.\\" Against the old-time religion of fellow countrymen, Mencken posed as a figure of old-time skepticism, and he reaped the whirlwind. Controversial even before it was published in 1930, Treatise on the Gods remains what its author wished it to be: the plain, clear challenge of honest doubt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xF5M0xkD1hUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","description":"A chronological survey of the evolution of Western philosophy provides historical analysis of the thought of key figures and schools and explores the broad influence of Jewish, Islamic, and Asian philosophy, the importance of women philosophers, and other topics.

I ll Be Seeing You moved me and broadened my understanding of the human condition.  Wally Lamb, author of I Know This Much Is True Elizabeth Berg s father was an Army veteran who was a tough man in every way but one: He showed a great deal of love and tenderness to his wife. Berg describes her parents  marriage as a romance that lasted for nearly seventy years; she grew up watching her father kiss her mother upon leaving home, and kiss her again the instant he came back. His idea of when he should spend time away from her was never. But then Berg s father developed Alzheimer s disease, and her parents were forced to leave the home they loved and move into a facility that could offer them help. It was time for the couple s children to offer, to the best of their abilities, practical advice, emotional support, and direction to, in effect, parent the people who had for so long parented them. It was a hard transition, mitigated at least by flashes of humor and joy. The mix of emotions on everyone s part could make every day feel like walking through a minefield. Then came redemption. I ll Be Seeing You charts the passage from the anguish of loss to the understanding that even in the most fractious times, love can heal, transform, and lead to graceful and grateful acceptance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yr7NDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","description":"When Dr. Troy Abernathy, who doesn't believe in ghosts, brings his patient Lynn DeAngelis to Silent Hill to confront her delusions, they find themselves terrified and become trapped in the small town.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dgB5zgEACAAJ&dq=Silent+Hill:+Dying+Inside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Leave Her to Heaven","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The refugees","description":"From the author of The Sympathizer, winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, The Refugees is the second piece of fiction from a powerful voice in American letters, praised as  beautiful and heartrending  (Joyce Carol Oates, New Yorker),  terrific  (Chicago Tribune), and  an important and incisive book  (Washington Post) Published in hardcover to astounding acclaim, The Refugees is the remarkable debut collection of short stories by Viet Thanh Nguyen, winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Sympathizer. In these powerful stories, written over a period of twenty years and set in both Vietnam and America, Nguyen paints a vivid portrait of the experiences of people leading lives between two worlds, the adopted homeland and the country of birth. With the same incisiveness as in The Sympathizer, in The Refugees Viet Thanh Nguyen gives voice to the hopes and expectations of people making life-changing decisions to leave one country for another, and the rifts in identity, loyalties, romantic relationships, and family that accompany relocation. From a young Vietnamese refugee who suffers profound culture shock when he comes to live with two gay men in San Francisco, to a woman whose husband is suffering from dementia and starts to confuse her for a former lover, to a girl living in Ho Chi Minh City whose older half-sister comes back from America having seemingly accomplished everything she never will, the stories are a captivating testament to the dreams and hardships of migration. The second work of fiction by a major new voice in American letters, The Refugees is a beautifully written and sharply observed book about the aspirations of those who leave one country for another, and the relationships and desires for self-fulfillment that define our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W4v1DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freddi Fish","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u1q1wwEACAAJ&dq=Freddi+Fish&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guideposts Christmas Treasury","description":"Twelve Guideposts authors share the warmth of Christmas with readers.

A wild and uproarious masterpiece set in Sydney during the early depression years, it follows the hilarious exploits of its hero and narrator, Jack Gudgeon. Deserted by his long-suffering wife and gorgon-like sister-in-law, Gudgeon and his dreamy, disaster-prone teenage son, Stanley, manage to stumble into a never-ending series of adventures and catastrophes from which they invariably emerge with monumental hangovers. they are joined by a wonderful assortment of eccentric characters, who always materialize to enliven the parties that Gudgeon and son hold in their increasingly derelict home. Originally published during the Great Depression, Here's Luck was essential reading for those needing cheering up and Lower's genuine style - a blend of realism, absurdity, satire and wit - has rendered his work timeless.

Balzac's fable is discussed not only within the context from which it emerged--early nineteenth-century romanticism--but also in its embodiment of various attitudes towards art. Ashton illuminates a web of associations linking Balzac to C?zanne, Rilke, Schoenberg, Kandinsky and Picasso as they struggle with the yearning to express the inexpressible, to make concrete the abstract. As Professor Ashton develops the conjectures of her book she reveals the interrelations of literature, music, and art and the basic problems which engage or beset the contemporary artist and those who seek to understand and appreciate contemporary art. This is a book of extreme originality which ranges so widely and offers such valuable insights that it forms an important contribution not only to the history of art and culture, but also to the history of ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YJzGwAEACAAJ&dq=A+Fable+of+Modern+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philippine islands, Moluccas, Siam, Cambodia, Japan, and China, at the close of the sixteenth century (Works issued by The Hakluyt Society)","description":"The publications of the Hakluyt Society (founded in 1846) made available edited (and sometimes translated) early accounts of exploration.

This 1868 volume is the first publication in English of a book originally published in Mexico in 1609, which describes the Spanish 'discovery, conquest and conversion' of the Philippines in the sixteenth century, and the administration of this part of the Spanish empire.

Like many of E. Nesbit s works, it has proven popular with children and adults to this day. It has been adapted into a TV series, a musical, a film, and even an anime series. In this story, five siblings encounter an ancient magical creature in a gravel pit. The Psammead, as it calls itself, grants each of them a wish per day, with the restriction that it ends at sunset. As expected, all of the children s wishes go comically wrong, and it s up to them to solve the problems they created. E. Nesbit s enduring popularity is due in large part to the way she addresses children. Like Lewis Carrol and Kenneth Grahame, she engages children seriously, tapping into their imagination without any condescension. C. S. Lewis admired her, and the grumpy (but kind) sand-sorcerer Psamathos in Roverandom, a story J. R. R. Tolkien wrote for his own children, bears a striking resemblance to the Psammead indeed, an early version of the story featured the creature itself!

Expected to care for others before they care for themselves, forced to deal alone with emotional and physical abuse, black women have turned stress and rage inward--with devastating consequences. But life doesn't have to be this way. In \\"Broken Silence, renowned psychologist Dr. D. Kim Singleton, herself a black woman, shares the inspiring stories of eight African-American women who have healed themselves by opening their hearts and minds in therapy. Dr. Singleton traces the psychology of today's black women back to the days of slavery, when female slaves suffered abuse in silence--or died. Over the centuries, black women have learned to survive by adopting strategies like \\"keep your business to yourself\\" or \\"take your problems to the Lord,\\" with the result that giving voice to their pain is often the hardest part of the process. For Amy, breaking the silence meant facing up to the sexual abuse she suffered from her father for years. For Ava, it meant admitting that she depended, emotionally and financially, on a husband who tried to kill her. For Kate, it meant acknowledging a pattern of surrendering her identity and self-esteem to the men whose love she wanted. For all of these women, and hundreds of others Dr. Singleton has helped over the years, entering therapy took courage they didn't know they had. But it has literally saved their lives. The stories gathered here read like novels about remarkable women struggling to overcome a legacy of suffering, loneliness, and deep humiliation. But \\"Broken Silence also provides clear advice and guidance that will helpall women deal with their most difficult life issues. Whether it's keeping a journal, turning to the Bible for solace and insight, or adopting new strategies for coping with the pressures of the work place, there are many practical ways to confront stress and build hope. Women, especially black women, need to know that they are not alone in their experience of abuse, failed relationships, and career disappointment. They need to see that personal change is possible, and that lasting change can come from breaking the silence in therapy. \\"Broken Silence is the book that will start the healing process and give women the power and clarity to live happy, effective lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=23WOPQAACAAJ&dq=Broken+Silence:+Opening+Your+Heart+and+Mind+to+Therapy--A+Black+Woman%27s+Recovery+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Stand at Stalingrad: The Battle That Saved the World","description":"Grades 6-8.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4dBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Last+Stand+at+Stalingrad:+The+Battle+That+Saved+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Triple Crown's Rail Compatible Trailers (Intermodal Transport Modeler)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hot Lesbian Erotica","description":"Tristan Taormino, the biggest name in lesbian erotica, picks 22 tales of lesbian desire of searing heat.

Just the mention of their names evokes the powerful chemistry between these screen couples, which utterly transcended the often formulaic films in which they appeared together. Indeed, watching the synergistic flow of energy between charismatic screen partners is one of the great pleasures of cinema and television, as well as an important vehicle for thinking through issues of intimacy and gender relations. In this book, Martha P. Nochimson engages in a groundbreaking study of screen couple chemistry. She begins by classifying various types of couples to define what sets the synergistic couple apart from other onscreen pairings. Then she moves into extended discussions of four enduring screen couples Maureen O'Sullivan/Johnny Weissmuller, Myrna Loy/William Powell, Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers, and Katharine Hepburn/Spencer Tracy. Using theories of neuroscience, she demonstrates that their onscreen chemistry is a very real phenomenon, powerful enough to subvert conventional formulations of male/female relations. Material she has uncovered in the infamous Production Code Administration files illuminates the historical context of her contentions. Finally, Nochimson traces the screen couple to its present-day incarnation in such pairs as Woody Allen/Diane Keaton, Scully/Mulder of The X-Files, and Cliff/Claire Huxtable of The Cosby Show.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hy1MAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual de practica que acompana Entrevistas: Primera Parte","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MAGIC OF DOUBLEWEAVE","description":"Loom-controlled doubleweave is explored in depth in this handbook of out-of-print articles from textile innovators Weaver's and Prairie Wool Companion.

Whereas Western society was once held together by the Christian Church, it is now held together by the rational procedures dictated by modern capitalism. But the rules of capitalism, whether ultimately helpful or harmful to our society s development, are not values or spiritual principles. Instead, they are simply technical dicta about the most efficient means to an economic end. One visible aspect of the process of secularization is the weakening, and perhaps eventual withering away, of traditional religious institutions. This process is already fully visible in Western Europe, and is evident, on a more subterranean level, in American society as well. Secularization threatens to  disenchant  the world (Max Weber), to cut us off from the sense of the sacred and of Mystery. But the withering of the old religious institutions does not mean that religion and spirituality themselves will simply disappear. Rather, they can take on new forms, as is evident in the New Age movement in American society. Yet, there is a difficulty with New Age sorts of spiritualities when compared with the old-time religion: these new spiritualities tend to be very individualistic, if not idiosyncratic. Sociologists point out that our spiritual practices will never appear fully real to us unless they have inter-subjective validity, unless they are supported by a social  plausibility structure  (Peter Berger). That is, my view of the world has the aura of reality as long as most of the people around me acknowledge that view and reinforce it. But individualistic New Age pieties seem to have no such social reinforcement underpinning them. Hence the central argument of To Re-Enchant the World: the Unitarian Universalist community accomplishes the unique task of re-enchanting the world by bringing a host of individual spiritualities into a single community where all of them are affirmed and thus granted social plausibility. The U.U. community, then, is a particularly powerful site for the re-enchantment of the world: it puts us back in touch with the sacred and with what the book labels the Mysterious Depth of reality. While Unitarian Universalists can bring many different spiritual ways into the U.U. community, five are analyzed in depth in the book, namely, humanism, a focus on nature, engagement with the arts, commitment to social justice, and devotion to a Source/Creative Abyss of the universe. The book also considers rituals common to the U.U. community and the experience of sacred space, sacred time, and sacred word in that community. Finally, To Re-Enchant the World makes some predictions about the future of Unitarian Universalism and even touches on the delicate issue of U.U. proselytizing. The book as a whole attempts to present a philosophical analysis of Unitarian Universalism that draws upon the most important intellectual currents in contemporary Western culture. The book operates with the conviction that while other American religious denominations can have their  systematic theologies,  there is no reason why Unitarian Universalists cannot have philosophies of U.U. pluralism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ypNq8ckI6kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crucifixion of Hyacinth: Jews, Christians, and Homosexuals from Classical Greece to Late Antiquity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hero's Journal (The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"River of Our Return","description":"Named a Notable Fiction Book of 2013 by The Washington Post  An engrossing adventure, with mystery, romance, humor, and impeccable historical detail.

On the contrary, the women workers of Harvard University created a powerful and unique union--one that emphasizes their own values and priorities as working women and rejects unwanted aspects of traditional unionism. The workers involved comprise Harvard's 3,600-member \\"support staff,\\" which includes secretaries, library and laboratory assistants, dental hygienists, accounting clerks, and a myriad of other office workers who keep a great university functioning. Even at prestigious private universities like Harvard and Yale, these workers--mostly women--have had to put up with exploitive management policies that denied them respect and decent wages because they were women. But the women eventually rebelled, declaring that they could not live on \\"prestige\\" alone. Encouraged by the women's movement of the early 1970's, a group of women workers (and a few men) began what would become a 15-year struggle to organize staff employees at Harvard. The women persisted in the face of patronizing and sexist attitudes of university administrators and leaders of their own national unions. Unconscionably long legal delays foiled their efforts. But they developed innovative organizing methods, which merged feminist values with demands for union representation and a means of influencing workplace decisions. Out of adversity came an unorthodox form of unionism embodied in the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW). Its founding was marked by an absorbing human drama that pitted unknown workers, such as Kris Rondeau, a lab assistant who came to head the union, against famous educators such as Harvard President Derek Bok and a panoply of prestigious deans. Other characters caught up in the drama included Harvard's John T. Dunlop, the nation's foremost industrial relations scholar and former U.S. Secretary of Labor. The drama was played out in innumerable hearings before the National Labor Relations Board, in the streets of Cambridge, and on the walks of historic Harvard Yard, where union members marched and sang and employed new tactics like \\"ballooning,\\" designed to communicate a message of joy and liberation rather than the traditional \\"hate-the-boss\\" hostility. John Hoerr tells this story from the perspective of both Harvard administrators and union organizers. With unusual access to its meetings, leaders, and files, he examines the unique culture of a female-led union from the inside. Photographs add to the impact of this dramatic narrative. Author note: John Hoerr, a freelance writer, has been a journalist for more than thirty years at newspapers, magazines, public television, and United Press International. A specialist in labor reportage, he is the author of And the Wolf Finally Came: The Decline of the American Steel Industry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOOlzMPtgAQC&dq=We+Can%27t+Eat+Prestige:+The+Women+Who+Organized+Harvard+(Labor+And+Social+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"United States copper cents, 1816-1857","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TabxngEACAAJ&dq=United+States+copper+cents,+1816-1857&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guinea Pigs for Beginners","description":"Guinea pigs are sweet-tempered, expressive, and cheerful pets.

A novel aspect is that symmetry is given its rightful prominence as an integral part of this foundation. The book offers not only a conceptual understanding of symmetry, but also the mathematical tools necessary for quantitative analysis. As such, it provides a valuable precursor to more focused, advanced books on special relativity or quantum mechanics. Students are introduced to several topics not typically covered until much later in their education.These include space-time diagrams, the action principle, a proof of Noether's theorem, Lorentz vectors and tensors, symmetry breaking and general relativity. The book also provides extensive descriptions on topics of current general interest such as gravitational waves, cosmology, Bell's theorem, entanglement and quantum computing. Throughout the text, every opportunity is taken to emphasize the intimate connection between physics, symmetry and mathematics.The style remains light despite the rigorous and intensive content. The book is intended as a stand-alone or supplementary physics text for a one or two semester course for students who have completed an introductory calculus course and a first-year physics course that includes Newtonian mechanics and some electrostatics. Basic knowledge of linear algebra is useful but not essential, as all requisite mathematical background is provided either in the body of the text or in the Appendices.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW AND THE ECONOMIST Winner of the Natan Book Award, the National Jewish Book Award, and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award An authoritative and deeply personal narrative history of the State of Israel, by one of the most influential journalists writing about the Middle East today Not since Thomas L. Friedman s groundbreaking From Beirut to Jerusalem has a book captured the essence and the beating heart of the Middle East as keenly and dynamically as My Promised Land. Facing unprecedented internal and external pressures, Israel today is at a moment of existential crisis. Ari Shavit draws on interviews, historical documents, private diaries, and letters, as well as his own family s story, illuminating the pivotal moments of the Zionist century to tell a riveting narrative that is larger than the sum of its parts: both personal and national, both deeply human and of profound historical dimension. We meet Shavit s great-grandfather, a British Zionist who in 1897 visited the Holy Land on a Thomas Cook tour and understood that it was the way of the future for his people; the idealist young farmer who bought land from his Arab neighbor in the 1920s to grow the Jaffa oranges that would create Palestine s booming economy; the visionary youth group leader who, in the 1940s, transformed Masada from the neglected ruins of an extremist sect into a powerful symbol for Zionism; the Palestinian who as a young man in 1948 was driven with his family from his home during the expulsion from Lydda; the immigrant orphans of Europe s Holocaust, who took on menial work and focused on raising their children to become the leaders of the new state; the pragmatic engineer who was instrumental in developing Israel s nuclear program in the 1960s, in the only interview he ever gave; the zealous religious Zionists who started the settler movement in the 1970s; the dot-com entrepreneurs and young men and women behind Tel-Aviv s booming club scene; and today s architects of Israel s foreign policy with Iran, whose nuclear threat looms ominously over the tiny country. As it examines the complexities and contradictions of the Israeli condition, My Promised Land asks difficult but important questions: Why did Israel come to be? How did it come to be? Can Israel survive? Culminating with an analysis of the issues and threats that Israel is currently facing, My Promised Land uses the defining events of the past to shed new light on the present. The result is a landmark portrait of a small, vibrant country living on the edge, whose identity and presence play a crucial role in today s global political landscape. Praise for My Promised Land  This book will sweep you up in its narrative force and not let go of you until it is done.

Thousands of pastors, students, and laypeople have found The Interlinear Bible to be a time-saving tool for researching the subtle nuances and layers of meaning within the original biblical languages. Featuring the complete Hebrew and Greek texts with a direct English rendering below each word, it also includes The Literal Translation of the Bible in the outside column. But what truly sets this resource apart are the Strong's numbers printed directly above the Hebrew and Greek words. Strong's numbers enable even those with no prior knowledge of Greek or Hebrew to easily access a wealth of language reference works keyed to Strong's-Greek/Hebrew dictionaries, analytical lexicons, concordances, word studies, and more. The Hebrew is based on the Masoretic Text and the Greek is from the Textus Receptus. The sources of the texts are documented in the preface, and are essentially the same (with some minor variations) to the Hebrew and Greek texts used by the KJV translators. Only a small minority of Bible students ever achieve the ability to read the original biblical languages. This resource offers a non-threatening tool for those lacking language training to begin exploring the languages of Scripture. [ Conveniently includes the entire Hebrew and Greek text of the Bible in one place [ Offering a concise, literal translation of each Greek and Hebrew word, it's a great jumping off point for in-depth Bible study and text analysis. This Bible displays all the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek words of the Bible in the Masoretic Hebrew Text and the Received Greek Text, with literal, accurate English meanings placed directly under each original word in interlinear form, with Strong's Concordance numbers over each original word, enabling the Bible student (whether knowing the original languages or not) to refer to all lexicons and concordances that have also been coded with Strong's numbers. 2,936 pages, bound in a bonded leather over boards hardback edition. This new edition has been much improved by a new typesetting of the New Testament (Volume IV), with larger print, the left marginal column containing a newly revised Literal Translation of the Bible (2000), and a right marginal column containing the Authorized/King James Version (1769). The three volume Old Testament is an exact reprint of the 1985 Hendrickson Publishers Edition. The Old Testament does not yet have the 1769 King James Version. The only complete Interlinear Bible is now fully keyed to Strong's Concordance numbers. The Strong's numbering above each Hebrew and Greek word - along with the Interlinear text and marginal literal English Translation and the 1769 Authorized King James Version - opens a treasure house of Bible study possibilities for those who wish to understand the Scripture better. It's use will allow the novice student to read the original text without losing valuable time to look up the meaning of the Hebrew & Greek words in the Hebrew & Greek lexicons. There is no substitute for a first hand knowledge of the original text. However since only a small minority of Bible students retain an easy reading comprehension of the original text, the Interlinear Bible is a welcome aid to Bible students, laymen, and pastors who wish to continue working with the original languages. Jay P. Green, Sr. (1918-2008) is Translator and Editor of The Interlinear Hebrew-Greek-English Bible and the translator of the Modern King James Version of the Holy Bible, The Teenage Version of the Holy Bible, and the Literal translation of the Holy Bible.

This tightly argued, historically grounded study sets out to demonstrate that a \\"pro-choice\\" stance, now held by a significant minority of Catholics, is as fully justified by Catholic thought as an anti-abortion view, and may even be more compatible with Catholic tradition than the current opposition to abortion espoused by many Catholics and most Catholic leaders. A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion argues that the current Catholic anti-abortion stance is justified neither by modern embryology nor by ancient church teachings. Combining up-to-date information on fetal development with a thorough grasp of the works of the church's early thinkers, Daniel A. Dombrowski and Robert Deltete expose crucial contradictions between the early and the modern church's views of abortion. Returning to the writings of two pillars of early Christian thought, Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, the authors show that abortion was originally condemned by the church on the grounds of perversity, since it nullified the only permissible reason for sexual relations: procreation. Only in more recent times has the view arisen of abortion as indefensible on the ontological grounds that human personhood begins at the moment of conception. The authors demonstrate that the early church's view of fetal development -- delayed hominization, in which the fetus is endowed with a human soul only when it achieves a physical human body -- is diametrically opposed to the current anti-abortion stance. In fact, the authors show, the insistence on immediate hominization that provides thefoundation for the current \\"pro-life\\" view stems from two seventeenth-century scientific misconceptions -- preformationism and the homunculus -- that have since been thoroughly discredited. By considering the history of Catholic thought in its relation to the history of science, Dombrowski and Deltete bring a new level of detail and focus to the abortion debate. Their thoughtful, measured argument provides a fresh perspective that will benefit participants on all sides of the controversy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=73HIS-jaU4YC&dq=A+Brief,+Liberal,+Catholic+Defense+of+Abortion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coaching Football's Midline Option","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wq4GAAAACAAJ&dq=Coaching+Football%27s+Midline+Option&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","description":"The purpose of this book is to illustrate to students both the techniques used in advanced analysis of physical systems and the reasons why these techniques work.

Udall","description":"Everybody liked Mo. Throughout his political life  and especially during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976  thousands of people were drawn to Arizona congressman Morris K. Udall by his humor, humanity, and courage. This biography traces the remarkable career of the candidate who was \\"too funny to be president\\" and introduces readers to Mo the politician, Mo the environmentalist, and Mo the man. Journalists Donald Carson and James Johnson interviewed more than one hundred of Udall's associates and family members to create an unusually rich portrait. They recall Udall's Mormon boyhood in Arizona when he lost an eye at age six, his service during World War II, his brief career in professional basketball, and his work as a lawyer and county prosecutor, which earned him a reputation for fairness and openness. Mo provides the most complete record of Udall's thirty-year congressional career ever published. It reveals how he challenged the House seniority system and turned the House Interior Committee into a powerful panel that did as much to protect the environment as any organization in the twentieth century. It shows Udall to have been a consensus builder for environmental issues who paved the way for the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, helped set aside 2.4 million acres of wilderness in Arizona, and fought for the Central Arizona Project, one of the most ambitious water projects in U.S. history. Carson and Johnson record Udall's early opposition to the Vietnam War at a time when that conflict was largely perceived as a just cause, as well as his early advocacy of campaign finance reform. They also provide a behind-the-scenes account of his run for the presidency the first House member to seek the office in nearly a century which gained him an intensely loyal national following. Mo explores the paradoxes that beset Udall: He was a man able to accomplish things politically because people genuinely liked and respected him, yet he was a loner and workaholic whose focus on politics overshadowed his personal life. Carson and Johnson devote a chapter to the famous Udall sense of humor. They also look sensitively at his role as a husband and father and at his proud and stubborn bout with Parkinson's disease. Mo Udall will long be remembered for his contributions to environmental legislation, for his unflagging efforts in behalf of Arizona, and for the gentle humor with which he conducted his life. This book secures his legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T4h0CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Catcher","description":"The daughter of J.D.

The storm essentially split the island in half and swept much of it away, including its inhabitants, wealthy vacationers, and its resort hotel. There were few survivors. Lafcadio Hearn used these basic historical facts to create Chita. Originally published in 1889, this long out-of-print novella is a minor masterpiece that is by turns mysterious, mesmerizing, and tragic. In the aftermath of the storm, a Spanish fisherman wades into the Gulf to pick through debris. Among the bodies, he finds one that is yet alive, a young Creole girl. Her parents are presumed to have died in the storm. Raised by the fisherman's family, Chita grows into a strong, independent young woman. Her story is counterpointed by that of her lost father, a doctor who thinks that his daughter is dead and, as a result, devotes himself to helping others in need. When he comes to Last Island to help stem a yellow fever epidemic, he encounters Chita. The consequences are devastating. This beautifully lush, ornately styled tale of south Louisiana in the nineteenth century is a haunting novel that is both impressionistic in its evocation of nature and realistic in its characterizations and depictions of life in this region. Jefferson Humphries' introduction puts Chita in perspective, gives an overview of critical reactions to the novel from its initial publication to the present, and provides a capsule biography of Hearn and a commentary on the stylistic influences on his work. Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904) was a writer, critic, amateur engraver, and journalist. He wrote extensively about the cultures of Louisiana and is considered the first major Western chronicler of Japanese culture. His many books include La Cuisine Creole: A Collection of Culinary Recipes (1885), Gombo Zhebes (1885), Chita (1889), and Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan (1894). Delia LaBarre is an independent scholar of Lafcadio Hearn and Louisiana culture. She lives in Baton Rouge. Jefferson Humphries is chair of French studies at Louisiana State University and the author of The Puritan and the Cynic: The Literary Moralist in America and France.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8kr1nQEACAAJ&dq=Chita:+A+Memory+of+Last+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A World of Secrets: The Uses and Limits of Intelligence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"OMC Stern Drive, 1964-1986 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Postmodernism and the Enlightenment: New Perspectives in Eighteenth-Century French Intellectual History","description":"First Published in 2001.

Published to resounding acclaim from such critics as Alain Locke and Montgomery Gregory, There Is Confusion was largely forgotten by the 1930s as the Great Depression and the Second World War shifted national attention away from the writers and artists whose vision defined the Harlem Renaissance. Rediscovered by scholars in the late twentieth century, There Is Confusion is seen as a feminist masterpiece on par with the best of Jane Austen and Edith Wharton. Set in Philadelphia and Harlem, Fauset s novel traces the lives of three African Americans from childhood to adulthood while situating their experience in the cultural shifts of the early twentieth century. Joanna Marshall is a dancer who longs for recognition. Maggie Ellersley is a beautiful girl who detests her working-class roots. Peter Bye is an ambitious student who hopes to become a surgeon. As they grow up together, their shared dreams are tarnished by romance and competition. As economic opportunity reshapes the African American community, the three friends must redefine their relationships and desires. Moving and plainspoken, There Is Confusion is a novel grounded in history that manages a delicate balance between the personal and the political without losing sight of the characters who live Fauset s vision. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Jessie Redmon Fauset s There Is Confusion is a classic of African American literature reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aW8vEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Library Information Systems: From Library Automation to Distributed Information Access Solutions","description":"Presents librarians with information on understanding and using the newest library system technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eYZBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Library+Information+Systems:+From+Library+Automation+to+Distributed+Information+Access+Solutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orwell (Life & Times Series)","description":"Winner of the Whitbread Biography Award: A  profoundly moving [and] definitive  portrait of George Orwell, author of 1984 and larger-than-life literary genius (The Daily Telegraph). It was not easy to bury George Orwell. After a lifetime of iconoclasm, during which he professed no interest in religion and no affiliation with any church, he asked to be buried in an Anglican churchyard but none would have him. Orwell s friends fought for him to have a proper grave, however, and the author of 1984, Animal Farm, and Homage to Catalonia, among other brilliant works of prose, poetry, and journalism, was laid to rest in a quiet country cemetery. Almost immediately, his legacy was in dispute. Orwell did not want any biographies written of him, but that has not stopped scholars from trying. Of all those published since the author s death in 1950, D. J. Taylor s prize-winning book is considered the most definitive. Born in India, Orwell spent his forty-six years of life traveling the British Empire and confronting the world head on. From the trenches of Spain to the top of bestseller lists, Taylor presents Orwell fully as a writer, social critic, and human being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7lLVCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fixed Period (The World's Classics)","description":"This eBook features the unabridged text of  The Fixed Period  from the bestselling edition of  The Complete Works of Anthony Trollope .

Now recognized as an unparalleled poet of the natural world, Mary Oliver writes with unmatched dexterity and a profound appreciation for the divergence and convergence of all living things. Mary Oliver is always searching for the soul of things. In poem after poem, her investigations go from the humble green bean that nourishes her and makes her wonder if \\"something/-I can't name it-watches as I walk the/rows, accepting the gift of their lives/to assist mine\\" to the vast, untouchable bliss of \\"things you can't reach./But you can reach out to them, and all day long./The wind, the bird flying away./The idea of God.\\" Oliver's search grows and is informed by experience, meditation, perception, and discernment. And all the while, during her quest, she is constantly surprised and fortified by joy. This graceful volume, designed to be paired with New and Selected Poems, Volume One, includes new poems on birds, toads, flowers, insects, bodies of water, and the extraordinary experience of the everyday in our lives. In the words of Alicia Ostriker,'Mary Oliver moves by instinct, faith, and determination. She is among our finest poets, and still growing.' In both the older and new poems, Mary Oliver is a poet at the height of her control of image and language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CErFfdNS8hEC&dq=New+and+Selected+Poems:+v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lie With Me","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Heavyweight Champions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=67c9AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Heavyweight+Champions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","description":"Examines how and why the A-12 acquisition program fell from a place of honor to one of derision and scandal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ZDfAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+%245+Billion+Misunderstanding:+The+Collapse+of+the+Navy%27s+A-12+Stealth+Bomber+Program&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quotable Hogan (Potent Quotables)","description":"Ben Hogan continues to be one of the most admired and contemplated figures in the golf world, even though he passed away in 1997 and played his last competitive round of golf 30 years ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wg0DAAAACAAJ&dq=Quotable+Hogan+(Potent+Quotables)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LoveSmart: Transforming the Emotional Patterns That Sabotage Relationships","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j-GUOGHqsMIC&dq=LoveSmart:+Transforming+the+Emotional+Patterns+That+Sabotage+Relationships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith Works","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GDOnx9ZN58AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailing Small: Inspiration and Instruction for the Pocket Cruiser","description":"Proving that one does not need to be wealthy to enjoy a lifetime of fulfillment aboard a cruising sailboat, this collection contains anecdotes from eight experienced sailors who have voyaged safely and comfortably aboard boats ranging from 16?-foot centerboard gaff cutters to ocean-going 22-foot cutters.

However, at elevated levels, all trace elements become potentially toxic. Anthropogenic input of trace elements into the natural environment therefore poses a range of ecological and health problems. As a result of their persistence and potential toxicity, trace elements continue to receive widespread scientific and legislative attention. Trace Elements in Soils reviews the latest research in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the chemistry, analysis, fate and regulation of trace elements in soils, as well as remediation strategies for contaminated soil. The book is divided into four sections: ? Basic principles, processes, sampling and analytical aspects: presents an overview including general soil chemistry, soil sampling, analysis, fractionation and speciation. ? Long-term issues, impacts and predictive modelling: reviews major sources of metal inputs, the impact on soil ecology, trace element deficient soils and chemical speciation modelling. ? Bioavailability, risk assessment and remediation: discusses bioavailability, regulatory limits and cleanup technology for contaminated soils including phytoremediation and trace element immobilization. ?

In the world of her fiction, nothing can be taken for granted, and there is no such thing as the run of the mill: here, a retired grocer takes up jewel theft in his twilight years; a data processor squanders her inheritance on a gown from Princess Diana's collection; a mugging victim, newly separated from his wife, feigns amnesia to win back her love; a teenage pyromaniac finds release in the company of her mother's jilted second husband. In the tradition of Lorrie Moore, the stories in this collection celebrate the absence of normalcy, the quirkiness of the human condition, the everyday deviance of \\"ordinary\\" people. In story after story, Perabo peels back the layers of the banal and the bizarre, revealing a world that is at once stunning and familiar, shocking yet comforting. Through her slightly off-center lens, she provides a fresh and penetrating look at human nature, giving us a glimpse of the extraordinary in the ordinary, the magic in the smallest of gestures. Her resilient characters are a testament to the undying potential for optimism that gives people a fighting chance despite the twisted, sad world around them.

Almost uniquely, his work bridged the divides between aesthetic and socio-economic inquiry, between Marxist thought and mainstream liberal thought, and between the modern and post-modern world. When The Long Revolution first appeared in 1961, much of the acclaim it received was based on its prescriptions for Britain in the  60s, which form a relatively brief final section of the whole. The body of the book has since come to be recognized as one of the foundation documents in the cultural analysis of English-speaking culture. The  long revolution  of the title is a cultural revolution, which Williams sees as having unfolded alongside the democratic revolution and the industrial revolution. With this book, Williams led the way in recognizing the importance of the growth of the popular press, the growth of standard English, and the growth the reading public in English-speaking culture and in Western culture as a whole. In addition, Williams s discussion of how culture is to be defined and analyzed has been of considerable importance in the development of cultural studies as an independent discipline.

Indeed, for the last fifty years, most popular and scholarly works have agreed that prehistoric warfare was rare, harmless, unimportant, and, like smallpox, a disease of civilized societies alone. Prehistoric warfare, according to this view, was little more than a ritualized game, where casualties were limited and the effects of aggression relatively mild. Lawrence Keeley's groundbreaking War Before Civilization offers a devastating rebuttal to such comfortable myths and debunks the notion that warfare was introduced to primitive societies through contact with civilization (an idea he denounces as \\"the pacification of the past\\"). Building on much fascinating archeological and historical research and offering an astute comparison of warfare in civilized and prehistoric societies, from modern European states to the Plains Indians of North America, War Before Civilization convincingly demonstrates that prehistoric warfare was in fact more deadly, more frequent, and more ruthless than modern war. To support this point, Keeley provides a wide-ranging look at warfare and brutality in the prehistoric world. He reveals, for instance, that prehistorical tactics favoring raids and ambushes, as opposed to formal battles, often yielded a high death-rate; that adult males falling into the hands of their enemies were almost universally killed; and that surprise raids seldom spared even women and children. Keeley cites evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world, including the discovery in South Dakota of a prehistoric mass grave containing the remains of over 500 scalped and mutilated men, women, and children (a slaughter that took place a century and a half before the arrival of Columbus). In addition, Keeley surveys the prevalence of looting, destruction, and trophy-taking in all kinds of warfare and again finds little moral distinction between ancient warriors and civilized armies. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he examines the evidence of cannibalism among some preliterate peoples. Keeley is a seasoned writer and his book is packed with vivid, eye-opening details (for instance, that the homicide rate of prehistoric Illinois villagers may have exceeded that of the modern United States by some 70 times). But he also goes beyond grisly facts to address the larger moral and philosophical issues raised by his work. What are the causes of war? Are human beings inherently violent? How can we ensure peace in our own time? Challenging some of our most dearly held beliefs, Keeley's conclusions are bound to stir controversy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KbAvbxse5wcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobody's Business","description":"Argues that criminalization of certain activities has a negative effect on society, denies constitutional rights, and misunderstands religious teachings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nsQvU_nxIX4C&dq=Nobody%27s+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Verses and translations (Red letter library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Education of a Typographer","description":"Exploring the methods for teaching and learning typography, this book features more than 40 essays from top experts and educators in typography today.

Until 1979 the Soviet Union's official composer was considered a staunch supporter of Joseph Stalin and his successors. This assumption was then challenged with the publication of Testimony, ostensibly the composer's memoirs as told to Solomon Volkov, in which Shostakovich emerged as a dissident. Serious reservations persist to this day about the integrity and validity of Testimony, but Volkov did reveal a \\"new\\" Shostakovich. Now, in the first important biographical work on Shostakovich to take Testimony into account, Ian MacDonald dispels some of the mystery surrounding the composer and his music. Declaring that Volkov painted \\"a realistic picture of Dmitri Shostakovich: it just isn't a genuine one,\\" MacDonald describes the ways in which the Soviet government used Shostakovich and other artists for propaganda purposes and examines the only authentic record of Shostakovich's personal and political beliefs that the composer left behind: his music. MacDonald argues that attempts to grasp the compositions of Shostakovich as pure music are doomed to failure because the composer's art can be understood only within the political-cultural framework of his time. Soviet institutions controlled artistic endeavors during Shostakovich's life, and he fought back through his compositions. Examining Shostakovich's music, MacDonald finds a sarcastic subterranean mind adopting ironic strategies designed to evade censorship. By looking anew at the life of Dmitri Shostakovich--and the nature of life in the pre-Gorbachev era--Ian MacDonald provides fresh insights into some of the greatest music of this century [Publisher description].","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=orEOAQAAMAAJ&dq=New+Shostakovich&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La musica popular en Cuba (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sports Racing Cars: Expert Analysis of Fifty Motor Racing Greats","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F80PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Sports+Racing+Cars:+Expert+Analysis+of+Fifty+Motor+Racing+Greats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jeopardy!

Indeed, like the tank, the transport aircraft was closely associated with the Blitzkrieg concept. This relationship was advantageous at the outset of the war, but it became dangerous as the war dragged on and German armies outran their surface supply lines in North Africa and Russia. Then ground commanders began to think of air transport as the means of supply. The history of this trend is one of the main themes of this study, which was first published in its English translation in 1961. Some of the questions embodied in this theme How much air transport is enough? Under what conditions is an air-supply operation feasible? What are the prerequisites for a successful airlift to encircled ground forces? What are the advantages and limitations of the glider? are as vital and controversial today as they were during World War II. Generalmajor a. D. Fritz Morzik, who began his military career as a non-commissioned officer in the German Air Service in World War I and ended it as Armed Forces Chief of Air Transport in World War II, is especially well-qualified to write the present study. His long career, spanning two world wars, and his experience with both civilian and military transport aircraft testify to the breadth of his practical knowledge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pg0qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biology (Monarch college outlines)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LUM5PwAACAAJ&dq=Biology+(Monarch+college+outlines)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night before Christmas - In Texas, That Is","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"By Their Blood Christian Martyrs of the 20th Century","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Calabash Cat","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ordnance Survey guide to smugglers' Britain","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gospel Time Bomb","description":"Cults, sects, and mass therapies abound in every part of the United States. Adherents to these extremist groups come from every geographic section, socio-economic stratum, ethnic and age group. \\"It is not the Moonies or the Hare Krishmas that we should fear,\\" writes Lowell D. Streiker, America's leading expert on cults. \\"The fastest growing and most dangerous religious movement in America today is ultrafundamentalism - an extremist form of evangelical religion that shuns reason, forbids needed medical treatment, abuses women and children, and eagerly awaits the end of the world. The cults of the seventies were alien and exotic. These sects are as American as the Fourth of July.\\" The Gospel Time Bomb explores the dangers of ultrafundamentalist cults by presenting selected case histories, by explaining the significance of the central tendencies of ultrafundamentalism, and by suggesting why such groups are flourishing at this particular time in this particular society. The author carefully defines the nature of religious experience, conversion, revivalism, pentecostalism, sheperding, and deliverance. He relates how many of the dynamics found in ultrafundamentalism are at work in such secular phenomena as Amway, real estate sales, and prostitution. The Gospel Time Bomb assesses the so-called evangelical upsurge and Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. In addition, Dr. Streiker offers his predictions of the future as well as his suggestions for defusing the destructive potential of the extremeists, for moderating the fanaticism of these new sects, and for responding to them humanely and effectively.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0YPYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Gospel+Time+Bomb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Cookery in the Middle Ages","description":"No description available.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i5h7_HXPHvwC&dq=The+Art+of+Cookery+in+the+Middle+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Guide to TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0","description":"This comprehensive text has been approved by Microsoft to prepare individuals for the Internetworking Microsoft TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 certification exam, part of the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer program (exam # 70-059).

Recently widowed, with only enough money to pay her passage, she was also pregnant. Of the three men in uniform who meet her at the landing, she is immediately drawn to Penn Warfield, the eldest of five brothers and the keeper in charge of the station. It was Penn who had placed the advertisement seeking a bride for his younger brother Adam. Only Adam has other ideas. Penn intends to send Hannah back on the next boat. Determined to stay, Hannah makes herself useful at the station. She cooks, cleans, and tends the injured better than any of the brothers can, despite continual clashes with Penn and his no-women-allowed rulebook. When Hannah goes into premature labor, it is Penn who delivers her baby, with the help of a veterinary manual. Little Sara Mirella Ballinger has all five Warfield brothers for her godfathers. She will need their protection and her mother will need a husband if they are going to escape the man who is searching for Hannah to lay claim to her baby. THE WARFIELD BRIDE won a Maggie Award as best historical romance of the year in 1994. Bronwyn Williams is the shared pen name of two sisters, Dixie Burrus Browning and Mary Burrus Williams, who are sixth-generation natives of Hatteras Island.

The epitome of sophistication and taste, they have graced the feet of royalty, supermodels, and movie stars. In these breathtaking pictures by Blahnik's longtime friend, photographer Eric Boman, the shoes take center stage in a dazzling array of intriguing and often lighthearted scenes and settings. A white leather stiletto plays an incriminating role in a suggested crime worthy of Hitchcock. A pale green mule nestles among ferns in homage to Blahnik's recurring botanical themes. The straps of a sandal echo the strands of spaghetti in which it lays entwined. Boman's unerring eye and oddly keen understanding of Blahnik's creations make for spellbinding pictures, full of wit, playfulness, and sole. Elegant allusions to Blahnik's eclectic influences abound from the cinema to history, from the natural world to art and literature. As covetable as a pair of Manolos, this is a book of consummate creativity, addictive power, and unrivaled individuality: a cult object on a cult designer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PZm-wAEACAAJ&dq=Blahnik+By+Boman:+Shoes,+Photographs,+Conversation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The living faith;: Selected sermons of Lloyd C.

He writes in detail about all the major figures including some that I'd never heard of that got bumped off the Nazi train along the way. He even had a one on one interviews with Hitler in November 1941 that is riveting in its analysis of Hitler. The details of Hitler's visit to Napoleon's tomb, personal meetings with Goering and Bormann, the treatment of Jews and Catholics, the runup to the invasion of Russia are all fascinating.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yUQktAEACAAJ&dq=The+foe+we+face,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The manhood of the Master","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0MNZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Guild (Novel of the West Ser.)","description":"In his early forties, Richard Wheeler had never given a thought to writing fiction. By his early seventies, he had written sixty novels. And these were being published while he was climbing the masts of a sinking ship. This late-in-life novelist didn t tackle high literature, but the sweaty world of genre fiction, where the publishers  advances barely paid the rent. He wrote western fiction, and when that genre began to ship water, he leapt over to historical novels, and finally biographical novels, where he found himself in an odd literary corner, without competition. This is a memoir of literary struggle, of agents and editors, of jackets and publicity and book tours. This is also a story about the astonishing help he received along the way from friends, best-selling novelists, agents, editors, and publishers. Writing may be a lonely profession, but Wheeler discovered that the world of genre fiction writers is populated with caring and wise colleagues. Here, Wheeler evokes his early struggles, which somehow prepared him for a life as a successful novelist. He discusses shattered dreams and sudden joys. And running through his narrative is his passion to write about the West in new ways. RICHARD S. WHEELER is the author of sixty novels of the West, the winner of five Spur Awards, and the recipient of the Owen Wister Award for lifetime achievement in the literature of the American West. Many of his novels are now in trade paperback editions from Sunstone Press.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sJzmxlbZ64MC&dq=Guild+(Novel+of+the+West+Ser.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiss and Tell","description":"\\"Kiss & Tell is a total rush!

He and his band Kiss & Tell are on their first major tour of North America, playing arenas all over the United States and Canada (and getting covered by the gossipy press all over North America as well). Hunter is the only gay member of the band, and he just had a very painful breakup with his first boyfriend--leaked sexts, public heartbreak, and all--and now everyone expects him to play the perfect queer role model for teens. But Hunter isn't really sure what being the perfect queer kid even means. Does it mean dressing up in whatever The Label tells him to wear for photo shoots and pretending never to have sex? (Unfortunately, yes.) Does it mean finding community among the queer kids at the meet-and-greets after K&T's shows? (Fortunately, yes.) Does it include a new relationship with Kaivan, the drummer for the band opening for K&T on tour? (He hopes so.) But when The Label finds out about Hunter and Kaivan, it spells trouble for their relationship, for the perfect gay boy Hunter plays for the cameras, and, most importantly, for Hunter himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L240EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","description":"Text and pictures show scenes and steps from the ballets \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" \\"Giselle,\\" \\"Coppelia,\\" \\"Swan Lake,\\" and \\"The Nutcracker,\\" while the enclosed CD includes the stories told scene-by-scene.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lcIyAAAACAAJ&dq=DK+Read&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Refining Common Sense: Moving from Data to Information","description":"Designed to help educators collect and use data more effectively, this guide enables the reader to develop three tools to use in decision-making. 1.)

These professions, more than any others, are said to drive a wedge between facts and values, faith and knowledge, the sacred and the secular. However, a growing number of observers are calling attention to a religious resurgence--journalists are covering religion more frequently and religious scholars in academia are increasingly visible.John Schmalzbauer provides a compelling investigation of the role of Catholic and evangelical Protestant beliefs in the newsroom and the classroom. His interviews with forty prominent journalists and academics reveal how some people of faith seek to preserve their religious identities in purportedly secular professions. What impact, he asks, does their Christianity have on their jobs? What is the place of personal religious conviction in professional life? Individuals featured include the journalists Fred Barnes, Cokie Roberts, Peter Steinfels, Cal Thomas, and Kenneth Woodward, and the scholars John DiIulio, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Andrew Greeley, George Marsden, and Mark Noll.Some of the journalists and academics with whom Schmalzbauer spoke qualified displays of personal religious belief with reminders of their own professional credibility, drawing a line between advocacy and objectivity. Schmalzbauer highlights the persistent tensions between the worlds of public endeavor and private belief, yet he maintains there is room for faith even in professional environments that have tended to prize empiricism and detachment over expressions of personal conviction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-ULk8WvTkyoC&dq=America%27s+Best+Christian+Colleges+1999&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Academy Awards: a Pictorial History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","description":"The insights presented in the volume are many and wide-ranging, recognizably in tune with the subtlest modern discussions of desire (such as triangulation. or loving what others love), yet offering new solutions to old problems, like the proper interpretation of Plato's Phaedrus.

A little over a decade later, John Howard Griffin famously \\"became\\" black as well, traveling the American South in search of a certain kind of racial understanding. Contemporary history is littered with the surprisingly complex stories of white people passing as black, and here Alisha Gaines constructs a unique genealogy of \\"empathetic racial impersonation--white liberals walking in the fantasy of black skin under the alibi of cross-racial empathy. At the end of their experiments in \\"blackness,\\" Gaines argues, these debatably well-meaning white impersonators arrived at little more than false consciousness. Complicating the histories of black-to-white passing and blackface minstrelsy, Gaines uses an interdisciplinary approach rooted in literary studies, race theory, and cultural studies to reveal these sometimes maddening, and often absurd, experiments of racial impersonation. By examining this history of modern racial impersonation, Gaines shows that there was, and still is, a faulty cultural logic that places enormous faith in the idea that empathy is all that white Americans need to make a significant difference in how to racially navigate our society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h7aFDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground","description":"As a rule, countries consider clearly defined international borders to be paramount for their survival and prosperity. Most borders gain definition peacefully and, once they do, these definitions stick (i.e., the border remains settled). The failure to define borders, however, produces protracted, geopolitical, militarized competitions (or rivalries) between neighboring countries. Rider and Owsiak model this failure as a particular type of bargaining problem - namely, bargaining over territory that affects the distribution of power between neighbouring states significantly - that undermines efforts to resolve border disagreements peacefully. Countries must then overcome this bargaining problem or risk falling into a protracted rivalry, which then needs to be addressed with more resources. The authors develop a theory of how borders settle. They then explore the consequences of the failure to settle, theoretically connecting it to the onset of rivalries. This leads to the process that helps rivals overcome the bargaining problem, resolve their border disagreement, and terminate their rivalry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7QEbEAAAQBAJ&dq=On+Dangerous+Ground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitts & Mrs.","description":"\\"Success in dealing with unknown ciphers is measured by these four things in the order named: perseverance, careful methods of analysis, intuition, luck.\\" So begins the first chapter of Colonel Parker Hitt's 1916 Manual for the Solution of Military Ciphers, a foundational text in the history of cryptology. An irrepressible innovator, Hitt possessed those qualities in abundance. His manual, cipher devices, and proactive mentorship of Army cryptology during World War I laid the groundwork for the modern American cryptologic system. Though he considered himself an infantryman, Hitt is best known as the \\"father of American military cryptology.\\" In Parker Hitt: The Father of American Military Cryptology, Betsy Rohaly Smoot brings Hitt's legacy to life, chronicling his upbringing, multiple careers, ingenious mind, and independent spirit. In the 1910s, after a decade as an infantry officer, Hitt set his sights on aviation. Instead, he was drawn to the applied sciences, designing signal and machine-gun equipment while applying math to combat problems. Atypical for the time, Hitt championed women in the workplace. During World War I he suggested the Army employ American female telephone operators, while his wife, Genevieve Young Hitt, became the first woman to break ciphers for the United States government. His daughter, Mary Lue Hitt, carried on the family legacy as a \\"code girl\\" during World War II. Readers of Elizabeth Cobb's The Hello Girls, Liza Mundy's Code Girls, and David Kahn's The Codebreakers will find in Parker Hitt's story an insightful profile of an American cryptologic hero and the early twentieth-century military. Drawing from a never-before-seen cache of Hitt's letters, photographs, and diaries, Smoot introduces readers to Hitt's life on the front lines, in classrooms and workshops, and at home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8N0uEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jeb Stuart","description":"Mary L.

Based on extensive excavations of archives and texts, this challenging passage through twelve essays presents a history of the literature and examines its debt to, and synthesis with, oral cultures. George Elliott Clarke identifies African-Canadian literature's distinguishing characteristics, argues for its relevance to both African Diasporic Black and Canadian Studies, and critiques several of its key creators and texts. Scholarly and sophisticated, the survey cites and interprets the works of several major African-Canadian writers, including Andr  Alexis, Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke, Claire Harris, and M. Nourbese Philip. In so doing, Clarke demonstrates that African-Canadian writers and critics explore the tensions that exist between notions of universalism and black nationalism, liberalism and conservatism. These tensions are revealed in the literature in what Clarke argues to be  paradoxically  uniquely Canadian and proudly apart from a mainstream national identity. Clarke has unearthed vital but previously unconsidered authors, and charted the relationship between African-Canadian literature and that of Africa, African America, and the Caribbean. In addition to the essays, Clarke has assembled a seminal and expansive bibliography of texts  literature and criticism  from both English and French Canada.

Fontenot finds strong ties between rural Louisiana practices and Haitian and West African medicine. The ethnographer, a native of the region where she did her research, is respected among local practicing secret doctors and is able to give a unique insider's view. Aside from documenting a rare treasure of our American cultural diversity, this study has a wider purpose in the field of health practices and policy. The high cost of Western medicine, lack of access to quality care, and the patient-doctor ratio are areas of major national concern, and rural residents and people of color are recognized to be the most at-risk populations. The alternative health-care system presented here can strengthen mainstream medicine's understanding of such patient populations while preserving valuable knowledge of healing plants and culturally sensitive therapies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gd1xSHpXIowC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amazing Graces: Prayers and Poems for Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors","description":"Here, Robert M.

During the late 1950s, Thornley became friends with Lee Harvey Oswald when the two served together in the Marines, and was actually writing a novel based on Oswald three years before John F. Kennedy's assassination. These connections would later cause New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to suspect that Thornley was one of the notorious Oswald doubles and a part of a JFK assassination plot. Initially, Thornley denied these allegations, but later came to believe that he'd been used as an unwitting pawn in the conspiracy.

To qualify, a principle must be so overwhelmingly powerful that anyone can reliably use it towards extraordinary results. Is there any principle that can tell you how to do that consistently and with a high chance of success? Working with venture capitalist Greg Lockwood, his co-author on SUPERCONNECT, and supported by research from the elite firm of OC&C Strategy Consultants, Koch has the answer. The principle Koch and Lockwood have discovered behind extraordinarily successful businesses is simplifying. Some simplify on price - take Ryanair's budget flights which still take you from A to B, but so cheaply that nearly everyone can afford them, multiplying the size of their market - and some simplify on proposition, such as Apple's decision to cut down on the number of their product lines and focus on perfecting only a few devices. With case studies of famous companies in all different industries from finance to fast food, the authors show how anyone can analyse their business's potential to become a simplifier, and which route they should take to maximise the impact.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MJKDCgAAQBAJ&dq=Simplify&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Don't Need Plastic Surgery: The Doctor's Guide to Youthful Looks with No Surgery, No Pain, No Downtime","description":"Provides advice on maintaining a youthful appearance without plastic surgery to smooth wrinkled skin, remove unwanted hair, eliminate acne scars, replace thinning hair, and brighten smiles,","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3qNblRJSbikC&dq=You+Don%27t+Need+Plastic+Surgery:+The+Doctor%27s+Guide+to+Youthful+Looks+with+No+Surgery,+No+Pain,+No+Downtime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COPPER CAMP","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bonsai Techniques for Satsuki","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer (Proposed)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me: A Play","description":"There was once an Englishman, an Irishman and an American - locked up together in a cell in the Middle East.

Despite performing both roles with equal success the Israeli reliance on the Mirage III and Nesher delta fighters meant that the F-4 was used most regularly in its air-to-ground role. The kill total of the Israeli F-4 community was, consequently, a modest 116.5; significantly lower than that of other Israeli aircraft types in service between 1969 and 1982. A handful of aces were, nevertheless, created and, using first hand accounts, this unique book tells their stories. Many F-4 pilots had previously flown the Mirage III but most of the navigators were either inexperienced flying school graduates or had been transferred from transport aircraft. The decision to create such teams may have appeared an odd one and it certainly led to a number of interesting experiences but proved, ultimately, to be so successful that by 2010 the Israeli air force will have more two-seat combat aircraft than single-seat fighters. The F-4 experience was, therefore, crucial to moulding the future of the Israeli air force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4liICwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John C.

The phenomenon and mystery of three similar but different Synoptic Gospels has for centuries challenged some of the best minds of academia and the church. How can we explain the differences and similarities among Matthew, Mark and Luke? Which Gospel was written first? To what extent did the Evangelists depend on oral tradition, written sources or each other? John Wenham courageously opposes the reigning two-document theory-that Mark was the first Gospel, with Matthew and Luke independently using Mark and a lost source of sayings of Jesus labeled Q. Through careful argument and analysis, he seeks to defend an alternative theory that satisfactorily accounts for what he argues is some degree of structural dependence but nevertheless a surprising degree of verbal independence among the Synoptics. This brave new revisioning of the writing of the Synoptics redates Matthew, Mark and Luke prior to A.D. 55. Insightful and provocative, Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke offers a fresh look at a hard problem as well as an interesting perspective on the inner workings of the early church. It is a book to be reckoned with and sure to stir up scholarly controversy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qin4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Being Well","description":"The Science of Being Great is from the author Wallace D.

On the fiftieth anniversary of King s assassination, the man and his activism are as close to public consciousness as ever. But despite his stature, the significance of King s writings and political thought remains underappreciated. In To Shape a New World, Tommie Shelby and Brandon Terry write that the marginalization of King s ideas reflects a romantic, consensus history that renders the civil rights movement inherently conservative an effort not at radical reform but at  living up to  enduring ideals laid down by the nation s founders. On this view, King marshaled lofty rhetoric to help redeem the ideas of universal (white) heroes, but produced little original thought. This failure to engage deeply and honestly with King s writings allows him to be conscripted into political projects he would not endorse, including the pernicious form of  color blindness  that insists, amid glaring race-based injustice, that racism has been overcome. Cornel West, Danielle Allen, Martha Nussbaum, Robert Gooding-Williams, and other authors join Shelby and Terry in careful, critical engagement with King s understudied writings on labor and welfare rights, voting rights, racism, civil disobedience, nonviolence, economic inequality, poverty, love, just-war theory, virtue ethics, political theology, imperialism, nationalism, reparations, and social justice. In King s exciting and learned work, the authors find an array of compelling challenges to some of the most pressing political dilemmas of our present, and rethink the legacy of this towering figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sYRKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stand on Zanzibar - Masterpieces of Science Fiction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ugly Truckling","description":"Teased by her brothers and sisters for being so different, an ugly truckling fears that she will never be a good truck, and sets out into the world to discover what she might be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J-5CKIfyudwC&dq=The+Ugly+Truckling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter","description":"Celebrated for his brilliantly quirky insights into the physical world, Nobel laureate Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the general public.

In nine chapters, these paintings, sculptures, lithographs, sketches, photographs, and press clippings are given context within the moral framework of an era when prostitution was considered an unavoidable or enticing evil, powerfully evoking the ambivalent place held by prostitutes in the midst of nascent modernity, from the splendours of the demimondaines to the miseries of the working-girl pierreuses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tFxOEAAAQBAJ&dq=SPLENDOURS+AND+MISERIES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valley of the Dry Bones","description":"\\" 'The Valley of the Dry Bones: The Conditions That Face Black People in America,' by Rudolphf R. Windsor, is a fascinating compilation of history, anthropology, sociology, and theology. In clear, limpid prose, Windsor tells the history of the black people, from biblical times until today. Drawing extensively upon the Bible and many works by eminent scholars in various disciplines, the author has created a work that is at once inspiring and intriguing. He seeks to prove that the black people, more properly called 'Black Israelites,' are truly God's chosen people and, as such, should become more aware of their unique heritage. 'The Valley of the Dry Bones' represents a first step in this admirable endeavor. In the latter half of the book, Windsor moves from biblical times to present. Not only does he delineate the problems blacks face, but he also offers some solutions. Together with the lucid text are illustrations that are both timely and relevant. Windsor, in addition to knowing his history, has a wealth of common sense that he shares with his readers. No dusty volume of willingly forgotten data, 'The Valley of the Dry Bones' is a controversial and daring volume. That rare work of scholarship, a book that makes the lessons of history pertinent to the modern reader, 'The Valley of the Dry Bones' offers its readers a glimpse into a field of research that indeed merits a great deal of attention and careful thought.\\" -- back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iNYkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Valley+of+the+Dry+Bones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Practical Encyclopedia of Good Decorating and Home Improvement Complete 18 Volume Set","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hj4hAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taking Liberty","description":"When I was four and my daddy left, I cried, but I understood.

She is referred to as a servant, and a house servant at that -- a position of influence and respect. When she rises to the position of personal servant to Martha Washington, her status among the household staff -- black or white -- is second to none. She is Lady Washington's closest confidante and for all intents and purposes, a member of the family -- or so she thinks. Slowly, Oney's perception of her life with the Washingtons begins to crack as she realizes the truth: No matter what it's called, it's still slavery and she's still a slave. Oney must make a choice.

Generations of women have grown up with messages about sex that make them feel dirty, used, or invisible, while men have been sold such a cheapened version of sex, they don't know what they're missing. The Great Sex Rescue hopes to turn all of that around, developing a truly biblical view of sex where mutuality, intimacy, and passion reign. The Great Sex Rescue pulls back the curtain on what is happening in Christian bedrooms and exposes the problematic teachings that wreck sex for so many couples--and the good teachings that leave others breathless. In the #metoo and #churchtoo era, not only is this book a long overdue corrective to church culture, it is poised to free thousands of couples from repressive and dissatisfying sex lives so that they can experience the kind of intimacy and wholeness God intended.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x2caEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","description":"Since the publication of the first edition over 50 years ago, Introduction to Solid State Physics has been the standard solid state physics text for physics students.

The industrial synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen has been of greater fundamental importance to the modern world than the invention of the airplane, nuclear energy, space flight, or television. The expansion of the world's population from 1.6 billion people in 1900 to today's six billion would not have been possible without the synthesis of ammonia. In Enriching the Earth, Vaclav Smil begins with a discussion of nitrogen's unique status in the biosphere, its role in crop production, and traditional means of supplying the nutrient. He then looks at various attempts to expand natural nitrogen flows through mineral and synthetic fertilizers. The core of the book is a detailed narrative of the discovery of ammonia synthesis by Fritz Haber a discovery scientists had sought for over one hundred years and its commercialization by Carl Bosch and the chemical company BASF. Smil also examines the emergence of the large-scale nitrogen fertilizer industry and analyzes the extent of global dependence on the Haber-Bosch process and its biospheric consequences. Finally, it looks at the role of nitrogen in civilization and, in a sad coda, describes the lives of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch after the discovery of ammonia synthesis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&dq=Enriching+the+Earth:+Fritz+Haber,+Carl+Bosch,+and+the+Transformation+of+World+Food+Production&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Same Homework, New Plan: How to Help Your Kid Sit Down And Get It Done","description":"\\"Presents tips and techniques to help parents teach their children ages 7-15 to manage homework better in the short term and become more organized, independent learners in the long term.

The author s interest has expanded into other fields that challenge and question the limits of our everyday horizons, namely, into operas, plays, and humor, as well as into new approaches to the meaning of human existence explored by modern thinkers. These various fields often interact, explain, and enrich each other. The book aims for deepening the awareness of our ultimate human concerns, the meaning of authenticity, and the urgent need for radical, long-term commitments. The present volume focuses almost entirely on the role of folklore in expanding and enriching a person s horizons, on the challenges by modern writers in terms of the need to radically alter the paradigm of Western society that has brought the blessings of technology, led to a fragmentation of our psyche, and threatens the very essence of our subjectivity. Throughout the book there is both the hidden and the overt implication that simply liking, appreciating or agreeing with insightful ideas and suggestions presented by anyone are absolutely worthless, or may even be counterproductive, if the readers do not translate into changes and actions the ideas that are most meaningful to them, and if they do not do so in their family, social, political and spiritual life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=17ZECQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silva Method Ultra CD/DVD Set (3 CD's and 1 DVD)","description":"Shows how to unlock the incredible powers of your own mind and use them to connect to a higher power to obtain the guidance you need to be successful, happy, and fulfilled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CtMOAAAACAAJ&dq=Silva+Method+Ultra+CD/DVD+Set+(3+CD%27s+and+1+DVD)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muskets of the Revolution and the French & Indian Wars","description":"In 1758, at the height of the French and Indian War, British Brigadier General John Forbes led his army on a methodical advance against Fort Duquesene, French headquarters in the Ohio valley. As his army closed in upon the fort, he sent Major Grant of the 77th Highlanders and 850 men on a reconnaissance in force against the fort. The French, alerted to this move, launched their own counter-raid. 500 French and Canadians, backed by 500 Indian allies, ambushed the highlanders and sent them fleeing back to the main army. With the success of that operation, the French planed their own raid against the English encampment at Fort Ligonier under less than fifty miles away. With only 600 men, against an enemy strength of 4,000, he ordered a daring night attack on the heart of the enemy encampment. This book tells the complete story of these ambitious raids and counter-raids, giving in-depth detail on the forces, terrain, and tactics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VXOICwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edwardian Christmas","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rough Guide Map Argentina","description":"The Rough Guide to Argentina is the definitive guide to this staggeringly diverse country.

Four main campaigns were undertaken to decorate the chapel between 1481 and 1541, and with each new addition, fundamental themes found increasingly concrete expression. One overarching theme plays a central role in the chapel: the legitimization of papal authority, as symbolized by two keys one silver, one gold to the kingdom of heaven. The Sistine Chapel: Paradise in Rome is a concise, informative account of the Sistine Chapel. In unpacking this complex history, Ulrich Pfisterer reveals the remarkable unity of the images in relation to theology, politics, and the intentions of the artists themselves, who included such household names as Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Through a study of the main campaigns to adorn the Sistine Chapel, Pfisterer argues that the art transformed the chapel into a pathway to the kingdom of God, legitimizing the absolute authority of the popes. First published in German, the prose comes to life in English in the deft hands of translator David Dollenmayer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CnFlDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Sistine+Chapel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","description":"Turn the anger in your marriage into a positive force.

What drives the fear of turning 30, the boom in anti-aging products, the wars between generations? What men and women of all ages have in common is that we are being insidiously aged by the culture in which we live. In this illuminating book, Margaret Morganroth Gullette reveals that aging doesn't start in our chromosomes, but in midlife downsizing, the erosion of workplace seniority, threats to Social Security, or media portrayals of \\"aging Xers\\" and \\"greedy\\" Baby Boomers. To combat the forces aging us prematurely, Gullette invites us to change our attitudes, our life storytelling, and our society. Part intimate autobiography, part startling cultural expose, this book does for age what gender and race studies have done for their categories. Aged by Culture is an impassioned manifesto against the pernicious ideologies that steal hope from every stage of our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qh_3UhFfM9kC&dq=Aged+by+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Saint: From Big Screen to Small Screen and back Again","description":"Published to tie-in with the release of the film of the same name, this book is a look at the film version of The Saint as well as the original TV series its individual episodes, the actors, guest stars and the music.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xZ1vNwAACAAJ&dq=The+Saint:+From+Big+Screen+to+Small+Screen+and+back+Again&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","description":"The private correspondence and diaries of the Romanovs, obtained from the Russian State Archive, offer an intimate look at the romance of the tsar and tsarina and the most significant events of the early 1900s. 50,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8_noIeduTs0C&dq=Nicholas+and+Alexandra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lo!","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bQydi8TssT8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A shepherd's life","description":"Reproduction of the original: A Shepherd's Life by William Henry Hudson","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PMTxDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+shepherd%27s+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deceit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Luv","description":"Colleen Barrett began her career as an executive secretary, yet Southwest Airlines' founder chose her to succeed him as president.

At that time the war was rapidly escalating: the United States hoped for a quick resolution of the conflict through massive amounts of American firepower and troop strength. Steinbrook was no ideologue; like so many of his compatriots, he saw Vietnam service as a job to be done, efficiently and quickly, and then home again as soon and as safely as possible. What elevates Steinbrook s account into a special category was his assignment as an artillery forward observer with Australian and New Zealand allied troops. In the American national debate and hand-wringing over the Vietnam War, an often forgotten component of the war is the service of several allied contingents Koreans, Australians, New Zealanders, Filipinos. The experience of these forces who often participated in heavy fighting has not been well reported or studied, not even in the countries that provided the troops. Accounts of the attitudes of these troops toward the war, and toward their ostensible Vietnamese and American allies, are a major contribution of Steinbrook s book. The author has created the account of his experience through a skillful blend of memories and letters home; the result is an engaging and unpretentious depiction of what the war was like for an ordinary young man who saw exceptional service in America s most troubling war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tjFOnGRPSw4C&dq=Allies+and+Mates:+An+American+Soldier+with+the+Australians+and+New+Zealanders+in+Vietnam,+1966-67&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","description":"A pioneering work on early childhood development that is as relevant today as when it was first published 60 years ago.

This comprehensive introduction to economic growth presents the main facts and puzzles about growth, proposes simple methods and models needed to explain these facts, acquaints the reader with the most recent theoretical and empirical developments, and provides tools with which to analyze policy design. The treatment of growth theory is fully accessible to students with a background no more advanced than elementary calculus and probability theory; the reader need not master all the subtleties of dynamic programming and stochastic processes to learn what is essential about such issues as cross-country convergence, the effects of financial development on growth, and the consequences of globalization. The book, which grew out of courses taught by the authors at Harvard and Brown universities, can be used both by advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and as a reference for professional economists in government or international financial organizations. The Economics of Growth first presents the main growth paradigms: the neoclassical model, the AK model, Romer's product variety model, and the Schumpeterian model. The text then builds on the main paradigms to shed light on the dynamic process of growth and development, discussing such topics as club convergence, directed technical change, the transition from Malthusian stagnation to sustained growth, general purpose technologies, and the recent debate over institutions versus human capital as the primary factor in cross-country income differences. Finally, the book focuses on growth policies analyzing the effects of liberalizing market competition and entry, education policy, trade liberalization, environmental and resource constraints, and stabilization policy and the methodology of growth policy design. All chapters include literature reviews and problem sets. An appendix covers basic concepts of econometrics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B9vxCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Matter of Trust:: Connecting Teachers and Learners in the Early Childhood Classroom (Early Childhood Education)","description":"The authors draw on their experiences as a developmental psychologist and as a teacher educator to provide ways for teachers to create positive child-teacher relationships and classroom climates.

This psychological condition, which affects men and women equally, is much more than just our difficulty in standing up for our rights. It is a complex and mysterious aspect of our psyche, concealed beneath our feelings of being helpless, overwhelmed, and indecisive.Inner passivity contributes to feelings of being defective or unworthy, and it is a factor in hundreds of symptoms, including anxiety, fear, anger, addictions, compulsions, and depression.Inner passivity is often experienced as a sense of inertia or as a lack of foresight or vision. It hides out behind the problem and the pain of being indecisive, yet it can also be a factor in hasty decisions. One of its primary emotional symptoms is the feeling of being overwhelmed, while one of its common behavioral symptoms is procrastination.We can experience inner passivity as the sense of having no power, as the feeling of being stuck or unable to move forward in our life, and as an inability to make something happen. It is present in the feeling that we're always playing catch-up or running late, in the impression that life is a losing battle, or in our worrying and emotional preoccupations concerning the uncertainty of life.Inner passivity also is the culprit in our failure to create a vision or a plan for our success, and it can also be an enemy that snatches defeat from the jaws of victory. Generally, we can say of inner passivity that we allow it to dictate and degrade our everyday experiences.We gain a distinct advantage when we identify inner passivity as a psychological condition or as a stage of our personal development. Once we identify it in this clinical sense, we're able to step back from the limiting, self-defeating symptoms it produces, thereby establishing some conscious separation from our symptoms. Otherwise the symptoms of inner passivity (low self-esteem, for instance) feel so much like our essence, as if they represent who we are or who we think we are. Without separation from our symptoms, the symptoms can define us in our own mind and thereby limit us.Free of inner passivity, we connect with our creativity, self-expression, and capacity for intimacy. We clear the way for the fulfillment of our courage, integrity, compassion, and love--and for reunion with our self.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEWMtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Phantom+of+the+Psyche:+Freeing+Ourself+from+Inner+Passivity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quotable Wooden (Potent Quotables)","description":"John Wooden was arguably the greatest college basketball coach of all time, a teacher as well as mentor whose handiwork produced a dynasty bridging the '60s and '70s.

The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym is an archetypal American story of escape from home and family which traces a young man's rite of passage through a series of terrible brushes with death during a fateful sea voyage. But it also goes much deeper, as Pym encounters various interpretative dilemmas, at last leaving the reader with a broken-off ending that defies solution. Apart from its violence and mystery, the tale calls attention to the act of writing and to the problem of representing truth. Layer upon layer of elaborate hoaxes include its author's own role of posing as ghost-writer of the narrative; Pym - his only novel - has become the key text for our understanding of Poe. This edition offers eight short tales which are linked to Pym by their treatment of persistent themes - fantastic voyages, gigantic whirlpools, and premature burials - or by their ironic commentary on Poe's mystification of his readers. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

With his latest entry, It's A Wrap!, Laszlo takes readers behind the scenes on a variety of projects he himself was involved in, to illustrate how unforeseen events can impact even the most carefully planned production.From a secret trip to Havana with Ed Sullivan during the Cuban Revolution, to near disasters involving The Beatles, Ossie Davis and Richard Chamberlain, It's A Wrap! gives an insider's view of the filmmaking process and sheds light on the inherent dangers of the industry. Through straight-forward commentary and insightful deconstruction of these events, Laszlo invites his readers into the world of filmmaking as it has never been discussed before. To do so, he strips away \\"the glamour and the dirt\\" to reveal the lives of cast and crew on location, the long and arduous days, the pressures, the constant demands of unforeseen problems, the personalities, the egos, the politics and more.Focusing on the action behind the scenes, Laszlo hopes to mine new territory and open the door for those with a genuine interest in the filmmaking process. \\"The memories of certain events associated with films I shot are so vivid still in my memory that I often talk about them,\\" says Laszlo. \\"And whenever I do, I sense the interest of my listeners. In fact, during my lecture series for Kodak, I often tell 'War Stories,' which are generally the most popular portions of my lecturers. Compiling a few of these stories in greater detail, I hope will be appealing to readers with an interest in filmmaking, or just movies in general.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SBjGAAAACAAJ&dq=It%27s+a+Wrap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek for Preachers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g7wtq3Df-sYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urban Transit - Operations, Planning, and Economics","description":"The only modern text to cover all aspects of urban transit operations, planning, and economics Global in scope, up-to-date with current practice, and written by an internationally renowned expert, Urban Transit: Operations, Planning, and Economics is a unique volume covering the full range of issues involved in the operation, planning, and financing of transit systems.

He argues that this cataclysm resulted from a change in the Earth s axis consequent upon a comet impact around 3100 BC The Middle-Neolithic period around 5,000 years ago was a time of dramatic climate and sea level changes all around the world. Welsh legends remember lost cities beneath the Irish Sea; and Irish myths recall an  otherworld , a golden age when the eastern Irish Sea was a flowery plain inhabited by a golden-haired race of men. The author argues that Plato s Atlantis is the same place that is remembered in these Celtic myths; and in Ancient Egyptian and Greek myths of an underworld known as the Elysian Fields. Bringing together modern scientific evidence and a pattern of ancient myths the author presents a multidisciplinary case for Atlantis as just one among many views of the submerged Neolithic civilisation of the Megalith Builders.

With graceful authority, Tomas Marco, award-winning composer, critic, and bright light of Spanish music since the 1960s, covers the entire spectrum of composers and their works: trends and movements, critical and popular reception, national institutions, influences from Europe and beyond, and the effect of such historic events as the Spanish Civil War and the death of Franco. Marco's penetrating aesthetic critiques are threaded throughout each phase of this rich account. Marco provides detailed coverage of the key figures, induding a chapter devoted entirely to Manuel de Falla--Spain's most celebrated twentieth-century composer--and a panoramic survey of recent arrivals on the contemporary music scene. Exploring the rise and fall of the zarzuela, the author highlights innovative works in this authentic Spanish genre. He analyzes the attempts to find an audience for Spanish opera; demonstrates the flowering of symphonic and chamber music at the beginning of this century; traces currents such as romanticism, impressionism, and neoclassicism; and tracks the influence of Spain's distinctive regional folk traditions. Covering musical innovation after Spain's emergence from its period of isolation, Marco notes the speed with which many composers absorbed the work of Stravinsky and Bartok, the twelve-tone system, aleatory forms, electronic techniques, and other European developments. English-speaking scholars, musicians, critics and general readers have for decades been without full information on the rich and varied work coming out of Spain in this century. This lively history fills a long-felt need and fills it superbly, with the knowledge and insights of a major figure in the musical world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5OypJWh20lUC&dq=Spanish+Music+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra and Famous Impossibilities (Universitext)","description":"The famous problems of squaring the circle, doubling the cube and trisecting an angle captured the imagination of both professional and amateur mathematicians for over two thousand years. Despite the enormous effort and ingenious attempts by these men and women, the problems would not yield to purely geometrical methods. It was only the development. of abstract algebra in the nineteenth century which enabled mathematicians to arrive at the surprising conclusion that these constructions are not possible. In this book we develop enough abstract algebra to prove that these constructions are impossible. Our approach introduces all the relevant concepts about fields in a way which is more concrete than usual and which avoids the use of quotient structures (and even of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials). Having the geometrical questions as a specific goal provides motivation for the introduction of the algebraic concepts and we have found that students respond very favourably. We have used this text to teach second-year students at La Trobe University over a period of many years, each time refining the material in the light of student performance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RhjnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pipits and Wagtails.","description":"Wagtails are noted for their bold plumage patterns and extensive racial variation.

Snyder helped the horse overcome its deficiencies, eventually naming her in part after his deceased wife, Lisa, the great and only love of his life a bright and sweet-tempered woman whose gentle demeanor seemed eerily reflected in the horse. The trainer (and now owner) was by nature a crusty and combative sort, the yin to his wife's yang, a racetrack lifer not easily moved by new-age mysticism or sentiment. And yet in those final days back in 2003, when Lisa Snyder lay in bed, her body ravaged by cancer, she reassured her family with a weak smile. \\"It's okay,\\" she'd say. \\"I'll see you again. I'm coming back as a horse.\\" Tim Snyder did not then believe in reincarnation. But he acknowledged the strangeness of this journey, the series of coincidences that brought them together, and the undeniable similarities between the horse and his late wife. And so did those who knew the couple well, and who could now only marvel at the story of the filly, Lisa's Booby Trap, and the down-on-his-luck trainer who apparently had been given a new lease on life. The Ghost Horse is a powerful horseracing story of underdogs and second chances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nlA_8C7aNQkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las hijas de sultana (Debolsillo, 275/2) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, 1-2 Cylinders, 1973-89 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals)","description":"SELOC Marine maintenance and repair manuals offer the most comprehensive, authoritative information available for outboard, inboard, stern-drive and diesel engines, as well as personal watercraft.

In his lifetime, Kipling was widely regarded as the unofficial Poet Laureate, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. His poetry is striking for its many rhythms and popular forms of speech, and Kipling was equally at home with dramatic monologues and extended ballads. He is often thought of as glorifying war, militarism, and the British Empire, but an attentive reading of the poems does not confirm that view.

In the first book, the main character, Wiley O'Mara, rescued six boys trapped in an ancient city submerged beneath the ocean. Now he and the other boys return to The City of the Golden Sun. Once there, Wiley takes a backseat to Keegan, the son of King Reginauld, and to the magnificence of the ancient city itself. The fictional city is based on extensive research into ancient Greece and Rome, theories about a possible Atlantis, and Ireland. The City of the Golden Sun includes elements of all these places, and much more.REVIEWSRebecca Brown, Founder of RebeccasReads.comOne of the endearing aspects of The City of the Golden Sun is how the boys see Wiley's world & learn how to adjust to it.Another grand adventure from Marilyn Peake that will keep young readers glued to the pages.

The writing is absorbing and the characters are easy to relate to. There are more adventures to follow, and I am eager to read what happens next. With praise coming from the master of fantasy, Piers Anthony, you know that Marilyn Peake is an author to watch.Sharon Schulz-Elsing for \\"Curled Up With a Good Book\\"Building on the message of The Fisherman's Son to \\"drink deeply,\\" The City of the Golden Sun reminds readers young and old to live life to its fullest, to recognize the glory of our time on Earth, to bring beauty forth wherever we find ourselves planted. This book has the feel of a middle book, and is indeed the bridge between The Fisherman's Son and the final book in the Wiley O'Mara trilogy. How Wiley and the boys from the City will deal with what they learn under the waves is something Marilyn Peake's readers - for now - will only be able to anticipate.Cheryl McCann, Review-Books.comThe City of the Golden Sun is beautifully written and paints the picture with words and the imagination takes over. It is sure to delight young readers over and over with its rich adventure tale. I highly recommend it. Look for the next book in the sequel.Beverly J.

As an exception to decoupling, where member states considered that there was a risk of distur??bance to agricultural markets or abandonment of production as a result of the move to the SPS, they had the option to maintain a proportion of direct aids in some sectors in their existing form. This was notably the case for the suckler cow and/or ewe and goat premiums. This special report presents the results of the audit of these premiums by the Court, which aimed to determine to what extent the suckler cow and ewe and goat direct aids were targeted to the most relevant regions in member states and effective in maintaining production and thus avoiding negative social, economic and environmental effects. -- P.

This violence erupted at the exact moment when the cold war confrontation was drawing to a close, when westerners were claiming their liberal values as triumphant, in a country that had only a few years earlier been seen as very well placed to join the west. In trying to account for this outburst, most western journalists, academics, and policymakers have resorted to the language of the premodern: tribalism, ethnic hatreds, cultural inadequacy, irrationality; in short, the Balkans as the antithesis of the modern west. Yet one of the most striking aspects of the wars in Yugoslavia is the extent to which the images purveyed in the western press and in much of the academic literature are so at odds with evidence from on the ground.\\" from Chapter 1 V. P. Gagnon Jr. believes that the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s were reactionary moves designed to thwart populations that were threatening the existing structures of political and economic power. He begins with facts at odds with the essentialist view of ethnic identity, such as high intermarriage rates and the very high percentage of draft-resisters. These statistics do not comport comfortably with the notion that these wars were the result of ancient blood hatreds or of nationalist leaders using ethnicity to mobilize people into conflict. Yugoslavia in the late 1980s was, in Gagnon's view, on the verge of large-scale sociopolitical and economic change. He shows that political and economic elites in Belgrade and Zagreb first created and then manipulated violent conflict along ethnic lines as a way to short-circuit the dynamics of political change. This strategy of violence was thus a means for these threatened elites to demobilize the population. Gagnon's noteworthy and rather controversial argument provides us with a substantially new way of understanding the politics of ethnicity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yWmCvMZK25oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Government: Readings and Cases (15th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cronos","description":"In a trio of novels--Letters from Atlantis, Project Pendulum, and The Time Hoppers--the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author explores the possibilites of time travel and the dangers of changing history as travelers set out to unravel the mysteries of Atlantis, journey millions of years into the past and future, and try to correct the problems of the present.

But renewed efforts at cooperation prove that familiarity breeds contempt. Diuturnity s Dawn is the third thrilling novel in The Founding of the Commonwealth, a spectacular space adventure that traces the perilous early years of this remarkable universe. From the beginning, while sharing the Orion Arm of the galaxy, contact between humankind and the thranx has been tenuous at best. Yet nearly a century after first contact, the likelihood of closer human/thranx relations is as far away as ever. Humans still find these insectlike beings physically repulsive, a distaste the thranx return in kind. At times the cordial veneer barely conceals the suspicion and distrust boiling just below the surface. Yet idealists on both sides refuse to surrender their dreams of achieving a thranx/human alliance. Among the most dedicated are a minor diplomat named Fanielle Anjou and her thranx counterpart. Others intend to make sure such a liaison never comes to pass . . . by any means necessary. For these xenophobes, the upcoming Humanx Inter-Cultural Fair, the first wholly cross-species event, is a hideous confirmation of their worst fears. Zealots on both sides vow it will be the last of its kind, no matter how many must die. In the coming conflagration Fanielle holds the key to triumph but only if she can outwit those desperate to silence her forever. Meanwhile, on a faraway planet, the duplicitous AAnn watch intently as archaeologists labor to discover what happened to an advanced human race that perished thousands of years ago. For the answers contain grave consequences for human, thranx, and AAnn alike . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X1ugOZgGavcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seagram Building: Building Blocks Series (Building Block Series)","description":"\\"Time and expedience have taken tolls on the building.

As digital technology fundamentally alters motion pictures, the lessons of Film as Art commend themselves as excellent insurance against reinventing the wheel in the new media landscape and hailing it as progress.  Edward Dimendberg author of Film Noir and the Spaces of Modernity  After more than eight decades, Rudolph Arnheim's small book of film theory remains one of the essential works in defining film art, understanding film less as reproducing the world than as opening up new possibilities for formal play and unexpected imagery. Anyone serious about film, whether scholar, filmmaker or simply a lover of cinema, must take Arnheim seriously.  Tom Gunning, author of The Films of Fritz Lang and D.W. Griffith and the Origins of American Narrative Film  An aesthetic theory based on the formal  limitations  of the medium, Arnheim s Film as Art always provokes students in an age of few limits and less formality, and they argue and engage this classic text with unparalleled passion. Written in the wake of sound s transformation of the cinema, Arnheim s essays are not only central to understanding a major historical moment in theoretical debates about what constitutes the  essence  of film, but also are a must read for anyone seeking a lucid, detailed, and rigorous argument about how works of art emerge from expressive constraint as much as expressive freedom.

Rather than herald a new era of Cuba joining the world community of nations as a paragon of democracy as many fervently hoped and believed it would, it became instead a new stage in authoritarian rule in the Western hemisphere.For more than a half century since then Cuba has been defined by the capacity of a single family to command and determine the fate of a nation?and to do so with a minimum of opposition. Incredibly, even those professing adhesion to democratic norms have been ready to forgive the dictator his excesses. This volume explains the theory and practice of this absence of internal opposition and the persistence of external support for the Castro family and its entourage.The Long Night of Dark Intent is chronological in order, with the author indicating major points in each of the five decades covered. The volume covers five centers of system analysis: economics, politics, society, military, and ideology. Who or what \\"determines\\" events and decisions is the stuff of real history. It is precisely due to variability in causal chains in society that we have huge variance in levels of predictability. The course of the Cuban Revolution gives strong support for such an approach to the Castro Era. This is a unique, unflinching account with a strong emphasis on the importance of U.S. policy decisions over time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lB8xDwAAQBAJ&dq=DARK+INTENT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Extraordinary Silence: The Emergence of a Deeply Disturbed Child","description":"A trained psychologist tells how he abandoned professional techniques to reach a nine-year old boy who had withdrawn since birth into an almost impenetrable cage of silence to protect himself from what the psychologist came to realize was the increasing inability of our society to form deep, focused interpersonal relationships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BpBHAAAAMAAJ&dq=An+Extraordinary+Silence:+The+Emergence+of+a+Deeply+Disturbed+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces of the J.

Matthews of The New York Times","description":"In 1957, Herbert L.Matthews of the New York Times, then considered one of the premiere foreign correspondents of his time, tracked down Fidel Castro in Cuba's Sierra Maestra mountains and returned with what was considered the scoop of the century. His heroic portrayal of Castro, who was then believed dead, had a powerful effect on American perceptions of Cuba, both in and out of the government, and profoundly influenced the fall of the Batista regime. When Castro emerged as a Soviet-backed dictator, Matthews became a scapegoat; his paper turned on him, his career foundered, and he was accused of betraying his country. In this fascinating book, New York Times reporter DePalma investigates the Matthews case to reveal how it contains the story not just of one newspaperman but of an age, not just how Castro came to power but how America determines who its enemies are. He re-creates the atmosphere of revolutionary Cuba and Cold War America, and clarifies the facts of Castro's ascension and political evolution from the many myths that have sprung up around them. Through a dramatic, ironic, in ways tragic story, The Man Who Invented Fidel offers provocative insights into Cuban politics, the Cuban-American relationship, and the many difficult balancing acts of responsible journalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FKqivgEACAAJ&dq=The+Man+Who+Invented+Fidel:+Castro,+Cuba,+and+Herbert+L.+Matthews+of+The+New+York+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China's response to the West: A documentary survey, 1839-1923","description":"Contains primary source material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0maVJuCh78oC&dq=China%27s+response+to+the+West:+A+documentary+survey,+1839-1923&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays in Religion, Politics, and Morality (Selected Writings of Lord Acton, Vol 3) (v. 3)","description":"Perhaps no issue is more divisive among philosophers, jurists and theologians than the nature of human liberty. Liberty is central to the claims of the Christian Gospel, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the American Revolution. But discussions about the nature of freedom have been characterized by profound disagreement and unsettling questions. What does it mean to be free? Is freedom worth more than mens' lives? Why should man be free? What, if any, legitmate responsibilities accompany freedom? These subjects are that the heart of Samuel Gregg's new book On Ordered Liberty. Beginning with the insights of Alexis de Tocqueville and some natural law theorists, Gregg suggests that something which he terms 'integral law' must be distinguished from most contemporary visions of freedom. He argues that this new arrangement requires a complete repudiation of utilitarian ideas on the grounds that they are incompatable with human nature. He also recommends a new and more rigorous focus on the basic but often neglected-question: what is man? On Ordered Liberty goes beyond the liberal and conservative divide, asking its readers to think about the proper ends of human choice and actions in a free society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9fYeAAAAQBAJ&dq=Essays+in+Religion,+Politics,+and+Morality+(Selected+Writings+of+Lord+Acton,+Vol+3)+(v.+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain mechanisms in diachrome;","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Surprise Garden (Molly and Emmett)","description":"While Molly prepares to plant a nice, neat vegetable garden, her cat Emmett does his best to help.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mCQQSa92QIgC&dq=The+Surprise+Garden+(Molly+and+Emmett)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Words That Wound","description":"Written by leading critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, this volume succinctly explores a host of issues presented by hate speech, including legal theories for regulating it, the harms it causes, and policy arguments, pro and con, suppressing it.

When he loses a shipment of top-quality booze to a double-crossing government thief, Frank hunts him down, roughs him up, and finds something that catches his eye. What at first appears to be a scrap of paper is actually a handwritten and unmistakably authentic IOU for $7,000, signed by Babe Ruth. Seven-thousand clams is a lot of money--and when Frank gets a tip that the Yankees are about to begin spring training in St. Petersburg, Florida, he wastes no time leaving New Jersey to track down the Babe. Frank thinks he's covered his bases: Along for the ride is a dangerous and curvy blonde named Ginger DeMore. She s smart, she packs a snub-nose pistol in her purse, and she s the perfect accomplice to help convince the Babe to cough up the dough. It seems like the perfect plan, but Frank and Ginger aren t the only ones seeking their fortunes in Florida. 1920 s St. Pete is a veritable nest of vipers.

Entering the world's most concentrated canal network Gogarty sails into England's past and future. 'The Cut' (the name most commonly used for the canals) is a blueprint of when England was a big island and the inland waterways its motorway. But, after more than a century of neglect, 'The Cut' is now enjoying a second golden age with waterfront cities being regenerated and more inland waterways currently opening in Britain than were being built at the height of Canal Mania 200 years ago. 'The Cut' is a hidden garden flashed with kingfishers and traditional narrowboats; a parallel universe ringing with the laughter of water gypsies, the thin cries of bats and drunken congregations in waterfront pubs. This is a journey across the face of England with all its exultations and darkness; rave boats, glorious sunshine and sheeting rain: canals that have been resurrected and enjoying their new summer and those still abandoned like shameful secrets. The Water Road is a voyage that is poignant, illuminating and hilarious at every turn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EWTTwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Water+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian Course: Part One (Pt. 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Manual of Equine Neonatal Medicine","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Selected Letters of John Keats","description":"This new edition affords readers the pleasure of John Keats' \\"trifles\\" as well as the surprise of his most famous ideas emerging unpredictably.

The last of the Ptolemaic monarchs who had ruled Egypt as Hellenistic Greek kings and Egyptian pharaohs for 300 years, Cleopatra created her own mythology, becoming an icon in her own lifetime and even more so after her death. This book explores the ways in which she was depicted in antiquity, within the context of the iconography of contemporary coinage, statues and other images of Egyptian, Greek and Roman rulers, and then examines the image of Cleopatra from the Renaissance to modern times, as seen in plays, opera, painting, ceramics and even jewellery. Exciting new research has revealed seven Egyptian-style statues believed to represent Cleopatra, and two portraits probably commissioned in Rome while she lived there with Julius Caesar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wL0UAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cleopatra+of+Egypt:+From+History+to+Myth.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anyone's my name,: A novel","description":"An author is suspected of being one of the violent criminals about which he writes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H-m6PQAACAAJ&dq=Anyone%27s+my+name,:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Na Ki\`i Pohaku: A Hawaiian Petroglyph Primer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Atkins Journal: Your Personal Journey Toward a New You, A 120-Day Record","description":"This journal is a valuable ally to help you do Atkins properly--enhancing your potential to manage your weight and improve your overall health!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w0tMQtq7dlUC&dq=The+Atkins+Journal:+Your+Personal+Journey+Toward+a+New+You,+A+120-Day+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarton Selected: An Anthology of the Journals, Novels, and Poetry of May Sarton","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I was a high school drop-in","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oX5LwnPBkuEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom","description":"Discovered in Egypt in 1945 as part of the Nag Hammadi Library, the Gospel of Thomas was long considered irrelevant to the study of Jesus' teachings. Stevan Davies' influential The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom overturned this view, and enabled the Gospel of Thomas to be taken seriously as a source for the earliest Christianity. This Bardic Press edition brings a classic work of accessible scholarshp back into print. A entirely new forty page introduction discusses recent developments in scholarship, looks at Thomas' independence from the New Testament gospels, discusses the role of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel Thomas, and offers a variety of valuable insights. A fascinating additional essay speculates that Thomas may have been used as an oracle text in a similar way to the I Ching.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4pifdYcwcbcC&dq=The+Gospel+of+Thomas+and+Christian+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"View of the dome","description":"This humor filled tale of political corruption, ingratitude and revenge concerns an idealistic young Washington attorney who persuades her former law professor, a man of lofty rhetoric, to run for Congress.

For each material in question, Gordon explains the unique physical and chemical basis for its inherent structural qualities in irrepressibly fresh and simple terms. He also shows how an in-depth understanding of these materials' intrinsic strengths (and weaknesses) guides our engineering choices, allowing us to build the structures that support our modern society.

But often, the outcome of those battles was affected by the heroic acts of spies--both Union and Confederate. Such heroes, unsung while they did their vital work, included those whose true stories are told in the pages of this book: ? Elizabeth Van Lew: Her Richmond, Virginia, neighbors thought her eccentric--or crazy--but her odd behavior covered her activities as a spy for the Union army. ? Belle Boyd: A daring Confederate spy whose charm and beauty were exceeded only by her boldness and resourcefulness in eluding Union's efforts to capture her. ? Serena Freneau: A beautiful spy who seduced secrets from Union officers--even marrying one of them! ? Timothy Webster: A Union spy who dared to infiltrate the South's infamous \\"Knights of Liberty\\" as a double agent. Their exploits, and the other tales in this extraordinary volume, are as thrilling as any spy stories from the past or present--and many of them are true history. The Blue and the Gray Undercover No war is won on the battlefield alone, and the Civil War was no exception. Behind the lines, behind closed doors, in disguise, spies for both the Union and the Confederacy did what spies have always done: seek out information that will help their side get some advantage over the enemy. In the pages of this unique volume some of the most gifted storytellers of our generation write about many different spies. Editor Ed Gorman has brought together never-before-published tales of undercover work during the War Between the States by such bestselling authors as Doug Allyn, John Lutz, Brendan DuBois, Loren D. Estleman, and by other talented writers, including Janet Berliner, James H. Cobb, Bill Crider, Jane Haddam, Edward D. Hoch, Marie Jakober, Jane Lindskold, P. G. Nagle, Gary Phillips, Robert J. Randisi, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Aileen Schumacher, and Ray Vukcevich. In cities and in the wild, north and south of the Mason-Dixon line, in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea--even in Canada--these stories capture the tension and excitement of the high-stakes risks numberless people took to help their side in the terrible war that sundered a nation. Not all the stories are based on fact, but all show people doing the kinds of things that were actually done to win the war with brains instead of bullets. The result is a fascinating look at a little-known part of our Civil War heritage.

InThe Essence of Chaos Edward Lorenz, one of the founding fathers of Chaos and the originator of its seminal concept of the Butterfly Effect, presents his own landscape of our current understanding of the field. Lorenz presents everyday examples of chaotic behaviour, such as the toss of a coin, the pinball's path, the fall of a leaf, and explains in elementary mathematical strms how their essentially chaotic nature can be understood. His principal example involved the construction of a model of a board sliding down a ski slope. Through this model Lorenz illustrates chaotic phenomena and the related concepts of bifurcation and strange attractors. He also provides the context in which chaos can be related to the similarly emergent fields of nonlinearity, complexity and fractals. As an early pioneer of chaos, Lorenz also provides his own story of the human endeavour in developing this new field. He describes his initial encounters with chaos through his study of climate and introduces many of the personalities who contributed early breakthroughs. His seminal paper, \\"Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?\\" is published for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CGm2IEWH894C&dq=The+Essence+of+Chaos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cormorant's Brood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ3XjwEACAAJ&dq=Cormorant%27s+Brood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knitting Heartland : Children's Handknitting Collection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6v-5AAAACAAJ&dq=Knitting+Heartland+:+Children%27s+Handknitting+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Observation Guide - Working With Young Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Money Magnetism : How To Attract What You Need When You Need It","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hedonist's Guide To Milan 1st Edition (A Hedonist's Guide to...)","description":"Italy's fashion and party capital, Hg2 Milan explores the world-class shopping in the quadrilatero d'oro, the sophisticated aperitivo scene, the endless chic fashion/friendly famiglia restaurants and the hi-energy clubs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VGSU_SWfePkC&dq=Hedonist%27s+Guide+To+Milan+1st+Edition+(A+Hedonist%27s+Guide+to...)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rough Chick","description":"Annabelle has tamed the wild boys, mastered the social hierarchy of catty mean girls, and bugged out over her first school dance.

Not only his own safety, but the life of every man, woman and child in Girdlegard depends upon his ability to embrace his heritage.

Now, she tackles the other end of life in this poignant memoir of a daughter coming to terms with a difficult father who is sinking into dementia, presenting an insightful exploration of the ways we think about disability, aging, and the self as it resides in the body and the world. In prose that is unsentimental yet moving, serious yet darkly funny, complex in emotion and ideas yet spare in diction, Levine reassembles her father's personal and professional history even as he is losing track of it. She unpeels the layers of his complicated personality and uncovers information that surprises even her mother, to whom her father has been married for more than sixty years. As her father deteriorates, the family consensus about who he was and is and how best to care for him constantly threatens to collapse. Levine recounts the painful discussions, mad outbursts, and gingerly negotiations, and dissects the shifting alliances among family, friends, and a changing guard of hired caretakers. Spending more and more time with her father, she confronts a relationship that has long felt bereft of love. By caring for his needs, she learns to care about and, slowly, to love him. While Levine chronicles these developments, she looks outside her family for the sources of their perceptions and expectations, deftly weaving politics, science, history, and philosophy into their personal story. A memoir opens up to become a critique of our culture's attitudes toward the elderley. A claustrophobic account of Alzheimer's is transformed into a complex lesson about love, duty, and community. What creates a self and keeps it whole? Levine insists that only the collaboration of others can safeguard her father's self against the riddling of his brain. Embracing interdependence and vulnerability, not autonomy and productivity, as the seminal elements of our humanity, Levine challenges herself and her readers to find new meaning, even hope, in one man's mortality and our own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m7tcMh5IBjEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 best magic tricks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mntizgEACAAJ&dq=101+best+magic+tricks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Proverbs: An introduction and commentary (The Tyndale Old Testament commentaries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Big Book Of Pirates","description":"A collection of well-known pirate tales, abridged and adapted for younger readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XCtBbwAACAAJ&dq=Big+Book+Of+Pirates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Marketing with CD (9th Edition)","description":"PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS, Eighth Edition, provides complete instruction in business concepts and skills students need in today's competitive environment.

This alarming thesis is explored by David Bayley, one of the most prolific and internationally renowned authorities on criminal justice and policing, in Police for the Future. Providing a systematic assessment of the performance of the police institution as a whole in preventing crime, the study is based on exhaustive research, interviews, and first hand observation in five countries--Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States. It analyzes what police are accomplishing in modern democratic societies, and asks whether police organizations are using their resources effectively to prevent crime. Bayley assesses the impediments to effective crime prevention, describes the most promising reforms currently being tested by the police, and analyzes the choices that modern societies have with respect to creating truly effective police forces. He concludes with a blueprint for the creation of police forces that can live up to their promise to reduce crime and enhance public safety. Written for both the general public and the specialist in criminal justice, Police for the Future offers a unique multinational perspective on one of society's most basic institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=icnhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acting One","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shakuhachi Meditation Music: Traditional Japanese Flute for Zen Contemplation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zJnTzQEACAAJ&dq=Shakuhachi+Meditation+Music:+Traditional+Japanese+Flute+for+Zen+Contemplation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing With Natural Forms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eG7FQgAACAAJ&dq=Designing+With+Natural+Forms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek and Macedonian art of war (Sather classical lectures)","description":"Bog om krigskunsten i Gr?kenland og Makedonien f?r ?r 300 e.

What to do. Where to go. Why it's important. Classes are given on it. Books are written about it. But details get left out. Every year, college graduates learn this the hard way as they step into adulthood. I was one of them. After earning a four-year degree, I went through two of the worst years of my life. Not that my situation is unique. I am a part of a generation that was told to go to college first and sort out the details later. Most of us did. We chased the promise of a big shiny future, and we ended up being chased by the mistakes of our past. That's not to say we completely regretted going. This book isn't a list of privileged millennial complaints. It's a collection of wisdom gained in less than pleasant ways. It's a story of hardship, failure, victory, and perseverance. It's all of the things we wish someone had told us. And it takes place before college, in college, after college, and without college. This is the wild, painful, awkward, hilarious, depressing, & beautiful journey from youth to maturity. This is the college book that no one ever gave us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l7XJAQAACAAJ&dq=US+College&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations","description":"A treasury of thought-provoking declarations and observations features a splendid variety of political, scientific, social, and literary voices.

I couldn't stop reading it.  Simon Sebag Montefiore In this life-affirming intergenerational memoir, Lily Ebert, a Holocaust survivor, and her great-grandson, Dov Forman, come together to share her story an unforgettable tale of resilience and resistance. On Yom Kippur, 1944, fighting to stay alive as a prisoner in Auschwitz, Lily Ebert made a promise to herself. She would survive the hell she was in and tell the world her story, for everyone who couldn t. Now, at ninety-eight, this remarkable woman and TikTok sensation, thanks to the help of her eighteen-year-old great-grandson fulfills that vow, relaying the details of her harrowing experiences with candor, charm, and an overflowing heart. In these pages, she writes movingly about her happy childhood in Hungary, the death of her mother and two youngest siblings on their arrival at Auschwitz, and her determination to keep her two other sisters safe. She describes the inhumanity of the camp and the small acts of defiance that gave her strength. Lily lost so much, but she built a new life for herself and her family, first in Israel and then in London. Dov knows that it is up to younger people like him to keep Lily s promise. He and Lily bridge the generation gap to share her experience, reminding us of the joy that accompanies the solemn responsibility of keeping the past and our stories alive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PBk8EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diagnostic Cerebral Angiography","description":"Dr. Osborn's classic work, An Introduction to Cerebral Angiography, has now been completely revised, reorganized, and updated and expanded from an introductory book into a comprehensive, state-of-the-art reference on cerebral angiography.

For Mark Liebenow, Yosemite did just that, and did so when he needed it most. In Mountains of Light, winner of the River Teeth Literary Nonfiction Prize, Liebenow takes us deep into the heart of this wilderness, introducing us to its grand and subtle marvels and to the observations, reflections, and insights its scenery evokes. Acting as our guide, Liebenow calls on the spirit and legacy of naturalist John Muir to rediscover nature and recover his own exuberance for life. Whether celebrating the giant sequoias, massive granite mountains, and wild, untamed rivers, or losing himself on an unmarked trail, Liebenow is always accompanied by thoughts of his wife of eighteen years, whose recent and sudden death tempers and informs his journey. Interwoven with his experiences are the stories of the Native Americans who lived in the valley for thousands of years and of the early settlers who followed. Melding documentary with introspection, environmental reportage with a search for meaning, Liebenow s work draws on the lore of geology, botany, biology, and history to show how each aspect of the environment is connected to the rest.
