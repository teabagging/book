Perhaps it gets better upon rereading many times? If I could ever make myself reread it.Now, I am a HUGE fantasy reader; if I'm not reading classic literature, I have a fantasy novel in my hand. Therefore, I should be predisposed to love The Hobbit, right? Not so, apparently. I've picked up and started the book three times. I just cannot get into it. The characters are flat and boring and their actions do not inspire or excite me. I had to make myself sit down and read it, which took a very long time with many books read in between. I am a great reader and love nothing more than to sit down with a book, so when there is a book that I must force myself to read (which haven't been all that many) then that says something to me.In some ways I envy all those who adore this book; what are you getting out of it that I am not?"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book, it was very well written and very descriptave.Fantasy novels have never been my style of reading, I have found them not to be my choice of reading. I figured I would start out with The Hobbit and try to read Lord Of The Rings.Bilbo Baggins the hobbit in the story had a lot to go through and had a great adventure with the dwarves. The storyline moved quickly and was enjoyable.My only downfall with this book was the fact that I have a hard time thinking of fantasy in my mind. So I would be lost at times with all the charactors.Overall I can't wait to start Lord Of The Rings sooner or later."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It's been nearly 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped yet.

I had started it when I was in junior high, but became too swamped with school reading to finish it. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more then. It's not that it's bad... it's just sort of plain.I guess you have to take into account that it was written in 1937, which I didn't realize until I finished it. I had always assumed that &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and its earthy themes was a product of the sixties. Apparently not. So this means that the world was a very different place when this book was written.I also tried to keep in mind that the whole fantasy genre grew out of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy; so these progenitors may seem tired because a lot of what I have already read has drawn quite liberally from these sources. Or maybe I'm biased against the whole adventure story thing. The risk of the adventure story is that the adventure *is* the story and that each part of the adventure is an isolated incident with no bearing on the next. In the case of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, there's the orcs, then the goblins, then Gollum, and so on. And, yes, Bilbo grows with each incident. But the story is so consumed with the incidents that it includes precious little else. The characters are flat and predictable -- and I think I'm supposed to like Bilbo, but I don't. I know he's supposed to be the anti-hero, the everyman rising to the occassion. But I just find him annoying.I have another issue with the narrator. Yes, I know it's the whole bard thing, I get it. It still doesn't stop me from thinking that there is a better way of telling this story. It's a little more aimed at kids than I remember when I attempted it a long time ago. Which may account for the lack of description, which, when included, is very vague in this novel. I want to know more than cusory details. When Bilbo gets lost in the mountain and stumbles upon Gollum, I never got the cloying sensation of twisting, dark tunnels. Instead, we are treated to something that is more akin to directions. Left. Right. Down, down, down. It cuts right to the action, so there's no tension and release. Things just happen and go away.And that, friends, is the whole problem in a nutshell:Things happen and go away.I am told that Tolkien wrote this as a bedtime story. I don't know if that's true, but it does have that sort of quality to it. I feel bad saying this, because I know it's a classic, but I think I like the animated movie better...Good for kids, adults will be disappointed....Unless, of course, you're a fan. In which case, you hate me."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is supposed to be an enhanced edition, but audio content is not working on any of my devices including the Kindle.The story is of course worth 5 stars, but selling an enhanced version that does not work is worth \\"no stars\\" or a single star.Just get the regular version is my recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Okay, I know I'm setting myself up for a lot of flack by giving &quot;The Hobbit&quot; only three stars, but I don't think these reviews are worth much unless you're willing to be perfectly honest about your opinions...even if those opinions happen to be different than those of everyone else on the planet, or in the solar system. So here goes.I'm twenty-eight, and I've been a huge fan of horror and sci-fi books and movies since I was about 12. I haven't read much in the way of fantasy fiction, however, even though it's such a closely related sibling to the two genres I love so dearly. As a kid, I loved the Narnia books, and I recently enjoyed the Harry Potter series quite a bit. So with the new movies based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy coming out, I decided it was time to dig into these pillars of the fantasy genre.I decided to start with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; since I'm the kind of person who always reads forewords and afterwards. I had heard so many people talk about it over the years, that I felt like I had already inhaled most of the characters and plot points like second hand smoke.Okay, let me start with some of what I liked: I think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is an original, often charming and fun-to-read story with some great thematic floorboards holding it all up. I like that Bilbo Baggins has some roguish family blood in his veins causing him to crave adventure in a most unhobbit-like manner. It is inspiring that Bilbo is unafraid to follow his own path. His actions and his unbending courage to be himself make him a role model for anyone. In addition to Bilbo, most of the other hobbits, dwarves, and elves that inhabit this book are also quite likable.It's generally a fun quest story that appeals to the imaginations of all ages. There's a dragon guarding some stolen treasure, and a series of fortunes and misfortunes along the way that keep the reader vested in the group's concerns.But there were also a couple of major shortcomings to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; that, in my view, kept it from being a great book. Now here's the part where my opinion will probably veer off from most anyone else's. But like Bilbo, I feel compelled to be my own self.I felt that the style of the narration was overly intrusive; it made me feel less than involved in the story most of the time. I've read the complaints that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reads too much like a kids' book. I didn't feel that exactly, but rather, that the point of view was just too off-putting. There's an omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time, taking you away from characters and events you've invested large chunks of pages following.Also, despite a pretty decent set up and first half, I felt that the book's ending just wasn't very well constructed. The writing isn't actually bad, but the dramatic momentum is often lacking. With less than a hundred pages left to go, a huge inter-race war breaks out, taking you away from the story you've spent most of the book following. When you finally get back to the end of the original quest, the role of hero and dragonslayer is unceremoniously taken from Bilbo by a character that we hardly know.I just felt that there was way too much narrative gear-shifting throughout this book. It felt like I was taking a ride with someone who's just learning to drive a stick.I don't mean to offend anyone with this review. I just felt it was best to be honest. I know lots of people who love this book, people whose opinions I greatly respect. I'll just have to live with a differing opinion on this. In my view, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a pretty good story with some major structural flaws that detract from the pleasure of reading it.If you grew up with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as I did with &quot;Star Wars&quot; or the stories of Ray Bradbury, you probably have the urge at this moment to poke my eye out with a key or to do something equally terrible. So I'd like to extend a peace offering of some kind. I don't think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a bad book, and I think if I had first read it as a young kid, I might have loved it. The same way that if I hadn't seen &quot;Star Wars&quot; until I was an adult, I might have only criticized its bad acting and been blind to the bottomless ocean of magic that swells hypnotically under its surface."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset.

He suddenly finds himself tangled in an adventure to find gold accompanied by thirteen Dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. To get to the gold they must go over the mountains and through the dark forests that lay far away from the little hobbit's house. It becomes a long and treacherous journey that Bilbo regrets even joining. With a lot of wit and \\"burglar\\"-courage Biblo ends up surprising himself, since he never imagined he possed those characteristics.What I ThoughtI really enjoyed this book that has grown to be a classic in English Literature. I did, however, found it really challenging to read by the second half. I felt like the book got a little slow and almost stuck, and was hesitant to continue reading. I made myself finish this book and was really happy I did because I thought it had the best ending. It was filled with the right amount of cute comedy and heart-warming friendship.Also, Bilbo surprised me at the end because he ended up not being as greedy as I thought he would be.I Loved...The fatness, clumsiness and crankiness of Bofur.I was also completely captivated by the Dwarves' names: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori,Nori,Ori, Fili, Kili, Gloin, Oin,I Disliked...The scene where they are lost in the woods.

Tolkein has always been a great writer, but this I believe to be one of his best pieces, with an interesting story, action and adventure, and everything a good sci-fi story needs. All combined to create an excellent story. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf, 2 of the main characters. Frustrated with Gandalf, Bilbo invites Gandalf to breakfast or brunch on a later day, little did he know, Gandalf would accept the next day, bringing with him 13 dwarves. The dwarves plan to retake their family?s home, The Lonely Mountain, stolen by the great dragon Smaug. Early the next day, they depart, on their way to the Misty Mountains, their traveling slow and weary. Needing rest from the elements, and advice for a path through the mountains, they stop at the last homely house of Rivendell. There, Elrond, an Elf of Rivendell, shows them a path through the mountains, and also gives them supplies. On they?re route through the mountains, two storms collide, and they need shelter, only to find themselves taken into a goblin clan?s cave. The party successfully escapes, but without food or supplies. They then make their way to one of Gandalf?s friends. He gives them shelter, and sends them on their way through a forest, the only obstacle left between them and he mountain. The party faces many things in the forest, and is imprisoned by the wood elves. After escape, they make their way to a town, where supplied, they finally make their way through the desolation of Smaug to the mountain. They finally make it there, and inside, when Smaug is killed when attacking the town. The dwarves have found their home, but they aren?t the only ones wishing the get it, and the treasures inside.I enjoyed the book immensely, with a rating of 5/5 stars, Tolkein lives up to his expectations, and delivers a wonderfully great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's Hobbit is not only the best book written by him, but also possibly the best fantasy book ever.

Though actually originally written as a children's story, it almost immediately transcended such a classification, and through the years many adults have read the delightful story of a small, but tough Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.Most folks know the basic premise of the story. If not from reading it, then certainly they know part of it from the prologue to *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie, and likely went out to learn the rest of the tale. A wizard, Gandalf the Grey, goes and visits the son of an old Hobbit friend, and after spending time with him, surreptitiously marks Bilbo's door with a sign that is an advertisement of services for a professional burglar.The dwarves that Gandalf was helping look for a burglar promptly knock on poor Bilbo's door, and up he finds himself enlisted in an adventure to slay a dragon and find lost gold. Initially the dwarves belittle Bilbo, and this just makes him all the more determined to prove them wrong about him, which attitude he does, to put it mildly, regret more than once on their quest. Eventually he finds the Ring and the adventures are many, but that is too much of a spoiler for this review. Suffice it to say, it is one grand adventure after another.It is said that the Hobbit was published on the recommendation of the publisher's son, who heartily endorsed the tale. It also was published on the strong recommendation of Tolkien's friends, including C. S. Lewis. Tolkien was a man of a very exacting nature. The debt owed to Tolkien's close circle of family, friends, and a few close academic peers is incalculable. For their insistence that Tolkien merely \\"publish it already\\" ensured the book kept the whimsical tone it may otherwise have lost.*The Hobbit* is often criticized, to be sure, for not having the extremely \\"serious\\" tone and \\"complex\\" plot lines of its sequel, *The Lord of the Rings*. While this criticism is perfectly fair, it also greatly misses the point. Yes, Tolkien included fantasy elements in the story derived from the epic fictional history of Britain that he was writing. But that was all that these were, small derivatives. There was not a concerted effort when he wrote the *children's* story, to include all of these. Indeed, while Tolkien had to go back and rewrite the section \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" to make the story of the Ring and Gollum coincide with the overall story of *The Lord of the Rings*, that is as far that he was able to go. He realized that to make the tone and story of *The Hobbit* match that of it's sequel would effectively make it no longer the fun story that everyone loved.So the question is, what is *The Hobbit*? What kind of story is it? It is lighter, but with a sense of foreboding. It is the story of a fat, happy, contented age coming to a close in a devastating war that will change the face of the earth. It is the origin of a story that is an attempt to explain how a variety of myths can be true.To this, many may object that *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of the story, but this is untrue. *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of *all* stories, and only concerns the events of the later periods of Middle-Earth very faintly, and near the end of that epic narrative. It is the Creation myth, one that connects with the Christian faith of the author surprisingly well.In fact, the light-hearted tone of *The Hobbit* is the pefect bridge for the reader. It is the most \\"modern\\" in perspective, and introduces the reader to the peoples, geography, and events that they will find are connected from the First and Second Ages in *The Silmarillion* and the Third Age in *The Lord of the Rings*.J. R. R. Tolkien didn't like allegory, as he himself attested, but he did try to do \\"applicability\\", which is really just a way of saying that he didn't directly do \\"x = x\\" in the story, but allowed his Christian worldview to mesh with ancient epics in an effort to reconcile the two differing myths, or as he later convinced Lewis, to separate the \\"one, True Myth\\" to which the other myths copy and pay homage.Perhaps the most important link, however, to *The Lord of the Rings*, however, (besides the Ring itself, of course) is the importance of characters and the emphasis on certain truths and values. Among these are loyalty, the Providence of God, and the simultaneous righteousness and brutality of warfare.Before entering the military after the outbreak of World War I, Tolkien and his closest friends, who made up the core of a club that was likely the inspiration for the later Inklings and other clubs Tolkien loved to found at the various colleges at which he taught, had this notion of the glory of war, and how they would find renown for their deeds. This is shown in the perspective of Bilbo and the other heroes at the end of the story. While they were happy to have won the battle against evil, they also felt the horrors of war quite keenly.For the careful and patient reader, this book contains so many nuggets of truth for a \\"children's\\" book. It is most definitely *not* only a simple story. It is WELL worth your time.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I really enjoyed reading it. I loved all the characters.

In \\"The Hobbit\\", there were numerous obstacles the group of dwarves had to overcome including a fight with a spider and a battle with a fire breathing dragon. This helps each person especially Bilbo grow as individuals, as well as make them realize that not everything and everyone are as they seem.I believe this kind of novel was written for young adult audiences who are interested in reading adventurous novels. It is also a great novel for people interested in all kinds mystical creatures. In my opinion, the novel's appeal is full of heroism, action, and discovering inner abilities and emotions. I honestly don't think the book could be considered a classic due to the fact that this book is aimed for more enjoyment and does not consist of the elements you're typically to find in a classic novel. The book could be recommended to those who are interested in science fiction novels and those who are intrigued by treasure hunting adventures.This novel was unusual from the typical novels that I am use to reading, and I was blown away by many of the breath taking events. Throughout the entire novel I was able to witness a young hobbit transform into a strong and proud leader, who takes on responsibility for the welfare of the whole group on the adventure. After Bilbo kills a spider in Chapter 8, the young Hobbit finally has enough confidence in his own abilities as a leader and hero, and thus is the transformation where Bilbo overcomes his internal conflicts. Bilbo has a newfound appreciation for the comforts of his dwelling, but he recognizes that his view of society and his surroundings has undergone profound change."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit is one of the best book of the lord of the rings saga.

Just getting to the Lonely Mountain is an adventure. Bilbo and the dwarves fight trolls, goblins, wolves and more, and when they finally get to the Mountain they still have to find a way to get rid of the dragon. This book is filled with almost non-stop action and adventure, and if you like either of those you will like The Hobbit. Just make sure you can make yourself stop reading it when you need to!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Ever since seeing the film version of the Lord of The Rings trilogy I've had a hankering to actually sit down and read the books. I haven't read The Hobbit in ages and remember more about the animated movie than the book. Still it was a better place to start being a short book, not to mention the fact that my wife owns an old hardcover edition.It was better than I remembered, a nice tight adventure story told in Tolkien's odd but unique style. Tolkien's works present an interesting dilemma as far as which novel to start with. In particular The Silmarillion, which takes place first chronologically first in the story, and was the first book Tolkien started, was actually released last, after his death. But was it really meant to be read first? Hard to say. Still, Hobbit is by far the most approachable and makes a good starting place.I suppose you either like Tolkien's wandering style or you don't. His loopy old English conventions and penchant for flat out inventing words and tenses might put some off. The structure of The Hobbit in particular is fairly repetitive as well. Once the intro is over the the adventurers are on their way the story falls into a kind of repetitive patter of increasingly more challenging but basically similar challenges for the group. And I'm not the first to mention Tolkiens arguably lazy use of certain recurring plot devices for use when he writes himself into a sticky situation. Gandalf appears and disappears just when needed. And The Eagles always seem to show up at just the right time to save our heroes from dangerous places here as well as in the later trilogy.There's been talk of a new live action The Hobbit film adaptation which is especially tantalizing with the faithful adaptation of the trilogy. Obviously it will be a much easier task considering the shorter length, but it still presents challenges. I see the biggest problem being too many persistent characters. There are thirteen fairly anonymous dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf to deal with. No easy task on film. Should the actor from the trilogy return to play Bilbo? Strictly according to the story it might work since The Ring kept him from aging since The Hobbit. Similar problem with Gandalf. These characters are now firmly planted in the audiences mind with these actors and it would be difficult to replace either.Then again there would be a couple things that make it easier. Much of the creative and production work is already done: the creation of Hobbiton and Bag End for instance, as well as Rivendale sets. Recreating is certainly easier than starting from scratch. It seems all of New Zealand has already been prescouted for locations. Plus all of the creative talent is already in place for costume and CGI work."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I was browsing in the bookstore when I enountered the Graphic Novel version of The Hobbit (IBSN 0-345-44560-0).

The book starts out in Middle Earth, in a town called The Shire. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable hobbit is living in quiet comfort. Hobbits are not supposed to have adventures or do anything out of the ordinary. His normal routines are upset when a wizard, Gandalf the Grey, comes knocking on his door. Gandalf brings 13 dwarves, and an adventure. Their task is to reclaim treasures that the evil dragon, Smaug, had taken from their ancestors. At first Bilbo is reluctant to go, but soon the draw of the adventure pulls him in.Along the way, the group meets all sorts of evil creatures, orcs, goblins, and of course Gollum. Bilbo meets Gollum when he becomes separated from Gandalf and the dwarves underneath the mountain. Bilbo also finds the ring. He finds it near Gollum's lair, and unknowingly takes it. Soon he discovers what it does, and escapes out of the mountain and becomes reunited with the group. They continue into the mountain to encounter Smaug's lair and take back their treasure. Bilbo returns to the Shire with gold, and jewels, and a more \\"precious\\" treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A classic children's story, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" was first published in 1937. The hero of the book is a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins. A small and agile race, hobbits are generally between two and four feet in height. They rarely wear shoes, and - while not magical - can move both quickly and quietly. Fond of eating, drinking and skilled in the smoking of pipe-weed, hobbits live in holes in the ground and thoroughly disapprove of adventures. Bilbo, as the book begins, appears to be a very typical hobbit. He lives in a very comfortable and well-stocked hole, known as Bag End, in a town called Hobbiton. However, things change after a visit from Gandalf the Grey - a very famous wizard - and thirteen dwarves. Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves' leader, is leading a mission to the Lonely Mountain far to the east of Hobbiton. Thorin's people had lived there until being driven out by a dragon, known as Smaug the Magnificent, and he intends to reclaim their stolen home and treasure. Gandalf has persuaded Thorin to bring Bilbo along as the company's burglar. Unfortunately, Bilbo knew nothing of this until the night before they were all due to leave. Although Bilbo has no good reason to join the group of exiles on their adventure, he still decides to go along with them. As the book progresses, he meets many strange people and creatures - including giant spiders, trolls, goblins and elves. The strangest of them all, however, must surely have been a riddle-loving creature called Gollum who cares only for something he calls his \\"precious\\".Following the success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations of the Hobbit's slightly more famous sequel, the Hobbit may - for a short time at least - be seen as nothing more than a precursor to \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It does introduce certain things that play key parts in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" : the race of Hobbits, Gandalf, Gollum and, of course, the Ring itself. However, it is a complete story in itself with a start, middle and end ! \\"The Hobbit\\" will be greatly enjoyed by children - and will also be enjoyed by adults who choose to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Book Review ofThe Hobbit written by J. R. R. TolkienBy Scott KoorsThe Hobbit is a very interesting and exciting book. The main character, Bilbo, is a little dwarf person that doesn't wear any shoes that they call a hobbit. Bilbo and a great wizard, Gandalf, set out on a great adventure together. The two of them overcome some unbelievable hardships. They also make some new friends and at the same time some new enemies.This book allows you to let your imagination run wild. I found that I was putting myself into the different character's shoes during the story. I just imagined how scary, but at the same time, how exciting it must have been for them. Even though there is a lot of science-fiction things in the book, I could still picture all of the scenes and settings. The book wasn't too abstract. I also felt that the book was very detailed. I could almost paint a picture of what was happening in the book in my head.I have always enjoyed reading adventurous books and this one was no different. The book kept me entertained the whole time. I found it hard to put it down, I just couldn't stop reading it. I had to keep reading just to find out what happened next. This was pretty unusual for me, since I don't really enjoy reading that much. The Hobbit was just an all around good book that keeps your attention, while at the same time allows your imagination to run wild. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventurous book, that is written very well by J. R. R.

The movies are a blessing and a curse from a parent perspective: we want our kids to read the books and to enjoy the movies, but easy access to the movies may result in the reading portion being ditched. After reading this version, your kids should be able to tell you which parts of the movie(s)(more are coming out!) were accurate and which were not. The Hobbit, as a story, has a significantly lighter and more playful tone and plot than The Lord of the Rings. Young children will naturally gravitate toward The Hobbit (a quest to recover gold from a dragon is mighty tempting to any youngster) but illustrations give the text tangibility and will solidify retention of the story. Reading The Hobbit, particularly this version, is a great way to get your kids hooked on Tolkien before turning to the Lord of the Rings, which is a much more challenging text.

Thus it becomes easily portable or, if one is as consumed by a love of Middle Earth as I am, it is exactly the right size to become a treasured talisman to be kept close to one's side.Inevitably many will consider this Pocket Edition to be suitable for children, and indeed they will find the story as charming in this version as in any other, nevertheless I would question the wisdom of giving this edition to a child as his or her's very first exposure to Tolkien. The larger editions containing color as well as black and white illustrations (preferably Tolkien's own) would better introduce a new reader to the magic of Middle Earth.Nevertheless this charming edition has great appeal and deserves to be part of every Tolkien collector's library."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The novel The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. It is a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the dwarves' treasure. Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing them. Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example of his courage and ability to perform under pressure. The Hobbit is a wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages. It can be read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral story by the older reader. Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and adventure stories. Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the underlying themes of the book are ageless."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a masterpiece of Fantasy literature. It combines elements of drama, comedy, suspense and adventure to bring your emotions to the surface. The book appeals to fans of the Fantasy genre of almost all ages. The grandfather-telling prose in which The Hobbit is written will appeal to adolescents while the sheer language, storyline and myths that Tolkien has created will surely entice the adult readers.In the opinion of this reviewer, no Fantasy fiction author gives as vivid depictions of all aspects of environments, characters and story as well as Tolkien. So much, in fact, that many popular authors since have tried to parallel Tolkien's writing style. The Hobbit (and The Lord of the Rings) is the echelon of every Fantasy book written since and should belong in every Fantasy liturature reader's library.This reviewer strongly recommends the 1997 edition of The Hobbit which marks the 60th anniversary of the first edition. The book is in beautiful hardcover format filled with lavishly painted illustrations by noted Norse myth artist Alan Lee. The illustrations serve as a wonderful supplement to an already well depicted story. The paper and typeface used in this particular edition is of the highest quality and will last for generations to come. It is wrapped nicely in a glossy paper sleeve, edged with gold foil on the top and bottom in which ancient runes of old are scribed. The sleeve is also adorned with one of the many beautiful paintings of Lee.In conclusion, please be sure to make it a point to read The Hobbit if you have not already done so. If you have had a chance to read it, you will have been rewarded with an incredible journey of the mind and will most likely want to read it again and again during the course of your lifetime, with each reading giving you a greater appreciation for Tolkien's talent."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is one of the best books I've read.

Words alone cannot describe the full force of what this book has done to shape fantasy writing in the 20th Century. It is a book in which everyone can associate themselves to in one way or another. There are many very human issues which arise out of this book, and it does not matter if you have read it once, or a hundred times (like me) that you still grasp something new and exciting about the nature of the book.I truly believe that this is a masterpiece which has and will stand the test of time for now and many generations to come.

Again - not green as in soft green grass, but green as in the greenbacks the company makes from this type of cut in quality.If a company had pride in its product it would have at least foregone the post consumer content grade recycled paperboard and upgrade to paper sleeves. Or better yet, perhaps a $3 jewel case that holds all 5 discs? The exterior box is certainly large enough for a nice plastic jewel case.

The rest of the box is loaded with a large cardboard insert as filler.These type of (goblin) antics are why people stop buying audio CDs and look for other means to acquire their audio (preferably without the aid of a burglar). I certainly won't buy any more products from AudioGO or BBC Audiobooks without holding the product first.

You and your children will enjoy this book for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, and it's more involved sequel (TLOTR), is without question the first and strongest source of my desire to read and to write. As a child, my camp counsellor read segments of The Hobbit as a bedtime activity. I often fell asleep to the tales of Bilbo and his dwarven companions, only to wake up saddened that I didn't make it to the climax of the scene before nodding off. At 10 years of age I came home from camp demanding that my mother buy me this most remarkable book so that I might learn what exactly happened to my new friends (the counsellor wisely wouldn't tell me what I had missed!). I read the book (the first adult book I actually chose to read without a teacher making me) and then read it again! The detailed painting of Middle Earth, and the characters thereof, ignited my imagination.I became an avid reader, always in search of that magic that would transport me to another place, another time. Though I have found many, many books that I have enjoyed reading, there has never been a book that has so utterly captured my imagination and my heart as Tolkien's The Hobbit.The Lord of the Rings is truly a masterpiece of modern literature, and I would recommend it to any that are in search of a wondrous adventure, but I have never mentioned the trilogy without insisting-demanding-that the person first get lost in its prequel. Though TLOTR stands alone, The Hobbit, with its easy style, scaled-down history, lesser characters, and fewer scene changes, is completely indispensible for a deep understanding of what comes next.Tolkien's biography may scare off the casual reader if they hear of his scholarly background, but do not be fooled: His works are more accessible to the reader than anything by Ann Rice, Stephen King, or Frank Herbert. Though no less intelligent or involving Tolkien manages to give the reader a much more &quot;immersive&quot; experience, transporting them into his world, rather than projecting the world onto and around them as most other authors do.I took a cue from that long-ago camp counsellor and began to read The Hobbit to my little son, the moment he was past Green Eggs And Ham. Often now(he's seven), he asks me to read specific passages to him, usually the Bilbo/Smaug confrontations or, sometimes, the adventures with the trolls or the spiders.Yes, this book is a vehicle in which I share &quot;quality time&quot; with my young son. It is also my literary inspiration. I enjoy writing. Whenever I run into a block I pick up my copy and open it randomly. By the end of the page, I'm back at my typewriter, filled with renewed enthusiasm, if not new ideas.I cannot recommend this novel more heartily, and cannot recommend more desperately that you read it before some teacher tells you to do it as a book report. Do it as an assignment, and you will go into the story filled with a bitterness that will ruin the glory of Middle Earth.Remember: when my son, Matthew, is in one of his moods during the day, or depressed about one thing or another right before bedtime, I lean over and whisper something in his ear that brings a smile to his face and a twinkle to his eyes...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The movie will be out soon. However, there is still time to do the right thing and read the book first! From what I hear, the movie is going to be outstanding. But even if our collective hair stands on end, the earth shakes beneath our feet, and a magnificent rapture proclaims us saved for all time...well, I digress. Anyway, my point is, it would be nice for audience members to acknowledge one of the greatest works of fantasy ever put to paper before they see the movie. So if you are debating whether to read the book or wait for the film, let me promptly put an end to that discussion: READ THE BOOK!!!Why is The Hobbit so great? For me, it has always been the character of Bilbo Baggins. He is lovable yet flawed, brave yet frightened. He is, for lack of a better description, very human!Like so many that toil through work days, constantly fighting through the challenges and sorrows of life, Bilbo finds himself thrown into the cross-hairs of evil and injustice. While we face the daily barrage of family problems and feuds, enemies, disease and the general unfairness of life, Bilbo also finds himself on a similar battlefield. Instead of a sinister real-life boss, Bilbo matches wit with the manipulative Gollum. Instead of a gang of criminals, Bilbo battles spiders. No matter what the fictional representation may be, the same code of honor all righteous men hold dear is manifested in Bilbo's duty to do the right thing.After all this time, Tolkien remains the ultimate master of placing the reader front and center in this remarkable fantasy. Tolkien makes us relate to the main character because Bilbo is just like you and me. Bilbo is every man. He is the reluctant hero kicking and screaming his way through the avalanche of predicaments that sooner or later pay us all a visit. His triumph is our own. In my opinion, The Hobbit is a testament to this truth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\`The Hobbit' by J. R. R. Tolkien is often described as the prequel to the much longer \`Lord of the Rings'. I often thought that designation simply does not do justice to the importance of this little \`children's' book.I have an almost reverential respect for the novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. I can appreciate that there are adult readers such as my Hemingway loving uncle who simply \`don't get it'. I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!\`The Hobbit' shares many similarities with \`Alice in Wonderland' in that both authors were distinguished Oxford dons who created the works out of stories they made up for young listeners. The differences are as interesting as the similarities. While Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) was a logician, Tolkien was a philologist. So, while both, in a sense, studied language, the differences in their avocations are evident in their text. Dodgson's works are full of logical curiosities and Tolkien's works are full of linguistic inventions, going so far as to create parts of at least three different languages to put into the mouths of his \`Hobbit' and \`Lord of the Rings' characters. But Tolkien went much further than simply creating languages. Even Carroll dabbled in creating words (see the poem \`Jabberwocky'). Tolkien created whole histories of a huge continent ruled by demiurges very similar to the Olympian gods and populated by at least three races of immortal elves, seven clans of dwarves, dragons, trolls, giant spiders, goblins, shapeshifting men, giant eagles, intelligent wolves, and some horrors too unspeakable to bring up here, as they do not appear in \`The Hobbit'.This history was probably not committed to paper as Tolkien was writing \`The Hobbit', but it was certainly in the back of his mind. And, it is this sense of great depth to Middle Earth's history that gives one great added pleasure in reading this book.For the three adults who don't know the story of \`The Hobbit', it is the tale of a band thirteen homeless dwarves lead by a former king of their clan, Thorin Oakenshield who wishes to reclaim his home and treasure from a rather large and rather cunning dragon named Smaug. Thorin meets up with the wizard, \`Gandalf the Gray' and over a pint of ale, hatch the scheme of hiring a thief and raiding their treasure from right under the dragon's nose. The thief who Gandalf selects is a most unlikely adventurer, a hobbit who is even more set in his comfortable ways than is usual for these very comfortable rural folk. But hobbits happen to have a few attributes that make them especially good at burglary. They are quiet in the extreme when sneaking up on something and they are exceptionally good with slings and hurling projectiles by hand.I will not tell much more of the plot, as the unfolding of the story is by far one of the greatest pleasures. This is in no way a character study; it's all about landing in trouble and getting out of it by the skin of their teeth. Aside from banishing a major league dragon from their cozy mines, the main point of the story is the finding of a magical golden ring, which is the jumping off point of \`Lord of the Rings'.There is another less obvious connection between \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings'. Gandalf's support of Thorin's adventure is not done out of the goodness of his heart, it is done to remove a major calamity from the playing field before Sauron, the ultimate heavy in \`The Lord of the Rings', can make use of Smaug. Even though dragons seem to be a pretty independent lot, there is no questions that Sauron could not bend even Smaug to his will, especially if Sauron recovered the \`One Ring'.One thing which always disappointed me about the great historical back story behind \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is that the origin and history of the wizards in Middle Earth is never fully spelled out. The history of the elves is done in great detail, but little is directly told of Gandalf, Saruman, and the other three wizards. The only thing of which I can be sure is that unlike Beorn, the eagles, and humans, they are not native to Middle Earth. There is but a single reference to a race of magicians in \`The Silmarillion', but neither the name Gandalf or Mithrandir appears anywhere in this last of Tolkien's major works.Since having read \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings', I have searched in vain for tales of equal quality and there are none. Arthurian legends come close and next to Gandalf, Merlin is easily my favorite fictional character, but Tolkien seems to have hit a mother lode of wonder and lore was before and remains hidden to other writers."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The story is superb, but I will not cover the story.The cover, pages, and binding are of high quality.

I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is beyond description... Gee Whiz, I am surprised that it's not more popular...If you have written any other books, would you please send me their names?John Barrow, 12 yrs., West Town PA.I thought these extracts from a letter I got yesterday would amuse you. I find these letters which I still occassionally get (apart from the smell of incense which fallen man can never quite fail to savour) make me rather sad.

But I suppose one should be grateful for the grace and fortune that have allowed me to provide even the drop. God bless you beloved.

Anyway, it's a great first step into the fantasy genre and will immediately make you aware of the pretenders out there; In fact, annoyingly so. I now spend my time looking for something as great, but still original.

His illustrations capture the tone and the mystique of Middle Earth better than any others I have seen."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out.A brief note about the annotations. There are a lot of them. Most of the annotations note changes from the previous versions, particularly changes made to account for discrepancies between the 1937 Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter underwent particularly dramatic revisions. Other annotations discuss the origins of words or concepts in the story. The book also includes dozens of illustrations from various versions of the Hobbit. Few of these sketches impressed me, except for Tolkien's, whose is surprisingly good. I'd definitely recommend reading the annotated version if this is your second or third read through this story, but for first time readers it might prove more a distraction than a help."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've always loved the Hobbit, so even though I own the hardcover version, it made sense to get a digital copy for my Kindle. I wasn't sure if the Kindle version would do the book justice, but this edition is quite good. Tolkien's images are beautifully reproduced, and the songs are formatted in a way that meets the style treatment Tolkien envisioned. My only complaint revolves around two issues common to many Kindle products:The first is that in a few places there's an unexpected line break in the middle of a sentence. This happens on many Kindle books, and seems to be a symptom of a greater problem, where these books are not as carefully edited as hardcopy books. But this is a minor issue.The second problem is that when you click on a link in the \\"Illustrations\\" list to view the map or illustration, only on the Kindle itself can you quickly get back to where you stopped reading. On the iPhone or iPad there's no convenient \\"back\\" button for this action, forcing you to manually find your way back to the page you were on prior to looking at the map or other illustration. You can create a bookmark, but it's an extra step that's complex and shouldn't be necessary.

The Hobbit, one of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece works, is clearly one of the most amazing pieces of literature ever dreamed up. It is extremely well thought out and written. Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read.The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them.

That was a loooong time ago, and I have wanted to re-read the book that started me into the fantasy genre. I have now satisfied that desire with the kindle version, and have to say that the story reads almost like a summary of itself in too many places. It's also written in a voice entirely unlike the serious tone of the trilogy to which it is a prequel---it is truly a book written to appeal to children, not adults. So, the adult in me wants to give the book three stars, but the child I used to be remembers this book quite fondly and had it on a pedestal at the time, and would give it five stars. So I have settled in the middle---pardon the unintended pun reference to middle-earth---at four stars.

Turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids. If you've taken them to see &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (I would advise children over the age of 10), then read Tolkein to them. Your children's imagination sparked by Tolkein's genius descriptive writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful Middle Earth than the blockbuster movie was able to create.

If you're expecting it to be the same style and intensity as Lord of the Rings you may be disappointed. This story, while having it's dramatic moments, is more mellow and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR. In reading this you get the impression that Tolkein was enjoying himself as much as we have enjoyed reading it. I must have read this book at least 15 times between 1975 and 1990. It has been years though, and with the new release of the movie I decided to re-introduce myself to an old friend.The Hobbit is a tale about Bilbo Baggins (a relatively minor character in LOTR) and his adventures with 13 dwarfs to reclaim their treasure. Initially led by the wizard Gandalf the troop encounter trolls, goblins, elves, giant spiders, and of course THE DRAGON. What I liked the most about the story is that Tolkien really uses his sense of humor throughout, something missing in LOTR. Of course we get to meet two characters who play important roles in LOTR: Elrond, the Elf Lord, and Gollum. The story follow the group from the beginning of their journey in the Shire, their trek across the wilderness where they are waylaid by trolls, and over (and under) the misty mountains where they are captured by goblins. It is here that Bilbo finds 'The Ring' and his life changes forever. After their escape they make their way through mirkwood, where they are first ensnared by spiders and then imprisoned by elves. In both cases Bilbo is able to rescue them. And of course to the journey's end at the Lonely Mountain and their confrontation with Smaug the dragon. The tale ends on a sad yet uplifing note of redemption.Although you can read Lord of the Rings, or even watch the movie, without reading The Hobbit first why would you want to?It's just much more fun to read this beforehand. I would also recommend &quot;The Simarillon&quot;, Tolkien's mythology of middle earth.

Still enjoyable, but not as visual and gripping as the trilogy to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I was a kid, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a perceived boy book. Girls, instead, read \\"Little Women\\", \\"Betsy-Tacy\\", and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\". Ask a boy to read any of those series, and they'd gag. Those girl books, however, are still great contributions to the literary and imaginative worlds.*** So even though Tolkien hasn't reached me until now (and well past my childhood years), \\"The Hobbit\\" is a rewarding pleasure. It's the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\") and considered gentler and more suitable for reading to young children than the subsequent installments.*** The Hobbitt is Bilbo Baggins who leaves his comfortable abode (his hobbitt hole) to go adventuring with the wizard Gandalf and a party of dwarves who have a penchant for breaking into boisterous singing during mealtimes.*** They're off in search of treasure with little more than an old map and a lot of gumption to guide them. Bravery emerges in a disarming way. Tolkien understands the homeliness of his hobbitt and the dwarves -- the sort of quality we, the readers, have as humans but spend a lot of time concealing as uncool. So when adventure prods the timid and the inexperienced into derring-do, we are swept along like participants ourselves.

Well they were a lot better, but were kind of boring and drawn out. But then I decided to read the Hobbit, and finally I was impressed. This, in my opinion is where anyone who is reading Tolkien should start out.This book is fairly easy reading and fairly lighthearted. It is written with much more excitement than the LOTR and as a result is much more suspensful. I actually felt tense when the wolves were attacking the company.Though the language is not as polished as in the LOTR, Tolkien makes up for in character development and plot.Well anyway, I feel this deserves every bit a five star rating.

I was spellbound within a few pages and was astounded at how energetic and compelling the story is. And this was published in 1937!

The descriptions of both settings and characters are very good, the story is extremely imaginative, but I think it's a very &quot;light&quot; adventures story because of all the perils Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit) and his dwarves companions encounter, there's not one in which you can really get concerned of what the outcome will be.

Personally, though, the themes and characters portrayed are much to deep for the story to be written as a children's book.I got just as much out of reading the intro to the Lord of the Rings (explaining briefly the events which came to pass in the Hobbit, for readers who have not read the Hobbit) as I did reading the entire book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up along with Narnia series.

I thought this was a typical fantasy novel with some adventures, good vs. bad encounters, and a happy ending where the party succeeded in killing the dragon and restored the city to its old glory. Boy, was I sure wrong! The characters were round, possessed both good qualities and flaws (for example, the dwarfs were excessively greedy, and there were serious problems because of that) and the group changed by each new experience acquired. The story was mysterious, suspenseful, funny, and dark, and the adventures were fascinating. The ending (*grin*) was totally different from what I imagined.

I grant that this is an unabridged reading, not a dramatization, but for an example of how the characterizations could have been accomplished, and for sheer listening pleasure you must compare this to the Harry Potter audio books read by Jim Dale. Jim Dale brings the characters to life in his reading with amazingly diverse voice characterizations, speech affectations, differing accents and pacing, such that the voices really suit the characters. In comparison, Mr. Inglis has a very narrow range of voice characterizations, and to my taste his characterizations were distinctly amateurish, flat and one-dimensional really, which was surprising in light of his Shakespearian credentials and disappointing after my experience with the triumph that Jim Dale brought us in the Potter series. In addition there are some rather horrible errors which should have been caught, and these now seem telling in the overall sparkless, indifferent and uninspired performance of this classic. An example of one such error: \\"Confusticate and bebother those dwarves!\\", which was flubbed by Inglis, saying \\"Confiscate\\" instead of \\"Confusticate\\". It is possible that Mr. Inglis thought to correct the text, as there is really no such word as Confusticate, nor \\"Eleventy-One\\" for that matter, but this may also underscore Mr. Inglis' ill-suited understanding of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as \\"not helpful\\" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"While this book is acclaimed as one of the best fantasy novels of all time. I find that the most weighing factor for this is age. Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively.

Tolkien is a book that is recommended for students at the middle school level and even the high school level who are interested in reading fiction and action/adventure books on their spare time. This is a book that may be hard to read at times because of the language that Tolkien used, so it may be a good idea to look up some words in a dictionary that are difficult in order to understand some parts of the book better.In my own opinion of the book \\"The Hobbit\\", I did not really like the book at first, but as the book went on and got more exciting after the great wizard known as Gandalf invited thirteen dwarves along with Bilbo Baggins to find the evil dragon named Smaug and reclaim the lost treasures that the evil dragon had taken from the dwarves in the past. At first, the dwarves were skeptical about Gandalf's decision, as well as Bilbo himself because of the grave danger that they could possibly face. Bilbo's character in the story was one of a humble manner; Bilbo did not have the character of an adventurer, or a burglar. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf assured all of the Dwarves that Bilbo had the hidden character within himself to be a stealthy burglar and a courageous adventurer. Bilbo not believing the omniscient Gandalf went along on the journey anyway. On the journey that Bilbo, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves endured, they had to face many secondary enemies such as Gollum, the trolls, and the Demon King. They also traveled to many lands such as the Lonely Mountain and the Mirkwood village on their quest to defeat the evil dragon Smaug.The characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien were each uniquely significant to the clarification of the plot. Bilbo, the main character is the central character who is trying to change his destiny of crude comfort. He becomes a hero and an enemy to evil. Yet his nature does not seem to emphasize his central role. He is still a little old hobbit, as he was always wishing to be sleeping at home in his hole, even towards the conclusion of the plot. This story will intrigue the mind of the reader, and this is definitely a book that will not be able to stop reading until the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I guess I am one of the few, very few apparently, who was not blown away by THE HOBBIT. While the story itself is fun and adventurous, I was let down by the telling of the story. While I felt the ending was much better than the begining, the Narrator just got on my nerves. Everytime the story got interesting and exciting, this voice would come out of nowhere and say something like, &quot;This was not the last time that Bilbo would use his sword Sting, but that is something you will hear about later.&quot; I know that exact line was never written, but stuff like it certainly was. I just think you shouldn't have to be told what will happen later so bluntly. Maybe a subteler form of foreshadowing is needed, or maybe I am just overly sensitive. In any case it was a good story, but not great."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"CHARACTERS-The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, seems to be a very strange person to write about in a fantasy novel (considering he's plump, lazy, has hair on his toes and hates adventures) but turns out to be a rather enjoyable nostalgic-like outcome. The dwarves (they could of done with less, I suppose) are pretty much the same character with some variations and exceptions such as Thorin, but just their rhyming names and happy demeanor throughout the story makes this book all the more merrier (besides the traditional cliche for fantasy is a large group of heroes setting out to fight evil, right?) Gandalf is like all mysterious mages, sorecerers and wizards in fantasy novels...you just can't do with out them. It seems they always set the foundation for the plot as well.....STORY-Not the best story in the world, and definetly not one set on need. Gandalf the wizard and king Thorin of the dwarves are setting up a group of adventurers to embark on an journey. Gandalf suggests Bilbo (the burglar) would be the the perfect person to be the last member of the dwarven group. King Thorin is setting out with his companions to retake his throne from the evil red dragon, Smaug. Smaug lies in the midst of the dwarven kingdom where dwarven gold lays in heaps along with a valuable item of particular dwarven interest.QUALITY-This will be very short. Tolkien is a great writer with a great mind for imagination. The adventures the rather small group takes on are very fun and mysterious if not terribly entertaining.FANTASY-The good ol' stuff... dwarves, wizards, sorcerers, elves everything that makes up traditonal fantasy. If you don't like traditonal, this book might not be for you. I myself used to be a huge fan, but now am more into the original stuff, like Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time.RATING-From 1 to 10, I give this book a 7. Keeps you very interested!

This all changes when an unsuspecting hobbit named Bilbo, when Gandalf comes back to The Shire. He tells Bilbo of a far off land in peril. He tells of a dragon that is wreaking havoc to the people of the nation. But most of all he tells of an adventure, an adventure that Bilbo is not to keen to be a part of. With a band of dwarves, a wizard (Gandalf), and a Hobbit, the team sets off on their quest. Along the way, the group is met with many challenges including a bunch of trolls, some mischievous elves, and a creature named Gollum. It is in the cave of Gollum that Bilbo has to use his skill of riddles, to outsmart the creature and escape. On the way out of the cave, Bilbo finds a ring that will come to lead to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their quest leads them to the mountain of the dragon Smaug (Mt. Doom), where it is again up to the smart and cunning of the little Hobbit to save a town. Here, at the lake, and epic battle occurs. With the dragon slain, it is time for the return trip and for life to resume as normal. Bilbo has a hard time trying to readjust to his former life of a hobbit. He is constantly seeking adventure again, and so is looked down upon by the inhabitants of the Shire. This book is filled with action, adventure, and friendship.

And other than that it was a fine story.If you had watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, you'd know that it started with a hobbit (one of the Hobbits which is a tribe of halflings) named Bilbo, who was trying to have a big party for his elleventeen birthday (111 in the hobbit tongue, don't you think it is very childish for me, sigh). This story, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is the sole account of Bilbo's adventures, and is the predecessor of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"Gandalf, who appears in the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" appears here too, and is one of the integral components of the story. He introduces Bilbo to 12 dwarfs (or dwarves as he insanely like to write it). The 12 dwarfs take Bilbo, who reluctantly agree to accompany them, on a trip to kill a dragon (what can be more childish). These dwarfs have some strange (childish) names, like dori, ori, nori, oin, and gloin.They encounter some trolls, goblins (or orcs), and Bilbo meets a strange creature called Gollum. He gets his ring from there. They meet some more odd creatures and then reach the place where the dragon is.They actually kill the dragon and then have a big fight with some other armies. Bilbo forsakes the dwarfs, for some reason or another. Things must be fixed, so Bilbo becomes a friend of the dwarfs one more time. He gets his share from the treasure of the dragon (all dragons must have treasures, you did not know that? oh my!) and then goes back to his hobbit hole, where he lives.You are welcome to read, you might not get bored, but I am not all that enthusiastic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There is no action, no underlying them, it's too gory, but, it wasn't horrible. I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games. And people with no life and lots of time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is a kind of prelude for The Lord of the Rings, but it lacks some of the good style found in the latter.

You'll enjoy the whole saga this way."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"While I admire Tolkein's imagination and ability to create such a vivid, interesting world, I found the book quite dull.The characters: Bilbo: Yes, I know he is not an adventurer (and perhaps the reader is supposed to identify with him), but that doesn't make his whining any more pleasant. His luck seems to explain some very fortuitous events, but makes it feel as though the book was written backwards (Okay, _this_ is going to happen, so _this_ had to have happened here.).Gandalf: a powerful wizard presumably fighting for good, but condescending and self-important.and a group of dwarves only really distinguished by Bombur the Fat and Thorin the Leader.It was interesting to see where some other fantasy realms got their ideas, but I found it difficult to pick the book up. Nothing important happens for periods at a time. Of course, the benefit of this is a more in-depth view of Tolkien's world. Don't get me wrong: the world is fascinating, but I'd much rather read about more interesting characters living in a very similar world (Dragonlance novels by Weis and Hickman come to mind.). Why suffer through the bad parts when everything can be wonderful?The only moment I felt any connection to the book was a section towards the end, when someone admits their faults and moves on.

However, despite the negative, there is still much more positive things to be said about this novel.

Come visit the Hobbit hole at Bag End, where you're always welcome...journey to the lake under the mountain...cross the enchanted river flowing through Mirkwood...and on to the Long Lake and the Dwarven Mountain overtaken by the evil worm Smaug. &quot;There and Back Again&quot; is quite the appropriate alternate title.Tolkien synthesized many mythical creatures and stories into his introduction to the Lord of the Rings. The story was meant for children, and is certainly not a difficult read, but anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventure, and heroism will not be disappointed by Tolkien's marvelous book.Without giving the plot away, the book does have more to it than simply the plot...consider, for example, the obstacles Bilbo and his party face. Water (it's been suggested before) is a recurring theme. Also taking into account where Tolkien is from and the time he wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the Lord of the Rings, some have examined whether the books contain historical allusions.Most, however, leave the academic arguments aside and simply read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as Tolkien, at least foremost, meant it to be: an escape to Middle Earth, an epic adventure with an unassuming, timid, and at the beginning, most unwilling Hobbit. Enjoy! econ"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Have you ever been at a particularly challenging point in your life? Ever woken up in the middle of the night and wondered, \\"How did I get into this mess?\\" I'm willing to bet that Bilbo Baggins wondered this many a night as he went through his adventure in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit. One day Bilbo's life was peaceful, orderly, and quiet, shut up in his little hobbit hole. The next he was worrying about trolls creeping up in the night, or spiders swallowing him whole as he led eleven dwarves and a wizard to retrieve stolen treasures from a legendary dragon. Tolkien makes readers feel as thought they are really there. Their hearts pound as the characters race from evil goblins. They can almost feel the bitter cold of the mountains, the cruelty of the dragon, the vulnerability of the dwarves, and the terror of the war between them. As a teenager, I don't read much fantasy. Normally, I enjoy books that are true to life and have things in them that really happen. But Tolkien makes the novel seem so real and honest that I find myself believing in every word he writes. There are always a few questions people ask when I try to tell them about this book. One question I hear a lot is, \\"Aren't I a little old for fantasy?\\" Never! Fantasy is written for anyone who has an imagination--who believes in dreaming and accomplishing his or her dreams. Fantasy is for them, and I believe anyone can dream. Another question is, \\"What is a hobbit?\\" A hobbit is a small creature with large hairy feet, an enormous appetite, and excellent eyes and ears. They love parties and hate adventure. So why did a wizard named Gandalf knock on his door one sleepy morning and push him into the greatest adventure of his life? What did the long, grueling journey have in store for Bilbo? How would he change? Find out when you read The HObbit, and enchanting, captivating book that I most definitely recommend. Take the journey of a life time that you're sure to never forget--and experience it through a hobbit's eyes."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have done dozens of reviews for Amazon and I have hundreds of reviews on other sites, and The Hobbit is one of only 2 books I ever gave 5 stars to. Simply put, everything else is worse by comparison. This book began the entire fantasy genre, and it is still far and away above all of its competitors. Put simply, there has never been and probably never will be a fantasy author as good as J.R.R. Tolkien. I read this book for the first time when I was 6 and I have reread the series at least 20 times since. What makes this book (and the entire series) so compelling is the level to which Tolkien develops his characters and settings; it is very easy to completely lose yourself in his words. You don't read this book, you experience it. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bilbo Baggins was an ordianary hobbit, living in his ordianary home, doing his everday oridanary things.

This gold originally belonged to the dwarves until taken away by the terrible dragon, Smaug. Bilbo and the dwarves are now off on an adventure. A very dangerous adventure to be more precise.

At first I believed after much reading I have come to see new aspects in the story. The way that the author describes the setting made me feel as if I was marching through the woods on the adventure. During the dwarves adventure they come into contact with many obstacles such as goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step from the opening of the story onward is a great adventure. Within the woods fo the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy written novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings. Although as unrealistic the story may seem, I found myself hping for Bilbo the hobbit to save the dwarves through each adventure. I recomend this book for suspense and mystery.

He very much enjoys going back and forth between his numerous pantries and smoking some pipes.One day Bilbo gets an unexpected visitor: The wizard Gandalf is standing at his door and offers him an even more unexpected adventure. Bilbo, though, doesn't have the slightest desire to be part of this. He prefers to concentrate on less dangerous things, such as cake for example. Lots of cakes, to be perfectly clear.However, shortly after, Bilbo is confronted with even more unannounced visitors - a bunch of dwarves are making themselves comfortable in his living room and eat all the delicacies from his pantries while discussing and planning said adventure. It takes some serious persuasion by Gandalf (that very much address Bilbo's idea of honor) to make the little hobbit decide to accompany the dwarves on their daring journey. He does regret this decision several times later on.Together with the wizard and 13 more or less brave dwarves he has to pass trolls, make it through the dangerous Misty Mountains and through the even more dangerous Mirkwood with its enchanted Forest River, to eventually reach Lonely Mountain. This is the final destination of their risky journey, because there, the dragon Smaug is sitting on a huge golden treasure that once was stolen from the dwarves and which they now want to get back under all circumstances.With the help of a golden ring, that Bilbo receives through a trick from the strange creature Gollum, and which can make its wearer invisible, he escapes great dangers more than once. Slowly, the once frightened and cautious Bilbo Baggins turns into a brave and bold version of himself, who saves his companions from danger several times.It was exciting to accompany Bilbo on all his adventures. A big reason for that is Tolkien's impressive writing style: It is captivating and totally dragging the reader into the story - there is no escape. Often, I have been staying up late to read \\"only one more chapter\\" (we all know how that works ;) ). Many times, I had to smile about cranky Bilbo or the grumpy dwarves.I loved this courageous little group; constantly hoping, they would be able to successfully fight all the dangers, and hopefully with most of them surviving. ;DBilbo's character really developed through all of this. By the end of the book there was almost nothing left of the once timid hobbit. Okay, he still is a little greedy when it comes to food, but I guess that's just in the nature of hobbits. He has a good heart, is honest and always tries to make everyone happy and to be fair. Overall, he was such a likeable character to me, which is a bit weird, because in Lord of the Rings, I found his character to be rather strange and couldn't get a real connection to him. Now, that I know his own \`story', I understand his character much better and just love that charmingly quirky dude.The end of this book, which apparently left many people disappointed, was totally okay with me. It was exciting and exactly what I was expecting. With Tolkien, most stories are built up the same: There's an adventurous journey, with a lot of dangers and mystical creatures such as elves, Orcs, Wargs or, well, dragons. At some point the journey ends and then there is a furious ending, which I, of course, don't want to spoil here ;). So, like I said, I expected it and it was just perfect to me.I even shed some smallish tears over it and finished the book with a big *SIGH*. I was sad that the long journey now had come to its end. One of my favorite quotes is from Paul Sweeney: \\"You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\\"This.With each end every book of Tolkien's.I am going to watch the movie next week and am very excited about it :)The Misty Mountains Song, which I posted at the beginning of this review, already very much convinced me and I hope the rest of the movie is just as awesome :)However, I do think that making a trilogy out of a book that only has ~300 pages is somewhat strange (and very much \\"milking the cow\\" = pure money making), but okay.Gotta watch the movie first to form my own opinion about that - maybe a trilogy really is a good idea in the end.To me, \\"The Hobbit\\" certainly is a classic, which every fan of epic fantasy should have read at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Way better than the movie!!

It combines adventure, fantasy, and folklore together making a thrilling book. This book was written because JRR was a professor of English at Oxford and had wanted to write something like this for a long time. The book shows that he spent much time on the book. Through this work, he became the father of the fantasy/adventure genre. I had to knock a star off though for the confusing laguage he used in conversation and in his descritions. Perhaps if one likes to think about something very deeply, this language would be a great source of thinking material. However, I enjoy the reading. I have to have adventure after adventure after adventure. This book portrayed that, however, the language did slow it up a bit. All in all, a very excellent piece of work by JRR.

He takes the imagination to new heights, introducing us to an extraordinary land filled with extraordinary people and creatures; some good, some evil. Bilbo Baggins the lead character in the book is goes on an adventure that is beyond his wildest dreams. The way in which Tolkien tells this tale, is worth the read by itself.

The details are rich, you can feel the awesomeness of this amazing story, and it is a _great_ prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's interesting looking at the level of greed in the dwarves. They care for nothing but treasure, or so it seems. Another thing is probably Tolkein's writing style and how it changes from this book to the rest of the trilogy.

The hobbit is such a wonderful book, everything thing about it is great not just the plot but the also the setting. Tolkien creates this whole New World for all the readers to explore as they go through the book.The \`hobbit' is about...well hobbits, hobbits are half human size and the most unmagical being and wouldn't do anything unexpected.

By the end Bilbo seemed like it was his personal destiny to be in adventures. He is a very funny and intresting charater with many good qualities. I like this book, this is because it is in a whole different world where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension.

(robes, large pointy hat, long white beard, magical staff)go into this book with an open mind, rand emember that is was not intended to be a great piece of literature, but rather a good story for younger readers, and you will love it.excellent book to read with your kids. or, if you want to remember what it was like to be one."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have been told that i am sad for reading the Hobbit.

One of The Hobbit's greatest aspects (or worst, depending on how you see it) are the vivid details of the scenery Tolkien provides the reader. This makes the reader feel as if he/she is in Middle-Earth as part of the party of 13 dwarves, one hobbit and a wizard. You experience everything the group does, and they do go through a lot. The downfall of this style is it may seem slow and boring to some, but not to me.Some say that there is not enough charcter development or that the plot is too thin. I beg to disagree. While there are many pages of wandering around Middle-Earth and descriptions of its locales, the plot moves at a fair pace with a main event present in every chapter. As for those who say that character development is non-existant in the novel must have skipped quite a few chapters. Do they not realise that the main character, Bilbo Baggins, goes through a tremendous change? At the very beginning of the book he has very little desire for adventure. He does not think of himself as brave or bold or resourceful. By the final pages of The Hobbit, he has become all the things he didn't believe he was.After reading this tale of travel and adventure, I now agree with those who say that this is the greatest literary works of the century. If you are open-minded and like fantasy in general or like the Star Wars saga, you should look into this book. And if you enjoyed reading this book you will also enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Finally, this is a great novel that is well worth your money, every cent of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The first time I read this book was when I was nine years old. I hated it.The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen. The first thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story. However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there quivering&quot;. The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable.

I went and dug up my old copy and fell in love with the book all over again. This book is a must have for anyone's home library. One of my favorite parts is the riddle game between Gollum and Bilbo (what's its got in its pocket?). There is so much to explore and discover in this book.

I know that some of you die hard Tolkien fans out there are probably ready to kill me now for saying that, but it's true. Yes people, there is a thing as creativity. Authors tend to use it every now and again. And yes, there are simularities between every book and the Lord of the Rings, if you look for them at least. But there are also similarities between Lord of the Rings and older books like The Odyssey. Or any other book you can think of. But why look for them? It just destroys your enjoyment of the book you are comparing it to. If you read every book expecting it to be like another one then you won't catch on to what the author has in mind.

Escaping from goblins, being rescued by giant eagles, killing dragons, and protecting a hoard of treasure may seem like a typical adventure story. This story will tingle the senses and twist your imagination to new heights and leave you wanting more and more! In a lifeless, boring, adventure-less, hobbit town with a shy, dull, adventure-less hobbit came an adventure of all adventures, one that couldn't be turned down. The shy hobbit meets a wise, risky, well-known wizard who talks the hobbit to throw a party and the hobbit accepts. At the party, the hobbit meets thirteen dwarves, who turn out to be his traveling companions and each have different traits and personalities which both aid and the hurt the friends on their journey. The friends start on their journey and they must travel through dangerous mountains filled with deadly goblins. There the hobbit proves his usefulness and saves the dwarves from the goblins from there on the hobbit pulls the dwarves and sticky and dangerous situations. This book is terrific. J.R.R. Tolkien's writing is detailed and flowing that lets the reader feel like he or she is actually in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good sense of imagination and adventure.

By the way, I actually rated this book a ten, but it wasnt possible. If you ever read in your life, if only one book ever, read the Hobbit, because it will change your life."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who wanted to live alone and not be disturbed. Later, a wizard named Gandalf comes along with a group of dwarves. The dwarves and Gandalf were going to go on a quest, which would be very tough. Bilbo became interested in this very fun adventure and decided to join along. While Bilbo was going on the quest, he and the dwarves and Gandalf encountered huge spiders, evil orcs and killer wolves. It got worse and worse by the minute. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves came to the the Lonely Mountains, and behind those mountains was the evil dragon Smaug. Many of the elves and dwarves feared him because he was of great evil and wanted to conquer the lands of all the creatures that lived in the forests and villages. He had to be stopped. The malovent dragon was very powerful and couldnt be stopped, but he had to. Bilbo didnt know what to do because he felt scared and frightened in many ways, but he did want to do the right thing. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves encountered a group of elves and these elves had a Elvenking, who was their mighty ruler. Bilbo talked with him about the malovent dragon Smaug and needed to be vanquished. The Elvenking agreed with him and decided to take a stand. So Bilbo went to confront the dragon. What will happen, and will Bilbo defeat the evil dragon Smaug?I thought this book was terrific! I thought it was really interesting, and I couldnt put the book down. I just kept reading and reading. The plot of the book was really neat. I think a story about good against evil is a good theme. I thought Bilbo was a good person in the story, obviously because he wanted to stop the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo was brave by showing courage and I really like that. This story is a classic, and you cant put it down. I would get this book. It is worth reading and you cant resist it. I recommend this book for ages 8-30. It is a very descriptive book with great amount of detail. Adventure, fantasy, and imaginination are all in the book. Read The Hobbit , the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, both written by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"First of all, let's dispose of a couple of widely-held beliefs about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, this book was written as its own story, stands very well on its own, and is far from being merely a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Second, although children certainly can read \\"The Hobbit\\" and enjoy it, this book can be read on more levels - and possibly with even greater pleasure -- by adults. So, to call \\"The Hobbit\\" a \\"children's book\\" is neither particularly accurate nor helpful. The fact that there's been a great deal of serious literary criticism written on \\"The Hobbit\\" should tell you something right there! Personally, I have read this book nearly a dozen times, starting when I was in college and just about annually for more than 15 years afterwards, and I still feel that I have not fully exhausted this book nor outgrown it. In fact, I very well may read it another dozen times in my life. Who knows?Now, what about the book? On one level, this is a fairly straightforward -- and excellent -- adventure story, with plenty of action, colorful characters (good, bad, and in-between), suspense, treachery, fighting, treasure, etc. On another level, this is also a kind of Freud meets Harry Potter \\"coming of age\\" story, beginning metaphorically in the womb (Bilbo Baggin's tunnel-like, comfortable, safe \\"hole in the ground\\") and ending up with Bilbo progressing via a series of challenges through childhood (burglar), into young adulthood (adventurer, with his new-found sword named \\"Sting\\" - hmmm, Freud thinks...sometimes a sword is just a sword?!?), and finally into full maturity (leader/hero). Contrast the beginning of the book, where Bilbo runs practically naked (\\"to the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a walking-stick, or any money\\" or even his \\"pocket-handkerchiefs\\") out of his womb..er, hobbit hole, and the end of the book, where he returns much changed (\\"not the hobbit that you were,\\" according to Gandalf the wizard) and totally grown up (actually, presumed DEAD, with his possessions in the process of being auctioned off). So, in sum, this is an adventure story/coming of age book, which takes us from the main character's birth to his (symbolic) death, with lots of interesting life in between.But, if that was all there were to \\"The Hobbit,\\" it would not be the classic that it is, but merely an entertaining, well-written book, mainly for children. Instead, \\"The Hobbit\\" rises to a totally different - and much higher -- level on the basis of several factors: 1) the author, JRR Tokien, Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and an expert in linguistics and early English literature, Beowulf for instance, creates a work of tremendous scholarship, great thought and care -- well camouflaged as a \\"children's story\\" -- and, as CS Lewis wrote in 1937, \\"a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology;\\" 2) this is a great work of imagination, which essentially imagines a world - Middle Earth - in many ways similar to our own world, and in other ways quite different; and 3) there is a lot of really interesting stuff bubbling beneath the surface here, some of which Tolkien hints at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" and much of which is developed further in his two other great works, \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" For instance, although great evils (and in fact the origin of evil - and much else) are hinted at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" they are left mainly for further development in other places. However, this does not lessen \\"The Hobbit,\\" per se, just gives it a sort of subconscious depth which is not often found in \\"children's books.\\"Just to provide one further illustration of how this is not merely a \\"simple children's book,\\" let's think about this for a minute in quasi-Marxist socioeconomic terms. Basically, what you have here is a comfortable bourgeois community of Hobbits - fat, lazy, happy, contented, ignorant, and kind of stupid. Then you have a bunch of mercantalist/proto-capitalist Dwarves enter the picture, who draw one of the bored-out-of- his-mind Hobbits (Bilbo) out of his comfortable hole and in search of their plundered (and now unproductive) capital, being closely guarded by the ultimate robber-baron, the Dragon. Other interesting creatures from this perspective are the \\"cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted,\\" machine-making, worker-exploiting Capitalists, er, Goblins (\\"they make many clever [things]...or get...prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light [to make]\\"). And guess what this all leads to, as Marx predicted? War, of course, which in this case is ultimately won (barely) by an unlikely alliance of the Dwarf and Elf proto-capitalists (led by various monarchs), the mercantilists/petty bourgoisie of Lake-town, and mysterious Other Forces (Beorn, the Eagles, Gandalf the Wizard). And, of course, lots of workers/proletariat types die in this war (which does, in the end, result in a long period of peace in Middle Earth). Given all this, is it any wonder that \\"The Hobbit\\" really became popular in the 1960s Vietnam War era?Anyway, this is just a partly serious, partly tongue-in-cheek example of why I think \\"The Hobbit\\" is a great book (like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), worthy of numerous readings, by both children and adults alike. The thing about great literature is that different people can get different things out of it. So, read this book, then read it again (and again), and, to paraphrase Tolkien, \\"see whether [you have] gained anything in the end.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

That Tolkien could write a children's story with such depth and resonance that anyone from 3 to 300 can read and enjoy is beyond nearly any other writer's ability, at least in this genre. The Hobbit stands alone as a beautifully written tale, but that it left so many tiny cracks that Tolkien could create an epic sequel and a complete land (With amazing history!) is beyond me. The Hobbit deserves reading once for entertainment, twice for discovery, and unlimited re-readings to delve again and again into a world that, beneath the magic, isn't unlike our own."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Since there are over 600 customer reviews listed below, I can't really say much more than what other people have already said.

Imagine Bilbo's surprise at being confronted with, first a wizard, then a large number of dwarves who show up for tea unannounced, threatening to stay a good while and (much worse, from Bilbo's perspective), wreak havoc with the crockery.

And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"1 wizard and 14 dwarves, how much adventure can you get from it?The Answer is alot! A hobbit who never been on a adventure and who is convinced in going on one by one wizard named Gandalf and other Hobbits. They all head on for adventure. The Adventure includes facing fantasy monsters like Goblins, stone giants etc. The author of this book is J.R.R Tolkien, The Hobbit is the first book of the series &quot; The lord of the Rings.&quot; There are 3 more books other than the Hobbit. The first of the three which is The Fellowship of the Rings recently just came out in the movie theater. The main character in this book is Bilbo Baggins a Hobbit. The adventure starts as soon as you pick up the book and read it.The Movie &quot; The Lord of the Rings : The fellowship of the Ring starts off with a brief introduction of The Hobbit a worth it movie to watch but before going to watch the movie maybe you should read the book first. The book is just as stunning as the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is an amazing story, a true classic about hobbit Bilbo Baggins being recruited by wizard Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves across treacherous terrain to do battle with a mighty dragon, Smaug, who had destroyed a small city and claimed it;s treasure. One of the dwarves, Thorin, was a descendant of a dwarf king of the city destroyed. There are encounters with giant spiders, trolls, wolves and goblins as well as a journey up a river in wine barrels! The goblins do battle with the elves, dwrves and men for possesion of lands shortly after the death of Smaug. The conclusion is to an extent sad, but staisfying. Several years ago here in Melbourne, there was a play about the hobbit featuring both puppets and peo0le."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I personally found this book more interesting than The Lord Of The Rings. His book is the prequel to it. It tells how Bilbo got the ring,his history with Gandalf, how he got the mail and where he found Sting and how it was named. Also, his encounters with drarwes, men, elves and a dragon called Smaug. If you read LOTR read The Hobbit. It is an amazing book. I recommend this book to all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A hobbit is a little person that lives in the land of Shire. It all starts with Bilbo Baggins, not found of adventures at all! He just likes to live in the comfort of his little hobbit hole. Then along comes thirteen dwarfs accompanied by a wizard named Gandalf. They come to him with a quest. A quest to get their town and treasure back from a dragon named Smaug. They just need one more person for their journey. That person is to be a burglar, and you guessed it, that burglar is Bilbo Baggins! The hobbit goes through many fasinating adventures in this book that are mind-popping and so enjoyable to read. Read the hobbit to find out about the adventures of Bilbo Baggins!Boy, I sure loved this prelude to the Lord of the Rings! It is so fascinating to read about the adventures Bilbo gets into as the book gets nearer and nearer to the end! If you read this and love it like I do, then I suggest you start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, read The Hobbit first! In this book, Bilbo finds a ring that somehow makes him invisible. But that's not all the ring does or creates! there is an evil master to that ring and put the two together, well Houston we got a problem! Frodo, Bilbo's cousin by blood, but now his adopted son because Frodo's parents died in a boating accident has a quest to distroy that awful ring in the fires of Mordor.Read the Lord of the Rings trilogy for more fantasy adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Paul Jones is referring to the BBC version. That one is abridged. The Rob Inglis version is unabridged and is 10 CD's long. If you loved the book, you'll likely love Rob Inglis' reading. If you didn't like the book, you probably won't like this. But what are you going to do while you're driving to work if you don't listen to this ;-)? I give it 4 stars because I don't like opera and Inglis sings the songs from the book. Wonder where he got the music."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It had been probably ten years since I read Tolkein when I saw the film &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; Needless to say, I've caught Tolkein fever again and after the second time I saw the movie, I went directly to the bookstore. I was thrilled to see this book on tape, unabridged (which it really is). I don't think it's necessary to review the actual story; you've probably heard all that before. I am very pleased with Rob Inglis as the reader, though. His voice can be either powerful or gentle, or both as the story calls for. I was a bit surprised of his reading Gandalf as, honestly, a pretty cranky guy...but after a while I got to enjoy Gandalf even more because of it. Now, I'm not a musical person, I don't sing, and I don't really enjoy musical productions. However, I thought Rob Inglis did a spectacular job with the songs. When I read them, they were OK, I thought. But hearing them sung with such a wide range of feeling just made the story all the more powerful. The dwarven songs were particularly well done, deep and resonant just as you'd imagine they should be. On a more practical side, I really appreciated the announcememts (very brief) at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. Since I listen to these in the car, it helps to know exactly where you are and when you'll have to grab the next tape. I listen to a lot of books on tape, and I can say that this production is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I won't go into how great this book is in this review -- if you're looking at the collector's edition, chances are you're either already a Tolkien fan, or you're considering this as a gift for someone who is. Suffice it to say that this and the accompanying trilogy are great for anyone's reading list. I bought this edition as a gift for my husband to replace the beat-up paperback copy he'd had for years.This particular edition of _The Hobbit_ is a very high quality, handsome book. It comes in a slipcase, and the spine of the book is embossed in gold and metallic red. The cover is a textured, leatherlike material -- I am not sure what it is made out of, but it feels nice. Inside, the paper is all good quality, the binding is strong, and the pictures (drawn by Tolkien) are beautiful, printed on glossy paper.This book would make an excellent gift for anyone who has read and enjoyed this wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien really captures the imagination that a young child has. The Hobbit shows you a whole new side of the world. Whether you're sitting on your couch or flying in the claws of an eagle, you can't help but love the adventure that Bilbo Baggins is experiancing. You begin to have a real fear of the goblins, and to admire Gandolf for his wisdom.

I asked what it was about, and when she said, &quot;hobbits,&quot; I remembered that I had always wanted to read the book from which that excerpt had been taken. So I obtained the Hobbit, and read it, and the books for which it is a prequel, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I was swept up in the epic nature of the tale, in the characterization, in the heroism. Whether one likes the tale or not, and I've found few who don't, there is nothing here to criticize: no gratuitous violence and no sex at all (amazing). An old fashioned Englishman's tale of a world where manners still count, where education, poetry, music, and values such as loyalty, honesty and courage are still the stuff of heroes. I have read the books dozens of times. It is so easy to pick up one just to read a passage, and be swept up in the story again. I read the whole Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to my son, out loud, twice. Now he is a teenager, and has read them on his own several times. This is great literature, and will be considered classic some day.

When I looked at some of the illustrations, they were originally printed in the hard copy so that they could be viewed from the side instead of up and down.

This is definitely a good book, but it might not have held up quite as well as I'd expected. I'm still going to give it 5 stars for the nostalgia, but otherwise I'd probably give it 4. The writing style is just very detached, and it's very hard to get into the characters. I never felt like I was Bilbo Baggis, this was partially from the writting style, but especially because of the comments from the narrator. Instead, the Hobbit feels like a story someone is telling me. Maybe this is why it works so well for children/young adults, but reading it now I just felt detached from everything that happened. There's a lot that happens during the book, but it all goes by so quickly that it's odd. This is most noticeable for the ending, which I found to be poorly done. There's such a buildup to fighting this dragon, but in the end it's fought and killed in about one pages time. Then the battle where multiple main characters are killed is hardly described at all at first, and then it's just summarized by the narrator. Still, The Hobbit is a fun and easy read, that everyone should at least read once."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Fast paced and delightful read, full of both whimsical and terrifying characters whom the reader grows quite fond of.

After watching all of the LOTR movies I was left with a desire to keep learning of this amazing and beautiful world. I found the creator of middle earth and did research I bought virtually all of his books. I started my journey to learn everything about Tolkien Mythology. This book is simply put out of this world, perhaps from middle earth. This book is supposed to be a children's book but I believe the reason for that is the story not the writing. The reading is above average and you cannot expect a child to fully understand or capture all of the context like it is meant to be captured. So I think this book is best to read to children and explain every detail about it or for older children around 12-16. I had never read any of Tolkien's literature before and started of with this book and I am inclined to read it again because you cannot squeeze all of it's genius out in one read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There is no way any review can do justice to the greatness of The Hobbit.

Since the first copy came into our home 2 generations ago, it has been replaced several times and read by adults and children alike, and is now being enjoyed by a 4th generation - our grandchildren. We purchased the 1966 edition shown in this listing with the beautiful dust jacket repro of Tolkien's painting of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien's unique art always piques the imagination. The image on the dust jacket of this edition was reproduced by one teenage son on his bedroom wall, and remains there to this day, some 25 years later, and in much better condition than the dust jacket of his parents' old book...Unlike Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit is not moralistic, i.e. there is no battle of good and evil. It is simply a straighforward adventure story. Little did we know when first reading The Hobbit that Bilbo's finding of a magic ring would trigger armageddon. Finding this out in our later readings of the LR trilogy did not reduce the continued pleasure and interest in Bilbo's adventures. Our first joyous discovery of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is renewed with each re-reading to a grandchild.The Hobbit carries on galantly alongside Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, The Wind In the Willows, and the Just So Stories. There is plenty of intellectual value for children in terms of broadening vocabulary, because it stirs intense curiosity through following a complex story line. Such books offer a look into other worlds where life and people are quite different, where rivers don't flow to familiar ends, and where simple objects can have properties and uses other than the obvious. No one absorbs this kind of material better than children, but over the years we saw the family's teens and collegiates sometimes re-read The Hobbit. The story keeps its hold even on minds that are jaded by age and hard knocks."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Let me just start by saying that I love, and have always since the first time I read it, loved this book.

Bilbo is a hobbit from Bag-end, a place in the Middle Ages. Hobbits are smaller that you and I. They don't wear shoes because they have hairy feet. Their houses are called hobbit holes. They are holes in the ground (hill). One nice day in May Bilbo gets an unusual visitor. The guest is unusual because it just so happens that he is a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit knew the wizard because when he was young the wizard came to Bag-end to meet old friends and make fireworks. Gandalf was an old friend of the Took family and Bilbo's mother. He and the Took family used to go on all sorts of adventures. Obviously the Took's weren't hobbits because generally most hobbits enjoy peace and tranquility. Little did Bilbo know he was about to embark on an amazing quest along with thirteen dwarves and of course Gandolf. Soon he will be battling with goblins, Gullem, orcs, giant spiders, and Smaug the dragon. All he has to help him along are his friends, Spike the sword, and his very unusual ring.The Hobbit is a great book to me because it is full of magic, battle, legends, and many unusual creatures.

A must have for anyone's audio book library."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is one of those novels that I'd put off reading for a long time. I often had difficulty getting past the first few pages. This isn't my sort of read, for I've never been into this sort of fantasy-and-magic-realism-for-children genre. But then I couldn't put it down the second I decided to give it a whirl. The Hobbit is a well written, engaging, and oftentimes humorous work of fantasy. It is aimed at a youthful audience and I think it would be a marvelous next step for Harry Potter fanatics. That is if said fanatics hadn't read this classic gem beforehand. In any event, this novel is far better written than the aforementioned popular series. This book is a wonderful revelation and I recommend it. You won't be able to put it down once you get into it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book tells of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and of his companions, a group of thirteen dwarves (Tolkien's preferred spelling) and the wizard Gandalf, as they set out to rescue a hoard of stolen gold from a fierce dragon. (A hobbit, for those not familiar with Tolkien's world, is a small, hairy-footed person who lives in a hole in the ground). Along the way, they have various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves, animals and even humans.If the above brief synopsis makes the book seem like a twee Enid Blyton tale for infants, all I can say is that it is not. Unlike the more adult The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit probably was written primarily with children in mind, but it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults. Indeed, it can in many ways be read as an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.The Hobbit can be divided into two parts, corresponding to the time before and the time after the finding of the gold. The earlier part is lighter in tone. Although Bilbo and the dwarves face dangers in the course of their journey, they are able, by courage, ingenuity and luck, to overcome them; they are always the heroes, and the reader's sympathy is with them as they battle with the malevolent trolls, goblins and wolves they meet along their way. Bilbo is a particularly well-drawn character. He starts out as hesitant and nervous about the enterprise (hobbits tend to be conservative and unadventurous), but as it progresses finds within himself reserves of courage and resourcefulness, which enable him to rescue his companions from danger. (The dwarves, on the other hand, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, apart from their determined, headstrong leader Thorin Oakenshield and the fat, lazy Bombur).After the gold is found, the tone of the book becomes darker. The dwarves become less heroic and more morally ambivalent as disputes over the true ownership of the recovered treasure threaten to lead to war. The issue is not finally resolved until a bloody and destructive battle has taken place. What started as a light-hearted children's adventure story becomes a parable about the corrupting nature of greed and the destructive power of violence. The links between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are thematic as well as narrative"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The book was amazing, it is a must read. I would would recommend the book for any skill level of reading. The adventures are imaginitive and in detail. The author Tolkien takes your mind to another place.

The cover art is by Giancola and is different than the cover shown above.I have been enamored of Tolkien's universe for over three decades now, and interested in associated works as well, though some work better than others. This one-volume illustrated adaptation of the novel works very well indeed. What I'm probably most grateful for is that, while not a verbatim transcript, it is a fairly complete adapatation -- even Beorn is here! As for artwork, I always measure Tolkien art by the depiction of the hobbits, and Gandalf, and Wenzel does a fine job IMO. (His pictures are quite different from the cover art.) The hobbits aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're not freakish either, and the dwarves and Gandalf and the elves and the settings are all quite nice.This would be of interest to a Tolkien collector, a fun read for graphic novel fans, and a nice introduction to the Tolkien canon for wee folk.Note: I believe there is also a three-volume graphic novel though I haven't seen it.

But Bilbo's life is unexpectedly turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf, with thirteen dwarves in tow. They eat Bilbo's food, take over his cozy hobbit-hole (a subterranean dwelling -- \\"Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort\\"), and generally make life difficult for him.But Bilbo soon finds out why: these dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, who slaughtered its inhabitants and stole their treasure. Now, led by Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves intend to take back what is theirs -- and Gandalf wants Bilbo to come along. Bilbo doesn't particularly want to go, but the adventure appeals to a quirky, adventurous side of him. Before he knows what has happened, he is on a rollicking adventure filled with malevolent goblins, a degenerated creature with a magical Ring, Elves both friendly and unfriendly, enormous eagles, savage wolves (also called wargs), and giant carnivorous spiders. But even if Bilbo can get past these dangers, he must still deal with the malevolent Smaug in his mountain fortress.Many people have fond memories of reading \\"The Hobbit\\" as children (including part of the LOTR movie cast). This is definitely a children's book in some ways, but most children can't pick up on the subtle character developments and the nuanced foreshadowing. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not merely an entertaining story or a delightful prequel, but also a masterful piece of fiction.If nephew Frodo Baggins is the ultimate \\"little guy\\" hero, then Bilbo is the ultimate reluctant hero. Bilbo is almost perfectly happy in his respectably dull life, but his very small yearning for adventure is evident from the very beginning. Though he is not the sort of person that you would classify as being a hero, Bilbo grows gradually and subtlely in courage and ingenuity. Only on the very last pages does the reader realize just how much Bilbo has changed.Gandalf is a more nebulous figure in this book than he is in LOTR, and displays much of the \\"crotchety gray wizard\\" archetype that he formed in fantasy literature. Thorin Oakenshield displays the endearing and annoying traits of dwarves, dating back to the Prose Edda: He's proud and sometimes a little obnoxious, but also fiercely loyal, honorable and extremely brave. The other dwarves are not featured as much individually (after all, there are twelve) but retain individual characteristics that never become jumbled or confused.Tolkien's writing style is somewhat in keeping with a bedtime story (which this once was) and a children's story. He had apparently mastered a very rare gift, that of being able to address the reader without sounding cutesy or smug. The descriptions are very evocative, especially when he describes action scenes. The dialogue is enchantingly written, managing to be fairly realistic while never being boringly so.Like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\" is influenced by mythology and a previous work of fiction. The goblins (later orcs) are somewhat reminicent of George MacDonald's goblins; as Tolkien read and enjoyed some of MacDonald's works, this is unsurprising. Additionally, the names of Gandalf and almost all the dwarves can be found in Norse legends. The impact is subtler than that in LOTR, presumably since Tolkien's children were too young to appreciate any influences.\\"The Hobbit\\" remains a classic that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike, possibly even more enjoyable now than when it was first written. Before you read \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" be sure to check out its enchanting prequel."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"With Peter Jackson's motion picture trilogy out this December, I thought I'd download the Kindle edition of The Hobbit and read it to my two young daughters beforehand.

Bilbo's quest to find the dragon guarded treasure stolen from the lost kingdom of the dwarves in the Misty Mauntain along with a band of dwarves wanting to rebuild this kingdom is very excitting though overall this book is not as dark and dangerous as the LOTR trilogy. It is also written in a slightly different way though this by no means makes it inferior to LOTR.

I am primarily a theologian. But I loved The Hobbit.With the announcement that Tolkien's great prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will soon be made into a movie trilogy of its own right, I thought it was time to delve into this classic adventure myself. I am so glad that I did.Let's start with character development. Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Wizard are two of the best characters Tolkien has ever created. (And he has created hundreds!) In The Hobbit, we learn to trust each of them. Bilbo emerges as a reluctant yet heroic protagonist. He is hesitant, traditional, mannered, quick-witted, and yet shockingly courageous. This despite his diminutive stature! Drawn into an adventure larger than life--to recapture dwarvish treasure held captive by a murderous dragon--Biblo shows himself over and over again to be the most reliable compatriot of the band.Gandalf on the other hand is Biblo's perfect compliment. He is strong, indomitable, larger than life, and yet flighty and preoccupied. He swoops in at just the right moments to rescue the would-be treasure hunters. In chapter five (revised in later editions) we also meet the grotesque Gollum, bent helplessly inward by the ring's debilitating powers. The repartee between Bilbo and Gollum while the ring's fate stands on the line is deeply memorable. We only learn later that all of Middle Earth hangs also in the balance of this test of wits between the deformed Gollum and the sharp-tongued hobbit.In terms of visual drama and setting, Tolkien in unmatched. He is able to create vast worlds that seem both familiar and impossible to the reader. Throughout his works, the Shire, the Misty Mountains, the Mines of Moria, Esgaroth, and Mirwood are described with vivid imagery. Tolkien creates a world that can both enrapture and repulse his readers. Few fictional writers can create and balance such elaborate settings as Tolkien does. (Thankfully, the movies have not let us down in portraying these stunning worlds).Most readers will be not surprised to note that The Hobbit (like The Lord of the Rings series) contains a substantial amount of poetry. In Tolkien, this functions to create a timeless quality, blending Middle Earth's mythic age into current bends in the plot. The poetry often emerges in the form of dwarvish songs, assuring the reader that the characters themselves are captivated by myths and legends of their own. These poetic songs and tales are sometimes warning, and sometimes consoling the heroes along their path of destiny.The plot itself, primarily a dragon-slaying tale, never lags. In each successive chapter, Bilbo finds himself entrapped in another web (once literally!) that seems at first inescapable. Once Biblo and the dwarves--led by the overly confident Thorin Oakenshield--actually meet the dragon Smaug, the reader stands convinced that their gold-snatching feat will at last be impossible. Only the heroic resolve of a certain halfling will prove otherwise! But I won't spoil the tale for you here.The Hobbit ends exactly where the reader hopes it will all along: with a cataclysmic battle scene featuring all the forces of Middle Earth present. Men, elves, dwarves, wargs, gobblins, eagles, and one particularly irrepressible wizard all arm themselves for battle to the death for fame and fortune.No wonder this work is timeless!Matthew Everhard is the Senior Pastor of Faith Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Brooksville, Florida."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Through the use of voices the Hobbit comes to life.

Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

Though it was not my introduction to fantasy, it was one of the first books of fantasy that I had read. Now, a couple decades later, I returned to the Hobbit in preparation for the movie coming out in December 2012.The story is straight forward. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable Hobbit living a respectable life, somehow finds himself part of an adventure. An adventure of all things! Adventures are not respectable. And yet somehow Bilbo is bamboozled into it. On the adventure Bilbo finds himself in the company of a wizard and 13 dwarves. Definitely not respectable company. This particular adventure involves trolls, endless roads, no chances for second breakfast, elves, men who turn into bears, goblins, more elves, and even a dragon. And of course, Gollum and a rather famous ring. Trying to write a review of this particular book without giving away spoilers is hard, but necessary. But you may be wondering what is the point of the adventure. Well now . . . the point of the quest is to reclaim the stolen dwarf treasure from the dragon, Smaug. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or watched the film adaptations then you probably know how things turn for Bilbo.The edition that I read was fantastic. It includes audio of J.R.R. Tolkien reading from select portions of the book. It also includes beautiful color illustrations.

For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship [on the ship] \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character ([for [all his]] though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life expereince to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past [When - give examples of this]Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others). [the whole affair of ] This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising [ever renewing] battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent [work] heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicility prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things.

While it may not live up to that epic trilogy, \\"Hobbit\\" is rather remarkable in its own way: Tolkien's ability to turn what essentially was a children's bedtime story into an engrossing novel filled with adventure.For a basic plot summary, \\"The Hobbit\\" sees Bilbo Baggins, of Hobbiton, set off on a grand adventure in the company of Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves bent on reclaiming their rightful treasure from a greedy dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the company meets up with some eclectic creatures ranging from trolls and giant spiders to great flying Eagles and even a pathetic little creature called Gollum who is hiding a \\"precious\\" whose significance cannot yet even be fathomed.Whereas \\"LOTR\\" reads like an epic, \\"Hobbit\\" reads as if Tolkien is telling you a story (with both the language and tone of the book reflecting this). It is full of strange creatures and sometimes rather terrifying events, but at the same time it is rather light-hearted, with the merry gang progressing rapid-fire from one adventure to another. There is none of the doom-and-gloom or Middle Earth politics that is often the focus of LOTR.Easily the \\"crown jewel\\" of this novel, though, is the portion involving Gollum and his \\"precious\\". Whether read before or after LOTR, these scenes will stick in your mind long after anything else in this book. Much more reminiscent of the darkness of LOTR.Thus, \\"The Hobbit\\" is basically the \\"first steps\\" of the greatest fantasy story ever created. I can't rate it as better than any of the LOTR books, but if you like a lighter tone and less \\"weight\\" in a book, then this one might just appeal to you even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As I said, it's a great classic. I really like how I didn't have to deal with marking which page I'm at and holding a 300-ish page book. E-delivery is also very nice."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Written before \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", Tolkien introduces us to the world of Middle Earth through the unexpected, and unsolicited, adventure of the main character Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit to help the dwarves retrieve their long lost treasures of their long gone ancestors. As they pursue their quest, we come across many other inhabitants of Middle Earth. Some of them are friendly and others are inherently evil and blood thirsty. Hobbits, dwarves, man, elves, trolls, wolves, eagles and the infamous Gollum are properly described to advance the plot but not extensively enough for you to loose interest. I couldn't derive a definitive moral message from the novel but it was immensely entertaining nonetheless. Two points worth mentioning about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, the language Tolkien used is so elegant and eloquent. I couldn't help but compare it to other temporary writings which seemed a bit vulgar! Secondly, there are many songs (lyrics) throughout the book and some riddles too. Personally, I found them entertaining and conveyed the spirit of the situation whether it was warring or a peaceful one. This book surely has popped up \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" on my books-to-read list. Now, I can't wait to watch the movie and make a comparison. Tolkien has set the bar a little high but I guess Peter Jackson is up to the task since he did such a great job with The Lord of The Rings. Highly recommended if you're into fantasy.

Not the glossy type that comes on most books these days. After reading a library copy of The Hobbit I decided to make a permanent place for it on my book shelf and bought this."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've read some negative reviews of \\"The Hobbit,\\" so I thought it might help potential (or confused) readers to explain some things.First, Tolkien's three major works set in Middle Earth are The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. You need to understand that Tolkien pretended, as he was writing them, that they were written by hobbits, and came to Tolkien as the \\"Red Book of Westmarch.\\" Tolkien then translated the Red Book and wrote up the translations as the three works above. That is the literary conceit, and if you fail to recognize that, then you won't understand how the three works can be so different.The part of the Red Book which Tolkien pretends to have turned into The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, was supposed to have been written by Bilbo himself, for other hobbits, as a tale of his adventure. Thus, descriptions and characterizations of dwarves and elves (and everything else) in The Hobbit are from the viewpoint of a very unsophisticated hobbit who had one (epic) adventure in his entire sedate and settled hobbit life. One of the overarching themes of The Hobbit is that the adventure radically changed Bilbo in some ways while leaving him amazingly unchanged in many other ways. Bilbo remains a hobbit, through and through (albeit a strange and unreliable one, in the opinion of most other hobbits). The description of a typical hobbit in the early pages of chapter 1 is the description of the writer, and the reader must keep that in mind.The LOTR, in contrast, was (supposedly) based on parts of the Red Book written mostly by Frodo, who lived through the events of LOTR and who was very much changed by them. Frodo as a writer was much more sophisticated, more well-traveled, more learned, and more connected to the outside world than Bilbo. Frodo drew on many sources for his story, and was not an eye-witness to much of it. Also, Frodo loses much of his \\"hobbitness,\\" partly due to the burden of the Ring and partly because of his extensive exposure to the Wide World. LOTR is therefore the most \\"human\\" (in the Middle Earth sense) of Tolkien's three works.Lastly, The Silmarillion was (supposedly) based on parts of the Red Book which were translations by Bilbo and Frodo from ancient elvish histories (both oral and written). So again, the character of The Silmarillion is quite different from LOTR or The Hobbit.However, the three works constitute one whole. Reading all three gives the reader much more appreciation of Tolkien's world of Middle Earth. I hope this helps some confused readers.If you want to hear some great lectures on The Hobbit, check out [...](Note that I have no association whatsoever with that web site / professor / school.)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"THE ENDING ENRAGED ME I MEAN TALK ANTICLIMACTIC SO GUY SHOOTS SMAUG IN THE HEAD AND IM LIFE ERRRRRRRRRRG SORRYDONT HATE INSPIRATEFOLLOW on twitter @JaredPendleton"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The book was brand new and it had the original art work on the cover and inside.

I don't know what made me choose it, I don't remember much of it...I don't even remember if I liked it or not, really, so maybe I should stop saying that I've read this book twice. Re-visiting it was really more like picking it up for the first time except for a couple of scenes that felt vaguely familiar.For the most part, I can see why this book is a classic. An author's creation of an entire world, with new creatures and politics and history, is one of my favorite things to discover (if it's done well, and this one was). I loved the gentle, familiar narrative voice and its occasional side commentaries. I greatly enjoyed watching Bilbo learn that there is more to him than he thought (this, I suspect, is the real appeal of this book for so many readers: if plain old Bilbo Baggins can embark upon such a dangerous journey and live to tell the tale, what may life have in store for us?). I liked that the characters aren't perfect, that they make mistakes but also experience successes. After all, minus the elves and faeries and goblins and dragons, isn't that what life is all about?There wasn't much that I didn't like about this one, to be honest. I probably won't read it again anytime soon, but that's only because I've got so many other books on my to-read list.

Tolkien's The Hobbit is the epitome of classic tales of adventure. It allows the reader to venture on a journey impossible to take in the real world. Adults are reverted to their childhood ways while reading about the encounters Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves face during their voyage. Tolkien's skill in entertaining was clearly shown in this literary work. Even though The Hobbit is not as well known or recognized like Tolkien's later work, it is still greatly acknowledged as the book that started a great series, and also launched his career as an important figure in entertainment.Tolkien's use of imagery is what helps this book flow so well. Tolkien, by using imagery and literary devices, displays a journey that the readers feel they are a part of. Tolkien's simple syntax gives the story an old-timely effect. This makes the story feel like it is a treasured legend recorded on paper. The simple syntax gives almost a play-by-play account of Bilbo's journey, allowing the reader to closely follow along with Bilbo and the troops' every action. This allusion makes the book more enticing, and engages the reader into the book. The author's expansion of certain made-up words, places, people, etc. keeps the reader informed and saves them from becoming confused and disinterested. These literary strengths make The Hobbit an extraordinary and classic adventure novel.Although The Hobbit is an interesting read, the plot itself has some holes that left the reader questioning what had occurred. These gaps, as minor as they are, still draw attention and create some confusion. The flow of the book is consistent, but it is clear that the middle to the end is more rushed than the beginning. In the beginning, Tolkien used great detail in describing context, characters, and plot that it set the reader on a steady pace. However, towards the end of the book Tolkien greatly quickened the pace of the events, resulting in a rushed feeling. Tolkien's flaws altogether are still minor compared to the literary strengths he displays.This book is a classic adventure novel that is altogether very well written. Tolkien, after gaining a reputation from The Hobbit, later goes on to write his famed trilogy The Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit may be lesser known than his other works, it is a great read and undeniably entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A lot of life makes more sense now.

Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

Seeing Bilbo reluctantly dragged from his comfortable hobbit hole into the adventure of a lifetime and seeing him rise to the occasion time and again was pure delight.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a magical book which resonates with overtones of mythology and folklore. Tolkien was a specialist in Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse materials--Beowulf, the sagas, and Eddic poetry were part of his professional stock in trade. Much of the atmosphere of his books comes from his use of these materials. Having studied a bit of Old Norse mythology since my first reading of \\"The Hobbit,\\" this time around I had a deeper appreciation of Tolkien's accomplishment.Unlike the LOTR trilogy, Tolkien originally wrote \\"The Hobbit\\" for children. This makes the book a little simpler thematically than the other books. However, Tolkien does deal with some very adult themes in spots and adds a touch of ambiguity to some of the characters as well. The aftereffects of the death of Smaug and the battles at the end of the book are cases in point. But whether you choose to read deeper meanings into the book or not, it remains a wonderful, enchanting read.One final word-this time around I listened to an audio version of the book.

Tolkien may be just the type of book you are looking for. In better detail, if you didn't know, a hobbit is a little person. They are about half our size and have furry feet. They live in small hobbit holes and like to be left alone by people not of their own kind. The Hobbit is the exciting prelude to the award-winning triolgy The Lord of the Rings. The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's journey is quite different than that of a normal hobbit. He sets off on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a great wizard named Gandalf. They would travel all across the land, which was called Middle Earth, and fight trolls, dragons, and something called Gollum. The purpose of the journey is to regain the dwarves' stolen treasure. In some parts of this otherwise flawless book, Tolkien over desribes things. When there is no excitment in the story at a certain time, I found myself wanting to move on and skip pages. I do not think you should look this book over and not read it because it looks like something a geek would read. This however is not the case, because The Hobbit should be looked upon as a great work of art, not something that is simply tossed aside. The book will keep you wanting to read more the further you get into it. As you continue to find out about Bilbo's exciting adventure, you will find that you have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the first book to delve into the world popularized in The Lord of the Rings, in which the reader's focus is on hobbits, a race comprised of homebodies with large furry feet and a decided lack of ambition.Bilbo Baggins is one of the least adventurous of hobbits, and is less than pleased when Gandalf the Wizard appears and twists his arm into embarking on a quest with a gaggle of rambunctious dwarves. But embark he reluctantly does, and what follows is an adventure that is far more charming, if less epic, than the pomp-laden Rings trilogy.Tolkien presents his own twist on existing mythologies and fairy tales, giving us a game of riddling and presenting, for the first time, in-depth cultures that defined orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves and humans under a unifying concept that has lasted for well over a half-century (and counting).Okay, okay, so this book is important in the annals of fantasy. But is it a good read?Yes.Tolkien has taken all of this in-depth detail and hung it on a time-honored plot that will never get old. Bilbo is the unlikely, reluctant adventurer who finds within himself the capacity to be a hero, overcoming various obstacles to a climax involving a firebreathing dragon (the evil Smaug). Stories don't get any more exciting than this, and the details that are Tolkien's trademark add a layer of depth and texture that help to bring this world to life.If you are considering reading the Lord of the Rings because the movies made such a big splash, or have already started that trilogy but been turned off by the weightiness, I urge you to start with the Hobbit. It is clean, easy reading that really inspired everything that came after it. The trilogy is everything that a Tolkien fan could want, but The Hobbit is what makes Tolkien fans happen."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The HobbitI read the Hobbit bt J.R.R. Tolkien. It only took a couple of days for me because it was definately a oage turner. If you like stories of good versus evil and stories of adventure than this is a book for you. The Hobbit is probably my favorite book of all time. If you read the Lord of the Rings trilogy than you should the hobbit. The trilogy takes place after The Hobbit, and if you read The Hobbit it puts things together that you didn't realize in the trilogy.

The story takes place in Bag-End in the hobbits hole on the hill. Long ago in a mystical time of goblins and dragons.Some of the most impoutant ebents in the story were when the dwarves and the wizard came in to Bilbo's house and asked him to go on a adventure with them. also when the characters were going through the Misty Mountains they goy into some trouble with goblins, that is also when Bilbo got the ring from Gollum that saved his life so many times afterwards. Then they go to Beorn's cabin in the woods and stay there for a while he gives them supplies and they go on. They make it to the edge of Mirkwoodwere the wizard leaves them there to go on there own. They have troubles with spiders and elves while going through Mirkwood. Then they fimally get to Smaug and can't figure out how to kill him and get their treasure. The conflict in the story is that during their whole entire journey they run into goblins and things that are bak and evil. The theme of the story is that even if you are small you can make a big difference.In the book Bilbo is a small little Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"So begins one of the greatest books of this century. The amazing journey of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire who sets out on a quest to the Lonely Mountain. Tolkien spent years perfecting his world of Middle Earth creating characters, languages, and stories that revolutionized not only the Fantasy genre, but literature as we know it. Beautifully written, and absolutely imaginative, readers will be enthralled as they read of dragons and wizards, treasure and riddles. Peter Jackson brought the trilogy to life, but if you want the complete tale from the beginning you will find no children's book better than 'The Hobbit.' A must for every home library!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I approached The Hobbit at the age of 25. Never having read anything by Tolkien and being recently uninspired by the overrated trilogy, I decided to read for myself--what's the big deal here?The Hobbit is not a comfort book for me. Since I didn't read it as a child, I don't have fond memories to draw me back. I can, however, somewhat empathize with those who do read and re-read this charming tale.The Hobbit takes the reader on a trip over wide landscapes, mostly from the perspective of a gentle nobody, Bilbo Baggins. Tolkien works hard to reveal characters as different types of people. Hobbits, Dwarves, Wizards, Dragons, Trolls, Goblins, Eagles, Wolves, Elves, Spiders, and Humans all represent some type of human condition. The young reader of The Hobbit will not realize that he or she is quite possibly being exposed to every type of person he or she will ever meet. Let us thank Tolkien.Tolkien gives the same breadth to the landscapes of adjacent but strange lands and the inhabitants therein. The land fits into Tolkien's environmentalist sensibility very pointedly. That is, this isn't a purely fantastical story--neither is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--and that's what makes Tolkien's work so wonderful. Like C.S. Lewis--they were friends, in fact--Tolkien is able to pour morality, politics, philosophy, and spirituality into his works without mocking or tricking the reader.If you have not read The Hobbit, please do. You'll enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This was an amazing prequel to the well known Lord of the Ring trilogy.

I had to read this book over the summer for an English class, and I have to say, I had my doubts before I even bought it. I'm not too big into the fantasy genre--I still haven't read the Harry Potter books, and I stopped with Tolkien's works after I read The Hobbit. As I began to read the book, I felt myself drifting off and not thinking about the book. I just could not get into it. By the middle, I was forcing myself to pay attention, but still, I was unsuccessful. I finally managed to finish the book, and all I could think of, was that I was glad it was over with.

Everyone else seemed to love them and I kind of felt left out, so I asked my cousin, a big fan, to explain them to me. He told me to go read The Hobbit.I gave this book a concerted effort, and after plodding through for its 300 pages, I still didn't like it and I'm still pretty confused. The hobbit and these elf guys get together, wander around for most of the book, fight off a few evil things and come back home. I think the reason so many men like this stuff whereas it's harder for some women to get into it is because this is the ultimate appeal to men's hunter instincts. They love stuff like this, chasing around things and fighting things and going off wandering in the woods. I guess I'm the woman who would rather be back gathering berries and looking after the kids. If you don't like Lord of the Rings, chances are you won't like the books either. To all the girls out there who just don't &quot;get&quot; Lord of the Rings, you're not alone!That being said, I'm glad I stuck with this book and read it to the end, if only because so many other books, TV shows, even everyday conversations refer to it. I am reading Stephen King's The Stand right now and he mentions The Hobbit. In fact he says The Hobbit inspired him to write The Stand.

Throughout this book, Mr.Baggins undergoes many adventures, accompanied by thirteen dwarves and, for some of the way, a wizard. His companions and himself are heading towards a mountain of gold, with a dragon waiting at the end. When finally reaching their destination, they do not know exactly what they will find. Mr. Baggins uses his magical ring, which makes him invisible, to investigate on what they are up against. Well, things are easier said than done. Actually killing the dragon was completely out of their league, so they hid and waited for the right moment. When they couldn't stand hiding any longer, they came out, expecting to be burned by the dragon's flames. To their pleasant surprise, they found that the dragon had been killed by townspeople the night before. Thinking that left the gold to them, they celebrated. Around a week later though, they went into war to claim the riches all to themselves. Winning the war didn't do too much, since they had to spare part of the gold to their alliances. When the adventure of his lifetime was drawn to an end, Mr.Baggin headed back to the center of his motivation, home sweet home. A year had passed since he had left his hobbit hole, and he could have wished for nothing more than to be back in his cozy little home."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"this was one of the most boring books i have ever read. i finished reading the book because i had to ( i was going to have a test on it). i still failed the test b/c i hated the book so much. i could not get into the novel and the characters just bored me to death. there was no point and i dont see what is so great about the novel"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This has to be the absolute WORST piece of &quot;literature&quot; I have ever read.

He is small and furry but acts quite human. He lives in a little house in the side of a hill and he treasures his home, his quiet, his regular meals, and his boring life. Then one day an ancient magician, Gandalf, appears at his door. He starts Bilbo on a fantastic adventure.This adventure mainly has to do with a group of dwarves who used to live in a fantastic kingdom underneath a huge mountain far away, where they would mine for gold and precious gems and turn them into lovely works of art. At the height of their power, a dragon swooped in, killed the dwarves inside of the mountain, scattered the rest, and took up residence inside the mountain, hoarding all of the gold and gems for itself.One of the dwarves who shows up on Bilbo's doorstep after Gandalf's visit is the grandson of the king under the mountain. He is determined to get his rightful kingdom back, by journeying to the mountain and getting rid of the dragon.Gandalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is a brilliant burglar and will make an excellent addition to their traveling company, and the dwarves bring the timid creature along with some reluctance. Over the course of their long journey, though, as the mountain gets closer and the dangers get worse, the company learns to respect Bilbo more, and he learns what he is truly capable of achieving.This story contains lots of plot twists and dangerous situations. I can also appreciate that much of today's fantasy has built off of what Tolkien wrote. However, I hated the story. I found it mind-numbingly dull. There was little character development, especially in the dwarves. They had no individual personalities, which made me unconcerned for their well-being. I thought Bilbo was one of the most irritatingly weak and whiny characters in all of literature, which made me even less concerned about this story having a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I borrowed this book from the library as an audiobook, read by Rob Inglis, 10 CD disks. Unabridged by \\"Recorded Books Presents\\".I have seen (and liked) the Lord of the Rings Movies, but I have never read any of the books. I heard that the Hobbit movie was coming out soon, so I thought it would be a good idea to read the book now, before the movie comes out. Apart from the movies, I didn't know anything about this story. It was definitely all-new to me.When I first started listening to it I said \\"Oh GAWD, is he really going to sing and recite poetry for 5 minutes straight\\"? Really, I wasn't sure why there was this need for singing and poetry, and it was boring, and felt endless, and it didn't really progress the story along. The story itself was a bit slow. The narrator was talking about how EVERY character was feeling and I remember asking myself \\"is that really necessary?\\" Why go into so much detail? Really. It started out quite dull.Then as it went along it started getting better. Once I realized that every creature and animal in the story could talk, including spiders and eagles. I also realized that this was a children's story. A really sophisticated, long, serious children's story, but it's definitely easy enough for 10 and 11 year old kids to understand. Plus, there is a certain amount of silliness, and strange word use (I kept asking \\"is this a REAL word?\\" even though I never looked them up), so I think kids will like it.There is also a lot of talk about FOOD - whether they are hungry, and want to be home with the hot teapot or a creature is planning to eat them - it seems like any animal can eat you and you can eat it. I thought that was strange, because ,I wouldn't want a spider to eat me, (not that it could, but still). It was strange that anyone could be PREY to anyone else, but oh well, that was part of the imagination of the story.Once their quest really got going, it wasn't so bad. They go through many lands and much turmoil to get to the end of their quest. It seems like they're always ALMOST killed (and/or eaten), but thankfully, luck helps them escape. Plus, it's in this story that Bilbo the hobbit finds the magic ring of invisibility, even though Sauron doesn't come looking for it.I think it helped to have watched the movies first because it really helped me see the characters of the dwarfs, the elves, the men, and of course the hobbits.I do like that the story doesn't end at the mountain (if you read it you'll know what I mean), but that the authors tells you what happens 5 days after, a few weeks after, and almost a year (or many years) after. It's nice to see that after all that hard work and danger and struggle, there is peace after all. It gives a good ending to the story.One of the things Tolkein does that I don't remember seeing in other children's books, is he talks directly to the audience, almost through the voice of the reader. For example, \\"And then, well, I'll tell you what will happen next, but right now we have to go back to _______ 's story.\\" So if a parent was reading this story to their child, it sounds like the PARENT is saying that they'll have to stop.Inglis did a good job reading the story. He did many of the accents, and they were quite different, and I think he did them well. He also actually SANG all the songs in the story, and for a narrator to do that, I think he should get bonus points!Would I recommend this book? Sure, just to a younger audience, one that has patience to get through it. It's not a short book. It took me a week and a half to listen to it, so I think it will take at least 2 or 3 weeks to read through on your own. But I think they'll like it.For adults, it's okay, not quite there, but not terrible.Am I glad I read this before the movie came out?

It was amazing&#8230;I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s a choice for the tween population mostly because at times it seemed a little childish for an adult, but at others I wouldn&#8217;t allow my six year old cousin to read it. If you are going to read this with your child you should know there are pitch-black scenes with goblins and trolls in scary caves, the dwarves and Bilbo get captured a couple times which included being whipped once, strung upside-down and almost cooked at one point, and even Gollum has a conversation with himself and decides whether or not he should eat Bilbo! Along with that there is a war that happens which can get gory at times, and a fight with some huge spiders and evil wolves.The ring in this book has such wild powers and to see a hobbit, a simple and small creature, show as much courage and bravery, along with all the action-packed scenes, fascinating imagery, magic and a bit of underlying comedy makes this a classic that anyone will enjoy.

Perhaps you feel ordinary, don't let that stop you from having an adventure. Go with Bilbo on his journey and cheer him on. Treat everyone you meet with caution and courtesy--you don't always know if they will be friend or foe.

Please dont take any offense to my opinion, for they are not directed to offend anyone else. Tolkien had an extremley strong beginning.Learning about Bilbo and all the dwarves really drew me into the story. I absolutely loved the detail the author put in all the characters. It really helped paint a picture for me to capture the essence of the story. As the story continued on, my excitement started to linger off. I wasn't as excited about the dwarves and Bilbo. I think those challenges they faced definitely could had a stronger build up to that point where the problem comes into effect.The one thing that upset me the most was the ending. Throughout the entire story the author talks about Bilbo facing the dragon alone. You can assume that something will happen to the dwarves that caused Bilbo to defeat Smaug single handed. The truth of the matter is, the dwarves sent Bilbo in alone because they were cowards and didn't want to do the dirty work. Then some random guy named Bard from the lake town ends up defeating Smaug and throws the whole story out of whack. The dwarves are clueless for a long time about the death of Smaug, and the switch of tenses can definitely end up confusing the reader.All in the entire of the story as a whole fits the fantasy genre. There are high and low points but the journey the characters face, and the overall moral of the story will leave a lasting impression on me."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Being among the last people in America to read this book, as I well may be, makes this a rather difficult book to judge, particularly since it is already recognized as a classic and has been published in many, including collector, editions. Add to that the fact that, with such a long and exalted history and with so many previous reviews, it is readily apparent that nobody really cares, nor should they care, what I may think of this book. Nevertheless: I read it. So, like Bilbo Baggins, I must persist.Let me begin by saying that I have never read, nor do I ever expect to read, another tome by an author with such a fertile and expansive imagination. The depth and detail of his prose is truly astonishing. Using his imagination, he has woven an intricate mythical tale of trials, tribulations, despair, fear, struggle, and ultimate success such that one would almost believe that the author, himself, must surely have been there and experienced the scenes which he portrays.What struck me most about the book, however, was that the author's creativity allowed him to take so many well known characters from mythology -- trolls, elves, dwarves, goblins, etc. -- and weave them into a cohesive story with no loose ends sticking out, but he always did it with an unexpected twist. The golden ring which allowed Bilbo Baggins to disappear at will is a good example. Strangely enough, Baggins could not be seen at night, but, while still invisible during daylight, he had to be careful because his shadow could still be seen. The trolls are another: fearsome at night or in the dark but turned to stone if touched by sunlight. The author's ability to empathize with his characters also seems uncanny. The dreaded Gollum, for example, who lived for so long in absolute blackness and solitude that he became two distinct personalities and spoke to and answer himself in riddles. The final twists came at the end when quite unexpectedly, after all their struggles, Baggins and his companions didn't even get to do battle with the fearsome dragon they had come so far to slay. And the coup de grace came with the unexpected events at Baggins homecoming, which also seemed quite fitting and brought a chuckle or two.Needless to say: I was well impressed with this book and would recommend it, especially to younger readers. (My daughter says that she was tasked to read it in the fifth or sixth grade.) To me this is the ultimate in creative writing and always with an added twist."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Doug Anderson does a wonderful job fleshing out background information,explaining Tolkien's mythology, presenting a wide range of art works and much more in a format that is easy to read and easy to use.

It is quick paced and very entertaining, a pleasurable respite from the often bogged down with hidden meanings of what too frequently passes for literature. I'm not trying to denegrate some high-class piece of thought-provoking insight, some Don DeLillo, some Thomas Pynchon, some William Gaddis, et. al. But how often have you picked up a book and become absorbed with a story, with what's going to actually happen next without the instrusion of some pretentious, philosophical meandering? It is a break for the serious-minded high art fan, a great read to the lowly John Grisham afficinado. All in all, a wonderful passage of time, transported to a magical place almost too real for the span of time you are being a voyuer, watching and waiting some never was characters fight never was creatures in a fundamentally never was land in this imaginative terrain that you have to believe in for such a short period of time.

First time readers would be better served to get one of the non-annotated ones and familiarze themselves with Tolkeins world. Oh! And read 'The Lord of the Rings' as well before you attempt reading 'The annotated Hobbit'.I have read a lot of annotated books over the years and I have to say that this one is one of the most seamlessly done. Understandably, as you try to read the comments you lose some of the continuity of the text, but they are usually so informative that you gain more than you lose by reading them. Some of the notes are written for the more scholarly inclined, some are just plain amusing.A great bonus is the collection of illustrations from all over the world....giving an insight as to how different cultures see the same objects. That was the beauty of the old books...you had to imagine the scenes. That beauty is forever sullied now as everyone is going to see Tolkein's characters as they appear in the (very bad) movie adaptations of the 'Lord of the Rings'.All in all, if you already have a version of the 'Hobbit', buy this book. It is one of those books that will reward repeated readings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bilbo Baggins, one of the small, fat persons called hobbits, is just minding his buisness one day when 14 dwarves arrive for breakfast! Little did Bilbo know what was in store for him. Soon Bilbo was away on a weird adventure, the story in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.I liked this book because it had great characters which were described with great detail. You can see the great detail in this excerpt: &quot; They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves... They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colors (chiefly green and yellow)&quot;. I liked the fact that the author described his characters with great detail. It makes the story able to come alive in your head, which helps me to understand it and be &quot;drawn in&quot; to the book.I also liked that there was an incredible amount of adventure. You can see adventure in this excerpt: &quot; It is almost dark so that its vastness can be only dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of Smaug!&quot;. The adventure also makes you become &quot;drawn into&quot; the book. It makes this book a real page-turner. It also explains the characters a little bit more by how they react to situations that have high-pressure.Although this book has excellent description, I was sometimes frustrated by the lack of suspense, especially in the beginning. You can see a little bit of dullness in this excerpt: &quot;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous,&quot;.

Yet The Hobbit deserves almost as much praise as that most incredible of adventures. Not only that but it is vital that The Hobbit is read prior to tackling Lord of the Rings, as it is really the first book of four not the pre-cursor to the trilogy.Having said that though, it is also improtant to note that The Hobbit does have a very different feel to it when compared to Lord of the Rings. This tale is far more light-hearted and filled more with boyhood dreams of adventure. Lord of the Rings on the other hand is a story of war that centres around the ring of power owned now by the Baggins'.The Hobbit is a must read for any Fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition.

The Hobbit I just reread for at least the third time, and it is well-written. By the time one comes to The Return of The King, his prose is stilted, seeming to mimic Malory's Morte d'Arthur and deserve the same kind of criticism Mark Twain wrote regarding Fenimore Cooper. Also, if anyone notices these things, in The Fellowship Sauron seems unaware of the existence of the ring, and doesn't know whether Gollum or Bilbo have it, and can't find the Shire. By the time the Return of The King was written, Sauron's existence depended on the Ring and he vanished when it was destroyed. I am not quoting but Gandalf does not seem to think the Ring is essential at first to Sauron's power but would prove disastrous in his possession, while later to destroy it is to destroy Sauron. Also he seems to know where Frodo is at the last when Frodo dons it. This may seem subtle to some, but you can't actually have it both ways. It seems as though Tolkien changed his own ideas about the nature and power of the ring, but never went back and revised his text.Him they sent thither. Sore hard were their travails. And thus he spake... this Malory pastiche belongs in the 16th century, or in Dante Gabriel Rosseti, but not in the 20th. I am surprised so many are sucked in by it. Still, \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\" finds Tolkien back in his best story-telling mode and sections like this make for great reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"i think Bilbo was a nice character in this story.

Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In his book, The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien does a masterful job of telling the story of the Bilbo Baggins and his adventures with the dwarves. Though The Hobbit is an outstanding piece of writing by itself, it has far more depth behind it than just a fanciful tale. The Hobbit is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings saga--though it was written last--and is written from a unique standpoint that is not familiar to the other books.The Hobbit, though written by Tolkien, is portrayed as being written from the perspective of Bilbo and is titled There and Back Again by the hobbit. This is an extremely interesting vantage point given to the reader as they receive first-hand account from Bilbo on all of the situations as well as have the chance to experience his thoughts on the adventures. This gives readers the feeling that they are actually being told an account of actual occurrences and they get to feel everything that Bilbo does during each exciting encounter, as well as his evolution from a simple hobbit into a \\"burglar\\". Tolkien authenticates that Bilbo is the author by adding in personal commentary on the side such as \\"You can believe me when I say that,\\" and \\"That I can assure you\\". Through Bilbo, Tolkien describes the melancholy, comfortable life led by most all hobbits and how they shunned any sort of adventure. He then proceeds to show throughout the story how Bilbo gains confidence as well as a love for adventure that turns him into an almost unrecognizable character by the end of the book.Another aspect of the book that added to its effectiveness as a whole was its actual content. Since the book was written last in the series, fans would have had questions as to how the ring of power came into the picture before the release of The Hobbit. This book not only entertains readers with constant action and suspense but introduces the origin of the ring and how Bilbo attained it in Golum's lair. It also goes further into depth and shows how Bilbo received his sword, Sting, and gave it its name as well as his mithril armor, both of which he passes down to Frodo--his nephew--in The Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien also does an excellent job at describing the times in which the book is set in. To someone who just picked up the book without foreknowledge of the Lord of the Rings would find it extremely bizarre that animals can talk and how the dragons and goblins and dwarves and hobbits come into the story. However, the manner in which Tolkien casually describes and introduces these characters gives the reader the perception that it is totally normal for such things to be in Middle Earth. To one who has read all of the books related to the Lord of the Rings as well as prequels to them, such as The Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin, one can identify the time in which the story is set and how things changed between the time of The Hobbit and that of the start of the Lord of the Rings.The Hobbit is a work of literature that is entertaining enough in itself to cause anyone reading Tolkien's series for the first time to become absorbed in it, yet at the same time the book has enough detail and depth that one who has read all of the related books will find themselves enthralled and deeply satisfied at the book's conclusion."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I must have bought my paperback edition (Ballantine Books) back in 1966 when this particular edition came out. The pages are yellowed and dog earred and yet, I can read the pages of this edition. I still love the maps of the Wilderland and Desolation of Smaug. I still have the cover, although it's long since detached itself from the book binding. But now that I know there's an annotated Hobbit--well, perhaps it's time for a new edition.I always knew there was something different about the Hobbit from The Lord of the Rings.After reading some of the reviews, my mind has been set at ease. It's simply, Hobbit was written for children, The Lord of the Rings for adults. (although in my opinion older chldren could love both of them. If they can plough through 900 pages of Harry Potter books, they certainly can read LOTR.The Hobbit is simply delightful. What's a hobbit? A small creature around waist high (maybe) who adores pipes, good food and comfort. He has furry toes and goes barefoot.One day, when Bilbo Baggins (hobbit) was ejoying the things hobbits enjoy, Gandolph the Gray (wizard) comes calling to invite Bilbo on an adventure. Bilbo is reluctant. No adventures for him. Hobbits simply do not like adventures. But, to get rid of the pest and enjoy his creature comforts once again, he agrees. Hoping that Gandolph and his friends that would be coming would NOT come.Not so. The next day, one by one, twelve dwarves and finally Gandolph spill into Bilbo'shouse. And, so begins the adventure, which lead them to a dragon called Smaug, the dwarves stolen treasure and a ring, which Bilbo wins in a contest from a cave dwelling creature named Gollum. The ring sets off the trilogy LOTR.The book was written in 1937 by J.R.R. Tolkien who taught at Pembrooke College, Oxford, from 1925 unti 1945. His specialty was Anglo-Saxon and then as Merton Professor of English Language and Literature. Other works include: Farmer Giles of Ham, The Adventures of 'Tom Bombadil and LOTR. He has a marvelous sense of humor, even when things seem the blackest.Bilbo's role as a \\"burgler\\" is hilarious. And even though Bilbo is no burgler, he seems to fall into the role every time the dwarves end up in trouble.I give this five stars because I love it and it really is a classic.Patricia A.

The journey, it would seem, ends with the boat to beyond the sea in the 3d volume but to fully claim a share in Tolkien's Middle Earth is to go back to the 'history' of this magical world. Tolkien provides such a history in a 5th book which is just as, or even more, magical than the first four books.

As each of my childred reached the age of five I would carefully tuck them in and then together we would imbark upon this most amazing adventure.

But perhaps the greatest joy is seeing the excited look on the face of my child as Bilbo first tricks theTrolls or when he first steals the ring of Gollum in the caves of the Goblins and certainly the climatic event of the burglary into the den of the sleeping Smaug, the dragon who awaits all of them under the mountain.

Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

Though it may seem a little slow-moving at first, it is actually an excellent adventure story, though perhaps a bit much for younger children to attempt to read for themselves. (However, reading it aloud to them is strongly recommended!) Bilbo is a likable character, easy to relate to, because all of us want to go out and have adventures and slay dragons, and yet we also enjoy the comforts of home a bit too much. Gandalf is appropriately mysterious and yet somehow feels like a loving grandfather, and the Dwarves are endearing and bring a smile to your face.

A somewhat self-centered but likable fellow with aspirations that rarely extends beyond a good pipe or his next meal, thrust without warning nor apology into a quest on par with those he would spin tales of over the course of an evening after dinner. There is no prolonged set-up inThe Hobbit. The author starts us off with a brief introduction and immediately proceeds to completely foul up his protagonist's current life and foreseeable future by commandeering him on the afore-mentioned quest. Thus the fun begins.Along the way Bilbo (a very small man, in both stature and mindset, and one with no desire to change either - thank you very much!) meets trolls and orcs and goblins and a even a huge, very old, and verrrry greedy red dragon who has no taste for thieves, but a taste for hobbits. Bilbo is so far out of his league, and caught up in world events of a world he had rather wished NOT to know of that it is a wonder he stays sane at all through his perilous journey \\"there and back again.\\"Everyone should read this book. Tolkien scoots us along (much faster than his drawlingThe Lord of the Ringspace) in a delightful fantasy filled with magic and wizards and creatures great and small, dangling us precariously sometimes over the edge of a few intersecting plot points (like snapping alligators in a pit) only to not-so-politely dump us off safe and snug at home once again with a few extra coins in our pockets and a lifetime of fresh stories to tell to everyone who was too timid to take the journey with us (and our strange new friends).This book is a classic because it is easy to read, enchanting, and fun. It started the whole of 'Middle Earth' which in-turn begat the whole of fantasy role playing (an annually multi-billion dollar industry now). This is the Bible of modern fantasy, and one that will make your children laugh and cry and remember the tales contained herein long into their adulthood.

Tolkien is commonly referred as a classic. While this is an often over-used term, it definitely applies in this case. Of the four books Tolkien is known for primarily, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", \\"The Return of the King\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\", this is the most satisfying. I t introduces and sets up key characters for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy consisting of the three books previously named.In Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the principle races are men, elves and dwarves. There also goblins (orcs), giants dragons, wizards and assorted odd characters and fantastic beasts. Then there are hobbits who have as little to do with the rest of Middle-Earth as possible.They like it that way.Hobbits are interested in green growing things, eating and smoking pipe weed. When they aren't being industrious, they enjoy their comforts. They are very short in stature and move through the woods efficiently and silently. This isn't so they can sneak up on someone so much as it is to stay out of adventures.Of these conservative, predictable folk, there is one Bilbo Baggins. The Bagginses are prosperous and respectable as hobbits go. Which means Bilbo is perfectly happy leading his boring comfortable life. The only mild eccentricity noted in Bilbo's line is he's related to the Tooks through his mother. Tooks had been known to get into little adventures from time to time and as such were of questionable respectability.Central to this connection is Gandalf the Grey, a wizard. For some reason he has developed a curiosity and a fondness for these little people. Maybe it\`s because in his adventure-filled life, it's nice to have a little peace and quiet. Gandalf is also renowned for his fireworks of which everyone enjoys.One day the family friend shows up on Bilbo's doorstep. Shortly after this, Bilbo finds himself hosting not just Gandalf but also twelve dwarves lead by Thorin Oakenshield. Not long after this, Bilbo finds himself \`assigned' to this motley crew as a \\"Burglar\\". They are on a quest to recover Thorin's lost fortune.This is when the book really begins. This is a journey tale. That means Bilbo goes through transformation in the process of this quest. Relationships are developed and tested in a way none can predict. This being a fantasy they see and do fantastic things.Eventually Bilbo returns home no longer respectable.

I disagree wholeheartedly. Although there are elements of children's fantasy tales in the text, the themes and actions of \\"The Hobbit\\" are much more oriented to adults.I won't waste time rehashing plot points with this iconic text; instead I will focus on some features that stuck out to me.First off, if one is familiar with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I think their reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" will yield some interesting insights and they will catch some details that people not familiar with LOTR would miss. One can read, and greatly enjoy, \\"The Hobbit\\" as a standalone text, but I think it is much better when considered within the framework of LOTR.Another observation that surprised me was just how unlikeable the dwarves are in this book. Tolkien frequently mentions in his other works that dwarves are foolish and selfish, and usually only do good works when prompted by circumstance, but on this reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" they greatly annoyed me. Perhaps because of how much they remind me of most of humanity. And maybe that was Tolkien's intent? An allegory for how humanity often only makes the right choice when goaded into it, as opposed to it being our first and natural instinct.Although there are moments in the text that are a little slow going, they are few and far between, and Tolkien focuses much less on the minutia of detail about Middle Earth in this book as opposed to some of his others. I had also forgotten how action packed the last 100 pages or so of \\"The Hobbit\\" are. I was recently arguing with a friend that the decision to make the films of \\"The Hobbit\\" a trilogy was just greed as the book could not support 3 films. I was wrong, if the movies are well done, there is more than enough in this text to justify three films.This rereading of \\"The Hobbit\\" has made me want to jump back into Middle Earth, and I sense that I will be picking up and rereading more of Tolkien in the very near future. As for \\"The Hobbit\\", I will gladly revisit Bilbo Baggins and his adventures again and again over the course of my lifetime.

I'm glad I did. Tolkien's writing is fantastic. His authorial interventions give the book a good dose of humor and set up the tension for the story very well. Gollum emerges as a well-defined character right from the start. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter is definitely the highlight of the book.I had a few issues with the book. Some of the resolution to the story isn't as satisfying as I'd like (certain actions are done \\"off screen\\" and other actions are performed by minor characters that we haven't followed on the adventures). There are so many characters (specifically dwarfs), that very few leave a real lasting impression. The book doesn't line up very well with the sequel, but I guess that is more the problem for the sequel.In the end I was surprised how much I got sucked into the book and the writing right away.

Those who like all sorts of fictional novels probably enjoyed reading this book, however, it may have not been all that great for the trekkies who are more into sci-fi.JRR Tolkien has a distinct way of describing the characters and environments in his books. Since he is very descriptive, the scenes are fairly easy to get a handle on despite the fact that the book was written more than seventy years ago and that he writes with a unique European dialect, as does JK Rowling, the author of the famous Harry Potter book series. Both books are of British origin.The author of The Hobbit also has a knack for symbolism. The gold that the main characters are after represents happiness, and all the obstacles they have to face, such as the evil goblins, Mirkwood Forest, and of course, the dragon at the very end, represent the many hardships and barriers we all must face in our pursuit of happiness. On the other hand, there are also many things that help us along that path, like Beorn the skin-changer, or the elves of the Last Homely House.To sum up, this was an all around great book.

Tolkien displays a magnificent tale of a little person on a big adventure. The Hobbit tells about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with many perils. A hobbit is a creature that is about three feet tall. They don't wear shoes because the bottom of their feet is leathery. The top of their feet are covered in thick hair.Bilbo Baggins is the main character in the book. He goes on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a wizard. It all started when Bilbo was sitting outside of his house enjoying some tea when an old wizard walked up to his hobbit-hole, and asked if Bilbo would like to go on an adventure. Bilbo was taken aback and said he would never want to go on adventure. Then, Bilbo abruptly got up and ran inside his house and locked the door. Bilbo then firmly told the wizard to leave. The wizard just smirked and scratched a symbol on Bilbo's newly painted green door.The next day Bilbo heard a knock at his door, when he opened it he saw a dwarf standing there. The dwarf said, \\"Dwalin at your service!\\" Bilbo was shocked. He had never seen a dwarf before. Bilbo remembered his manners when he saw the dwarf and said, \\"Sorry to keep you waiting!\\" After a while, all of the dwarf's friends showed up. They all convinced Bilbo to go on their adventure with them. So he did. Bilbo was faced with many perils on the journey and overcame all of them.Overall, the book is excellent and full of heart-stopping danger.

Highly recommmended."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is probably the most underrated of all Tolkien's writings and it is not hard to see why. Hobbit is written in the style of a book for children and consequently, many people set it aside after the first few chapters. What a mistake! For Hobbit may be childlike in its writing style (in fact, children enjoy reading it tremendously) but there is nothing childish about it. On the face of it, Hobbit is the tale of an adventurous treasure hunt, sprinkled with wizards, dwarves, elves, dragons and of course hobbits. In actuality however, slotted (chronology-wise) between the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings (LOTR), Hobbit sets the stage for the climactic struggle with Sauron in LOTR. In fact, Gandalf in LOTR refers to the events in the Hobbit, both the finding of the Ring of Power and the destruction of Smaug. As compared to LOTR, Hobbit is a sunnier book, with hints of troubled times, yet filled with humor and adventurous optimism; hence perhaps its appeal to children too. For fans of LOTR, Hobbit is a must. It answers a lot of questions that LOTR raises about prior events. Do not get put off by its apparent lightness and you will find it rewarding. Ideally, read Silmarillion first, then Hobbit and finally LOTR. But even if (as most people) you first read LOTR, Silmarillion and Hobbit will still delight you. The Leatherette edition is particularly good with quality binding, paper and illustrations and would make a great gift."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Adventure, great plot, and likeable characters are all key factors in making &quot;The Hobbit&quot; an entertaining piece of literature. Bilbo Baggins is a character of many possibilities, he grows throughout the entire novel, from a homebody to a well-known hero. To read any of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, is an adventure within itself, for each of his books are connected. His talent for story-telling along with his creative nature have pieced together &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a story, later followed by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series.This 272 page novel tells an interesting tale of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a journey with his dwarven friends. Bilbo knows very little of the outside world, he has lived in the same area for over 50 years. As the reader should notice as the book progresses, Mr. Baggins is taking steps. Bilbo is slowly transforming from an quiet nobody, to a humble hero.I am rating this novel a 5 out of 5, because I found nothing that I disliked. The great plot, pleasant characters, and the fascinating adventure, each play their parts and keep the reader locked."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"honestly, havent finished the book yet... im halfway done but having read half of the work, i can already say how good the book is and i have already become a big fan of tolkien, and it encouraged me to read more of his works... so rare can one see a book as good as this..."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"During the course of our English Independent Reading Project, I have read the book, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a fantasy story about a group of dwarves, Thorin Oakenshield, and Bilbo Baggins that must journey to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the land of the dwarves. The group must be very courageous to overcome the dangers of their trip as they encounter goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. It is the teamwork and courage that finally gets them to Smaug, the great golden-red fire dragon, who is terrorizing the entire countryside.In The Hobbit, Smaug is controlling the land of the dwarves, finally the dwarves decided to take back their land and restore their homeland. They needed a little help, Gandalf had decided Bilbo Baggins was the perfect hobbit for the job, he would be the thief. Bilbo Baggins was a quiet peaceful little hobbit. All he wanted was to be left alone to his beautiful hobbit hole where he could eat lots of meals and smoke his pipe. Bilbo heard a knock on the door and before long he had thirteen dwarves and one wizard sitting at his table and eating all his food, it was then, without a choice, that Bilbo was the final man for the trip. As the journey started it seemed so simple because the great wizard, Gandalf was along. As soon as they were left to travel alone, they got themselves in a bit of trouble. They worked together to find their way and save each other from dangers. They met trolls who wanted to eat them, goblins who ate their horses and wanted them dead. Giant spiders that wrapped them up in a web so fast that only Bilbo had enough courage to fight them off. It was also Bilbo alone that had to confront the great dragon Smaug, the terror of the countryside.As expected, there is a lot of action that goes on in The Hobbit-such as when giant spiders became very angry because they could not see Bilbo, due to the ring, but could hear him making fun of them, calling the spiders \\"attercops\\". Bilbo is fearful of these spiders but he still finds the courage to sing \\"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me! Attercop! Attercop! Won't you stop, stop you spinning and look for me?\\" Bilbo found himself running around being chased, singing songs to get the spiders away from the dwarves, who are hanging on a limb of a tree from a web, cutting down the webs that the spiders are wrapping around the trees to trap Bilbo in, and killing these spiders all at the same time. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across dark spaces. Not only that, but as soon as Bilbo had managed to cut down one of the dwarves, who at this point is very weak, the dwarf uses the rest of his strength to help get the others and stop the spiders. The Hobbit uses great detail. J.R.R. Tolkien really knew how to explain action seens so that a person could visually imagine them, probably almost to what the author wanted them to be portrayed as. Tolkien, gets you right into the story in the first chapter, introducing main characters and explaining the conflict. Tolkien starts his action off simple, with a confrontation with trolls, and ends with big action, like the big fight with Smaug. I believe that while Tolkien is wrote these fantasies, he somewhat relates the ideas of these actions to his life, real life. The Hobbit is a book that really kept my attention, so much was always happening and I didn't want to put the book away.You can see as you read this book, Tolkien wanted the courage of man to stick out, that bravery can get you very far. Don't hold back even is the fear is killing you. Work as a team and never leave anyone behind. Bringing peace and security will be your ultimate reward."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands. Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years. The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today. The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix. You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it. Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down.

I love the simple beginning \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\\" It plays to my curiosity immediately. Bilbo is such a likable character. His initial hesitancy to do anything unexpected is relatable. I think his subconscious sense of adventure lives in a lot of us...in me. While on his journey he realizes what he is capable of. I like how he accidentally saves his traveling companions from perilous situations over and over again coming off as the unlikely hero.The subtle finding of the \\"One Ring\\" was intriguing leading to the introduction of the mysterious creature Gollum. I like his big round pale lamp-like eyes. The game of riddles between Bilbo and Gollum was particularly entertaining while full of angst. His eagerness to eat the juicy \\"scrumptiously crunchable\\" hobbit was creepy.The Battle of Five Armies was swift and exciting. \\"The elves were the first to charge.

This is an exciting journey for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Here are a few words for those of you who have yet to read The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien:Best. Book. Ever.The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is (guess what?) a hobbit. Bilbo lives in his house (which is indeed, a hole) in the Shire alone, and loves the peaceful life. But one day he receives a visit from the wizard Gandalf, and everything changes. Before he knows it, Bilbo is swept up in an adventure he'll never forget.In his quest, Bilbo aids the dwarves from the Lonely Mountain. The home of the dwarves has been taken over by the dragon Smaug, and they cannot face him alone. And so, Bilbo sets off with this group of colorful characters, and their journey leads them through mountain ridges, elven cities, dangerous forests and more, the climax at the end being the great Battle of Five Armies.This book, like all of Tolkiens novels, is exquisite, unique, incredibly well-written...I could go on forever about its greatness. I have read a good many books despite my only fifteen years of age, and for me to pick this one as the best, well, you know it must be good.Even if you are not a fantasy reader, I believe that it's hard not to enjoy this story.

From the moment Gandalf leaves a dent in Bilbo's door to the moment Bilbo hands him the jar, I was rivetted. I took me 6 hours tops to read this book and I knew I was a Tolkien fan for life.

And, like a scant few other people, I have seen the movies (note the sarcasm). In addition to this, I have read numerous Terry Brooks novels which, in my opinion, greatly rival Tolkien in originality and depth.With my esteemed credentials out of the way, here goes...I feel that of all the aforementioned books, the Hobbit is the best. It is an easier read and isn't nearly as deep as LotR, but this does not take away from it in any way. Trust me, I am a HUGE fan of LotR (movies and books), but the Hobbit is a much better read. It has a much more carefree feel to it, as the hero is a bit of a pansy and clutz. While it is obviously fictional due to the Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and Dragons involved, it has a ring of truth to it in that the hero, much like us, oftentimes will be afraid in situations that any normal person would be afraid in. He is no superman.LotR, while I greatly enjoyed it, seemed at times to drag on at times. This is due to the fact that there several tales going on at once, and while it leaves cliffhangers, the transition is often slow. With the Hobbit, I felt that everything was very fresh. There was just one main story and this story was told with enough, but not too much, detail.Many consider the Hobbit to be a great precurser/intro to the LotR. However, I feel that the Hobbit is great as simply a stand-alone novel. After I read the Hobbit, it was several years before I read LotR. I never felt like I was missing something, and as a matter of fact, I didn't even know a thing about LotR before I read it (this was years before the movie). In my mind, the ring was a trinket and Bilbo's tale was done.If your looking for a fun read that is just a little different than that lastest New York Time's Bestseller, then check out the Hobbit.

It would help children to become better writers and want to read other stories.The poems are at times beautiful, fun, creepy but all around magical.

Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it.

Tolkien's The Hobbit may both please and disappoint - the latter, because it is so much lighter, more comedic, less sophisticated, less on the epic scale than LOTR. It is very much a children's book, and one that really should be read aloud in the night to children before bedtime. It is much more lighthearted, and has far fewer truly scary moments. However, it will please those who would like to know more about Hobbits, The Shire, Elves, Dwarves and sundry monstrous creatures that inhabit Middle Earth. The origin of Frodo's orc-detecting sword, Sting, is given; the ancestors (perhaps?) of Shelob are revealed; Bilbo himself, seen only in his great age and not for long in LOTR, is here in the prime of his life and revealing some of the characteristics of practicality and courage that reappear in Frodo. Aside from Ursula K. Le Guin's dragons, which are without parallel, the great Dragon Smaug is among the best I have encountered in fiction, and the description of his loot-filled cave is superb. The lust for gold and jewels experienced by the Dwarves is clearly the precursor of the lethal lust for the One Ring felt by so many in LOTR. Be warned: there is some horror. There is dread and anxiety. The evil creatures of The Hobbit are equally as evil as those in LOTR, but as readers we are less exposed to them, and the mood is soon lightened by the antics of either Bilbo or the Dwarves or both. There is the classic, familiar journey, or Quest; Gandalf fills the role of the wise guide and father-figure (though with less gravitas); there are terrible set-backs, unexpected hurdles, ghastly encounters and a fabulous battle scene, prefiguring the great battles of LOTR. Basically, The Hobbit is LOTR writ small, funnier, lighter and a lot shorter, but no less satisfying as a story for all that."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I bought this book from another seller after Readinggirl never sent my book.

I go through books in different cycles. Sometimes I can't put them down. Sometimes it takes me forever to finish them. In regards to The Hobbit, I can say that I have read and reread this wonderful book many times. While I have read The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and most would curse me in some form of literary blasphemy, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book more than the trilogy. If I remember correctly I've read it about five or six times. (Coming from a very inconsistent reader, it has to be a pretty good recommendation.) While I loved the trilogy, I did find that the pacing of The Hobbit to be much better, and aside from the fact that this book was geared more towards children, I found the story to be exciting and very entertaining to read. (I suppose I am a bit biased since I watched the cartoon movie from when I was a child and this film greatly fascinated me, enough to end up reading the novel.) Regardless of the fact that this novel was geared towards a younger audience, one can't deny that it holds its own as a great tale of adventure and personal growth. Bilbo Baggins' transformation is one that all readers can relate to. One can't deny the impact Tolkien's work has had on the world of literature, and this piece is no exception. In all this book is a wonderful introduction to the world of J. R. R.

I then began the hobbit after seeing the movie and I couldn't stop reading it. It's a classic that I think everyone should be exposed to. The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it read like a children's story and although that may be how it was intended to come across I found it confusing at first.

I agree that this book should not be class reading, not every one reads at the same leval and not everyone can appreciate this form of lituratuer, but Shakspere is no better he totaly bores me.

In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, renowned Oxford professor of ancient languages, created a world so authentic I find it difficult to think of as fantasy. Tolkien used epic language and style when he wrote The Hobbit and the incomparable trilogy that follows it, The Lord of the Rings, as though he was retelling history. Sagacious wizard Gandalf ensnares home-loving hobbit Bilbo on an adventure with thirteen dwarves who venture forth \\"to seek the pale enchanted gold.\\" The dwarves' treasure was stolen by sinister dragon Smaug and now they want vengeance.I think Tolkien's theme of sticking together and helping each other out is timeless. I love the camaraderie between the companions such as when they are feasting at Lake-town. The book is third person limited point of view as told by an anonymous narrator but primarily reflects Bilbo's perspective. The Hobbit is an extremely fast-paced book.

One of the best things about this story is that it is the classic \`slay the dragon' story with more than one twist.A lacking part was defiantly the denouement because at on part the author say \`Bilbo had never stopped to think how the treasure was to be removed' and I just thought that was never dealt with, he just got back to his house \`magically'.So overall I think you should read this book but prepare to be imaginative because this book has suspense in every active and more than one plot twist!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"For over fifty years, THE HOBBIT has been a wonderful introduction to the world of literature. The humorous tone and fantastic imagery of dragons, lost treasure, magic rings and swords adds up to much more than mere entertainment for children: they work to present the timeless themes of heroism and identity.By now, the comfortable life of Mr. Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole at the Shire is quite famously well known. Born into a respectable family and inheriting both his home and country gentleman status, Bilbo sees little need for new experiences. So when the wizard Gandalf brings the thirteen dwarves to Bilbo's home inviting him on a quest to recover a treasure from a fierce dragon, they find Bilbo unwilling to take risk. Moreover he lacks the self confidence to test his way of thinking against the wider world.The small hobbit is surprised to find himself running out the door, without any worldly processions, and leaving his home to set out into the unknown. Thus begins one of the motifs running through out the story; in facing the unexpected an individual discovers new strength. Soon he is confronting dangerous trolls and cruel goblins. When the dwarves prove unable to make good decisions or act effectively, Bilbo must go deep into his inner reserve of courage and common-sense to lead his friends to safety. To the surprise of Bilbo and constant delight of readers; with greater danger comes greater resolve and wisdom to do what must be done.Finally Bilbo enters the heart of the Lonely Mountain and pauses to consider this crucial moment; will he go forward with his plan to confront the dragon Smaug, or turn back out of fear. The decision alone in the tunnel is the defining moment in his ability to shape his identity and assert power over his own fate. What is more Bilbo knows it, and going on in that moment reassures his strength of character for the rest of his life.In presenting his classic story of a small, common person finding identity through heroism and grand adventure, J.R.R. Tolkien gave us a powerful way to learn about ourselves. The book was a favorite of mine growing up and has been a major influence in my writing. I hope you will give this book to a young person and share the magic of literature through this extraordinary adventure.[...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is an increadible tale about a quiet hobbit of the shire who is swept away on a adventure through mountains and forests who meets elves and other friends and other less freindly creatures like goblins and wolves and spiders.

Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins was a home body who liked to stay in the Shire and mind his own business, but after Gandalf showed up on his doorstep with a group of twelve dwarves, he soon became an adventurous and courageous little hobbit. Bilbo was forced into Thorin's, the king of the dwarves, quest for his treasure that was wrongfully taken from him by the evil dragon, Smaug. On their quest for Lone Mountain, Bilbo and his companions were forced to adventure through mountains and valleys, in which they come across giant trolls, nasty goblins, and enormous spiders. With the help of Bilbo and his magical ring he found while being trapped in the darkness of the mountain, the dwarves defeat these evils and continue on their quest for home and riches. These challenges that Bilbo is faced with help build his character in order to prepare him for the battle with the wicked dragon, Smaug. In the end of the story, it is Bilbo alone who must face Smaug and recapture the mountain, while at the same time keeping peace with the armies of men, goblins, and dwarves.In my opinion, The Hobbit is a well written book that is enjoyable and interesting for all who read it. Though it is a children's fantasy, anyone who begins to read it will find themselves spending endless nights reading until morning due to the enjoyment and anticipation for the next scene.

Bilbo is brought along on a quest as a burglar to help Thorin (the main dwarf) and his party re-gains his mountain and treasure from the dragon Smaug.I think this book deserves 5 stars because it was so hard to put down. Bilbo and his party encounter many foes such as giants, goblins, wolves, spiders, Golum, and Smaug himself. Chapter after chapter, Bilbo and the dwarves got into more and more danger and enemies. The Hobbit is a great adventure book and also a prelude to The Lord of The Rings Trilogy.In the chapter Riddles in The Dark, Bilbo discovers the Golum and the ring. Bilbo makes a deal with Goulm. They both will tell each other riddles. If Bilbo wins, Goulm must show him the way out of the mountain. If Golum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Golum loses but won't show him the way out, so Bilbo tries on the ring. He discovers it makes him invisible.

This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I know that over a thousand people have reviewed this wonderful book but I felt so strongly about The Hobbit that I just had to say sonething about it. The Hobbit was and still is a masterpiece, and will remain a masterpiece for centuries to come. One of the main reasons why is that its prose and style of writing is absolutely captivating. It has a simple and delightful charm to it that makes you want to keep on reading. Its plot is also a treat. It is not boring or stale, as I've heard others say, but lively. Also, with this book, there are many coicidences and connections among characters (so what if Bilbo didn't kill Smaug? Think about it. Could a little hobbit really kill a dragon twenty times his size, despite his cunning and discreetness? I don't think so). Best of all, though, it has a sweet message and theme that can actually leave you pondering about it for hours. I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I have to admit that, in my opinion, The Hobbit is better, despite the Trilogy's genius. What can I say? It's an excellent read, and definetly worth your time. The only thing you'll regret is that it will go by too fast.Also, I wanted to comment on the Houghton Mifflin trade paperback edition. It is absolutely beautiful; I believe Alan Lee illustrated the cover. It is very durable, and the paper (I believe) is acid free."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I love the hobbit. i read it in 7 grd. and it was great read it again in 9 grd. is was even better that time.

To those who are young and find it too long, too confusing, too dumb, etc., perhaps you should just stick with Stephen King until you mature a little. Ironic that this book, which was originally intended to be a &quot;kids&quot; book, misses with so many kids...Anyway, I'm 30 and I have been meaning to read Tolkein for years; I'm not a fantasy fanatic (at least not yet) and picked this up a week ago, and I loved it!

I found the fantasy land in which it takes place, Middle Earth, to be extremely well developed. The history of this land was so detailed that it was almost as if you were reading a non-fiction book, except that it was extremely exciting. There have even been a number of atlases published on Middle Earth that, I believe, can be found on Amazon.com. The characters in The Hobbit were very well put together. The only problem I had with this book, at the time that I read it for the first time, was that the characters in some of the parts seemed to all have the same name. You couldn't tell which one was which! Upon reading it a second time, I found that it was much easier to understand. This book was made for children, unlike its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. I loved the suspenseful parts of The Hobbit, such as when Bilbo enters a secret door in The Lonely Mountain to confront Smog for the first time. I really am a fantasy nut, so this review may be a bit of an exaggeration.

The use of his made up elvish language and places were unpronounceable, and often forgotten when they appeared again! However the hobbitt is different!Tolkein at this point has yet to develop much of his literary prose, and deep love for middle earth folklore. Not that those are bad things, but in later writings it becomes too much of a good thing! Character description 's are kept to what is needed, especially for a larger cast as in this book. In fact I would say in lots of ways you were kept wanting more! You are told partial stories, that won't be finished for several decades, weather it's about gollum or the elves.All in all a very good easy read, that while lacks tolkeins rich folklore, does give young readers especially a fun, and enjoyable adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Really enjoyed this!

The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've loved this story since I was a kid, decided to re-read it on kindle.

The Hobbit is a fun read for kids or adults. The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, his trek across the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood and finally to the Lonely Mountain, where he and the Dwarves face Smaug the Dragon will certainly be entertaining for years to come. Now what did become of that magic ring of his?Plot Summary: Bilbo Baggins is overtaken by a party of Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. He is employed as their \\"burglar\\", as they head for the Misty Mountains to rescue the treasure from the Dragon Smaug. On the way they encounter 3 Trolls that try to eat them, but the Trolls end up getting turned into stone, and then they are abducted by Goblins in the Misty Mountains. There Bilbo gets momentarily lost, finds the creature Smeagol and the lost Ring of Power. Escaping Gollum with the Ring and reuniting with the Dwarves on the other side of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo and the Dwarves will then become lost in Mirkwood and captured by Elves (all except Bilbo that is). Bilbo helps the Dwarves escape their Elvish prison in barrels that are sent down the river towards Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug lives. Finally arriving at Lake Town, Bilbo and the Dwarves approach the lonely mountain, where they enter via a secret door. Bilbo discovers a key weakness in Smaug's armor. He also discovers the Arkenstone, a precious gem of Thorin's ancestors. Smaug's weakness is learned by Bard (a noble man), who slays the Dragon as the Dragon attacks Lake Town. This causes Elf, Dwarf, and Man all to want Smaug's unprotected treasure, which is (mostly) Thorin's by ancestral right. But Thorin proves too greedy and selfish in the final moments, and will not share his treasure, even when just claims are made to it by Bard. Unbeknownst to Thorin, Bilbo delivers the Arkenstone to Bard, as leverage to negotiate and end the siege and stalemate at the Lonely Mountain. Thorin is outraged. Matters come to a head when the three armies of Elf, Dwarf, and Man are assailed by evil Goblins (Orcs) and Wargs. The Goblins and Wargs are defeated, in part due to the warnings of Gandalf, but Thorin Oakenshield is mortally wounded. Thorin apologizes to Bilbo for his prior anger at him, and dies. Bilbo Baggins then returns to Hobbiton, with 2 chests of Smaug's treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This was a gift and the recepient was very pleased.

I highly recommend this particular narrator for this book. It's the best I've found and I tend to be pretty picky with my favorite authors, of which Tolkein is one. Rob Inglis has a wonderful reading voice, varies his tone and delivery for the different characters & creatures (especially Gollum!) very well, and he does a wonderful job of singing the songs that Tolkein wrote for the dwarves, elves, etc. I will never listen to another version of this again.

Which is amazing, really. Our notions of literature are usually reserved for those dusty old thick & smelly books our high school teachers tried to make us read. But this is it too. A story, but not just any story. Characters, but characters that are destined to become legendary. The Hobbit was indeed the first written. I think it is the most approachable and has the most crisp and concise language of all the JRRT books, and is a pleasure to read again and again. If you happen to come upon a biographical documentary of the author, it well worth viewing. The background of his service in WWI lends a greater nuance and a whole other level of depth to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. In fact, you can't think of Mr. Frodo at the end of L of the R the same way again, but as returning soldier from the war to end all wars. On the whole, read the paper back if you must, but then, later, you may want a nice hard-copy to keep for those times you sit by the fire as you read and travel back to the Shire."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've read and been a fan of the fantasy genre for a relatively long time - about twenty years at this point.

I'm more familiar with the LoTR stuff than this book due to the movies, and so it was nice to read the \\"prequel\\" so-to-speak.

Just as Bilbo probably felt, I was in a state of comfort when I was reading about the Burrow. From the moment the journey began, I felt as if I had become a part of the journey. I was able to envision every mountain, hillside, road, and creature, thanks to the powerful descriptions by J.R.R.

Texpect someone of inferior education and experience to come up with something new is asking a great deal."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was just about the most fun reading experience I have ever had. I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged during the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\").But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It's sillier and lighter, with less dignified Elves and Dwarves. But it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Much of the book involves Bilbo leading the stubborn dwarves through many dangers, and getting himself out of nasty situations such as spiders, trolls and a deadly riddling game. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty Tolkien was capable of -- and through it all is the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English than his later works, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime.Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. He's supported by Thorin Oakenshield, the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. Crotchety wizard wizard, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Rob Inglis narrates this book, and has distinct voices for the characters. He is not dry and does not read in a monotone like most narrators. I found it an enjoyable experience, second only to Jim Dale in the Harry potter series.As I said I'm picky... I would have given it a 5 star, but as the recording of the audio could be a bit better, and the CD's skip here and there throughout the story, it only gets 3 stars. The Audio levels go up and down a few times as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was a great story of the heroic journey of Bilbo Baggins. It is a part of the series The Lord of The Rings and is typically recommended to be read prior to the other three books. I thoroughly enjoyed reading nearly the entire story; there was hardly ever a part that even remotely let my mind wander elsewhere. I think that J.R.R. Tolkien did a fantastic job of capturing the reader's imagination and holding it there consistently throughout the entire book. This book has become a great staple in modern day literature and I definitely regret having not read it earlier in my life.The book began when Gandalf came to recruit Bilbo to go on an adventure with a tribe of 13 dwarves who had lost their treasure to a dragon. Bilbo was a great thief and Gandalf wanted his help to steal the treasure back. Initially Bilbo had no desire to leave his comfortable home in the Shire and said that he wouldn't go; he was too afraid to get out of his comfort zone. I think that this is a part of the book that people from today's world would definitely benefit from listening to; so many adults and teenagers are too comfortable with where they are right now and refuse to pursue anything even relatively difficult--no matter how rewarding. Sometimes the greatest things in life come at the greatest price.Eventually Bilbo agreed to go and help the dwarves, they met many obstacles along the way including trolls, goblins, monsters, spiders, and wargs. Gandalf rescued the crew from the trolls but as the story progressed we began to see Bilbo's true potential. Especially after Gandalf left and he had found a ring (whilst he was in a cave that he had gotten left behind in) that had powers which could turn him invisible. This made for easy attacks on the monster, spiders, goblins, and wargs that he met along the way. Finally after many trials and tribulations they all made it to the dragon and they were able to retrieve their treasure from beneath it and protect their prize from the greedy goblins that were in hot pursuit. Gandalf came and rescued them all, flying on the same eagles that had saved them earlier on in the book.I liked the ending of the book because Gandalf returned and rescued them; it was not exactly something that you expected and I am glad that the author brought the conclusion together in that way. All in all the plot was fantastic and the build up was impressive from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I originally picked up this edition so I would have a copy for my library, but this is a great tale. Why has Tolkien stuck with us all these decades? I still recall the slogan in the streets of San Francisco that \\"Frodo Lives\\" but never understood that until I read Lord of the Rings. But I digress.Gandalf the Gray, a wizard that the Hobbits look forward to coming by and showing a few of his tricks, recruits Bilbo Baggins to come with a troupe of dwarves to help recover their stolen treasure, guarded by the dragon Smaug, who has possession of the dwarf kingdom deep within the Lonely Mountain.I really enjoyed Tolkein's characterizations and creation of new races and beings, and hints at the affairs of the world that our little Bilbo can only dimly imagine. The Ring is introduced, found almost accidentally, and plays a larger role in the later novels in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The banter of the dragon with Bilbo, its anger at being bated, its eventual fall and the dwarves return to power -- the battlefields come together against Men and dwarves thanks to old animosities coming to life. There's lots in this book. Battle, betrayal, love & honor, and poetry -- all written as if we were reading a translated chronicle of that which came before.What is our modern world but what we've built from the past? Tolkien shows the way, through fantasy, that we are larger than the sum of our parts.This particular edition is sadly free from illustrations except for a map or two at the end.Recommended:The Hobbit (Illustrated Edition)The Hobbit or There and Back Again. Illustrated by the AuthorMiddle Earth: The World of Tolkien Illustrated"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I picked this up on a Tolkien-high, interested in reading the graphic adaptation of the beloved novel it was based on. It had been a while since I read The Hobbit and had quite forgotten a few things, so I figured it was time to dive in.The biggest problem with this graphic novel is the amount of words per page. Comics almost never have multiple text boxes spread across a page, let alone a full novel's worth. Some pages were littered with these boxes, much to my annoyance. And some of these were ridiculously long. I don't think this would have bothered me as much if it were Tolkien's words, but Dixon lacks the charm Tolkien had.On the other hand, the illustrations are beautiful. Water-colored works of art grace the reader's eyes, always magnificent to look at. Indeed, David Wenzel did an amazing job of drawing the scenes and crafting the characters. Gandalf is perfect, as are the Dwarves and Bilbo. Smaug is awesome (when are dragons not?). The Elves weren't how I imagined them, but still fit the overall stylistic themes of the book.Taking these two together, the graphic novel of The Hobbit in no way compares with Tolkien's masterpiece, but it's definitely worth the read. I wound up skipping large blocks of \\"narration\\" text, letting the individual comic panes and character dialogue instead fill in the story. It was nice going back to the beginning of the journey that inspires The Lord of the Rings, and Charles Dixon's The Hobbit mostly met my expectations. Recommended for those interested in Tolkien, especially younger readers, but I would first recommend reading the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I can't believe at my age I had never read this book. I would recommend this book to readers of any age and genres. My only reference to these amazing characters was through film. The films don't do justice to Tolkien's mastery. Due to this book I have now purchased The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Silmarillion. This book will be an added classic to your bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In the fantasy novel The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien, a small mythical creature called a \\"hobbit\\" leaves his home on an adventure to help dwarves reclaim their stolen treasure. This happens after the hobbit was chosen as a burglar. The story's setting is long ago in Wilderland, a fantasy place. The main conflict is that long before, a dragon had raided a dwarvish town and stolen all of the treasures. The company of dwarves were eager for revenge on the dragon, \\"Smaug the Magnificent\\". Smaug was, unfortunately, a fearless and dangerous \\"worm\\" who lived in the faraway ruins of the town under the Lonely Mountain on the heap of treasures. Eventually, a team of 13 dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit set off on a long journey. Along the way, there are many dangers. First, there are trolls who are hungry and would love to eat the dwarves. Luckily, they are all saved by the wizard. Next, over the goblin-infested Misty Mountains they were caught and taken into the heart of the goblin town, where they would have been slaves for the rest of their life. Then, in the dark, deep forest Mirkwood, they are captured by giant spiders who would eat them like flies. Only for Bilbo's quick thinking do they survive. And after surviving all of these ordeals, only to find a dragon at the end...Main Character:Bilbo Baggins the hobbit is the main character. He starts out with two sides of personality. One side is a respectable, jolly fellow who enjoys a comfortable life with two breakfasts a day if possible. The other side of him urges him to go on an adventure to faraway lands. The book tells of how his second side wins and he becomes a hero and burglar.Character Traits:The hobbit is jolly, excitable, and clever. Most of the time he is happy, and is not ever too grumpy. He sometimes has fits where he yells out strange things if he is scared. He is clever when the time comes. When the dwarves have all been captured by spiders, the hobbit came up with a plan on the spot! The hobbit is also stubborn and proud. He is looks down on the dwarves. Once, he sniffs, \\"all this dwarvish racket!\\" although \\" You or I wouldn't have noticed is the whole cavalcade passed within two feet of us!\\"Theme:The main theme of this book is the conflict between the good and the evil. The evil is always trying to thwart the good from doing what they have the right to do.Recommendation:I strongly recommend this book to children in 4th to 6th grade. The book is full of adventure and the outcome is often unexpected. Throughout the book, the language is engaging and playful which lessens the often scary scenes. I read it when I was 8, and now I am 9, I love it even more as I understand the story better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is amazing, I love it and it's worth the money. I had it on my wish list and recieved it as a gift for Christmas. The binding is great, the pages are thick, fairly tare resistant... just don't let a baby get a hold of it, a baby could probably rip it.The cover and back are sturdy, and, well, when I say great binding, it's probably life guaranteed. The front is really great, around the picture in the middle are symbols, which I belive to be ancient Middle Earth runes. As for the print inside, nice and big, with pictures included. This is a great offer all together.For me, this isn't even worth taking off a half star because I personally think it's just cool, though some would disagree. When I got the book and I looked inside to see the pictures (my mother has a copy with Alan Lee art), I was disappointed for a second and didn't know how it was a Collector's Edition. The pictures were simple, not the great art that I had seen in my mother's copy. They looked like basic sketches of Alan Lee's work. I checked the front of the book to see who the author was and that's when it was suddenly really amazing. The sketches and pictures inside were actually sketeches drawn by Tolkien himself! This edition was so amazing, I found myself pulling it out every time I saw it just to look thorugh the pictures and the neat symbols on the front. I've read The Hobbit a couple times, as well as the Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings, and parts of both the Book of Lost Tales and The Book of Unfinnished tales (I own more of his work than I've read). I'm quite a Tolkien fanatic. I began to learn Quenya and Sindarin and I know basic pronounciations for elven language in general, this was to improve my pronounciation of several places and things in Tolkien's works. I'm telling you what I know so that i can back up my belief that...When people say the Hobbit is more of a child's story. I have to disagree. My mother read it to me when I was somewhere between 6-8 years old and I was pretty bored. I didn't get most of it (I just liked the pictures and songs). She, however, seemed to be into it the whole time. I didn't find myself enjoying Tokien's work until I was 12. The Hobbit story itself is more fun and \\"bouncy\\" than his other works, but even if he had children in mind when he wrote it, it's not something childrn today can easily get into. Plus, the usage of words that are now used differently, only in England, or hardly seen altogether, would confuse many kids. For example, Tolkien uses the word \\"gay\\" several times. \\"gay\\", however, means happy. So when he describes something or someone as \\"gay\\" I can see too many 8-12 year olds, and even high schoolers, getting the wrong idea completely.My notes of warning:1. If you prefer detailed art over scetches, even if they are drawn by Tolkien himself, consider that before buying this edition2. Don't buy this for a kid thinking it's a simple childrens book. And if you believe them to have a large enough vocabulary to get into it, just double check to make sure they know the original meaning of \\"gay\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent choice for any fantasy book lover.

What if you didn't have a choice? Well that's what happened to Bilbo Baggins who faced one with courage and determination.In The Hobbit Bilbo Baggins goes on a magical journey through mountains and over plains. Accompanied by dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey he must help recover lost treasure from the dragon Smaug. On his journey he finds a magical ring with surprising powers. When they get to Smaug's lair Bilbo alone must defeat the evil terror of Smaug.I give this book a 4/5 stars because it's hard to get into. At first, there are lots of new characters you have to get to know. It starts out in Bilbo's Hobbit Hole where nothing but talking goes on. Than they start to journey and slowly the book gets better and better. The Hobbit does pack a lot of action though and the scenes with Smaug are exciting and captivating. I think Tolkien wrote this wrote this book in a great way. He used great descriptions and funny conversation to pull you in.Bilbo is the most in depth character in the book and as time passes you will learn all of his hopes and dreams. In the beginning, Bilbo is a stuffy, old, boring hobbit who doesn't think twice about going on adventures. As time goes on, he slowly crawls out of his shell and gets braver. At first, the dwarves don't like him because he's boring but when he gets braver and saves their lives, more than once, they start the respect him. Bilbo is a funny, clever, tricky, and witty character who is really fun to read about. In the end, he learns that even though he's small he can do great things to help shape the world.The best part in The Hobbit is the part where Bilbo confronts the dragon Smaug. Bilbo speaks in riddles and calls himself a \\"Barrel Rider\\" which greatly angers Smaug. He also learns of Smaugs weak point by using Smaugs arrogance against him. In the end, Bilbo makes Smaug so mad that Smaug goes on a rampage where he destroys caves and caverns. After, all of this Bilbo learns a valuable lesson, don't anger evil dragons.I wholly recommend this book for readers ten and over. It is written with powerful words and imagination.

Tolkien created the Lord of the Rings books and then they turned into movies that amazed the world. But, before Lord of the Rings came the Hobbit. The Hobbit introduces Bilbo and Gandalf and all the other people. It's basically the prologue in the Lord of the Rings story. The story starts off with the party Bilbo wasn't expecting. That's why they call it The Unexpected Party. This only introduces the dwarves, Bilbo and Gandalf.After that, it's trolls, dragons and other mystical beings. Unsurprisingly, Bilbo and the dwarves can slay or escape all of them. But actually, it is kind of a surprising storyline. You won't know what is gonna happen next. But, why is this book good? Well.........The storyline is awesome and unpredicatable.You'll learn to like most of the characters, unlike some other stories I've read.Very big detail lets you see what's happening in your mind.There's a fat dwarf in it.But, of course, no novel is PERFECT. Just because The Hobbit is good, doesn't mean it's the best. Why would this book be bad?Well.........The first chapter(Unexpected Party) can confuse you at times.So many characters, you won't know which is which.The book annoyingly makes you flip back to find stuff you've already read. Well, it did with me.Thorin constantly reminds us about his past, which is unacceptably boring.The horrible Barrels Out of Bond chapter goes too far.

You may have experienced battles in other books, but compared to little people of 4ft in height fighting against 10ft people you just it is just unbelievable how they manage to overcome them with victory that is all in mind. You have to read the book to understand the detail that the JRR Tolkien puts into these scenes. I have to say that the reason why I gave this book a four out of five was firstly because of the detail. The expressive words used within the book such as \\"He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts h could not scramble on top.\\" The descriptiveness of Bilbo's inability to climb up the tree in the quote is just of the many found in the book. Secondly I am a sucker from adventure stories. If you are like me then this is a book for you. The story goes on and never ends. You are left hanging until the last line.

This could easily be considered the epitome of great folklore. While adopting concepts from Greek epics such as Beowulf and other Norse legends, Tolkien continually surprises even the skeptic in us all. It has a series of twists and turns of mischievous deeds and heroicism, unraveling ever so slightly as the reader delves further in.As the novel begins, Bilbo Baggings, the humble, intelligent and often out-spoken hobbit, leads a quiet undisturbed life down in his hobbit hole at Bag End. However, soon enough this character is rudely awakened. And all his surrounding are in upheaval. This is a book of self-discovery and adventure; action and \\"peaceful\\" resolutions. It is an excellent read at any age.Tolkien is an absolute genius in the art of writing a fantastic trilogy or anything for that matter. He even devised an alphabet specifically for these books, a history and map of the lands in which these stories take place. This is and excellent example of fantasy type literature. The reader responds to Tolkien's writings like it is some sort of true happening in the news. This is fantastical writing and should be reviewed as such. Brilliant in all aspects, praise worthy.

GREAT JOB"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I'll be honest. It's pretty much impossible for me to really review J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Tolkien's 1937 prelude to The Lord of the Rings is my favorite book, ever, and has been ever since I first read it upon my father's recommendation when I was twelve. Since then, I've re-read it more times than I can count. However, with this read, I've done something new - I listened to the fantastic audiobook rendition read by Rob Inglis. So, I'll be focusing on that.Many readers, especially fantasy fans, are already familiar with The Hobbit, and even those who don't fit those categories are likely to know the basic premise with the recent first film in Peter Jackson's three part adaptation of the novel. So, I'll only briefly discuss the novel itself.The hobbit of the title is Bilbo Baggins, a well-to-do and - on the surface - boring hobbit of the Shire. To Bilbo's surprise, the wizard Gandalf recruits Bilbo to join exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield and his company of twelve dwarves in reclaiming their home and treasure at the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, the terrible dragon who conquered the Mountain many years ago. Of course, even getting to the Mountain is no small task, and Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and company have many exciting adventures.In Recorded Books 1991 production, narrator Rob Inglis delivers a masterful reading of The Hobbit. It's a rather challenging book, when one reflects that it contains dwarves (thirteen of them!), elves, men, goblins, trolls, spiders, wargs, Gollum, and a dragon, all with major speaking roles. Inglis does a fantastic job of giving each character a unique voice while also making them recognizable as one of their kind. No small task, that, but on top of it, Tolkien includes a great deal of singing and poetry in The Hobbit, and Inglis even sings like dwarves, elves, or goblins.This production was recorded a decade before Jackson's Lord of the Rings films and two decades before The Hobbit films, so Inglis never imitates the well-known actors when creating his voices but uses his own excellent interpretations of the characters. Inglis also recorded The Lord of the Rings for Recorded Books. I'm sure that will be excellent as well, and it's next on my listening list.This unabridged recorded of The Hobbit runs approximately 11 hours, and is a full telling the book as written, and not one of the various dramatizations produced over the years. As such a fan of the original book, I'm happy to have found this unabridged and well-narrated but not dramatized edition.I highly recommend The Hobbit as a novel to anyone, and am currently reading it to my children. Fans of The Hobbit or audiobooks will be very pleased with Rob Inglis' performance of the novel. The Hobbit is a classic well worthy of the name."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Love the lord of the rings books.

Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting.

I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.The main character is Bilbo Baggins. This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out.

The Lord of the Rings is much more in depth, descriptive, and more entertaining than the Hobbit, but it also includes several references that only one who has read the Hobbit will fully understand.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins and his journey away from his comfortable home in Hobbiton and across Middle Earth in order to defeat the Dragon Smaug. Bilbo travels with 13 dwarves whose homeland has been taken by the evil dragon, and their journey is aided by the wizard Gandalf who has chosen Bilbo to join the dwarves in their quest. The Hobbit is a fairly simple story in which Bilbo and his new friends encounter many dangers and hardships along the way, but most importantly, it is the story in which Bilbo finds the Ring that will eventually be the centerpiece for Tolkien's subsequent classic.Read The Hobbit to enjoy a quick story that will give you the background and introduction to Hobbits and Middle Earth that will make reading The Lord of the Rings much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read this book last year.....I LOVED it.

As close as I could imagine Tolkien or Mr. Bilbo would have had it.As for the negative reviews, which almost seem intentionally too long-worded and heavy to want to read, comparing this edition to that edition, blah blah blah.... a review should be just that... otherwise it would be called a comparison, would it not? Sounds like a pissed off writer who never made it, sitting on their chair the wrong way (something up their south-facing orifice)THAT SAID :PI am a book collector. In particular I tend to gravitate towards classics which are bound and covered in such a way as to make them worthy not only of reading, but also for display and even to be handed down within the family. I have inherited and purchased a number of books over the years to this end, and not only is my library becoming and amazing collection to experience through reading, it is becoming a beautiful sight to behold, thanks to books like this particular edition of The Hobbit, which happens to be among my favorites, at the center of my collection.The book is initially pleasing to the eye. The slip-cover is of the same bound heavy card stock as the book cover, with beautiful drawings affixed to either side. The pages are heavy, the page edges have a nice rustic cut (though I wish they were gilded), the print is bold, and the font fitting. It won't be long and you won't be able to find books of this quality anymore.The Hobbit is perhaps my all time favorite story. The first copy I read was a ragged elementary school softcover book, missing pages and covers... I loved the story first long before I became a book collector. Tolkien wrote it primarily from the perspective of the one telling the tale, I.E. \\"There and Back Again\\" by Bilbo Baggins, and if old Bilbo were to have had a printing press, and produced his book en-masse, I imagine, of all the editions I have handled, that this particular one has the most authenticity and character, and is the closest to what Bilbo would have produced himself. This is very original. If like me you become absorbed into what you read, then you know how important the 'feel' of a book can be. You just don't get that same feel from a paper back book.For the money, you will not find a more beautiful, more collectable copy of this tale. I also recommend the matching red-\\"leather\\" bound LOTR with similar slip-cover. All that is said of The Hobbit in this review could also be said for the similar copy of LOTR.Thanks for reading!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end.

Either they did not really read it or read it very superficially.The author was a professor of Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, and he took many of the elements of the story--including, for example, the dwarves' names, the the theft of the dragon's cup, and trolls that cannot stand daylight--from the legends and myths of those cultures.Basically, the story is one of a well-to-do middle-aged bachelor (50--which isn't as old for a hobbit as it is for a human, as they live on the average about half again as long as we do) who lives a comfortable, snug, smug existance in the beautiful home his parents--he was an only child--had built. Then, along come thirteen dwarves and a wizard who take him out of that narrow existance and show him a great, big world out there; some of it is beautiful, some of it is horrible, but all of it is exciting; along the way he finds that he's a lot braver and a lot cleverer than he thought he was. He comes home, to his old life, but not the same.The book is all about growing up, maturing, pushing your limits. It is also about the futility of lust for material gain and the horror of war.You don't have to like it; nobody said that you HAVE TO like anyting.

I am forever indebted to this teacher for introducing me to one of the greatest fantasy novelists of all time. In this delightful tale, Tolkien introduces a new world called &quot;Middle Earth.&quot; &quot;Middle Earth&quot; is a place where dwarves, elves, wizards, dragons, and hobbits live.Of course, in this story, Bilbo Baggins is the consummate hobbit who runs off on a dangerous and exciting adventure (something hobbits do not normally do) with a clan of dwarfs. These adventures lead to dangerous encounters with giant spiders, goblins, etc. Moreover, Bilbo encounters an odd slimy creature named Gollum, who possess a ring that holds great magical power (an item which plays a vital role in the trilogy titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Gollum is so obsessed with this ring, which he calls &quot;precious,&quot; that he will do anything to get it back from Bilbo (who found it on the ground and later took it from Gollum after a contest of wits and wisdom). Gollum, of course, shows up again in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Another important character in this enthralling tale is a wizard by the name of Gandolf. Gandolf periodically appears to either help Bilbo and his befriended dwarf companions or he appears to give advice or simply converse with his hobbit friend.This story is very captivating from beginning to end. Actually, there are no dull points in the story line at all. The descriptions of this wonderful imaginary world are very florid and imaginative. Tolkien developed an entire world with maps, alphabets, languages, riddles, and very vivid characters who not only win your heart but wheedle your emotions and imagination.This story is not your typical run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. In fact, much of what is called 'fantasy' today owes a great deal of homage to Tolkien and his creative expertise. Since many fantasy novelists who followed Tolkien borrowed in one way or another from him and his works. Tolkien is a master story teller who has an eye for elaborate detail and sophistication. None of his stories are trite or typical. Tolkien stands in a class all his own."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The fantastic and terrific book by J.R.R. Tolkien, which is called THE HOBBIT, which tells a story of a brave Hobbit going to the rescue of a treasure being protected by a dragon. It is an adventure book which every one should read because of the authors way of writing it and also because of its setting, which is very creative. The book tells about a Hobbit, which is a small creature about one meter, more or less and lives in underground holes and are very smart and silent. One day a magician called Gandalf comes to his house and invites him to a journey to rescue a treasure which was stolen from their ancestors by a evil dragon called Smaug. He accepts and gets into a lot of adventure, danger and meets very different creatures, sometimes bad and sometimes good, until the the cave where the dragon sleeps... The first reason I liked the book is because of the authors way of writing. He describes exactly whats happening and makes us able to picture every plant, every character. I also like the setting, which is super well described, and is very creative too, with lots of characters, mountains, and different scenarios which are very well pictured while reading the book.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is one of the best-beloved books out there, for either kids or adults -- it's cute, funny, charming and very well-written. (In general, stories that were originally created to entertain kids are the best) Author J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper, and later concocted a complex and colorful bedtime story for his kids...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot; That hobbit is the determinedly normal Bilbo Baggins, whose comfortably boring life is turned upside-down when the wise wizard Gandalf turns up with thirteen dwarves. But they're not there just to abuse Bilbo's hospitality -- they're there to recruit him as a burglar, so that they can sneak back to the old dwarf stronghold of Lonely Mountain and reclaim it from the dragon Smaug.Before Bilbo knows what's happening, he's being whisked off with the dwarves and Gandalf across Middle-Earth. His odd journey rapidly turns dangerous when they are captured by goblins, he is forced to riddle with a withered creature, finds a golden Ring that will turn its wearer invisible, and they are nearly devoured by monstrous spiders. And he hasn't even gotten to the Mountain yet -- where the dragon is still sleeping.I was seven years old when I first read &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which wasn't even the start of my appreciation for Tolkien. Now with the movie trilogy partly released, a new buzz of interest around anything and everything &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-related has brought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; back into bookstore displays. This is a less serious, dark book than the Rings trilogy, but the charming tone and delightful, unexpectedly brave unlikely hero Bilbo will delight both kids and adults. At a bookstore recently, I saw a teenage boy insisting that &quot;Hobbit&quot; was not a children's book, because he still read it. (The final chapters hint at the future epic battles of the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy, and several plot threads are picked up in those books as well, so note the details...)&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is a special treat for Tolkien fans, or just people who want to know more about this book and about Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Pictures (Tolkien's own) are included in the middle of it; Douglas Anderson includes plenty of careful footnoting, citing works of mythology, legend, and careful usage of other books by Tolkien to back up his commentary. (For example, one major question is answered: Do Elves have pointy ears? Answer: Yes, and check this book to see why) The binding is nice and tight, the cover is one of Tolkien's illustrations (Smaug on the dwarves' gold), the paper is smooth and very pale so that the words are always clearly visible.Needless to say, if you liked the movies or the books, you'll adore &quot;Hobbit.&quot; If you haven't read it, then do so. And then check out &quot;Annotated Hobbit,&quot; with its extras and bonuses. Great read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In light of the previous critics words on Tolkien, I have this to share:To say that \\"The Hobbit\\" is flawed is like saying the The Mona Lisa is imperfect. To cite an \\"omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time\\" is to misunderstand one of the most important narrative styles of all time. To complain about leaving main characters in the dark for too many chapters is to ignore what Tolkien did for suspense in the world of literature. To criticize Tolkien for the descriptive style that, for the most of us, puts him miles above all other fantasy writers, is to be incapable of objectivity. And to find fault with putting the glory in the hands of Bard instead of Bilbo is to fail to grasp the meaning of the tale altogether. And if you think that the struggle between four armies does not begin until the last 100 pages of the book, then you just aren't a very good reader. The battle of four armies starts in chapter one.Every child I've read it to was completely fascinated by it and seems to have understood its worth above lesser fantasy.\\"The Hobbit\\" is quite possibly the greatest work of fantasy fiction ever written, and the one all comers will continue to be judged by.Maybe one day there will be another children's story as good as this.J.

What is a hobbit you may ask, you will find many little things about them by reading the book, but the are short people looking things that have very thick hides the grow as there feet- they have normal looking feet, but just are tougher-so they don't use shoes. In this story Gandalf the grey (a very powerful, wise, and tall wizard) although our hobbit has no idea what is going to happen to him Gandalf has already chosen his adventure coming up. Bilbo (our hobbit) is set to meet with a number of dwarfs. They are off to find there right full home. Also one of the dwarfs is a soon to be king. They are all party of the dwarf community that belongs to one of the great huge mountains. On the way there they will meet many foes few allies, and a dragon. They will make quit a bit of coin from the loot they found in the mountain. Bilbo is also very skilled with a dagger, just not aware of it at the beginning of the story. At first he did not want to go and just wanted to stay home and drink tea. Later on in this magical story Bilbo fights large spiders and also finds a magical ring, the original ring belonged to the dark lord, and then to a mighty king, Smegule-who was once also a hobbit-was twisted and turned into an animal and obsess with the ring. He would call it precious and keep it close to him. Bilbo will take it and then use it agents the dragon and also agents the spiders.

It was everything I expected and more. Absolutely beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien wrote a very well known novel titled the Hobbit. The book starts out introducing a calling the a very unlikely hero. The hero being Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a small dwarf-like humanoid species called a hobbit, a short, fat, uncoordinated, inexperienced, peace loving creature. He is taken on an adventure by an old friend that is leader of the quest and happens to be a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. This quest travels all throughout his world, and experiences many things that no one from his race has ever seen before. He is taken to battle Goblins, meet Elves, fly on the backs of Giant Eagles, and was almost a dinner for three very stupid trolls. Bilbo's reason, or place for being on quest was the title of \\"Burglar\\". He was assigned to steal treasure from the last Dragon alive named Smaug. Bilbo steals the treasure he was supposed to and an enraged Smaug reeks havoc on the city of men below him. After he is slain there is a huge epic battle at the end for ownership of the stolen treasure.

In my opinion, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is one of those books. I actually had not read this book until a few years ago, and regret not reading it earlier in my life. 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.Many people often imagine heroes as strong and comely in form. Comic books are filled with mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues amount to \\"beat people up\\" good. Tolkien's protagonist is radically different than such heroes as, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman. Bilbo Baggins is small, mundane, weak and sometimes whiny. Of all characters in this story he possibly possesses the least amount of \\"fighter's instinct.\\" Yet, he is not a completely mundane character. Bilbo is one of my favorite of all times characters as he is gentle, simple, and humble. He bears no grudges and desires no vengeance. Bilbo is indeed another breed of hero; A hero who succeeds though a mixture of luck and common sense. Bilbo is a unique take on the everyman hero!Gandalf is also a favorite of mine, despite being a deus ex machina in several situations. The wisdom of Gandalf along with his pure, unfailingly good, although slightly grumpy demeanor make him quite interesting, and mysterious.The Hobbit is an outstanding book that I highly recommend to all adults and their children!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In this book, The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, by J.R.R. Tolkein, is a story of self discovery from the point of view of a hobbit who sometimes resents said \\"journey of self discovery\\". Throughout this book, you watch as the hobbit becomes a completely new hobbit. At the start, he was described as \\"a well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins,\\" by the end of the book though, he becomes Bilbo, Warrior against the Goblins, Peace-maker of Nations, Burglar of the Dwarves, and the owner of a very special yet suspicious ring. The plot of this story was very effective because it kept things very interesting. There were many various adventures that took place during one big overall adventure. Tolkien never let the story get too dry and always kept the reader interested with exciting events. I also greatly enjoyed the point of view being from Bilbo's perspective. I think that everyone can appreciate the story of an underdog. Bilbo was a rather uninteresting hobbit, and I think everyone can relate to that sort of unexciting life, but then suddenly he got to travel on a fantastic adventure! It almost gives the reader hope that maybe someday their life will take them on an unexpected journey. I somewhat agree with what bernie \\"webviator\\" said about how this is not a children's book. It most definitely is not a children's book, but I also have to point out that although the book itself may be too advanced for children just as ALice in Wonderland is, the story is still suitable for a child. Sometimes more a simpler mind can appreciate things much differently than a more advanced mind, but they would still appreciate it nonetheless. Tolkien's style of writing is very nicely illustrated in the line: \\"Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist,\\" the entire story has a magical and almost spooky tone, the author does this by creating many amazing creatures and magical objects throughout the story. I love this writing style because it successfully creates a completely alternate universe in which the story takes place, and it becomes an escape from the real world. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to witness an adventure or would like to discover the \\"Tookishness\\" in themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Well what is there to say, JRR Tolkien is a genius!I bought this book for like the 5th time and i would be more than happy to get it again!This is not LotR do not make that mistake, this book is more written towards children. but it is a great read even for adults if you have the right mind set!The book is an amazing adventure of Blibo Bagins, who is not one who likes adventures.It is filled with Epic moments and great interesting characters!It is an absolute must if you are a fan of fantasy fiction / Adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I had to read this after seeing the movie.

I like to say that Tolkien wrote the former for someone of similar education as him, a professor of English or some such at Oxford, an expert of the English language and history, whereas The Hobbit was written for children - for well-educated smart and savvy children but still for children and who knows? Maybe I am a kid at heart. I Loved The Hobbit!The story is beyond engaging. The descriptions are brilliant. The humor is well-placed and just delicious. The dialogues that Bilbo Baggins carries on in his head and the conclusive remarks that Tolkien makes here and there, makes you think he is just sitting in a park, surrounded with kids, doing a reading... and making observations. Oh I just loved it.I do wish there was more of Smaug, and I had hoped that he would be the ultimate climax to the end. I felt a similar way in The Lord of the Rings. The ending happened and then Tolkien was going on and on in an anticlimactic sorta way. The story really should've ended but who am I to complain? There was more of Bilbo to read and love.Fantastic read even if you are not a fantasy fiction junkie.

They need a quiet, sneaky hobbit to help them recover their lost gold from the evil, fire-breathing dragon Smaug. Many dangers lie along their path, but courage and heart win them through. In the end, Bilbo realizes that there are much more important things in life than being comfortable and a world full of beauty beyond the Shire.

I am able to enter into the story, suffer along with the characters, feel with them, be sorry for their travails, be saddened by their foolishness, and mourn as Thorin Oakenshield, Kili and Fili die in battle. It is difficult to read this book and not see foreshadowing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; though that is not the best way to read it. It does not tie perfectly with the latter book, there are a couple of points which don't link, quite. But for the most part i see the trilogy in the book, and had to be careful not to push it too much to the girls ~ apart from anything else, it is probably a little above them right now, and it would certainly be a major commitment to read. Standing by itself, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a wonderful story, with a well-wrought plot, characters that are near enough human for us to relate to them, yet far enough from us for the enchantment to work, and enough stylistic ties to legend, myth, and saga that it is familiar to me and will ring echoes in the girls' ears as they read further."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien can only be described as a mideival fantasy. It is the story of how a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with some newly made friends to find the fortune that awaits them. His companions are 13 dwarves variously sized but all about half the size of a human. The wizard Gandalf also greatly helps on their adventure. The reason all of this got started was because when the head dwarf of the group named Thorin Oakenshield, was just a young boy the castle he and his family lived in was destroyed by the dragon Smaug. His family and friends were all killed and he barely escaped with his life. He vowed revenge and to take bake the kingdom that would have once been his. His long time friend Gandalf helps get the motley bunch together and they start on their adventure. On their way they encounter such things as goblins, spiders, elves, ravenous wolves and the horrid golum. In the end it turned out the dwarves started a huge war which they ended up winning and as they vowed, they took back what was rightfully theirs. I would absolutely recomend this book to anyone, anywhere. This is not only one of my favorite books, but listening to other peoples reviews, their favorite too.

I would love to use The Hobbit when I have my own class. I think the story is exciting and scary and appeals to elementary and high school students alike. There is much &quot;SAT vocabulary&quot; that I believe ought to be in a person's everyday usage. I was sorely disappointed when my classmates did not understand such words as &quot;repose&quot;, &quot;requisite&quot;, and &quot;defrayed&quot; which appeared in a short note left to the main character Bilbo. The just of the note was that his friends were thanking him for hospitality and accepting his offer of professional assistance; followed by the terms of the business venture. Anyway, my classmates thought that someone in the story had died because one of the terms was that the business partners would pay for Bilbo's funeral expenses if he died and there was no one to pay for them.Complaining about our present educational level aside, I think this book could be used in many ways; discussions of journeys, how spiders spin webs, are there different levels of stealing? what does it take to make a decision that changes your life completely, as well as everyone else's expectations of you, and more.Most importantly, this book is fun for both teachers and students to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Hey, this book is awesome!

All the good things that I would have said about The Hobbit have already been voiced many times in the positive reviews before this one, so please read some of them for more information about the book. My observation is that the minority of people that disliked the book seem to be very blatantly aggressive in their criticism without providing any substance to support their claims. Perhaps this is the reason so many people have expressed the fact that the poor reviews were not useful to them. I question no one's opinion for what it is, but I do question the way in which they choose to express it. Negative reviews, I think, would be welcome and considered, as long as they were well written and thoughtful, instead of combative and insubstantial in content. The Hobbit is a delightful story, and deserves all the praise it is given in the hundreds of positive reviews here (and many more). Best for children, but good for anyone who likes adventure and lore."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Since others have already written reviews about the story I am writing about this particular edition.

The colored glossy illustrations (5) also add a dimension as well as non glossy green and black ones(7). There are maps on the inside covers of The Desolation of Smaug and Wilderland.

KhauP. 5This book takes place before the Fellowship of the ring which is part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, who is a hobbit that lives his peaceful life at the Shire. Hobbits are little people that live in comfortable holes. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf visits Bilbo and invites him to go out on an adventure with some dwarves. Bilbo agrees and his adventure starts. Little does he know of what challenges with he run across...One thing I like about this book is the way the author describes something.&quot;Hobbits are little people, smaller than dwarfs. They love peace and quiet and good tilled earth. They dislike machines, but they are handy with tools. They are nimble but don't like to hurry. They have sharp ears and eyes. They are inclined to be fat. They wear bright colors but seldom wear shoes. They like to laugh and eat(six meals a day)and drink. They like parties and they like to give and recieve presents. They inhabit a land they call The Shire, a place between the River Brandywine and the Far Downs.&quot;This is an excellent quote that is discriptive and simple at the same time. It caught my attention and provided me with lots of background information that I would stumble and be confused without.One thing that I dislike about this book is the way it lengthens things that are boring or get boring. Most of these things are not important in the story and easily get forgotten.They can also confuse you.&quot;You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.&quot;This is an example of somethings I dislike. If you are not really concentrated, this could confuse you. I had to read over that paragraph a couple times before I acually understood much of it. Later on in the book this paragraph seems irrelevant. You should also only try to read this book if you have a lot of time to spare. It is pretty long and there are lots of parts in the book that will take some time to understand.My favortie part of the book is the beginning. It caught my attention with good descriptions. They were not too long and acually told you how something looked or felt. There was no junk about descriptions that you can't even visualize and remember enough to care. The beginning was solid and it didn't leave you confused and wondering what the author meant. My least favorite part was Chapter 18. It didn't lead to an ending well. There were a couple boring parts that I wish were taken out."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Tolkien's main character in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is evidently a hobbit, who is unknowingly volunteered to go on a dangerous adventure with 13 other dwarves. A wizard by the name of Gandalf is the one responsible for volunteering Bilbo. As the 14 journey towards the Lonely Mountains to retrieve their long lost fortune, they are faced with many fantastical obstacles.The wild adventure leads the 14 dwarves to many creatures and goblins, including one named Gollum. Bilbo wins a gold ring from Gollum, which later on becomes the basis for the series, \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" What does this ring mean for Bilbo? How does it change his unwanted adventure?I am not usually a big fan of fantasy type literature, however I enjoyed, \\"The Hobbit,\\" very much. I waited to see the cartoon version of, \\"The Hobbit,\\" until after I had finished the book. My sister and friends had always loved Tolkien, and I had never given him the chance. Tolkein did an excellent job of making a very unreal setting, real to the reader. The setting and characters were extremely well described. Tolkien describes every tiny thing, right from the beginning. Even the hobbit's hole, which is not an important part of the story, is described in great detail. An author's ability to suspend disbelief is very important to the pleasure the reader obtains from the book, especially if the reader is already skeptical. There was really not a transition from realistic world into the fantasy world. The Hobbit instead slowly leads the reader into a more fantastical world through the chapters. The adventure and plot of the story really keep the reader interested and not wanting to put the book down. I can now understand why so many people have gone crazy over Tolkien's writing. I plan on reading Tolkien's, \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" series very soon. I just cannot get over the great detail he puts in his setting and characters as he writes.I think that the Hobbit would be a difficult read for elementary students. However I think it would be perfect for middle school or high school students. It could be used as an excellent choice to read aloud to students in elementary. I am not sure about parents reaction to Tolkien's writing, but I would love to use some of his work in my own classroom."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is perhaps one of the best-written books about the advantages of having parties. Written relatively early in his days as an Oxford don, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a strongly autobiographical novel about Tolkien and his status as a party man. His reputation as a party enthusiast was so secure, in fact, that Tolkien regularly was the host to impromptu parties as other Oxford and even Cambridge professors would appear uninvited at his home with the expectation of a good meal, some beer or wine, and rousing party games.It is such experiences that form the basis for \\"The Hobbit.\\" A sedentary fellow, much like Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins finds himself the unassuming host of a party of dwarves (more established professors) and the wizard Gandalf (the president of the university).Wooed by promises of great wealth, and strongly encouraged by Gandalf, Bilbo joins the dwarves on a quest to regain their lost ancestral gold, an action that represents Tolkien's own quest for tenure, a position that, once secured, would guarantee him employment, a place to live, social status, and ultimately a healthy retirement package.The story follows Tolkien-as-Bilbo's journey to the heart of the Lonely Mountain, where he must confront the dragon Smaug (the experience of teaching undergraduate and graduate students) and be swept up in the dramatic Battle of Five Armies, a situation not unlike peer review.And in the course of the story, Bilbo acquires a magical Ring that secures his reputation with the dwarves, much as Tolkien's literary and liguistic prowess, developed through education, secured his position in academia.A thoroughly fascinating and enchanting book, \\"The Hobbit\\" will have you wishing again and again for the opportunity to attend more parties and, even more, to host them yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit&#65533; is a lightly-written fairy-tale of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins&#65533; journey to the Dwarven home. It includes elves, a wizard, and wonderfully odd characters such as Tom Bombadil and the River&#65533;s Daughter. Bilbo is caught up in a strange adventure with a troupe of dwarves and a wizard. The tone of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; is very different from the rest of the series; it is an adult story written as a children&#65533;s story. Bilbo awakens one morning to an old man blowing smoke rings outside of his &#65533;hole in the ground&#65533;. This old man rested on a staff and wore a pointed blue hat, and his beard hung nearly to his waist. It seems the old wizard, Gandalf, has chosen Bilbo as the fourteenth man to accompany a troup of thirteen dwarves. Thirteen is an unlucky number, and in any case they needed a good burglar. That Bilbo never considered himself a burglar, and in fact had never burgled, bothered the wizard not in the slightest.I think that part of the success of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; can be attributed to its &#65533;moral&#65533; about war (which I can&#65533;t explain further until you&#65533;ve read the book, and then you won&#65533;t need me to). But it is also an engaging story of a middle-aged nobody&#65533;s coming-of-age. Bilbo passes through fire, literally, and emerges, if not a hero, than at least a story-teller.Overall I think this is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good read.

Tolkien's great galaxy of hobbits, wizards, dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons that he so deftly invented all by himself is quite vastly celebrated throughout the 20th century. In fact, his unique vision is so immensely popular that anything tasting of mystic whimsicality is at once labelled &quot;Tolkienesque&quot;. And over the years, his very first story, &quot;Hobbit&quot; had been getting its share of artwork from many different artists. Some are brilliantly colorful and others are just plain drab. Here in this 60th-anniversary book with the title in gold, Alan Lee created very gray watercolor paintings for its illustrations. Unfortunately, I find them quite dry and lifeless though he does have a good hand at drawing characters, trees, and mountainous passes. Instead, I would have preferred brilliant, deeply detailed fantasy art dramatically showing every emotion, every conflict, and every magic-working either in full colors or in very dark, gloomy tones.

Check the print before you buy, folks!)The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are.And then the annotations - useful, engaging, and very well done. You will WANT to read these. We discover how the book was written, and what was changed between editions.

There are fascinating tidbits about Tolkien's life and the experiences that made their way into the story.The forward tells about the writing of the novel, and the appedices give additional details about the text.There are also many illustrations from other editions of the book.

At times it's a bit busy - but there's always fascinating reading! Tolkien fans are sure to get excited over this one.Doug Anderson includes lots of sources in his notes. He quotes Tolkien's own letters, other fairy tales and legends that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as previous versions of the section he's noting.

Anderson is published by J.R.R. Tolkien's American publisher, Houghton Mifflin (important because it means the cover of this book uses the same art as the cover of the most popular hard-covered American edition of the Hobbit, published in the 1960's).Let me be perfectly clear that this is first and foremost a review of the Annotation, not of the novel, \`The Hobbit' itself. I have an almost reverential respect for the original novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike some cinematic versions of experiences like Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement in this annotation that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. And, while I can appreciate that there are adult readers, my Hemingway loving uncle being one of them, who simply \`don't get it', I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!But back to this Annotation'. Like similar annotations to works of fiction such as \`Alice in Wonderland' and the Arthur Conan Doyle stories of Sherlock Holmes, there are four different subjects for annotation. One is internal; where names and events are cross-referenced to other parts of the work to explain, elaborate, resolve, or point out inconsistencies. The second is external, where correspondences can be made to sources or, in the case of Conan Doyle or Carroll, events of the day that may have found their way into the fiction. The third is references to the author's unpublished notes and letters. Tolkien's works should be rich sources for all three types of annotation, as the world of \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is based on an enormous body of Norse, Celtic, and Teutonic mythology, fable, and epic literature. Also, standing behind \`The Hobbit' is the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings', \`The Silmarillion', and over twelve volumes of Tolkien writings compiled and annotated by Christopher Tolkien.So why are the annotations in this volume so sparse? The author certainly does not limit himself to only one kind of annotation. There are examples of all three references to other Tolkien works, notes and letters, and other sources. The author does give us lots of illustrations of scenes from \`The Hobbit' published in translations of the work from around the world. There are also a few illustrations from books that certainly influenced Tolkien, such as \`The Marvelous Land of Snergs'. The one thing that all these illustrations tell me is that, on average, they are not very good, oriented primarily towards a children's audience rather than some of the more heroic art familiar to us from modern fantasy illustrators. It seems to me a lost opportunity also to not include Tolkien's own color illustrations for \`The Hobbit', as they appeared on the very first \`Tolkien' calendar in, I believe 1966 or 1967.I will give just a few illustrations of where I think the author may have disappointed his readers. By far the most interesting character in \`The Hobbit' next to Bilbo and Gandalf is Smaug. And yet, the book has next to nothing to say about the fictional antecedents of that delightfully cagey old worm. One of my only fond memories of the rather insipid cartoon version of \`The Hobbit' done several decades ago is the gravely voice of Smaug done by Paladin himself, Richard Boone. If you couldn't get John Huston, then Boone was certainly the next best thing. To the whole conversation between Bilbo and Smaug, there are but two notes regarding Smaug and dragons. At least we get a reference about the source of Smaug's name, a primitive Germanic verb, \`smugan' meaning to squeeze through a hole. Tolkien confessed that this was \`a low philological jest'. In the wider story culminating in the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings' coming at the end of the Third Age, it is much more important to Gandalf to remove this great dragon from the field so Sauron could not use him as a weapon in the War of the Rings than it was to restore a small band of dwarves to their treasures. The book has practically nothing to say about this, or the fact that the character of the \`necromancer' who takes up residence at the southwestern tip of Mirkwood forest is actually either the leader of the Nazgul or Sauron himself.I keep thinking, as I turn each page of ample, empty white margins, all the things that could have been included.In balance, this is not a bad book or even a poor purchase, especially if, like me, you simply must have a copy of every different version of Tolkien's works imaginable. It has a very nice bibliography and an Appendix of all textual changes between the 1937 and 1966 editions. For those notes it does have, it is great as a version to read to children where you can record your own notes with answers to their questions."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I always thought this book was for children so I got it for my son for Christmas. He had read all the Harry Potter books and was waiting for the next one so I figured this classic fantasy would help fill the void.Well fill the void it did! My son absolutely loved it and has already read through it twice. Intrigued, I picked up the book myself and was immediately captivated by the story and stayed up until 2AM one morning to finish it! This is a book that any adult can appreciate and while it might be challenging for a child under 14, the effort will be rewarded.This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is very much like many of us. He would rather avoid &quot;adventure&quot; and sit by the fireplace with a mug of beer and a good meal in his stomach. He is suddenly dragged unwittingly into an adventure that ends up transforming him and teaching him things about himself that he never knew.As Bilbo and his dwarf companions encounter trolls, goblins, giant spiders and ultimately a giant dragon in their quest to recover lost treasure, you will find it increasingly difficult to put the book down.J.R.R. Tolkien is a master of prose and you find yourself reading paragraphs over again to absorb all the rich detail. They sure don't write them like that anymore!I highly recommend getting this book on tape (or CD) as well.

Like I suspect many others do, I have my own old sacred tattered and dog-eared paperback version on the Tolkien bookshelf.This book (the physical object, not just the story) is beautiful. It's clothbound in dark green and embossed in gold, and the bottom corner of the front cover has a gold embossed dragon, tastefully rendered. The paper dustjacket/cover features a dragon as well (I'm guessing Smaug). Eye-catching.There are many full-page color paintings, and many grayscale drawings (not full page) throughout. I'm not an art student, so I don't know what they're really called. Pencil-drawings or something. I call them grayscale because they're gray. Anyway, the Allen Lee illustrations are utterly charming, soft and colorful without being too bright. However, I wouldn't recommend this illustrated book for very young children; some of the goblins and trolls are frightening!I was a bit disappointed that Alan Lee didn't include more illustrations of Elves. Most of the pictures dealt with Bilbo and the dwarves, with a few of goblins and Gollum (scary). Also, I pictured Bilbo Baggins to be somewhat on the &quot;stout&quot; side...the text *does* refer to Hobbits as being &quot;inclined to be fat in the stomach&quot; and liking two dinners a day, &quot;when they can get it.&quot; The Bilbo Baggins in these illustrations is quite slender and looks as if he could use that second dinner right away! Maybe even a third and fourth! The balding, skinny Hobbit did surprise me. But then, I kind of expected the chubby halfling I saw on some old Tolkien calendars.This book makes a wonderful coffee table book and would make a great gift.

There are plenty of Alan Lee fans out there, especially after the LOTR movies were made with his assistance, and those fans may be disappointed to find the work of a different illustrator show up in their mailbox. Amazon also gives the wrong ISBN-10 number, though I doubt many will notice or care.Having said all this, I have enjoyed this adaptation of Tolkien's work. I bought it primarily for my 5 year old daughter who is a bit too young for the unabridged and non-illustrated novel but is still very interested in the story.

I've reviewed the book proper elsewhere, and would rather focus on the actual edition itself.]\\"The Hobbit\\" is one of those few books that I have felt justified to buy multiple copies over the years. It is a book I have read and cherished, and a book I dearly love. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a novel that deserves to be bought multiple times over, and I always enjoy looking at new editions of this classic work. So imagine my excitement when I found out they would be publishing a 70th anniversary edition of one of my most cherished novels!This has been a big year for Tolkien fans. Christopher Tolkien published \\"The Children of Hurin\\", a newly completed version of Turin's legend, in April. We've gotten (at long last), \\"The History of the Hobbit\\", expertly handled by brilliant Tolkien scholar John D. Ratcliffe and published in two separate volumes. And of course, we have the 70th anniversary of Tolkien's first primary work, \\"The Hobbit\\", which this edition is published in celebration of that momentous occasion. And does it live up as a major new edition of this fantasy classic?That's a pretty easy answer. The answer is NO.First off, here are the positives. The 70th anniversary edition is pretty much how the first edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" was actually published back in 1937 with some notable improvements, and conforming to Tolkien's pretty exacting specifications, including how the dust jacket should appear, as well as the art and maps that accompany the text.These are the notable differences between the first edition and this edition. Due to cost, Tolkien was not able from a production standpoint to have the book appear exactly as he envisioned. The 1937 publication cut some of his artwork, the map was not how he so desired, and the dust jacket, due to printing cost, was limited to three primary colours (green, black, and white). Originally, Tolkien wanted the sun on the front cover and the dragon on the back cover to be totally in red, but this was not feasible.Obviously Tolkien's work is successful enough that these production costs are no longer an issue, and so this is a relatively accurate facsimile of what Tolkien would have wanted to publish in 1937 had money not been an object, as it too often is in the real world. For that, this edition has some worth.Now, there are some negatives. And these are big negatives.First off, paper quality and binding. It's bad.Then there's the actual art work. The colour artwork is quite nicely implemented into the main text, and overall I don't have a problem with the colour artwork from a production standpoint. The paintings are bright and colourful, and remain true to higher quality prints of Tolkien's phenomenal painting. But unfortunately the same cannot be said of the black and white illustrations. Like a reviewer said before me, it appears Tolkien's drawings were reproduced on a cheap scanner. Tolkien's artwork is highly valuable, but unfortunately the drawings here are rather badly reproduced in this edition.Then there's the advertisement for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at the end that's rather annoying. They reproduce the first chapter of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings\\" and place it at the end of the novel, acting like a cheap plug for Tolkien's masterpiece. I don't have any problem with plugging \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but to me this inclusion of the first chapter just cheapens the whole book, especially when it's supposed to be a major edition of a major work. We all know about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Do we really need the first chapter here? Rather tacky, to say the least.Then there's the problem of Christopher Tolkien's forward. This is what I was most looking forward too, actually. Having read E. A. Solinas's review, I was under the impression this was a new forward prepared specifically by Christopher for the 70th anniversary of his father's work. Not the case. It's simply a reprint of the forward he wrote for the 50th anniversary of \\"The Hobbit\\", twenty years previously.As far as textual authenticity, I must be honest in the fact that I've only browsed it at a Borders bookstore, but I'd be very surprised if they did not use the text fromThe Annotated Hobbit, as it is the most definitive and accurate text yet established for the book. Still, I can't verify that that is the case.Overall, this is a fair edition of \\"The Hobbit\\". It could have been a lot more. What sets this apart from the other copies is this is how Tolkien truly envisioned how he wanted the book to appear, and for that fact alone, this is a valuable edition to the Tolkien collector. Unfortunately the poor production quality of the black and while illustrations, the rather tacky inclusion of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"'s first chapter, and the disappointment of the publishers' just reprinting a twenty year old introduction to the 50th anniversary publication rather brings the whole affair down. I think I'll pass on this one.For those looking for the best edition of Tolkien's book, buy \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", first published in 1988 and republished in a new format in 2003. The second version of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", is the definitive edition of this phenomenal work as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The first time I read this I was about 12 years old, and it was just an awesome story.

Then he gets visited by a wizard - Gandalf - who invites some friends of his. Without really asking Bilbo about it first. So, one by one, 13 dwarves show up uninvited on his doorstep and eat all his food, and recruit him for an adventure he doesn't want to go on. An adventure to go see an old dragon called Smaug, kill it, and loot its big cave - because that cave, and indeed the whole mountain, used to belong to the dwarf leader's father back in the pre-dragon days.And the rest of the story is about the party and their journey to said dragon-infested mountain, during which we're introduced to dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins and a creepy creature calling itself Gollum, who has a trinket it's quite attached to. Oh yes, and there is plenty of song lyrics as well. I tend to skip those, because they bore me to tears. I could say the same about Tolkien's prose, but then I'd be lying. It doesn't bore me.It annoys me.My first impression when reading this book is that the tone of it feels incredibly condescending. I'm half-expecting to feel Tolkien pat me on the head at times. Just because you're writing to kids doesn't mean you have to talk down to them. That it was written in the 1930s is not an excuse! We could also argue about the overt racism (\\"goblins must be killed because they are goblins\\"), sexism (where are the girls?), or even weightism (Bombur is a \\"fat person\\" stereotype). There are also 13 dwarves for no reason other than that their names are quaint and funny to say because they rhyme. In truth, the only one with half a personality is Thorin. The rest are just fillers.\\"The Hobbit\\" promises much but is just a lot of dwarves and a hobbit faffing about, roadmovie style, except they're mostly on foot. Perhaps revolutionary at the time and it can't be ignored - or stressed enough - that Tolkien sparked a great genre, but I really prefer other fantasy authors than him.2.5 out of 5 riddles."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A childhood favorite, now in a leatherbound edition. It made a great Christmas gift!

Very amusing for me, and very good for you- and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it,\\" Gandalf said. This is how the great adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakshield, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin and Gloin began. The thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and the wizard Gandalf set off to use \`their' burglar (Bilbo) to steal back the treasure of the dwarves of Dale, stolen in the first place by Smaug the dragon. Gandalf leaves the group after they encountered three trolls, stayed at the home of Elrond, got lost in the goblins' lair, rested at the huge house of the man/bear Beorn, and reached the edge of Mirkwood. From there, the dwarves traveled alone and fought giant spiders, were captured by wood-elves, escaped by hiding in barrels, and were greeted and treated very nicely in Lake-town. Then the group traveled to the Lonely Mountain where the treasure was being watched carefully by Smaug. For a long time the dwarves and Bilbo waited until Smaug left and was killed by a Lake-town man. Then the treasure was fought over by dwarves, men, elves, goblins, eagles, and wolves. Finally the dwarf/elf/man/eagle side won the Battle of Five Armies and peace was restored. Bilbo was at last able to return home safely. I disliked the way this book was written, but I loved the story behind it all and I would recommend it to fantasy-lovers.One reason that I disliked this novel is that often the author would complicate simple things. For example, he would write \\"You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it.\\" Really all he needed, though, was- You will find out about it in a few days. The author definitely over used commas in The Hobbit. Sometimes the amount of detail was good, but a lot of instances the detail and description was confusing. One of the possible explanations for my confusion is the length of the author's sentences. For example, take the sentence, \\"The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky.\\" I had to read this sentence a few times before fully grasping the meaning of it. This is just one of the many paragraph long sentences.One thing I did like about this book, though, was the story line and the characters. Once I finished the book I was able to look at the \\"big picture\\" of the story rather than the specific details. I especially enjoyed the part in the book where Bilbo (with his invisibility ring on) talks to Smaug. I also really liked when Bilbo was playing riddles with Gollum because I could guess them, too. I also liked the character of Bilbo. Even though it seems as though there are many characters, Bilbo is the main character so you come to like his clever, kind, curious, and brave ways.Lastly, I really didn't like the amount of violence in this book, especially in the end. The ways the battles are described are frankly quite gross. For example, during the fight between Bilbo and the dwarves against the spiders, one spider is described, \\"Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks...\\" Also, during The Battle of Five Armies, the valley was described as \\"the goblins were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses.\\" These sentences were very disturbing to read.In conclusion, I didn't really like the way this book was written, but I loved the over all story and characters. The novel was violent and sometimes it was very confusing, but I did enjoy some parts of the book a lot. I recommend this book to fantasy loving readers who have a lot of time to read this novel and who don't mind reading about war.-C.

Anyone under10 would like it. But according to my sister it is a little scary. Some of the adventures have to do with big spiders, dragons, and goblins."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the second time that I have ventured into the mystical and mysterious adventure that is The Hobbit. Professor Tolkien's writing is nothing short of enchanting and informational. His incredible skill to create new languages, peoples, and settings is obvious as you follow little Bilbo Baggins on this curious adventure within the realm of Middle-Earth. This is one of the best fantasy novels that I have had the pleasure to read. Tolkien's follow-up trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, is just as captivating, and I would recommend it as well. Even though the plot twists and turns every which way, the basis of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is none other than the age-old battle of all that is good and evil. I would highly recommend these works of J.R.R. Tolkien to anyone who enjoys getting lost in a good adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Well, this is one of my favorite books ever, and that is why I've read it over and over so many times. To say that it is &quot;just for kids&quot; is like saying that ice cream or watermelon is just for kids. Blasphemy! It is true that Tolkien intended his story for young readers to enjoy, as is evident in the fact that hardly a page goes by in which the narrator does not address children in the first person singular, but the story is never &quot;childish&quot; (in my opinion). Any child reading this story will feel elevated to being at one level with the (adult) narrator. I think it is significant that Tolkien makes the hobbits beardless and &quot;shy of the Big People&quot; and their stature to be &quot;about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves.&quot; They tend to &quot;disappear quietly and quickly when large and stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.&quot; The misgivings that Bilbo has as he is swept off on this adventure, are the misgivings that any child would have... and the fact that he overcomes those fears, learns to live with a determined initiative, becomes a true leader, and emerges a hero in the end is a great lesson for young and old alike.The Hobbit is self-contained, and essentially independent of the three-volume Lord Of The Rings, which, in my opinion is a far more graver sort of quest... perhaps less accessible to the younger reader. It is not necessary to read the Hobbit in order to understand The Lord of The Rings, but The Hobbit serves as a quarry of important themes for the larger work.The Hobbit reminds me of something C.S. Lewis (a friend of Tolkien's) once said of children's literature: &quot;No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty...&quot; The Hobbit surely fulfills this criteria, and so I believe you will be smiling at the end of this book regardless of whether, in doing so, you're displaying baby teeth or dentures at the time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"First things first: If you have NEVER read the Hobbit before, I do not recommend this version. GetThe Hobbit: or, There and Back Again (Collector's Edition)instead. That is a wonderful hardcover collector's edition with a slipcover and beautiful illustrations.Having said that, I will now direct my review towards people who have already read the Hobbit at least once and now wish to lean more about both J.R.R. Tolkien's writing process and the world of Middle-Earth itself.But before I discuss this product I would like to explain why I bought this book in the first place. When Tolkien published the first edition of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins aquired the Ring from Gollum in a slightly different way than that with which we are familiar. Originally Gollum offered to give the ring away as a prize if Bilbo won the riddle contest. A few years later when Tolkien began work on the Lord of the Rings and finally realized what this Ring actually was, he knew that there was no way that Gollum would voluntarily give away the ring. So he went back and rewrote the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter, and to this day every later edition of the book has Bilbo taking the ring in a less-than-honest way. I wanted to read the original text from the first edition. What do you do when you want to read the first version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" but can't afford to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a first edition copy of the Hobbit? Get Douglas A. Anderson's annotated version!What is \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\"? Start with the final edition of the Hobbit that Tolkien published in his lifetime, and center the book around that. Add Anderson's detailed annotations in smaller print in the wide margins of most pages. Add a large collection of illustrations of all sizes, and include appendices in the back. What does Anderson discuss in his annotations? Most notably he quotes the original text from every time Tolkien changed anything from one edition to the next. At one extreme is the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter rewrite included in the margins next to the regular text. At the other extreme are numberous single-word changes. In between the two Anderson detailed every time Tolkien made sentence and paragraph rewrites. Anderson discusses Tolkien's writing process, drawing heavily on Tolkien's published letters and other sources. Anderson cross-references minute details in the Hobbit with LOTR, Silmarillion, Book of Lost Tales, etc, in order to further explain people, events, and places and to point out cases where Tolkien occasionally contradicts himself. Anderson also discusses the impact the Hobbit has had on different audiences throughout the world.The illustrations are splendid. We have all of Tolkien's original (published and unpublished) artwork for the Hobbit. We have the paintings of modern authorities like John Howe, and we have absolutely horrible artwork by illustrators who must not even have read the book - such as early Russian versions. Not only does that make this book a feast for the eyes, but it is interesting to see how different artists have had their own interpretations of Middle-Earth.For anyone who wants more information or more artwork or the original text of \\"Riddles\\", this is the book for you.

I hope I never recover.This was the book that opened up for me the glories of Middle-Earth and introduced me to the genius that was J.R.R. Tolkien.Yes, it's a children's story, differing greatly in tone from both &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. But that's what it is supposed to be. A fairy story in the classic sense. A story which is easily appropriated by children, yet hints at something greater, something deeper, something more intense. A bigger world is out there. The Ring. The Necromancer. The High Elves, Deep Elves, and Sea Elves. Gondolin. Elrond. The Mines of Moria. All hints toward something more.You won't be able to escape. And you won't want to.Start with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Move on to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Then re-read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. You will get more the second time around.Then, read &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. And re-read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Comparable with Chaucer and Shakespeare, J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most influential writers in the English Language. His masterful story telling and tails of adventure can be read on so many levels. Tolkien's style and themes have been imitated time and again, and many words have come into the English language from his works. It's a must-read for a full understanding of the current day culture in all English speaking parts of the world.The Hobbit is a light hearted prequel to Lord of the Rings series. A Hobbit and 13 dwarfs set off on an adventure to fight a dragon and reclaim a lost kingdom. Of course, recovering the dragon's treasure is just an added bonus. They have almost as much trouble and adventure just getting to the dragon as they do when they arrive.The Kindle version of this book is Fantastic!

From a tiny, dog eared paperback that I got free from a RIF event (Reading is Fundamental - they give books to school children) to this graphic novelization. Which is why it is so hard for me to write something bad about this book.I flipping love The Hobbit.But this version is dreadful.First off, it has been abridged. Who in their right mind would cut out parts of the Hobbit?Second off the writing is so teeny weeny and with the pictures running right into the center binding, I had to break the spine to get at the dialogue to read it. Tres annoying.Third, this is sorta a recap of number one, but with the parts left out and then the pictures teeming with activities and characters, well, sometimes it was just plain hard to know what was going on.Anyway, I think instead of this book, I'd rather buy the hardback version of The Hobbit which has pictures at the beginning of each chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The story of , \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, has grown greatly in its telling. This pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s has morphed into the basis of the blockbuster LOTR films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, \\"The Hobbit\\", myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of, \\"The Hobbit\\", ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford!This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something.The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke.This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :).All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

Tolkien's great fantasy classic The Hobbit, but I will tell you about it anyways. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit(smaller, chubbier folk who have six meals a day, and have very hairy feet) who is living a very easy, relaxing life in his home at Bag End. One fine morning while Bilbo is puffing his smokepipe, the mysterious wizard Gandalf comes along with a band of 13 homeless dwarves asking Bilbo to be the fourteenth member of their adventure through dangerous forests, giant spiders, menacing trolls, savage wolves, and other unknown dangers! Bilbo is persuaded to go and finally it will be Bilbo alone to face the fear of an entire countryside, the great dragon Smaug! J.R.R. Tolkien brilliantly takes you through a marvelous fantasy world in Middle Earth as Bilbo and friends go on their epic adventure. There are plenty of amazing settings and wild creatures. He keeps you on the edge of your seat as Bilbo and company pull off one miracle after another. The copy of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien that I read was published in 1982 by Ballentine Books.

All the various illustrations will no doubt interest younger readers as well.Anderson does perpetuate a couple of myths (such as the notion that Tolkien's Elves had pointed ears) but his research is generally regarded as some of the best in the world and that is well-deserved praise. The book includes all the changes Tolkien ever made to The Hobbit in an appendix which is non-intrusive. There is also an extensive bibliography for further reading.But maybe the best reason to buy the book (if/when it is printed again) is its size. It's a nice, big cuddly book that is easy for an adult to hold, especially if you're reading to a child in your lap or beside you.

He enjoyed the book a lot and even asked if he could read it to me. The book is \\"addicting\\", it makes you want to constantly read on. \\"What will happen to Bilbo next?\\" \\"Where is Gandalf?\\" It also helps that Tolkien used \\"Deus ex machina\\"(Latin for god from machine), meaning that out of nowhere one of the characters will save the day, and that he used this method correctly by only using Gandalf for this once in a while and then not using him anymore.**The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from Bag End in the Shire, and his being forced into a journey to steel back treasure from Smaug for thirteen dwarves that think he is a theif. His is forced into this journey by Gandalf, a wizard and old friend of Bilbo's family on the Took side, and his secret need to find go on an adventure, which is frowned upon by hobbits.

Tolkien also uses vivid imagery to give us an idea of what this world is like. Also, Tolkien use of foil through Thorin and Bilbo helps readers further understand characters. The Hobbit is strengthened through the use of the indirect characterization, the vivid imagery, and the use of foil. The best example of the characterization is when we first meet Bilbo, and when Bilbo is described to us in the end of the book. In the beginning Bilbo is described as quiet and reticent. But by the end of the book, we see through Bilbo's actions what he is really like, which is courageous, brave, and does what always is right. Tolkien also helps readers further understand the characters by using foil through Bilbo and Thorin. The characteristics of the two are completely opposite, Thorin being brave, doing what he likes, and confrontational, while Bilbo is timid, reticent, and taciturn. Tolkien helps readers imagine what the world is like by telling us what each land is like when the dwarfs and Bilbo crossed the mountains. Tolkien basically paints out the entire scene for the readers making them feel like they were just a few feet away from the other characters. All three of this literary devices together help strengthen the story. So that the reader doesn't feel like they are just reading, but that they are there in the book and know exactly what the characters are like."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I really enjoyed this novel from beginning to end.

As a fairy tale style story it can be read to young children and generally enjoyed, but the true depth of the story is mainly appreciated by those old enough to read between the lines and understand what an amazing and detailed world Tolkien has created and placed this story in.Unfortunetly, the &quot;bed-time story&quot; style of writing can put off some older and most young adult or teen readers who find the book too childish for their likings. To anyone who feels this way after reading through a few pages all I can say is this - allow yourself to get past the all of that. Pay attention to the great characters and excellent story. And then look deeper and appreciate the wonderful and deep world Tolkien has created. From Bilbo's Hobbit-hole to the Last Homely House to Smaug's Lair every location is detailed and rich with character.If you haven't read The Hobbit, go read it right now.

And every subsequent read allows you to peel away more layers and see deeper into the world of Middle-earth.

Tolkien's The Hobbit will take your imagination on a wonderful, magnificent flight of fantasy and enchantment that it has never experienced before. Starting with the first page, Tolkien will grab your attention and reel you further and further away from reality and into this magical world he has created. This world is like none other, and is described right down to the mountains that surround it and the sky that engulfs it. Tolkien describes exactly what's happening in every scene and enables you to picture every plant, every cloud in the sky, and every character depicted in such a way that you will never forget. The storyline is so extremely fascinating and addicting, that you won't want to put down the book. Tolkien's attention to detail is magnificent, and his imagery is outstanding. The action scenes are extremely suspenseful, and they force you to read on in order to see what will happen next.The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read, and I recommend it to people all ages, especially those who have an interest toward mythology and fantasy. Don't get the conception from the front cover that this is a child's book, for it is far from that. The Hobbit not only will titillate your imagination, it will reflect certain truths about the real world. The Hobbit addresses the problem of determining the \\"right\\" way for a hobbit, or any ordinary person, to live his life. Should one concern himself with great deeds and wars, and risk losing the humble perspective afforded by the simple life? Or should the ordinary person never look outside his or her own quiet existence, and risk ignoring the larger perspective that might have allowed him to do great things for the common good?

A couple of months later, I blew off the dust and made the decision to really READ it. I couldn't believe all the good stuff I had missed. I loved it. Skimming doesn't seem to work for this series, unless you've read them before.Anyway, The Hobbit was a great book.

Their mission: to find the treasure of Thorin's (head dwarf, descended from kings) ancestors and desolate Smaug, the feared dragon of The Mountain. Bilbo's occupation is a thief; not swiping radios from the nearest department store, but helping the company retrieve the treasure.Though doubtful at first, the dwarves begin to admire Bilbo in his talent to get out of nasty scrapes (of which there are several).

Nevertheless, the prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is endowed with its own special magic that captures the attention and imagination of its readers and takes them to a place that is as real as it is fantasy: a place of hobbits and dwarves, a place of trolls and elves, of spiders and dragons, of heroes and goats. In fact, Middle Earth can be likened to the whereabouts of our own subconsciousness and its function as the battleground for competing human emotions and values.As the story opens, we are introduced to a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a creature not unlike a munchkin in appearance but perhaps less squeaky in voice. Passive and gentle, he is recruited by the mysterious wizard Gandalf to contrast the abrasive nature of Thorin and Co. (a group of dwarves on a quest to recapture their stolen treasure from the clutches of Smaug the Dragon). How can this unassuming and timid little being possibly be the protagonist? Indeed, he is of little value early in the dwarves' quest. Yet Bilbo's latent desires for adventure (attributed to his Took side, as we are so informed) are slowly awakened, and soon we are taken aback by his ability to manipulate enemies and rescue his friends time and time again. Still, it's hard to root for the dwarves, controlled as they are by their greed and selfishness, and eventually they have to pay for their sins. It may be too late before Thorin and Co. come to value the hobbit's appreciation for cheer and brotherhood over gold and other material possessions. Is not unity and charity better than suspicion and avarice?Some may bicker that Tolkien's approach is too straightforward. And granted, \\"The Hobbit\\" isn't very Dickensian when it comes to names. Heck, one of the huge, ugly trolls the dwarves encounter is called William. With a name like that, I had trouble picturing a troll at all and thought he might start up a conversation with, \\"Excuse me my dear Thomas, but it appears you have some mutton on your face. Care for some more tea and crumpets?\\" Irrespective of a handful of critics, however, most readers will come to love \\"The Hobbit\\" for its enchanting scenic representation of Middle Earth, its memorable characters (especially Gollum and Beorn) and its original storytelling. Best of all is it's wonderful simplicity and an opening that's as a portal to escapism: \\"In the hole in the ground there lived a hobbit...\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the book that started it all.

It turns into a real page turner towards the end. Please pick up this book and you will be whisked away to the enchanting land Tolkien creates. It's a great escape from the day-to-day drone we are used to."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is great! It should be a cornerstone for future authors so they may know what true writing is all about! The book portrays the adventures of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins as he is hired on a quest for treasure. He finds courage and adventure in him he never knew existed until he travelled from his home to the lonely mountain, where the treasure is along with a dragon, and many more trials and tribulations on the long journey in between. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone and everyone. This book has such a faced pace edge to it that the action never stops. As soon as you think that the character couldn't possibly entangle hisself in any more ordeals, the story takes a new twist and has you on the edge of your seat. You will find yourself wanting to be right alongside the title character, Bilbo Baggins, fighting goblins and puzzling a nightmarish creature named Gollum! This book was so well written and the detail tolkein put into this book makes it immortal. You can see everything that tolkein saw when he wrote this book. I commend tolkein for such an outstanding job he did with this book.

I have never been able to read a book very easily because I could never pay attention long enough, but this book really caught my attention the whole time.To begin with, a wizard visits the hobbit, whose name is Bilbo Baggins. The wizard puts a mark on the hobbit's door and then leaves. Later twelve dwarves visit the hobbit. They hire him as a burglar to help in their quest.He finally decides to go along, but highly against his own will. They start on the journey and have all sorts of strange happenings that occur. They encounter goblins and are taken into the depths of a very large underground network of tunnels. Here, Bilbo finds a ring that is quite magical. He does not know it yet, but the ring will prove to be a very vital part of their quest.After the goblins, they meet a man who is both Man and Bear. They manage to ask him for food and lodging for a while, though he does not like strangers. At night, Bilbo hears sounds of scratching and thumping, but does not dare to get up for fear of being eaten by Beorn, who is the Man/Bear. In addition, Beorn's animals have the ability to communicate with him and can do most anything that a regular man can.The Mirkwood Forest is quite peculiar in itself. The group of twelve dwarves and Bilbo must travel through a forest that is extremely dark. Although it is daytime, the forest is very dimly lit because all the trees form a canopy, which blocks all the light. Near the end of the forest, they become lost. They are forced to battle huge spiders and are eventually captured Wood-elves.Bilbo slips on his ring in time and is able to follow the elves as they take the dwarves to the cavernous hideout. Each dwarf is questioned to try to find out why he is traveling through the Mirkwood Forest. None will give the answer that the Elf King is looking for, so he throws them all in prison.While the dwarves are in prison, being quite well fed, Bilbo figures out a means of escape for all of the dwarves and himself. He also has time to learn quite a lot about the inside of the elf cavern. Bilbo gets the chance when a guard and another man go and taste the new wine that has been brought. Both become drunk and fall asleep. Bilbo is able to get all the dwarves out and himself.After this, they are not far from the dragon's lair. Smaug has taken all of the dwarve's treasure in gold and jewels and is in a cave on the Lonely Mountain. The quest of the small company is to reclaim the treasure that is rightfully the dwarves'. Bilbo faces Smaug and...I cannot tell you what happens, that would ruin it. They also face a war, but you will have to read to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed and easy to remember. I usually lose track of who is who in a book, but this book was easy to keep track of the characters. The book is actually quite believable if the reader looks past the fact that the characters are dwarves and a hobbit. I was quite lost throughout the book wondering what the characters were actually feeling. I felt this was a very believable story.I have never been able to sit down and read a book as easily as I did this one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book. It keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat and has action in almost every page that is read. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter who he or she is. This book is deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit,\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fantasy adventure about a group of dwarves going on an adventure with the assistance of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. The wizard who suggested Bilbo as the last member of the team is named Gandalf. Gandalf chose Mr. Baggins because he is no ordinary Hobbit, he is a burglar. Hobbits personify small people, roughly half the size of humans, with hair on their feet, round bellies, and love food and comfort. This is why Mr. Baggins is such a successful burglar, noone would suspect it from him. The adventure that the Hobbit and thirteen dwarves embark on is to a land called Lonely Mountain, the home of the evil dragon Smaug. The fourteen plan to reclaim the dwarves' lost treasure that Smaug has taken. Along the path to Lonely Mountain are many dangerous obsticles they have to avoid. They are captured or almost killed by trolls, goblins, wood elves, spiders, wargs, a Gollum, and Smaug. During the close encounter with the Gollum, Mr. Baggins finds a golden ring on the ground. He finds out after the Gollum's riddle contest that it is no ordinary ring, for it has the power to make whoever wears it, invisible. This ring comes in handy throughout the rest of the book during their later close encounters. In the end of the book, the original fourteen reach Smaug the Dragon and......you'll have to find out for yourself. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, symbolizes a big adventure for such a small character. He symbolizes that no matter how small and worthless you or others think you are, if you really try you will be able to accomplish anything. The theme of the book is teamwork, the thirteen dwarves would never have been able to accomplish what they did if Mr. Baggins didn't accompany them. The narration is told as a third person point of view, \\"Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was.\\" The tone of the book was told in a much warmer and more humorous way than most fantasy books that I've read. This is shown during the whole adventure, \\"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me!\\" The Hobbit is one of the best books I have ever read. Other books I would recommend would be all four \\"Harry Potter\\" books. I would recommend \\"The Hobbit\\" to anyone who likes magical and imaginary tales. Never during the book could I say that it was boring or too long. \\"The Hobbit\\" was so good that it has lead me into reading the next book in the series, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This piece was enlightening to read because I have just recently watched, &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; and I didn't understand it very well.

The story line keeps reader's in anticipation as to what is going to happen next. This book gave the before look at how the hobbits lived and more in depth about Frodo. It explains the living styles of the hobbits(like what they enjoyed doing to their work habits for a day's time.

The Hobbit is truly a masterpiece, for all ages, and is not corny or just for kids. I beleive that any adult would enjoy this book as much as I did.

Someday, I hope to read The Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit takes place in a fantasyland called Middle-Earth. The story is about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with a group of dwarves to steal their treasure back from a dragon who stole it from the dwarves a long time before this. The main character is Bilbo, a hobbit that lives in the Shire. Other main characters are Thorin, leader of the dwarves and heir to the gold that a dragon named Smug stole from his family, and Gandalf, a wizard that added Bilbo to the group and helped them as much as he could on their adventure. The story is about Bilbo, who gets stuck with an adventure being a thief. Which is funny because he has no clue how to be a thief or even to steal from someone. He and a group of 13 dwarves lead by Thorin go on an adventure and steal the dwarve's gold from a dragon. The whole trip across the mountains led them to many little adventures, with trolls and goblins and other creatures of Middle-Earth. My favorite character is Gandalf because he is very smart and knows everything about everything (well pretty much, anyway).At one time I was much like Bilbo. Not really afraid to have any adventures, just saw no reason for them. Then I got to High School and that all changed. Much like how Bilbo did, with a friend showing him the way. Gandalf started him on his adventure and a friend named Bobby started me on mine. Bobby taught me that taking a risk every once in a while wouldn't do much harm and that changed my whole life around. Much like how Bilbo met Gandalf, I met my friend. Bobby was a friend of one of my family members. Just like Gandalf was Took's friend, who is one of Biblo's family members. Right when I met him he began changing me. He showed me many adventures and changed my life much like Gandalf did for Bilbo.When I first opened the book I thought it might be a little strange, but the book was amazing. It is now my favorite book. It is very hard to pick a favorite part in this book because there is so many, but if I had to pick, the part where Bilbo starts killing all the spiders and names his sword Sting. Tolkien writes so well I could see this part taking place in my head. And if I had to change one thing I would change the lack of information. I want to know more about Beorn and the Necromancer.I think if someone likes to read; they will like this book. It is so much more then a fantasy, more like a life lesson.

This book is a classic example of great fantasy, with the elves, hobbits, dwarves, goblins, men, dragons, and much more.

Tolkien has a tendency to make everything evil or good, with the exception of gollum and the hobbits(the most interesting characters). Thus, the characters have no depth and the places are boring. He describes every bush too. It drives me crazy. It is like this:And then the party came to a knoll. A more wonderful knoll the hobbit had never known, and his heart was filled with joy. Then after the beautiful knoll, the small party came to a plateau. The plateau was very evil. Dark evil things fluttered about and bla bla bla.....It really is garbage, but the hobbit is saved because it is funny and ventures into the gray area. Tolkein never understood the fanatics of his books, and neither do I. They truly are crazy.

This book introduces the character Gollum and explains how the Ring came to be in The Shire.

Read about the invention of Golf (in a ridiculous way), the riddles between Gollum and Bilbo and the humorous portrayal of Gandalf as an almighty but occasionally vulnerable wizard. There is only one main storyline about Bilbo and the dwarves heading to defy Smaug, the dragon, in order to uncover their lost treasure, but despite this, their journey is interestingly full of ups and downs. Tolkien, once again, proves his immense creativity by placing his characters in absurb and hilarious positions. Even Gandalf, the supposedly dignified wizard, has been reduced to getting cornered high up on a tree or stuffing himself silly on bread, cream and honey. Needless to say, the title &quot;The Hobbit&quot; indicates that the story revolves around Bilbo Baggins and his misadventures.Simply said, this is one book that wants to make you read on and on.

Bilbo lives a normal, everyday life in the village of hobbits called the Shire, until he is pushed out of his comfortable life by 13 dwarves to join them on a quest to reclaim stolen gold.In the beginning Bilbo has little confidence in himself but as the story goes on he discovers courage in himself that he never believed he had. Their adventure takes many twists and turns as they get closer to their destination, the lair of the dangerous and greedy dragon, Smaug.Bilbo and the dwarves encounter many obstacles along the way including their run-in with three hungry trolls, and their skirmish with a group of huge spiders. If you are curious to find out the fate of Bilbo and the rest of the unforgettable characters, you have to read this book.I thought it was very fun to read and understand more of JRR Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth\\" after being familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937, but it was revised in 1966 to fit the plot of the later three books in the lord of the rings series. The revised edition was not printed until 1982. This fantasy is a prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is Bilbo's story of Thorin (son of Thrain son of Thror, king under the mountain)'s quest to recapture his grandfathers long lost treasures. Gandalf, a Wizard, received a map from Thorin's father on his death bead with instructions to give it to Thorin, the rightful heir of the map and helped him find a party to go on his quest. The group included Bilbo the hobbit-burglar, Killi, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bombur, Bilfur, Bofur, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, and Thorin, all dwarves. They faced many challenges on their journey. They had a conflict with the wolves, the elves, old fat spiders that would love to eat dwarves for supper, and most of all Smaug, the dragon of the mountain.Tolkien chose third person omniscient to write The Hobbit. It is almost exclusively told from Bilbo's point of view. He also chose to have the narrator talk to the audience, which seems unusual for a novel.&quot;Well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.&quot; Pg 2.Tolkien has a distinctive writing style:&quot;Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome-there was not a doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening the \\"doorstep\\" in fun remembering Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit hole, when he said they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit they did, or wandered aimlessly about and glummer and glummer they became.&quot; pg. 205-206.It is oblivious that he did a beautiful job incorporating description and the plot into the same paragraphs to create a story that is constantly moving, yet full of imagery.A less appealing aspect of his writing is the way the author gave oral storyteller foreshadowing such as the last sentence of this quote:&quot;\\"I am too fat for such fly-walks,\\" he said. \\"I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.\\" Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&quot; Pg. 207This seems to take your train of thought out of the book. Foreshadowing should be something that requires the reader to scrutinize the dialog and descriptions for clues that can be combines to deduce how the story will unfold.I recommend the Hobbit to anyone whether they have loved or despised fantasies in the past. The plot will keep anyone interested in the book until the end, and it takes less than a dozen pages to develop. His unusual writing style has its positives and negatives, but anyone will fall in love with his intertwined descriptions and action in the never slowing fantasy adventure of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a story of a calm hobbit named Bilbo Baggins that lives in his hobbit hole and likes peace and quiet.

The Hobbit is a much easier novel to read than the Lord of the Rings, and is just as good. The novel is also more lighthearted and aimed at younger readers. Tolkein is a masterful story teller, and I could sense the enjoyment he must have felt from telling his stories. The way he writes, the words he uses, shows the fun he had writing this novel. However, I feel there is somewhat less excitement in this novel than in the Lord of the Rings.~~ Maybe it is because the Lord of the Rings is longer or has graver consequences. Anyway, it is still a enjoyable read, and much quicker to finish than the Lord of the Rings.What is it about. Bilbo Baggins has an adventure, which is quite unusual for Hobbits. He with a group of dwarves set out to slay the mighty dragon Smaug and recover their treasure. There are many obstacles in reaching the dragon, and then the must find a way to rid their treasure of its guardian. Now that I have~~ read the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, one of my favorite parts of reading the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is noting references by Tolkien to Gondolin or Beren or Turgon.If you have seen the movies, and are interested in Tolkien's novels, this is a great one to start with.

Tolkien's Hobbit has created a 20th Century myth base on the Jungian archetype of modern man' search for a mysticalcenter. The key to the Hobbit is that is the beginning of theatomic essence of the great journey of the Hero. The call toadventure is the beginning of the trilogy of the Lord of the Ring. The universal secret of the Hobbit is that he has achieved the power of riddle of the Egyptian god thoth who hasgiven man the cleverness of speech but not the &quot;gravitas&quot; of speech. This gives him a superficial victory over ring. TheLord of the Ring brings Frido into the second stage of the callto adventure which prepares the hero to enter the underworldwhich is controlled by the powers of darkness and chaos. Thelife and death struggle lead not only to the destruction ofthe ring but the recovery of the great boon or great treasure that reveals the secret of Tolkien: the bliss is the greatcenter of the human quest. The bliss of discovery andknowledge of the real vs. illusion; good vs. evil and thereality of enviroment over the commerical poisioning of Gaia.The trials and tribulation are part of the Two Towers andthe Return of the King represent the struggle to escape fromdrowning in the evil and poison of the soul. Frido must returnto the world or face a Rip Van Winkle sleep into the ages ofevil. The grand epic of the Lord of the Rings captures themythic quality of human existence which transcends race, sex,nationality and re-affirms Jungs universal discovery of theprofound meaning of myth which has been lost and found in thetwentieth century. Jung like Tolkien had been in a T.S. EliotWasteland of World War I and the utter collapse of WesternCivilization into the dustpan of history. The Tolkien mythhas attempted to re-integrate Marcuse's One dimensional Maninto a new world based on new languages and new insight intothe Middle Earth.

TolkeinA ReviewWell, after reading the whole Lord of the Rings series in the summer of 2001 for the first time, I soon afterwards purchased the Hobbit and read it. Let me start by saying the anything by Tolkein is OVERRATED! Sure, he practically kickstarted the fantasy genre into creation (although not all of his concepts are original; most are based on historical mythology), and therefore is responsible for an unimaginable amount of literature and content in the world today. Without Tolkein's the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, there would be no Dungeons and Dragons, and therefore no true joy in my life, hehe.Anyway, the LOTR series was, admittedly (in which I admit in a somewhat resigned, even grudging, fashion) an excellent work. Tolkien has been heralded by many as quite possibly the best author of all time, but I beg to differ!Okay, just because the Hobbit gave birth to fantasy means NOTHING to me!!! Listen to the following, and you will discover why I did give this book a five out of five rating but why I do not feel it does not entirely deserve such a high rating. Without a doubt it is a classic, respected and adored by many worldwide. Is that reason enough to call it one of the best books of the century? Well, I most certainly do not think so! Why not? Look at it this way: if one could rate one of the very first computers, those Apple/Macs that were so big and expensive that they took up a whole room, would one give such a computer a 5/5 just because, at the time, it was the best in the industry? OF COURSE NOT. One does not term such a computer a &quot;classic&quot; because if it weren't for that exact computer many technological advances in computer technology would have not even existed today? A bit confusing, perhaps, but the TRUTH. The fact is, that the Hobbit really isn't altogether anything remarkable, at least in comparison to the other fantasy books out today.It's still good, though, I'll admit. Why do I feel this way, though, compared to all the other reviews? Most likely because I'm a heavy fantasy reader, and am used to reading much more complex, intricate, and contemporary fantasy than Tolkein. Furthermore, the fiction I read is so much more fast-paced and with hundreds of gallons of adrenaline that the Hobbit seems like something of a ROAD-BLOCK in my mind.Nonetheless, I cannot deny that I DID enjoy the book and Tolkein is an exceptional writer, his imagination so great that he created an entire genre never before considered. I also recognize this book as one of the best books of the 20th century. How could it not be, after all, considering that it created a whole new genre?! I guess these comments and remarks are a bit contrary to my earlier rants in the review, but really I like Tolkien's books. My only problem with them is that I feel they are OVERRATED. Not too overrated, but overrated nonetheless.So, to sum up my review and to give the read of this review an undeniable verdict, I advise them, regardless of their circumstances, to somehow get ahold of this book and read it. It is written in a very archaic fashion, which is another something I have difficulty enjoying, but it is, without a doubt, the most original, imaginative book ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I thought this to be a truly adventurous book. I have rated this book with 4 stars because at the beginning it was hard to get hooked into the book, but once you were hooked you couldn't put it down. I think that the climax in this book is towards the middle when Bilbo Baggins confronts the horrible red dragon, with the armor of jewels and scales. A description of Bilbo's personality is kind of challenging. I think that he has a fairly diverse personality. Gandalf on the other hand is full of suprises, but can be very serious if need be. There was something different about each dwarf and I would have to say that Bombur is my favorite. He is the lazy, fat one who loves food and of course Bilbo's friendship. I thought that the lowest part of the story would have to be at the very beginning, well the first 50 pages or so. What I love most about the whole story is the folklore and magic that drips from almost every page, and the adventure and mystery that fills up nearly every paragraph.

Bilbo discovered his ring made him invisible, and decided to make a deal with the creature. The creature was hungry, so Bilbo said that if he lost at a competition, the creature could eat him. If Bilbo won though, the creature would show him the way out. They decided to tell riddles, and by slightly cheating, Bilbo won and escaped. After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo.

After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo. When he was in the cave, he saw a small place where the dragon armor didn't cover the flesh. It was conveniently located near the heart. It was a tough shot, but a young archer in the town had a good arrow. One shot and the dragon plunged into the ocean, killing it and disabling it forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I think it is a really interesting book about a hobbit that goes on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain with his dwarf friends.

An author's work deserves to be viewed as created by the author, not as condensed and interpreted by actors/directors, in the case of a movie dramatization or the audio presentation of a book.That being said, I am willing to endorse this dramatized version of J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The storyline is true to the book, as are the dialogs. This Four CD collection presents an opportunity to listen to several hours of a classical fantasy tale, complete with songs, pronunciations of elven and dwarven words and names, and limited, appropriate, sound effects.I played the CD's in the car on a long road trip; it helped to keep my mind occupied as the miles ticked away. I purchased the CD version over the Cassette version of this B.B.C. production so that I might use this collection to entertain, and very likely introduce to the genre of Fantasy, my future children. I wholeheartedly recommend this collection to parents, and future parents."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The 70th anniversary edition has some nice extras -- Tolkien's son Christopher wrote a new prologue for it, which is never quite as interesting as it should be. It also contains reedited text, foldouts, and it apparently has all of Tolkien's quirky, solid illustrations.That's more, this nicely-bound edition includes a duplicate of the original cover, from when the book was originally published -- a gorgeous scenic view of mountains, forests and sky, all done in black, green and blue, with runes all around the edges.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book can be a great purchase for two reasons. Those that love the Hobbit story and appreciate it as one of the greatest classic fanasty tales ever written, and would enjoy learning some 'behind the scences' history and info themselves (not exluding alternate covers and artwork from editions printed in other languages). It is a great purchase to add to your own library.Also, it works well as a gift. If you know a Tolkien lover who already seems to have all of his basic works and some hard to find ones to boot. They may not have thought about adding an annotated version to the stack. This is a great way to give them something inexpensive that they are sure to treasure for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I loved the illustration by Alan Lee in this version. He is so gifted. Just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"After seeing the epic motion picture trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga can be difficult to picture individually for readers. This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I am a sixth grader.The Hobbit by J.R.R. TolkienOne thing interesting about this book the Hobbit is the Giant Spider Attack when they barely have any supplies. Do you think they make it alive safely? To answer the question you must read this exciting book of fantasy, adventures, and an impossible quest. If you read this book I know you'll love it, becasue I thought it was GREAT!! There are many main characters in this book but the real main character is the Hobbit himself. The other characters are Gandalf (Wizard), Smaug (the Dragon)and the rest are the dwarfs named Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin. The first time the Hobbit heard a ding-dong on the door Gandalf was not there. Only one to come for teatime was a dwarf named Dwalin and he wanted coffee. After that all of the other dwarfs kept coming in his hobbit hole all thirteen dwarfs from a far off land. It all started with Bilbo or Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit), and a wizard named Gandalf had teatime on Wednesday. Thorin asked Bilbo to accompany Gandalf and the dwarfs on a quest. Biblo was thinking real hard about it if he should go, but finally agreed. When the dwarfs told Bildo they were homeless and on their own, plus to help them retrieve their stolen riches from Smaug the merciless Dragon who burns towns and a terror of the entire countryside. When Thorin (Dwarf) had a map to Smaug Palace and realized they had to kill the Dragon to save the contryside and get the dwarfs stolen riches back with the help of the Hobbit who has a special ring. You'll have an incredible adventure and excitement of a lifetime. Your New Fantasy World is just beginning."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was easily one of the best books I have ever read in my lifetime. This book has inspired me to continue reading the trilogy of the Lord of the rings. The size of the books look intimidating, but if they are as good as The Hobbit, then it should be worth it.The Hobbit was everything i looked for in a book. It was packed full of action, packed fool of fantasy, and packed full of dialogue that never bored you. Every chapter set the stage for the one that was to follow. It always left you reading and never being able to find a spot to stop because you want to see what occurs next in the plotline.Gandalf definitely stood out as a peculiar character to follow. In this story, it is very hard to tell what his real agenda is. It APPEARS that he wants Bilbo to go on his adventure for danger and excitement, but maybe what he really wants is what's best for him (Bilbo).Bilbo never intended on leaving The Shire to begin with, and ever since he took that first step out of the door, he continuously wishes he was back home sitting in front of a fire reading a nice book smoking some pipe weed. He faces some very hard trials on his journey to the Lonely Mountain. From almost being eaten by trolls, to being captured by the woodland elves. Still, Bilbo and his gang of friendly dwarves manage to continue onward.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who has a fetish for fantasy books and action books. Take it from me; this book never leaves you bored at any point at all. Once you start reading and getting into the events of the story, you will find it very hard to find a place to leave off for another day."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I knew when I ordered the book that it was hard back, but when I opened the box and there was this beautiful green box with a very beautiful green book inside with a picture and the gold writing around the edge I was very pleased. It was much more than I was expecting. There are pictures inside that are illistrated by the author. This book has most definatly lived up to \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" legacy. It is truly a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Step back from the age of Aragorn, and indulge yourself in the prelude to the exciting Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit, another beautifully crafted work by J.R.R. Tolkien, is not only breathtaking but also full of surprises. Small and puny in size, the shy Mr. Bilbo Baggins follows a journey to help recover the long lost treasure of the grim dwarves that he eventually becomes comfortable with. From a mountain full of vicious goblins to killing eight-legged creatures to the cunning and ferocious dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, Mr. Bilbo trips upon adventure after adventure as he builds his respect and confidence as a tiny being in the vast world of Middle Earth.In this conglomeration of exhilarating events, I could not decide where it was most exciting for me. Yet what stood out the most was the hobbit&iexcl;s witty ways in challenging the large colony of spiders in the shadowy forest of Mirkwood, where a significant amount of the plot is set. The amusing part of this event was how the hobbit deviously distracts the spiders by throwing showers of pebbles and stones in his invisible self (he had already obtained the ring of lord Sauron at this stage), in order to save his fellow dwarves from captivity. In addition, his &iexcl;battle&iexcl; against these spiders also demonstrates courageous themes that had a touching effect amid the excitement: do not belittle little people, and expect from the unexpected. Indeed, this was so for hobbits were described as little Halflings that preferred comfortable settings, had no taste in bold and audacious adventures, and were nothing of worries. Yet Mr. Bilbo Baggins, with a taste of adventure in his ancestral blood, defied that by defeating a few of these spiders in the process of saving his warrior companions, which emotionally tied me in with these brave themes (mentioned above). It is no wonder this novel was so thrilling.I would highly recommend The Hobbit, not only to those fantasy-lovers out there, but to any other general reader. The Hobbit is well-fashioned to a degree where it is not too supernatural nor too dull and dry, since Tolkien&iexcl;s style is a tad dry. Nevertheless, The Hobbit is a novel worth reading and enjoying, for I assure you that it will definitely seize in the fantastic world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins and his companions through a journey into the perils of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Wow!

Reading this book was like a cherished homecoming to me. I saw the movie Monday, downloaded the book on Tuesday and I've finished it on Sunday.My comments are about the Kindle edition. All in all it is not bad - it contains the line-drawing illustrations through the book, which is lovely. But the maps are disappointing. The map of the Wilderlands is at the back (fine in a paper book but awkward in a Kindle) and I completely missed Thror's map at the front - for some reason when I downloaded this book it started me out in the Author's Notes section, so I didn't see the cover, table of contents, or map until after I finished and went looking for it. Maybe this was just a glitch on my Kindle but watch out for it.Both maps, sadly, are almost impossible to read on a small Kindle (can't comment on how they'd look on a Kindle Fire etc). You can't see any of the detail and you can hardly read most of the words. It's not like you can't follow the story without the maps, but part of the joy of Tolkien is poring of his maps.I would give the book itself 5 stars, but the Kindle edition gets 4.

Tolkien definitely tells the Hobbit in a much more innocent, almost-naive voice, which is understandable, considering (1) he hadn't fully conceived of the darker-themed LOTR at the time, and (2) it is a children's story.While it is a children's story, The Hobbit is still a masterpiece that anybody can enjoy.

It is definately for people who can get deep into fantasy and like to use their imagination. It is the stunning prequel to the Lord of the Ring trilogy and an excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of middle earth. This is the story where it all began. Mr. Bilbo Baggins strikes out with his dwarves companions on a mission to retrieve dwarvish gold from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way, they encounter more than their fair share of adventure, which includes Beron the Bear-Man, Gandolf, elves, trolls and even giant spiders. Not only is this book by istelf a good book, it it will also help you understand the trilogy better. It helps to explain how a simple Hobbit is transformed from a shy non adventurous person to someone who fights goblis, trolls and dragons. It also helps to explain how this shy Hobbit comes in contact with the dreaded ring of power. If you are a lover of adventure, travel, mystery and magic, I strongly suggest that you read J.R.R. Tolkien's, \\"The Hobbit\\". You can go on many great adventures, cross mountains over the lush lands of Rivendell, and the dark forest of Mirkwood. J.R.R. Tolkien creates vivid pictures that make everything seem so real. You can imagine yourself anywhere the author puts you. If you have read the Lord of the Ring series, but haven't read \\"The Hobbit\\", I would strongly recommend this book. Even if you have only seen the movies, this book will help the whole series come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit . . .\\"To explore imaginary worlds and have adventures with the inhabitants, Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", a novel filled with the author's imagination, is the one to read. Published in the 1930s, this novel is still loved by many readers and is known throughout the world, and its sequals, which are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, are famous as well. They were read during a time before \\"Harry Potter\\".Using his love of languages and cultures, John Ronald Ruel Tolkien created a world of his own, where the cultures of imaginary/mythical creatures, such as Dwarfs, Elves and Dragons, live in. In this book, we journey through the land of Middle Earth, and there, we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, or, in other words, a halfling, a little man, smaller than Dwarfs and humans and lacking a complete beard.In the land of Middle Earth, the Dwarf, Thorin Oakenshield, is determined to recover his ancestor's treaures, which now lay in the hands of the Dragon, Smaug, a fearsome and evil creature. Yet Thorin is willing to go there. So he asks help from Gandalf the Grey wizard and the other Dwarfs, who venture into forests, fields, rivers, and mountains, getting caught by trolls and any other creepy creature. But Thorin is not the hero of this story . . .During the times of trouble in the book, there comes surprise help. During times of hardship, they learn patience and persistance. And on a mission like this, there comes the MOST unexpected idea for a hero!Filled with imagination and heart warming characters, The Hobbit is novel of epic proportions, and is one that your family will enjoy! With memorable scenes, you can laugh, especially when Bilbo picks on a troll's pocket. You can fell the humor as the as he faces Smaug, the action when the Elves battle the feared dragon, and in the end, you'll have sweet dreams after bedtime. As I said before, your whole family will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is the prequel to The Lord of the Rings and tells the story of how Bilbo Baggins acquires the ring that becomes the central focus of that trilogy, however it also has its own story to tell. In fact other than Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, this book has little connection to the trilogy that would follow it other than introducing readers to the world of Middle Earth. In fact, it is written in a completely different style. The prose of The Hobbit has more of a fairy tale feel to it than the straight-forward fantasy of The Lord of the Rings. This gives the book a large appeal to children, but it can still be enjoyed by readers of all ages.In The Hobbit, the wizard Gandalf involves Bilbo in an adventure (despite hobbits' aversion to such escapades) with a company of dwarves. They seek to repossess a treasure that is rightfully theirs and is currently in the lair of the dragon Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo and his companions encounter trolls, elves, goblins, giant spiders, and a host of other fantasy story creatures. Bilbo also encounters the strange creature, Gollum, in a diversion from the main story. In this part of the book, readers meet one of the most memorable creatures of all fantasy literature in a fateful encounter that sets the stage for Frodo's later adventures. Of course Gandalf and Bilbo also rank up there among the most recognized characters of fantasy literature as well.The Hobbit gives readers an introduction to Tolkien's world of Middle Earth which is probably one of the best developed worlds in fantasy literature. Every creature in his world is alive, even the plants and the birds. This gives an animated and lively feel to the world that keeps the reader engrossed in the story. Tolkien also does a masterful job of contrasting the feeling of safety and security in places like the shire and Elrond's home with feelings of dread and uneasiness that the reader experiences as Bilbo and his companions venture through such places as the Goblin caves, Mirkwood, and Smaug's lair. This draws the reader into the story and helps them feel like they are experiencing it with the characters.Tolkien only wrote four complete novels about Middle Earth, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also wrote a wealth of background material as well as several short stories about Middle Earth. For the new initiate to Tolkien as well as the young reader, The Hobbit is the place to start. And for those revisiting Middle Earth, The Hobbit reintroduces them to the fantasy world that is as familiar as it is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I picked up \\"The Hobbit\\" to start my reading of the Lord of the Rings series. I decided to start at the beginning of the series where the Ring is initially found. Also I wanted to test out J.R.R. Tolkien writing before I dropped $56 on the hardcover box set. Plus my interests into the movies made me want to read the classics.Well once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. It was very well written. As one of my friends described it \\"It is easy reading\\". It takes you through your imagination senses. Of course it does help to have watched the movies and have a visualization of the characters and the environment in which this tale takes place.The tale is about Biblo Baggins and his adventure with thirteen dwarfs to go after a dragons treasure. Biblo is reluctantly recruited as the burglar for this adventure by Gandolf. Gandolf insists that Biblo is perfect for the job and believes in him whole hardily. As Biblo gains courage in himself he proves to be a leader and is one of the biggest reasons that the group continues on in their journey. Bilbo's courage is amplified once he finds the ring and understands the power it posesses.I found this book to be an excellent read for all ages it truly is a classic. Obviously I give this book a 5 out of 5 rating and will be reading the next three books over time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is JRR Tolkien's prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Though it stood on its own legs for 30 years, it is now difficult to disentangle this tale of Bilbo Baggins' adventuring with dwarves and finding of the One Ring from the grandly-scaled tale that would follow. This is a charming story, less an epic than a good old-fashioned tale, as Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the rest trek to the Lonely Mountain to wrest dwarvish gold from the dragon Smaug. Along the way they encounter Beorn the Bear-Man, elves, trolls and giant spiders.This edition is quite beautiful, and would make a lovely gift for someone who has read the story and considers it something special.

This book is about the expedition of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and a company of dwarves. A wizard, Gandalf, also accompanies the hobbit. They intend to travel to the Lost Mountains to recover the treasure of the dwarves from the dragon, Smaug. Tolkein does very well at describing the adventures of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. This book is not a light book and will take some time to read. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I bought this leatherette edition along with The Lord Of The Rings leatherette edition.

On page 183, Chapter Nine, &Ograve;Each dwarf was blindfold&Oacute;. These are just the ones that I noticed. Are these the errors mentioned in the original, first edition? Or are they new errors committed by Houghton Mifflin? I have read this novel several times in other editions and never seen these errors. The odd use of grammar at times, even ending sentences with a preposition is understandable although curious. But the wrong word entirely isn't likely coming from a Professor of The English Language. The workmanship of the book is acceptable and worthy of the price at Borders/Amazon. The unusually wide margins are a bit strange, but quite handy when holding the book open! The inclusion of the artwork of Tolkien is a welcome treat also.

His voice is clear, resonant and beautiful, and he has created unique voices for each character -- even the fourteen dwarves. He could relate the dialogue with no intervening narration and you would be able to tell who is speaking! In addition, he lends animation to the text, not reading in a dry style, but with appropriate inflection, humor and drama. It's a pleasure to hear this beloved book brought to life by such a talented actor.Minimal packaging of ten CDs, each approximately 1 hour in length.This is a wonderful way to introduce The Hobbit to children, to enjoy the book as a family, or to give to someone who, for whatever reason, can't read the book for themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I just finished reading The Hobbit for the first time in several years and was surprised by it. This novel reads much easier than Tolkien's later books. For anyone who hasn't read Tolkien before and has become interested, the Hobbit is a wonderful place to start. Besides being one of the shortest novels, it also predates The Lord of the Rings, making it chronologically the novel to begin with.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit who goes and a grand adventure. Unfortunately, hobbits do not like adventures and Bilbo takes a while becoming comfortable with the situation. The novel takes place predominantly in three parts. Tolkien develops his plot over the first part of the novel as the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo travel to the Misty Mountains. The second part deals with the adventures reaching the dragon. And, the third part deals with confrontation of the dragon. For novels this size, The Hobbit has more detail and plot than any self contained novel I have read.But, I am decidedly biased in favor of Tolkien. I have read all of his novels at least twice. The open a world full of tragedy and heros. The greatest of his work he never published. However, the Hobbit is the first and inspiration for the Lord of the Rings.

Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.

Goblins, wargs, spiders and huge stone giants are some of the mean creatures that they meet up with. There are many surprises in this book. At the end of the book there is a very cool thing that happens.I think that this is a good book. I enjoyed reading it very much some days I couldn't even put the book down.

I gave my two thumbs up and asked if they have ever read Tolkein. They hadn't. Our local church library had copies of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I encouraged them to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; aloud before entering &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I have read most of Tolkein's fiction aloud to my sons, including our own hardback 50th Anniversary edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Simarillion&quot;, and several other works as well. Tolkein reads well. Several years ago, we unplugged our TV and started regularly reading to our kids. This has been one of the best parenting decisions we've ever made! Turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids. If you've taken them to see &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (I would advise children over the age of 10), then read Tolkein to them. Your children's imagination sparked by Tolkein's genius descriptive writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful Middle Earth than the blockbuster movie was able to create. Encourage their imagination to fill the big screen of their minds with Tolkein's epic tale, beginning with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. This marvelous tale has always been my favorite adventure story.For two books with many more creative ideas for parents, look into &quot;The Family Cloister&quot; and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot;, both by David Robinson and available on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you've never smelled cinnamon rolls on a frosty morning or have never lain in bed on the sleeping porch inhaling the perfume of night-blooming jasmine or if you've never read The Hobbit then you do not know the majesty of imagination.Do not be fooled! Though ostensibly a children's book there is a veil of darkness about it that only adults or precocious children can appreciate. Tolkien himself admitted adding the trappings of a child's fantasy to what was a basically dark and forboding story for fear of being laughed at for producing an adult fantasy. The Hobbit is a sweet, dark, and intoxicating work of fantasy that enrobes the reader in a parallel world of mythical events and beings that closely echo the themes of life necessary to adulthood. The Hobbit warns of power used for material gain and the horrors of greed and waste but also teaches the value of being true to one's self and friends. That The Hobbit succeeds so transcendently well that the reader barely realizes he or she has been reading a modern parable stands as a testament to the genius of Tolkien and his sheer love of the English language.When Tolkien began writing Lord of the Rings years later the early chapters were of a tone similar to The Hobbit yet, as he progressed, the tone changed to a more adult and complex use of language as the story began to progress. Tolkien fans say that The Hobbit is to be read as a child and Lord of the Rings to be read as an adolescent. I whole-heartedly agree. These books are life as we live it and The Hobbit is an outstanding introduction to the lessons, bitter, enobling, and ultimately wisening, that we must all learn or become but shadows of what we have the potential to be.I'm sure you know there is a wizard, a dragon, eagles, and furry-footed Hobbits, but there are also fearsome monsters, werebears, haughty elves, greedy humans, and even greedier dwarves. Evil in The Hobbit doesn't disappear when dear Mr. Baggins goes home to petty and avaracious relatives thinking him dead and auctioning off his home and household goods. And that is the greatest triumph of the book as I see it. For evil in Tolkien's world is never wholly put away but is instead resisted and overcome with the lessons of life gained in the struggle. All of us have our moments of dread, fear, and temptation. Listen carefully to Tolkien's quiet but enduring message and you will never be alone no matter what life gives you.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; isn't just a book you give your children to read, it's a lesson in the labors of life in the adult world."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a tale of gold, dwarves, an evil dragon, hobbits and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, it is amazingly still enjoyable. The style that J.R.R. Tolkien uses to write this book is so lively that it makes the readers feel like they are part of the adventure walking along side Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the dwarves .Tolkien crafts an interesting world inhabited by Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits like peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and traveling to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they could.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit. He has lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with the company of a clan of dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair but he gradually becomes, in many ways, the leader of their troop.When a person starts this book, it will be very hard for them to put it down until they have finished it. This is because Tolkien presents his characters with such a charisma that it makes the readers want to delve deeper into the story to find out what happens next to the adventurers. He also presents such seemingly insurmountable obstacles that those that have been keeping up with the situations will have to read on to find out how the characters escape this one.The style is easy to follow and the story is straight forward with some twists. The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness.No matter how many times someone reads it, it will never be enough. There will always be things that were missed and caught the next time around, which is what makes THE HOBBIT such a great story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I know J.R.R.

In it, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit (a good natured creature about half the height of humans) sets out on an adventure with a band of 13 dwarves and a wizard. This is a journey to regain the treasure stolen from the dwarves by a dragon. In it, Bilbo comes across elves, evil goblins, angry wolves, and much more. In the end, when they finally reach the dragon, surprising events occur that put a twist in the well-thought-out plot. The book is described so well you feel as if you are part of the adventure. You also get to know Bilbo and his friends as if you really met them. As a delightful prelude to Tolkien's famous trilogy THE LORD OF THE RINGS, it can be enjoyed by both adults and older children. Personally, it is one of my favorites, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"good book even though it is the umpteenth time I have read it but the first time in digital format.

It is simply marvelous. Bilbo Baggins' adventure to conquer the evil dragon, Smaug is the epitome of fantasy fiction. But as good as it is, the Ring Trilogy is somehow even better.It is possible to read the Ring Trilogy and thoroughly enjoy it without ever having read the Hobbit, but my advice is to read the Hobbit first. It provides a good deal of background so that the later story is easier to follow, plus I feel it's a let-down to read the superior Trilogy first and then follow up with the Hobbit.Then again, that's like trying to decide whether it's better to first wear diamonds or gold, or drive a Ferrarri or Porsche. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"That's what i felt about this book WOW!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Dwarfs,trolls,and dragons come to life in J.R.R.Tolkens The Hobit .Bilbo never thought would go on a adventure till Gandolf a wizard came across the bridge.Bilbo was sent to get back dwarfs money back.Read this great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is one of the best Fantasy books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.

One reason I liked it was because of the detail. Tolkien wrote with such precise detail and acuity that I thought that I was acually there in the middle of all the action following Bilbo the hobbit every step of the way. What each character looked like, acted like, smelled like, what they were wearing, even what weapons or tools they were carring were all described in the most precise detail. Also, Tolkien describes the settings down to the cracks in the road so anyone can just picture these places right in his or her mind. I believe that this particular piece of literature is directed toward anyone who loves to hear stories about wizards and magic and dwarves and trolls and hobbits and goblins and elves and all other manner of Middle Aged mythology. The only drawback to the entire book is the fact that it requires the reader to be at a fairly high reading level do to some of the relatively long words and odd concepts.

I couldn't make up a song if I tried for weeks. I reccomend this book to fantasy fans that have actually read alot before. If you're new to fantasy-type novels then....this is not for you.

Rob keeps your attention! It's nice too, that when you get to the end of a CD, there's a little jig and voice over that informs you your at the end of the disc.

Give yourself a pat on the back, and a wink in the mirror, there are not enough of us left in the world. But book worms beware, skip the reading this time and listen to The Hobbit as narrated by Rob Inglis. Listen as Gollum, Gandalf, Thorin, the house of the elves, the mountains come to life. Inglis even sings the many Middlearth folk songs that appear only as words in the book, folling JRR Tolkien's music but even having to create some of the tunes himself. As a twenty year old college student I remember this book fondly in particular as it was played in the car on road trips. I can only wait until I have my own family to read this book aloud to, but I will treasure and play this for the rest of my life.

His voice differentiations are fantastic and this is definitely one of the best audiobooks I've listened to. He makes it a real delight to hear, as you can clearly imagine the characters interacting with each other in this manner as they all sound quite distinct.So, being the unabridged version of The Hobbit, this contains the entire story from cover-to-cover, nothing missing. I feel compelled to mention that the tracks are not sorted by chapters. Since I first heard this version on cassette, it was never a big deal for me, but some people might be annoyed by it.I don't really need to mention that I think The Hobbit is a great book/story, but it really deserves a-lot of credit just in terms of a literary piece. It's one of those works that either really keeps you enthralled or bores you. It's extremely well written and has a great flow to it that really suits the audiobook format. A magnificent story with one of the best story tellers out there reading it to you. This is something I definitely recommend you own, if you enjoyed the book. It's certainly a tale worth being heard."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"First let me explain a few things: I teach high school English and 7th/8th grade Lang Arts in a small school. We read the book for both my language classes.It was coming down to the end of the school year and we had one more 'classic' to get through. I thought the audio book would bring the story to life more since the guy that reads it has a different voice for each character. I had a tough time getting the kids into the story. The reading-guy reads a tad slower than I expected and he sings every song. Some songs are rather drawn out and kind of cheesy so we would fast forward through those parts. It wasn't until the 4th chapter when I made the students read it themselves that they finally began to get into the story. By Ch 5 when Gollum comes into the picture they were more hooked. (Some, sadly, I was never able to convince that it was a good story.)All in all, the CD experience was okay. 1) I didn't have to read it myself, 2) at least the kids that didn't read it got pieces of the story in class, and 3) it kept us going because the kids liked not \\"doing work\\" per say in class those weeks.It was definitely an experience most had not had (hearing an audiobook). Bonus! I learned that a few of the students are better \\"readers\\" by listening to audiobooks! Perhaps I will try it again in the future for those with learning difficulties such as dyslexia, ADD, and dysgraphia. Audiobooks are the way to go with those and I had all 3 LDs in my classrooms this year."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Just finished reading this to my son and it was just as good as I remember. I remember having this book read to me for the first time when I was nine by my Dad. He was a big fan of the Tolkien and felt it was time to share his love for these epic stories. I can still remember getting into bed while he sat in a metal office chair reading till I fell asleep.At the age of nine I was enthralled by this story with tales of Wizards, Goblins and Dwarves. It was all so fantastic I was transported to a different world and loved every minute of it. After this tale my Dad then read me the Lord of the rings trilogy and even though I am not a fan of Sci- Fi, I do love these stories and still get a thrill out of reading them over and over.All these years later I am a father now and wanted to share this with my son and possibly start a tradition that I hope he passes on to his children one day. My son is young and has no idea what is going on but he loves to hear my wife and I read to him.

Pointless and boring? You haven't seen such till you read certain volumes of Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. For me, this book is like a doorway into another world. A wizard, a hobbit and a group of dwarves go on a quest to oust a dragon from their mountain and run into orcs, wolves and spiders on the way? Jeez, what could be cooler? I found it engrossing every step of the way. The only criticism I would have for the book might be that the latter part of the book takes an abruptly more serious tone than the first half of the book, but that's only fitting since it prepares for the more serious tone of Lord of the Rings.

Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).&quot;Also, it must be said, hobbits do not tend toward adventure! A loving family, a comfortable home, a good meal, a pipe of tobacco, and a pint of beer are generally all that is required to make us happy.HOWEVER, in recent times, hobbits HAVE begun to have adventures and to participate more fully in the deeds of the Wide World.

They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Some of my favorite novels of all times are fantasy novels I love the rich imagination that comes with them. Amongst these wonderful fantasy tales is the novel The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.Unlike several of Tolkienfs other books The Hobbit is much easier to get through. It is the kind of book I would recommend to any age and every generation.I would also recommend this book because it is an opener to The Lord of the Rings. The movie to that particular novel has inspired many people to read the book and The Hobbit is a story related to that. I would recommend this book if you plan on read The Lord of the Rings or if you already have.I myself enjoyed The Hobbit and by writing this review I hope to get others to read it as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is one of my favorite fantasy/adventure books I have ever read.Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) is called to take part in an adventure when the wizard, Gandalf and a bunch of dwarves some by his house and tell him if he goes on the adventure he will get a share of the reward. The reason Gandalf and the dwarves came by was to get back the treasure stolen by the evil dragon, Smaug.On the way to the Lonely Mountain (Smaug's home) the hobbit, dwarves, and Gandalf have to get past evil goblins and trolls, wood-elves,savage wolves, giant spiders.If you like fantasy books, I HIGHLY recommend this book! This book is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings Series. I am definetly going to check them out since I loved this book so much.

Rings is probably the greatest epic novel ever written, but The Hobbit touches me more closely. One should never read LOTR without having read the Hobbit first, afterall it is the first book and sets up a lot of the action that will follow.

If I could give more I would! This is an entertaining, captivating and imaginative book. Tolkein creates a magical world where you feel that anything can happen (which in all truth could)and the characters he makes are both lovable (Bilbo)and despisable (e.g.Smaug). For people who love fantasy, this is the best in that context that I have ever read, save a few other well known books by the same author. I don't believe that anyone has not heard of Tolkien by now, either because of the movie Lord of the Rings or because of his reputable books. In either case, those who have not read this book (and also The Lord of The Rings series, which is a sequel of sorts to The Hobbit)READ IT NOW!!!Don't be among the minority.

Thorin and Co., as the dwarves called themselves, were in need of a fourteenth member of their group to assist them on their quest to get back gold and other riches the dragon Smaug had stolen from them. Bilbo obliged and accompanied the band of dwarves on their rescue mission. On many occasions during his journey, Bilbo wished that he were back home, but once his duty was complete, Bilbo never regretted going with the dwarves.With an unexpected ending and great descriptions, I would undoubtedly recommend this book.

Tolkien creates one of the best. The land of Middle earth is filled with many creatures and settings. This story is centered around Bilbo Baggins, a simple living hobbit with a big appetite (sort of like a modern couch potato). One day he is visited by his friend Gandalf, the wizard. Gandalf brings an interesting twist to Bilbo's life: thirteen dwarves on a mission.Bilbo decides to join them on their quest as their \\"burglar\\". Thorin Oakenshield is the leading dwarf. He has strong doubts about Bilbo being a real burglar, but sucks it up and lets him come. Once they set out on their adventure complications start: Bilbo complains about the lack of food (considering hobbits usually eat six meals a day) and Gandalf's random comings and goings don't help either.Somewhere along the way Bilbo gets stuck in a cave...alone (very different than being home alone). As he tries to find his way out he finds a gold ring. He picks it up, being the burglar he is. He keeps venturing through the dark, damp cave. He comes upon a murky lake. This lake is inhabited by an-uh-a...thing named Gollum. Gollum, with his extreme split personality called Sm&eacute;agol, have a game of riddles (lame!). If Bilbo wins Gollum and Sm&eacute;agol will show him the way out. Bilbo is shown his way.\\"Adventure filled\\" doesn't cut the chase when describing this story. The action, complications, and escapes keep you reading. The songs may take up time, but they play an important part to the plot. Tolkien really keeps you on your toes.The Hobbit is the perfect beginning to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. We learn to take opportunities and feed our since of adventure.

On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style.

Tolkien's The Hobbit, Tolkien captivates the human imagination with the fantastical tale of a Hobbit, who wanted nothing more than to stay in his hole sipping tea, when a wizard and thirteen dwarves recruit them for their journey and steal back their stolen treasure. Bilbo, the hobbit, represents what the majority of western population is like, fat, lazy, and unwilling for adventures, yet somehow the wizard, Gandalf, stirs his longings for adventures that are buried deep inside of Bilbo, the side which he calls \\"the Tookish part of him.\\" Tolkien is much like Gandalf, he finds us sitting in our homes, eating cake, drinking beer, and smoking our pipes, and even though we might not think we want to go on a journey, Tolkien rouses us up to come on a journey, go places you've never been, and meet people you never knew. Bilbo's journey is a page turning classic that is the prelude to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.Tolkien uses incredible characterization in his vast list of characters. The dwarves each have there own unique characteristics and hilarious names such as Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, and Ori. The dwarves mainly have one thing on their mind, and that is to steal back the treasure that was taken from them long ago. In fact they don't even like Bilbo, but only bring him along, so as to not have an unlucky number in the party. Gandalf is a favorite character in the story, he is wise beyond years, and yet so much of him is a mystery.On Bilbo's journey he runs into trolls, a host of goblins, warves(wolves), and slinks away from them all, with the help of Gandalf and the dwarves, and a certain ring that makes the wearer invisible, which he just happened to win, by pure luck, in a riddle-competition, with a strange creature.

These are the traditional ingredients in this fantasy that make it...well, fantasy. What stands out in this work, though, is the incredible depth of his world, and the incredible story behind each and every little thing, hinted at here and there, though never completely expounded upon. It leaves enough to the imagination to make you think, yet tells you enough to avoid being confusing; a fine line that many fantasy authors fail to walk successfully these days. In short, this is a WONDERFUL book, and I think it should be required reading in school (and, I'm glad that it IS required in many schools)."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937. The Hobbit is a fantasy that takes place in Middle Earth. Middle Earth is filled with dragons, knights, castles and grand battles. Grassy valleys, dark forests, grey mountains and blue rivers is what Middle Earth looks like.The story starts off in Bilbo Baggins hobbit hole. Bilbo, like any other hobbit never leaves his hobbit hole and eats five meals a day. A hobbit is a furry fellow who is slightly smaller than a dwarf. They don&#8217;t wear shoes because they have leather feet.Hobbits never go on adventures. That is, until one morning when Bilbo&#8217;s house is filled with thirteen dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit is asked by the wizard to join them on their journey. After a debate, Bilbo decides to go help the dwarves recover their gold from the Dragon, Smaug.Bilbo didn&#8217;t know how to take care of himself without being in his hobbit hole. Sometimes they didn&#8217;t eat at all and Bilbo was used to eating five meals a day. During his adventure Bilbo fell into goblin caves, was caught by wood elves, attacked by killer spiders and was in the Great War with the Goblins. (spoiler)The main characters are Bilbo the hobbit, Gandalf the wizard, Thorin the dwarf king and Smaug the dragon. My favorite character was Gandalf because he used magic. He used magic for fun to entertain by making fireworks and also as a weapon of mass destruction to kill his enemies. I liked the use of imagery in the book. The words used to describe the mountains, forests and dungeons made you feel as if you were there. The plot was exciting, action packed and suspenseful.I really enjoyed The Hobbit and would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or books with medieval settings.

I first picked them up my freshman year in highschool and I haven't been able to put them down since. I have read all of them 5 times at least, and each time they seem to get more magical. Tolkien, like no other writer, is able to take the reader and actually put them into his book. His writing is full of detail, and the vividness of the scenes he paints grabs the readers attention and doesn't let go. It is by far the greatest literary work of the 20th century, and in my opinion the greatest ever."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is quite simply, wonderful. It can stand on its own as a self contained story, but when read in conjunction with the Lord of the Rings, it's deceptive simplicity suddenly falls away. Many people have said you don't need to read this in order to enjoy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and this is true. However, you are cheating yourself if you don't. Many major and key players from LOTR are introduced here, not to mention the extremely important moment when Bilbo Baggins finds a lost ring in the caves under the mountain. This story is less than 100 years old, yet it resonates and feels like Tolkien was basically rewriting old myths. The argument for this can indeed come from some of the source materials that Tolkien used, but as far as I can see, the story is wholly original. It's wonderful that in the age when everything was modern and sleek, Tolkien gifted the world with this age old story. This book may have been written for kids, but I have noticed that many more adults seem to enjoy it than children. It may be Tolkien's overly descriptive language can turn kids off, but this book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a book full of adventure and fantasy.

Tolkien has been one of the better books I have read in quite a while. The detail and language Tolkien uses is unique in that authors don't go the distance as he does to describe something. The Hobbit takes place in a world filled with elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other mythical creatures. The hero of the story is a hobbit, which are small men, named Bilbo Baggins. He receives a call for adventure when a well-known wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves show up on his porch, asking for his assistance. Hobbits generally never like adventuring and would rather stay home, but Bilbo reluctantly accepts their offer. The dwarves main quest is to retrieve their lost treasure that is currently guarded by an evil dragon. I gave this book a 4 out of 5 because it's one of those books that you have to read in your life. Whether you hear people talking about it, or just find it in a library, Tolkien was one of those rare authors that everyone could enjoy. The book did a great job on detail, settings, characters, and development. Reading this book reminded me a lot of Brian Jacques, Redwall series. They share a similar style of writing that gives me a sense of de-ja vu while I'm reading. In every sentence there is a detailed description of even the smallest thing. The characters in the book were also one of the reasons I gave it a high rating. Each one was unique, and had his or her own personality. The only thing it lacked was that it needed a little more action. There was a lot of excitement throughout the whole book, but it only seemed to get action packed at the end of the book. Even with its flaws it's still one of the best books I have read and will probably continue reading the series. It is worth reading whether you're new to Tolkien books, or enjoy just reading fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R.

Since then, I've re-read it four times. I have bought copies for each of my three children. They all enjoyed it, but only one,the daughter, has accompanied me on this trek through Middle Earth. This mastery of fantasy has brought me and mine, hours of literary pleasure. No other author of fantasy has been able to touch JRR Tolkien, in respect to depth and intricacies of storyline. Bilbo Baggins will always be my favorite character because of the way JRR Tolkien presented him to us.

Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious.

Unlike other books that I put aside to read later, I couldn't wait to get home and read The Hobbit. I was looking forward to learning about Tolkien's world before I saw the LOTR films (which hadn't come out yet).The novels begins with Bilbo Baggins as the respectable (and quite boring) Hobbit living in The Shire. Quite against his will, Baggins is recruited in his middle aged years by the wizard Gandalf to accompany on band of dwarves as their resident burglar and lucky number 14 on their mission to retake the treasure that was stolen from them by the dragon Smaug. Setting out without his kerchief, Baggins is in for the journey of a lifetime as he crosses forests and mountains on his quest to reach Lonely Mountain. Along this way this pint sized hero must battle trolls, orcs, and giant spiders as well as his own fears.This book introduces so many of the important races that make up the world of Middle Earth including the Elves, The Eagles, Orcs, and of course, Hobbits. It also gives us the first glimpse of The Ring of Power. In a whimsical and prosy manner, Tolkien tells the story of how a Baggins had his first adventure.

I feel I am indebted to him ... forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Pages are nice and solid, beautiful jacket, and great illustrations. A must have if you don't mind hardback books. A must have for any Tolkien fans. The book has a nice breakdown of illustration descriptions and languages."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read the Hobbit back in high school, then recently re-read it prior to the movie coming out. It's a very enjoyable journey into the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, written for a younger audience than the Lord of the Rings series. Because of this, I'd have to mark it lower than L.O.T.R., but overall is a fine read. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes an appearance in the LOTR series as well.If you love LOTR, you will really enjoy the Hobbit. If you read the Hobbit first, then LOTR is jsut, oh so much better on all levels. I recommend reading the entire trilogyThe Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Editionthen catching the incredibly produced and directed moviesThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions) [Blu-ray] . But definitely read the books first. They will make the movie make much more sense."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"this book was written many years ago and first published in 1938. unlike Lord of the Rings (which reading level is high school level) the book was written for children and is easy to read and flows well. i had seen this book before and went looking for it at amazon.it's a really nice hard back book and for anyone who has a book collection it fits nicely on the shelf next to the LORD OF THE RINGS and \\"THE SIMARILLION\\" and \\"THE UNFINISHED TALES\\". christopher tolkien did a 12 book edition on this fathers original writings as well.13 Dwarfs and a Wizard set out on an adventure to find Dragon's Gold!! which is actually stolen Dwarfs Gold and they want it back. Gandalf seeks help in the unlikely helpful Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (whom he calls a Burglar)... he's a Burglar but just doesn't know it yet!actually it's a good thing they brought the little fellow along because he pulls them out of fire many times over. the finding of the one ring, Smaug the dragon, spiders, Trolls, Goblins are part of many adventures they have getting to the Lonely Mountain to seek the Dragon's Gold!!i'd recommend this to anyone who likes hard back books and LORD OF THE RINGS. trade paper backs are nice as well, but nothing captures the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien better than this book. enjoy!!!\\"Theif, Theif... He's stolen our precious!! We hates it forever!!\\"cmh"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A great story, but I already knew that. I was interested in listening to the audio book in preparation for the upcoming movie release, but was tentative because I knew from having read the book years ago, that it would take the exact right person to pull off all the songs. The audio book is one of the best I have ever listened to and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A pure pleasure to read this multi-media enhanced edition of The Hobbit! The illustrations are very nice and to be able to hear J.R.R. Tolkien sing, etc. is a really nice touch! I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is a true classic and a great introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth.
