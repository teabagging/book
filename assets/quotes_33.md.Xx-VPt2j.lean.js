The point of view here - that of poor relations of all ages who have nothing but poverty to look forward to and create their own solution - is unique and beautifully handled.

Along with a well written story are bits of living conditions one might find disturbing in today,s modern world."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I have a kindle, and have amazon prime, so I have access to the kindle owners lending library, which is how I ended up with this book -- it was my February 2012 borrowed book. Lady Fortescue Steps Out is short, and sort of expensive for the length at $5.59, but I've heard good things about M.C. Beaton (she writes the Agatha Raisin series) so I thought I would give it a go.So glad I didn't buy it. So, so glad.Brief Plot Summary: The premise behind the book is that a whole bunch of \\"poor relations\\" get together in Regency London and start a sort of a hotel so they can make some money and live more comfortably. A number of characters were introduced, including the title character, Lady Fortescue, who is the owner of the house that is converted into The Poor Relation. The plotline was cute, and had promise.Review: Overall, this book just didn't work for me. I couldn't make up my mind if it was intended to be satire (not biting enough), comedy (not funny enough) or romance (not romantic enough). The characters, who should've been sympathetic, were mostly extremely unlikeable and quite unappealing.There was a central romance between the Duke and the character whose name I can't even remember (not a good thing in a romance novel) that was pretty cute. And the Duke himself was humanized over the course of a book in a way that was pleasant, although not terribly convincing. Overall, though, I won't be checking any more of these out. Thanks, Prime, for giving me a free chance to decide that they aren't for me.2 stars -- because it is reasonably well-written. I expected better."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"This was a light and entertaining book with no swearing or other content that most books have. I am reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"Lady Fortescue is a lonely old lady who was formerly a member of the aristocrats in London. She is now a poor widow who has held on to her large house and her two servants. She is often hungry because she is so poor. She has a rich relative who invites her occasionally and on her last visit, she steals some candlesticks from a seldom used room. She get's caught and is sent home in disgrace. She is totally embarrassed and one day walks to the park and is thinking about her disgrace when she comes upon an elderly man who is in the same situation. She invites him for dinner and after that, they scheme to go in search of others in the same situation. Once they gather a few, they turn the house into a hotel. Many adventures take place in the hotel and then there is a very happy ending. This is a feel good story. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I really enjoyed Lady Fortescue Steps Out!! I liked the variety of characters and what each of them brought to the story."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"Marion Chesney writes intelligently, cleverly and humorously about a unique group of people living in Regency England: the \\"poor relations.\\" I've enjoyed her Hamish MacBeth and Agatha Raisin mysteries (authored as M. C. Beaton), and thought I'd try one of her historical novels. I hesitate to call this book and series \\"romance\\" when it's more like wry, insightful comedy. The \\"Poor Relations\\" books give a slightly wacky view of upstairs/downstairs life in Regency England as the scandalously wealthy aristocracy and their not-so-rich but still genteel relatives are sketched in all the glory of their faults, foibles and fantasies. In the opening pages of \\"Lady Fortescue Steps Out,\\" the lead character is a destitute but proud elderly widow who sits in Hyde Park .. \\"a grim black figure, back ramrod-straight, one hand leaning on the ivory handle of her parasol. She looked thoughtfully at that parasol. The ivory handle was mounted in silver. As she looked at it, it became transformed in her mind's eye into a pile of savoury meat pies.\\" How Lady Fortescue overcomes her desperate poverty and draws together a band of new friends from similar situations is presented with sparkling wittiness in this series. The adventures of Lady Fortescue and her band of Dickensian aristocrats are charming!"},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"This short work -- at 152 pages in paperback, more of a novella than a novel -- will sneak up on you. Lady Fortescue Steps Out, sly and humorous, evolves into a fable of finding your inner strength and of knowing your own mind. It isn't until half-way through the novel that you discover there's also a bit of a romance.Lady Fortescue Steps Out, the first in a series about the plucky poor relations of the wellborn and well-to-do, begins with the eponymous lady stepping out in all meanings of the word. While Lady Fortescue, a widow in very straitened circumstances, is strolling throug Hyde Park, a favorite haunt of those who haven't enough money for any but free entertainment, she meets another destitute poor relation. Comparing their situations, Lady Fortescue steps out of her comfort zone and the dictates of the high society of Regency England to come up with a plan for herself and others in her situation: banding together. Eventually, a motley crew of poor relations does the unthinkable and establishes a genteel hotel audaciously called The Poor Relation.Their snobby relatives are horrified that their poor relations -- shudder! -- have gone into trade, a humiliating step in those days for artistocrats. The families will stop at nothing to close down the hotel before it causes them to lose social standing. Will the six poor relations be able to withstand the assault from their better-off relatives?Lady Fortescue Steps Out constitutes a great start to the Poor Relations series. Are some of the situations a bit predictable? Sure, but the characters are so lively and language so slyly clever that you won't mind. It's just the thing to read when you're looking for something light in tone and a speedy read."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I love the Agatha books and Hamish is another favorite of mine. This was my first time with these romance stories and what comes to mind is Georgette Heyer. These are the same sort of really enjoyable Regency romance stories.

Not sure how far the series can go."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I read the entire \\"Poor Relations\\" series of 6 books, one each night, in the week after New Year's. These little books are just right for decompressing and relaxing. As with just about all formula romances, good conquers evil, the right boy gets the right girl, and in these Chesney books, there's lots of humor and silliness to lighten your attitude. Each book involves at least 5 of the original 6 'poor relations' who band together to open a hotel. In addition, a young girl in need of friends ends up at the hotel and is aided by the group to find love and happiness. Of course, happiness in Regency terms means finding a handsome man with a title, and Chesney's love interests are varied and interesting in their own right, and include an uptight duke, a dashing military man, and even a French comte. The plots are fanciful and told with lots of good historic detail about upper-class behavior and London's condition in the early 1800s. The personalities of the Poor Relations themselves are the most compelling reason to read the whole set. All but two are middle-aged or older, but haven't given up seeking a better life. And they get it. Four stars because these aren't quite as sparkling as Georgette Heyer's \\"Friday's Child\\" or Barbara Metzger's comical regencies, but they are good."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I enjoyed all the individual characters, each had well drawn unique personalities.

It is a great resource for both exams; if you can only but 1 book to study for either test then this is the book!I passed both exams with high scores, thanks to this book. I agree with other reviewers that you should get a copy of the exam outlines as that really helped me to focus in on what I really needed to know.If you are buying this book for the CLEP exam, you should buy or download the Official Study Guide from the College Board. I had at least 5 questions on my exam that were taken right out of the book. Also, I used the questions in the guidebook to determine areas in the Barron's book that I needed to spend more time on. I highly recommend taking the Business Law II exam shortly after you take the CLEP exam since some of the information overlaps.For the Business Law II exam the majority of the questions are situation based, so you need to know how to apply the principles of the law. Lots of wordy questions which require you to watch and manage your time carefully.In total I spent about 15-20 hours preparing for the CLEP; I spent an additional 10 hours to take the Dantes exam."},{"Title":"Business Law","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone taking the Business Law I CLEP exam or Business Law II DSST exam; very comprehensive and very well written (as opposed to other books focused on passing the CLEP exam, e.g., REA's CLEP book and COMEX).

Also great as later reference!"},{"Title":"Business Law","review":"This book has all the things you need to pass a Business Law CLEP testing and it is also very useful as a reference tool for Bus.

Honestly, this is a subject that should be taught in High School in order to prepare one for life, and this book is a wealth of information. Including shipping, it cost me a little over $6.

I, however, am a person that wants to get A's on tests, except when it is pass or fail (then I just want to pass). This book probably gives all the information you need for the CLEP, but I just skimmed the parts that looked the most important. All of the information I read seemed to be covered in the much simpler book CLEP Introductory Business Law Review published by Comex.I ended up barely passing my test with a 56, but I think I could have done the same without Barron's Review.My advice, if you want to really be prepared, buy this book and read it after the CLEP Review by Comex. I would have absorbed the information a lot better if I had read it second. Also make sure you stay awake while you are reading it. It was not hard to read in terms of vocabulary, but I found it was very boring.If you do not buy this book, and just read the Comex you are taking a risk, but the time saved may be worth it. This CLEP really is a lot harder than the Priciples of Management and other tests I have taken.

I agree with most everyone on here that this book is a good resource and will help you pass the CLEP exam.The only problem I saw with the book was the order of the chapters. Specifically it didn't really define Torts until chapter 19 and yet the term was used several times in chapters 4-6 comparing Contracts to Torts. An oversight by the authors (and editor) just assuming that every reader already knows what a Tort is in detail. Do yourself a favor and read the Torts chapter before you get to Contracts.[...] They also sell a practice exam that is useful to help you get used to the types of questions and the wording of the questions. I memorized all of the questions and answers to the practice exam. There were about 4 or 5 questions from the practice exam that were exactly the same on my CLEP exam.I recommend you read these chapters from the Barron's Book: 1-9, 13-16, 18-20, 22-24, & 26. In addition make sure you know the 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.Definitely know all of the stuff in the boxes labeled \\"You Should Remember\\", as well as the bold words throughout the chapter. Also answer all of the questions at the end of each chapter.I studied about 2-3 hours a day for 6 days straight and passed. It is a timed exam so be cognizant of the amount of time remaining during the exam. I almost ran out of time.Don't underestimate this CLEP exam, it was fairly difficult and there is a lot of information to digest but this book made the process easier.

It was so interesting I found myself absorbed into the book, intrigued by the story line. Then I pasted the book on to my best friend and the same thing happened to her.Here is a quick summary: Cimorene is bored of being a princess. She isn't allowed to do anything fun. So she sneaks away and enters a hovel,...FULL OF DRAGONS!!! Instead of being toasted, she proposes that she be Kazul's princess. From then on she is having a blast making cherries jubilee, sorting treasure, making fire-proofing potionw...until Zemenar and Antorell, very irritating wizards, start trouble.I have all for books at my home library, and i love them all, but my favorite is this one. I love everything about the book. And for sure if you decide to read this book you to will be absorbed. I LOVE DRAGONS!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"\\"Dealing with Dragons\\" isn't your normal fairy tale. In Patricia C. Wrede's universe, most Princesses are deadly dull sorts, fit only to be rescued by the even more deadly dull heroes. And Princess Cimorene (princess by courtesy and convention, not by aptitude, as she's smart, funny, and her own person) wants none of it.She runs off, and apprentices herself (more or less) to Kazul, an imposing female Dragon. Yet she and Kazul find they have much in common; razor-like wit, uncommon sense, and the ability to enjoy fine cooking (which Cimorene discovers she's not too bad at cooking, either).Some wizards show up and emperil their existence; Cimorene and Kazul don't care for this too much. How they fight them is up to you to figure out; trust me, you'll want to know the ending.Thing is, it's the wit and the style that carries this book. It's hilarious; Ms. Wrede goes out of her way to satirize convention, yet gently and with great care. The mix of gentility and satirization makes for loads of laughs and fun.As for recommendations, I think anyone who's read a lot of fairy tales or is at least in the fifth or sixth grade (about age 10 or so) will enjoy this. Adults, however, will probably enjoy this just as much as the kids, if not more so. I did."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Princess Cimorene lives in a fairy tale universe where the beautiful princess always gets rescued from the dreaded dragon and ends up living happily ever after. She doesn't enjoy being proper and doing princess activities like needle work. She likes to fence, learn Latin, cook, and learn magic. That is until her father stopped her from doing all of the things she loved simply because it \\"isn't done.\\"When Cimorene is faced with the possibility of marrying a Prince whom she can't stand she'll do anything in her power to stop this from happening, including running away and voluntarily getting kidnaped by a dragon. Luckily for Cimorene her dragon is kind and lets Cimorene do all the things she was forbidden to do. Unfortunately Cimorene can't go on living her new life. Knights and Prince's come every day with the hope of rescuing her from the evil dragon. She sends them away but yet they continue to come. To top that off wizards have been hanging around the dragons lair and Cimorene suspects that they have sinister plots. With the help of a naieve princess, a prince made from stone, a kind witch, and a bunch of dragons, Cimorene is off to save the day.Dealing with Dragons is the first book of Patricia C. Wrede's well renowned Enchanted Forest Chronicles. I've been meaning to read these for ages now and I'm glad I did. Cimorene is a strong female character that young girls can look up to and older ones can relate to. She doesn't fit into the picture perfect fairy tale world that she lives in and instead of trying to change herself, she makes everyone else change there rules. I love the description of the dragons. It's nice to see a novel where they aren't portrayed as large, stupid, and evil, but almost human, just a great deal older. The supporting cast is great, including Morwen the kind witch, Alianora the princess (who I've found is the easiest to relate to), and the two wizards with horrible plots.The book ends happily but leaves the door open for the rest of the series that I will be sure to read as soon as I get my hands on them! I highly recommend this novel to anyone into kids or YA fantasy with strong female characters."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is the first book in the Enchanted Forest series (although much of this book has little to do with the actual Enchanted Forest).The book is a stand-alone story. The other three Enchanted Forest books are a trilogy which serve as a single sequel to this story.Kids will love it, but so will adults. Especially fans of the old Fractured Fairytales, because Wrede skewers all the fairytale conventions. Princesses are insipid and useless, knights are dense, witches are pretty and nice, dragons are ethical (but amoral), and wizards are evil and greedy (even though they look just like Gandolf).The heroine is a princess who would rather learn fencing and cooking than how to spin straw into gold or get put under an enchantment so she can be rescued by a handsome prince.She is a no-nonsense, capable, and smart girl. And fun to read about."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"On the advice of a younger correspondent, I bought two copies of this novel to use as gifts for pre-teen girls. It is a delightful book for readers in any age group, and is suitable for reading to younger children.A princess could not have a real career, it just wasn't done, so when a princess finds herself faced with an arranged marriage and confinement to a stuffy life at court with a booring husband, she escapes to live with dragons. Events get somewhat humorous when various princes seem convinced that they have to fight the dragon to rescue her.The troubles of the princess are increased by the intrigues of evil wizards and the political machinations of some of the dragons. There is a friendly witch to lend a helping hand, various magic mixed in, and another princess or two waiting for a prince to rescue them from their dragons. It all adds together to make an interesting story.The story is roughly at the reading level of the Harry Potter novels. This is the first novel in a series which has several sequels you might also consider."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing with Dragons is an awesome, awesome, book! I love the way that Patricia C. Wrede makes it like a fairy tale, but puts a twist on it where all the princesses are not perfectly perfect. Cimorene is a great role model for people. She teaches us we don't have to be exactly what people want and expect us to be. This book is funny in some cases, and this is definatly a \\"YES\\" for all fantasy lovers. I liked this book so much that I'm reading the rest of them. I'm about in the middle of book 4. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It takes you on a journey to meet dragons, princes, witches, wizards, and more. This exciting tale will grab you, and you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books of all time, and the audio version of it is also spectactular. From how Kazul says \\"Wi-zards\\" (it is so cool!) and the voice that says \\"End side 5\\", this is so amazing. The story is just wonderful. Get it. Rent (or buy!) this tape.. you'll play it over and over and over (etc. etc.). I love how the tape is unabridged, unlike many audio books out of books you love so well you can tell all the missing parts as soon as you listen to it. This audio tape is not read by a person (as cool as that is, just listen to Harry Potter), but is read (really, acted) out by a cast.. very cool. In short, the book is wonderful, and so is the audio tape."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book was amazing! It's about a daring girl named Cimmorene, who doesn't want to be a princess. But instead of like most books, where the princesses just learn to deal with their life, Cimmorene takes action! She asks a sweet dragon, Kazul, to capture her. Now, this may sound a bit odd, but Kazul was a nice and gentle dragon, and was always nice to Cimmorene. Cimmorene learns to make potions and spells and even befriends another captured princess. But as the groovy story goes on, Cimmorene learns a secret about a dragon who is helping wizards. When the dragon king dies, and the contest to find the new kings gets closer. The wizards cook up even more mischief. This hillarious adventure/mystery/fantasy is an excellent, awesome read!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I think this is a great book that I just engulfed in one day; once you start, you just cant stop.

After getting the advice to run away from a frog, she ends up in a cave full of dragons, where she becomes Kazul's princess. Things are going great when all of a sudden princes and knights start trying to rescue her. And thats not all, she finds out that the wizards are trying to take over all the magic in the Dragon world. You have to read this great fantasy/fiction book to find out what happends to Kazul and Princess Cimorene.

She runs away and discovers a world filled with dragons, magic, and evil wizards. This book was pretty good, but I liked the third book in the series better. I think that these books are better than the Harry Potter books for more mature people, because they aren't quite as simple as Potter is. I enjoyed the part when Cimorene, the main character, cast a fireproofing spell, because it is a clever idea. I didn't like the part where Cimorene was at the Ford of Whispering Snakes, because it didn't really describe the ford well enough. I think that the author also could have squeezed in a few more characters. Even though I liked the other books in the series better, it still helps if you read it before reading the others, because she wrote them to be read in order. Wrede also could have gone into the other dragons' personalities a bit more. Overall, this book was good, but it could have been better."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I read this book when I was only ten years old and now I am 14, so I still agree that this is a fantastic book. I thought it was a very epic story and more modern then ancient. SO it's got a clash of 1400's(which everyone loves to hear about) and 1900's additute. Cause no one likes the damsel in distress kinda shakespeare girl of that time period. But this book demonstrates individuality of basically any young girl that is alive today in a very comservative household.

She also has to fend off persistent knights who come to rescue her, and investigate the actions of a couple of sneaky wizards.Patricia C. Wrede's Dealing with Dragons is a refreshing change from some of the more recent fantasy epics aimed at teenage girls. It's light, fun, and often hilarious as it pokes fun at several fairy tales and fantasy clich&eacute;s. The plot moves rapidly and the writing is clear and precise.

Cimorene is princess of Linderwall, and when she's fed up with normal princess-ing and heads off, she gets involved with tons of dragons, witches, wizards, a jinn, talking birds and more. Cimorene loves fencing, magic, cooking, economics, Latin, and she can't do any of them because \\"It's NOT done\\". I'd say if this was real, it'd be in the early 1500\`s.

The book is about an improper princess named Cimorene she runs away to a dragons cave and becomes the dragon's princess. She encounters all kinds of weird things, but you will have to read it yourself if you want to find out. The book is very funny, like when all the dragons start sneezing whenever a wizard appears close to them.Is anyone tired of seeing princesses totally helpless, and then a knight or prince has to come to their rescue. I know I am, well this is nothing like that. Cimorene can take care of herself she doesn't need protection. She stays alive instead of getting burned to a crisp by the dragons.I would recommend it to any fantasy fans. It is a perfect mix of fantasy and comedy.

I found myself easily connecting with the characters and being totally captivated in the plot.Wrede makes sure you fall for the plot of the story, and draws you as if you're part of the story. The story is full of twists and turns and characters who you'll learn to love and hate.It's a fun, entertaining book to read, and I highly recommend it for anybody to read, regardless of age.

I am not a stranger to this series; I have read every book. It was only after completing the series that I looked back and realized that this one is the best. This book, and this series for that matter, is good for someone who likes fantasy, as well as a kind of wry humor about old fairy tales and the way things always used to work in them. Meet Cimorene, a princess from a &quot;proper&quot; kingdom who just isn't proper. She isn't interested in learning dancing or embroidery, or the proper moments to scream when being carried off by giants. She prefers learning about magic, taking fencing lessons, and many other un-princess-like activities that her fairy godmother and parents agree just &quot;isn't done.&quot; When her parents, behind her back, arrange for he to marry a perfectly proper, and very dumb, prince, Cimorene is furious. Taking the advice of the enchanted toad she encountered, she runs off to VOLUNTARILY become the princess of a dragon, something that certainly is never done. Read about Cimorene's adventures with the dragons, encounters with annoying wizards, and desperate efforts to discourage the manly knights and princes to just LEAVE HER ALONE. Plenty of excellent reading.

Not only is it entertaining, with sly but affectionate digs at fairy tales and their accompanying tropes, but its main character, despite being a princess, is a strong character who thinks and solves problems for herself, and doesn't shy away from a good adventure.Princess Cimorne is a headstrong princess who would rather learn swordfighting, magic, and cooking than \\"proper\\" princess activities such as embroidery and etiquette. When her parents try to curb her willful ways by marrying her off to a bland Prince Charming, she decides to run away and go live with the dragons. In this world, dragons don't eat princesses -- they keep them as servants. And despite now serving as cook, housekeeper, and treasure room organizer to the female dragon Kazul, Cimorne has never been happier, as she finally has the chance to put her illicitly learned skills to use. Especially when she learns that a group of wizards seek to overthrow the Dragon King and gain control over dragonkind... and that she, Kazul, another dragon's princess, a sensible witch, and a stone prince may be the keys to thwarting their plot.All too often I grow bored and tired of books with female protagonists -- too often the \\"heroine\\" is supposed to be strong and independent but almost instantly become spineless and useless once a boyfriend (often supernatural in nature) comes along, or they rely on a convenient deus ex machina to succeed. Cimorne, thankfully, stays strong and likeable throughout the story, able to think and solve problems for herself, and even turning away the knights and prince who arrive at Kazul's cave to try to \\"rescue\\" her from the dragon. (The scene where she corrects a knight on his battle etiquette is particularly hilarous.) And though she does occasionally rely on magic to do what she needs to, such as a fireproofing spell, more often than not she's able to handle situations on her own.The book's writing style is clever and appealing as well, full of amusing references to classic fairy tales and the various themes and tropes of light fantasy. The book often comes across as an affectionate parody of fairy tales, sometimes playing them straight and other times turning elements from them on their heads. There are clever references to such tales as Sleeping Beauty, Arabian Nights, Toads and Diamonds, and even Wizard of Oz. These elements never feel jarring as they sometimes do in other fairy tale parodies (such as the Shrek movies), and they even add to the charm of the book.Highly recommended for older kids and preteens who want a light, humorous fantasy with a strong female lead, though even adults will enjoy this one. It's not a heavy, epic fantasy like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Game of Thrones,\\" but it's still quite enjoyable and isn't afraid to poke some fun at its own genre."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I can't even begin to count how many times I have read this series. I love it just as much every time. It's so fun and tongue-in-cheek. It stands convention on its head and asks 'why' to all the regular fairy tales. Witches don't have to be mean and princesses don't always like their job duties. Sometimes things are perfect just the way they are, and these books are no exception."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is a girl after my own heart. My 10 year old daughter devoured this book and the next three in the series before I reluctantly picked it up (having nothing else to read).

She likes to learn magic and fencing, Latin, philosophy, and cooking. So when her parents try to force her to marry the rather dim-witted Prince Therandil, she runs away and becomes the dragon Kazul's princess. But the wizards are causing trouble with the dragons, and something's going on. It's up to Cimorene and her friends to find out.This is one of my favorite middle-grade fantasies. Yes, it's easy, but it has a matter-of-fact and humorous way about that makes me reread it again and again. I love the character of Cimorene; she's untraditional, but really wonderful. Morwen the witch is also amusing, as is Kazul. Cimorene is a princess who doesn't hesitate to take her fate into her own hands. Dealing With the Dragons is the first of a series of four books, and while the other three are good too, it's definitely my favorite.All of my reviews can be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"As a reader who loves books with dragons in them I recommend this book and the rest in this book line."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I remember reading this back in... I think middle school? I'm not sure. What caught me was that the heroine wasn't a typical spoiled princess. She was strong and intelligent, and ran away from her family because she was tired of the restraints she experienced as a princess, she was not allowed to do things like cook or fight and when she attempted to learn, she was cut off from her secret lessons. The dragons are a lot more fun than her royal life, that's for sure!So this is a rather refreshing book, and one I would recommend for any girl (or boy) to read since it's different from your usual traditional fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"My granddaughter and grandson are really into dragons.

The princess is a princess that dose not want to be a princess and has left her castle to live with dragons, but she keeps having this knight that keeps trying to rescue her but she dose not want to be rescued.One of the best parts of this book is when Kazul and the princess goes to see the witches house, and they see that the houses rooms keep changeing. Another good part is when the princess finds tests out her fire proof spell. The best part is when the princess finds a way to get back at the wizards, but I'm not going to tell you how she dose it.

All that combined with the livley plot and vivid storytelling makes for a fantastic reading adventure for everyone young or old."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene isn't your everyday fairytale princess and Dealing with Dragons isn't your everyday fairytale, although you will recognize many allusions to them. Patricia Wrede tweaks the old-fashioned, well-known stories without getting embroiled in a politically correct mood-killer. The traditional characters retain their charm beginning with this first book of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. With her trademark light touch, Wrede creates a charming world with wizards and dragons and knights, giving you details to make your imagination take flight.And the places she takes your imagination! It all begins with a talking frog and an exasperated princess of Linderwall. Ever practical, Cimorene, plans her escape and decides she will be a dragon's princess. Adopted by Kazul as her Chief Cook and Librarian, Cimorene starts a whole new life filled with cherries jubilee, Latin, fire-proofing spells, challenging would-be rescuers, and intrigues for the dragon throne.Cimorene is joined by other delicious characters, like the cool witch Morwen, allergy-prone Roxim, fellow dragon princess Alianora, and the pretentious Society of Wizards. The action is fast-paced and exciting, but what really makes these Chronicles memorable is Wrede's witty, smooth humor. She slips in tongue-in-cheek references to conventional fairy tales everywhere, from chapter headings to bit characters without drawing unnecessary attention to it. The plot also doesn't leave things unexplained. Wrede is a tight writer, accounting for all her details in the end. Dealing with Dragons is thoroughly satisfying, completely engrossing, and totally fun, as are the sequels. A must read, at any age, especially if you like whimsical fantasy with a touch of humor and a dose of common sense!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is a very original fantasy story, featuring the un-ordinary princess Cimenore, who begins trying to escape marriage from an empty-headed prince.

Cimenore is happier than ever until the knights and princes come to try to rescue her, which she DOES NOT WANT. So she meets Morwen the witch and together they help to relocate the rescuers. But now, Cimenore can tell something is amiss, and the nasty wizards seem to be the source of trouble. I'm not going to tell you the end, you'll have to read it to find out.

I had great time laughing at the more humourous parts of the story.With a more serious story line and in-depth characters, 'Dealing with Dragons' could've been a great novel.I recommend this book for young(well... younger than me) readers just starting to have a peek at the wonderful world of SF & Fantasy."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I thought this book was very good.

She's headstrong, curious, stubborn, opinionated, smart, and tomboyish. Not only that, she is bored. Utterly, and completely bored. So when she has the chance to runaway, she takes it. Now she's living with Kazul, one of the most dangerous and powerful dragons around. A dragon who looks vicious, but is really quite sweet to her. However, Cimorene being Cimorene, she has a knack for finding and befriending dangerous characters such as a witch named Moranz, a stone Prince, a death-dealing talking bird, some wizards who are up to no good, and more. Adventure was what Cimorene was looking for, and this little Princess certainly got it!Fans of fantasy novels will be overjoyed to find DEALING WITH DRAGONS, which is the first book in the ENCHANTED FOREST CHRONICLES. Cimorene is an extremely fun character who will warm the hearts of children of all ages, especially females, as DEALING WITH DRAGONS is one of the few fantasy series heralding a female as the main character. The descriptions of the dragons, both personality and looks-wise, will charm even the grumpiest of people, as they are vivid and enchanting and make you feel as if you are right there alongside them. Patricia C.

A great beginning to a fun series."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is the classic modern heroine--plucky and a tad off-step with her surroundings. The dragons are well charactorized and as interesting in their differentness as in their similarities with humans. The humans, other than our heroine and her friends, tend to be a bit flat, but as there aren't many of them, this can be forgiven.I wouldn't go so far as to call Dealing with Dragons a fantasy classic, but it's a worth-while read. Both I and my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Do you like Fantasy books? Do you enjoy a book that gives you a few good laughs and has a little bit of romance, too? Well, then this series is for you. The first book, Dealing with dragons, is an amazingly well-told story about a princess, the youngest in a long line of golden-haired, dim-witted sisters, who grows exceedingly tired of her boring life. She wants to learn spells, cook, know how to fence, but all she is taught is how to scream properly and the correct ways to curtsey. So, after her parents try to force her to marry some simple-minded prince, Therandil, Cimorene runs away to the dragons on the advice of a toad. This book is jam-packed with laughs, interesting characters, and an enthralling landscape that parodies all the fairy tales ever written."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I'd heard quite a lot about this book before I actually read it. Everyone told me that this book was funny and great fantasy. For once, &quot;everyone&quot; was right. This book is about Cimorene, a girl who isn't your typical damsel in distress princess. She runs away to live with a dragon named Kazul. She's having a great time at Kazul's until the wizards start to stir up trouble. Cimorene must try to stop the dragons. Throughout this book, Cimorene meets many magical people and creatures such as the witch, Morwen, and another princess, Alianora. What makes this book so funny is that it alludes to many fairy tales in a way that makes fun of them. Almost a the fantasy equivalent &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide&quot;."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing with Dragons is a great book for all ages. It is perfect to be read aloud, as it was when I first read it. It is also a fun fast read for anyone over 8. It has all the aspects of the classic fairy tale but with some new twists. Has strong female characters, and humor from slapstick to sophisticated. Has a plot of mystery and magic. It is enjoyable through till the end.If you enjoyed this book, read the other Enchanted Forest Chronicles for more fun with soapy water with lemon juice."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimerone is one unusual princess. She tried to learn to cook, fence, etc, etc, and her parents kept trying to persuade her to act more like her airheady sisters. So she gets sick of everything, and decides to be a dragon's princess, which in her opinion is more interesting kind of princess to be, and it is more interesting to read.Many of the dragons want to eat her, but she is able to talk them into the thought that she would be much more valuable alive then dead.So Cimerone deals with much more than dragons in this book, such as annoying princes, witches, and sorcerers that can be melted with lemon juice/ soapy water- or something like that.I also like the second book, but the third &amp; forth books were a little sad. But, still, these books are all great."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"&quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot; is on my list of favortie books plus all the other ones that follows it.

I first read her Enchanted Forest Chronicles years ago and I am still in love with them. Her writings will be treasured for all time."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I was looking at the interview with J.K. Rowling when I saw the sign 'What to Read After Harry Potter.' I immediately clicked on, eager to see what was recommended. And I saw this fantastic book. I began my journey into the kingdom of Linderwall last year. I gleefully followed Cimorene on her adventures as the Kazul's (a dragon's!) princess, and couldn't WAIT for more. But no matter how many book stores I looked in I couldn't find the rest of the series. So imagine my delight when I looked here. Dealing With Dragons is an incredible read. It has everything a book needs: excitement, adventure, a touch of romance, and a highly believable main character. Who can honestly say that they haven't felt the way Cimorene does: sick and tired of their life, in her case a boring life of a princess, with nothing better to do then 'lady-like activities'. So the princess sets out to stop being a princess, with a great outcome. Turning away princes who come save her? As if she needs saving! It's a wonderful twist on the fairy tales of weak princesses being captured by vicious dragons, and being saved by the big strong princes. Cimorene volunteers to be a dragon's princess; if anyone needs saving it's those princes who come to 'rescue' her. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone. And the last thing I say is, &quot;ENJOY!&quot;"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"The start of four wonderful books, Dealing With Dragons is a light, funny fantasy classic.Princess Cimorene is not allowed to use swords, spoons, or magic-it's simply not done by princesses! Irritated, she takes advice from a magic frog and runs away, and is quickly adopted as the personal princess and housekeeper for a dragon, Kazul. In doing so, she discovers and explores an interesting and sometimes hilarious new culture, and is enmeshed in a conspiracy.Forget ages of foreshadowing-this book goes straight to the point, where Cimorene wants to leave. It skips along at a brisk pace with lots of funniness, such as Cimorene reasoning with a homicidal genie and trying to shrug off her various knights and suitors, who want to rescue her whether she likes it or not.It spoofs the various damsel-in-distress stories by making the princess WANT to live with the dragons, and telling her wannabe boyfriend to go away and rescue some other princess. The tea party with the four &quot;trapped&quot; princesses, two proper and two ordinary, is a riot. The wizards and dragons manage to be endearing and funny without even needing much character development.And Morwen is one of the most magical witches since... well, she's as unique as Gandalf!You'll fall in love with this book and the three sequels, I promise!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is a delightful little book of fantasy. I think all of us like to escape from time to time to a world such as that of the Enchanted Forest and the Mountains of Morning. Although this world is inhabited by dragons and bothersome wizards, it is still an airy, light-filled world that captivates the imagination. Cimorene is a princess who has no interest in learning the things a princess is supposed to learn; she would rather learn fencing, magic, cooking, and other things forbidden by her parents. Her parents finally give up on changing her ways of thinking and decide to marry her off to the prince of a neighboring realm. Rather than submit to this unwanted fate, she takes the advice of a friendly frog and volunteers to serve as a dragon's princess. The dragon Kazul accepts her offer, and Cimorene goes to work organizing Kazul's treasure rooms, cataloguing the scrolls in her library, and making cherries jubilee and other foods for her. Several princes, including her betrothed, come calling to rescue her, and she has to continually explain to them that she does not want to be rescued. Cimorene comes to discover a plot between the Wizard Society and one turncoat dragon, and it is largely up to her and the princess Alianora, working in conjunction with Kazul, the witch Morwen, and a stone prince to sort out the plan and goals of this dastardly plot and prevent the dragons from granting kingship to the traitor. Even when things are hairy, Cimorene keeps her wits about her, foiling much of the action with her own extraordinary determination.Apparently Wrede's Enchanted Forest chronicles are considered young adult literature. I did not know this when I began reading the story, and I certainly would urge other adults not to let this fact rob them of the opportunity to enter this wonderful realm of fantasy. The writing is witty, the plot is well-thought out, and the action moves along well with no dead spots or literary pot-holes. A few allusions to traditional fairy tales are interspersed in the story, lending a good bit of fun and charm to the book. Younger readers will find this book enjoyable, and Cimorene seems to me to be a pretty good role model for young women given her forthright nature, zest for learning, and discontent with the life others tell her she is supposed to lead. I look forward to reading the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is a great book that I think anyone who could should read it, because the way the author expresses the character of Cimorene. She has shown the main character as a tomboy who doesn't and is tired of the thing they do in the royal family.Princess Cimorene finds embroidery, etiquette, and being a princess boring, so she runs away and becomes a dragon's princess. She loves her new job, which allows her to practice her Latin, magic, fencing, and cooking skills, all far more interesting than etiquette, but sadly neglected by her tutors at the palace. Her intelligence and common sense soon make her an indispensable advisor to her dragon, Kazul. (Cimorene would be cross with me for calling Kazul her dragon, actually Cimorene is Kazul's princess. Convenience necessitates the shocking error.) Cimorene is never more indispensable than when she discovers a dastardly plot by the Society of Wizards to take over the dragons' kingdom in the Mountains of Morning.Princess Cimorene and Kazul are both intelligent, strong willed heroines, and great role models for kids of both sexes. There's also a fun supporting cast, including the no-nonsense witch Morwen, the shy Princess Alianora, who comes into her own with Cimorene's help, the rather grandfatherly old dragon Roxim and his allergies, the stone prince, and lots of dragons, wizards, and cats.But the aspect of Dealing with Dragons (and the others in the series) that I enjoy most is not the exciting plot or the characters, but the humor. The novel is packed with sly references to popular fairy tales, slightly skewed so that the novel is at times an enjoyable parody of the fairy tale genre. (&quot;So Aunt Ermintrude told Mama to put me and a spinning wheel in a room full of straw and have me spin it into gold,&quot; Alianora went on, &quot;And I tried! But all I could manage was linen thread, and whoever heard of a princess who can spin straw into linen thread?&quot;) This is lighthearted and enjoyable fantasy for kids 10 and up (or younger, if read aloud.)"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"My wife and I both read the book twice!

Then at the age of 14 her father discovered she was taking magic lessons.By the time she was 16, Cimorene ran away, ending up to be Kazul's princess [Kazul is the dragon who Cimorene is her princess]. There she has the freedom to do anything she wants. From cooking to magic!While Cimorene has an enjoyable lifestyle with Kazul, she has to deal with the trouble of knights that keep trying to rescue her, convincing them she was happy with Kazul and did NOT want to be rescued.As ther story goes on, the plan of wizards trying to overtake the kingdom of the Mountains of Morning unravels and builds up. There are also other characters such as Morwen the witch who doesn't take any nonsense from anyone, Princess Alianora who helps Cimorene with the wizards, a stone prince and other dragons you will meet and get to know.This book is the kind for anyone. It includes humor, adventure, plot, excitement and a hint of romance, thinly lined around the borders of the story. Cimorene is an irresistible main character that you will find hard NOT to like.

Imagine my distress, then, when my family decided to move, and I couldn't find this book, or the rest of the series, anywhere! I finally broke down and purchased all four books, and proceeded to read them over and over and over. . . you get the picture.Cimorene breaks the mold when it comes to princesses in enchanted kingdoms. She's not at all proper. She likes to fence, and cook, and conjugate Latin verbs! Her parents and their advisors, being all very proper themselves, are quite shocked. . . and they decide that they should get Cimorene married off to proper Prince Therandil as soon as possible. Cimorene tries with all of her persuasive powers to convince her parents, their advisors, and Therandil himself that this is a big mistake! However, she finally sees that the only solution to her problem is running away. So, she leaves, and with a bit of advice from a talking frog, falls in with an interesting crowd: dragons, who keep princesses to cook and clean for them. This job description being more in Cimorene's line, she goes to work with a will.This book will have you rolling as Cimorene meets up with persistent suitors, finicky princesses, unscrupulous wizards, and some extremely delightful dragons.

This book left me cold, however. It seemed aimed at a much younger audience than her normal books, and the humor was a little too silly for my tastes. Still, judging from all the other wonderful reviews on this book, perhaps I should go back and try it again."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I first read this back in middle school and I loved it and so I thought I'd give this another try. I found that Dealing With Dragons is not a bad book - its just a book that holds no appeal to me now as an adult. Some books stay with us and continue to grow as we grow, and to me this is how we come to define classics. DwD is no classic, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible one either.Cimorene is your typical fantasy princess unhappy with life. Of course she's just too *spunky* and *spirited* and *smarter* that the other people around her to be happy with life. God above save me from the wish fulfillments of teenage girls. And so our intrepid reader avatar heads off into the mountains where she becomes a live in maid for a dragon with a personality as flat as a piece of carbon paper.I will say that I did enjoy the fact that the dragon in the book is female and that Cimorene remains single throughout the entirety of the book. There's something to be said about a writer who allows her main character to remain without a paramour when she says she's not ready for one rather that forcing a romance in somewhere towards the end of the book. And we get a doubly nice touch when we see that Cimorene is very aware of her arousal to the opposite sex and views it as something natural - but she's just not ready to settle down quite yet. I'm almost willing to tack on an extra star to my rating for that one.Over all this is a good book for anyone looking for teen fantasy aged at girls that's age appropriate. The characters are unique, the prose flows evenly, there's plenty of adventure and a main character that didn't entirely make me want to gouge my own eyes out. You can't ask for more than that in a book for teens."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Great book with many humourous twists and turns which I found extremely hilarious. Fantasy lovers will want this book, even though it isn't quite what you expect. Definitely worth a try!!**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Well, I can easily, easily see how such a book as this would be so popular. It is an ingenius spin on all those fairytales we grew up with, complete with a spunky princess as a main character and her charming outlook on life.The delay for the plot is slight if non existent, and the humor is oftentime so strong you have to put the book down to wipe your eyes of tears.It is the type of book (if you are older than the intended age group, like myself) that you break out when you are having a bad day, because it will always make you smile and you could read it over and over and probably never tire of it...But if you are actually looking for a book that you will actually remember for having something besides great humor and a headstrong princess..a stereotypical one at that, then this, sadly, is not the book for you.And even if you are not expecting something other than the described mentions, then you still may, like me, not find this book quite to your flavor. There just isn't enough ACTION and ADVENTURE. Oh yes, I am very interested in reading about a princess avoid rescue from a dragon and cook in the stove...Nevertheless, while I did not enjoy it as much as I could have, if you are looking for a light, quick read that takes most of those cliches for a ride, this is it. Just don't expect any dazzling swordfights."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Someone recomended this book to me a couple of months ago so i tried to get it at the library but it was all out so i waited and waited.

Wrede's books, it is complete and utter fun. It is hard not to love this book, bubbling over with humor and excitement. Dragon's are truly loveable creatures!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"A truly miserable book. It's meant for middle-grade readers, and it starts off promisingly-enough with a princess who runs away from her family because she doesn't like being a princess. She wants to have adventures, so she goes off and finds a cave-full of dragons! And...and...she becomes a maid-servant to one of the dragons. I kid-you-not. Most of the book deals with how she cleans, cooks, sews, and generally takes care of her dragon. To be fair, the dragon whom she works for is a female dragon, so it's not quite as bad as it could have been. And she does have a few adventures. But the overall message seems to be: \\"Aspire to be a maid-servant and a care-giver, and you can still have an exciting time along the way.\\" Not the most progressive thing I've read.SIDE NOTE: For some time, I've been searching for a fantasy novel that stars a strong heroine. Many fantasy novels have strong female protagonists as side-kicks. (e.g. Hermione in Harry Potter). Others star female characters, but they fit stereotypical molds. I've found that most female fantasy heroines are either: (a) weak, bumbling, foolish women / girls who succeed due to luck &/or intuition rather than competence & skill, or (b) sexy women who kill vampires with whips, while wearing tight-fitting leather outfits that expose as much cleavage as possible. Neither is my idea of an admirable female lead."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"That's what Cimorene says when she hears she's being married off to this boring empty-headed prince who only cares about swords and tournements. A nearby talking frog hears her and asks her what she is going to do about it, and gives her advice.From the very first page, Patricia C. Wrede had me enthralled and wanting to read more. The first page describes Cimorene's castle, all of the perfectly normal things that happened there, and then the page ends with, \\"And Cimorene hated it.\\"This is a great book for girls. Not a guy-hating feminist book, but a story about a strong-willed, brave, loyal, clever girl and her adventures and friends she meets, about how she will not let any world confine her.Not only that, but it's a great funny story poking a little fun at traditional fairy stories. All of these books are great, Read them all! I especially like the third book narrated by the witch who can understand her cats. THe author really knows how cats think!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Proper Princesses don't speak Latin. They do not cook. And they most certainly do NOT learn fencing and magic! Why? Because it's just not done by proper princesses! Not even Cimorene would describe herself as a proper princess. She even chases away the knights who come to \\"rescue\\" her from the dragons because she is very happy where she is, thank you very much!And if that isn't enough to illustrate the author's sense of humor, it is also the book from which we get the warning, \\"Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.\\"I first read this book in the 7th grade (I'm now in college) and I picked it up again out of nostalgia. Imagine my surprise when I liked it even MORE the second time. The princess is intelligent, has a sense of humor, and doesn't balk at adventure. It's always refreshing to read a book with a heroine who doesn't whine about breaking a nail or wait for someone to come rescue her. This is no damsel in distress!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Patricia C Wrede is a good author and I would highly recommend this book to young girls, but the feminist lesson is a bit forced.Cimorene isn't your typical princess and she knows it. She's been groomed her whole life to marry a prince and live happily ever after, but that isn't what what would make her happy? Cimorene wants more from her life and she's willing to run away to get it. She finds herself at the door of Kazul and soon finds herself the assistant and housekeeper of a very powerful dragon. If only the stupid princes would stop trying to rescue her she might really get her happily ever after.The characters are sometimes a bit simple, but the story is fairly clever. Cimorene frowns upon girls who actually do enjoy the standard princess life. She ridicules them and finds them \\"silly\\". Wrede sets up Cimorene to be a feminist in an old fashioned world and that in itself is a good message, but putting down those who live their lives in the standard way might not be the best way to do it. You want girls to feel empowered. They should feel free to be whatever they want to be whether it's a doctor or a homemaker. All of the choices are an option and that should be taken into consideration.The book is well written, entertaining and funny. It has a good message for young girls, but would be enjoyed by boys who like fantasy also. I haven't read the rest of the series, but it be interesting to see how Cimorene develops."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"How could this be just a 5 * book???? This is like a 10 star or something! So i must give the book what it deserves. The plots are very good. they make you sit up if you're on your bed. sit at the edge of your chair jump up and down if you're standing. The names are very original and very creative. Cimorene, Mendanbar, Kazul. These are not names you would usually find in books. Thses are very modified (well not very) tales and are rib tickling. they are also very suspensive. You have to read these books. They are as good as Harry Potter! They go a long the same lines yet at the same time are completely different. They have many of the same characters, yes i'll give you that, but they are in no way similar. Who can call Antorrel and Zemanar good? WHere as Harry is the hero. Who can say that dragons are good in HP? In DWD They are good. If you are a die hard fan i strongly recommend that you read these!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing With Dragons, by Patricia C.

It's realistic, funny, invilves lots of magic, and is NOT your boring typical 'the princess is beautiful with long flowing gold hair, gets captured by a dragon, gets recued by a prince, they get married and live happily ever after'. The best thing about it is: There's a sequel! The sequel is called Searching For Dragons. Then comes Calling On Dragons, both by Patricia Wrede. Whether evil wizards are plotting against the dragons, a prince is trying to rescue Kazul's Princess, or Cimorene makes herself fireproof, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and is definitely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book was suggested to me by me sister, Lisa.

Cimorene is a princess. One day, she leaves her home. On her adventure, she aquainted with all s;orts of magical creatures, withes, wizards, and of course dragons! Some kind, and some bad. She meets a dragon, who she lives with. She meets a kind witch but ( here comes the &quot;bad&quot; part) also meets a wizrd who is bad. She does, many, many, exciting thngs besde that.

Prince Therendil: Basically, he is just a nuisance. He-like Ciromene-wants to do something memorable, like saving a princess from a fire-breathing dragon. Which is traditional to princes.

Wrede. There were 211 pages but it went by fast. This book takes place during the mid-evil times, when dragons and wizards were around.Cimorence is the main character in this book , she is around 18 years of age andshe is a pricess ,the princes of Linderwall to be exact. She normally dresses like a normal everyday teenageer.She has long black hair and wears them in braids all the time.Cimorenceis a dragons princess,the dragons name is Kzuel.Cimorence wastired of having to be proper. So she ran away to be a dragons princessshe keeps the cave neat and tidy for Kazuel.Cimorence is the main character in this book. She has everyday vocabullary ,but she really speaks mind when she wants to, even if she shouldn't at the time . An example of that would be when she got mad at the young prince Therandil. Quate'' You are being selfish, improper, annoying, and acting like a 2 yr old toddler and if you don't leave me alone you will be SORRY.'' Cimorances normal personality and physical traits are she ishonest, she is brave , she is exciting, intelligant, strong, tall, pretty, humble, hardworking,able and even witty. She has a long strain of traits.Cimornce attitudeand personality trates move the story along by quit a bit.She is always either get to ciurious and getting into trouble or her wittyness getting out of troubleand meeting new people. I think this book is an exelent book ,and would recamend it to anyone who likesdragons wizards and mid-evil times."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"These are fantasy books very comparable to Harry Potter books. They are fun and funny, with enough adventure to keep your interest. The vocabulary is difficult because she does not restrict herself to using small words, but the difficult words are repeated so that you are rewarded for looking them up (or asking a parent.) Examples: mollify, incursion, evident. These books are best read with a parent.My daughter was 8 when we first read these books, and I had to encourage her to ask when she didn't understand the words, but after a while she got the hang of it, and some of the words actually stuck. Now that she is 10, she knows to ask, and she remembers many of the words.The characters are well developed, and it's fun to think of how specific characters would react to things and situations that come up daily in our real-world lives. It really adds to the enjoyment of the books."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"When I was younger this was the only book I ever enjoyed.

As a picky reader myself, I cannot see how anyone could dislike this amazing book."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I received this book a long time ago as a gift from one of my foster dads and fell in love with it. I was so excited to find it again and i feel the same love when i read it again. Thank you for bringing those memories back to me."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I didn't read this when it was \\"all the rage\\" in the early '90s when it was published, so I was curious to see how much I'd like it all these years later and coming to it as an adult. Turns out, I liked it quite a lot!I think the concept is delightful: In a world where princesses are constantly being rescued from dragons by princes (and consequently married to said princes), Cimorene is a princess who *chooses* to go work for a dragon -- and not because she wants to be rescued by a prince, but because she needs to get away from her overbearing royal family. Turns out not being rescued is rather a chore as princes are constantly trying to \\"rescue\\" Cimorene, even though she's perfectly safe. In addition, Cimorene finds herself overhearing/seeing some pivotal information that could determine the safety of the dragons one way or the other. Oh, and did I forget to mention that the dragons can talk, there are enchanted caves, complicated spells and even wizards?I really liked Wrede's writing style and can see how this book was a huge hit (and still is)! Cimorene is a protagonist you can get behind, and the dragons are all intriguing as well.For me personally, this book was probably just a 4 star, simply because reading it now it doesn't have the \\"newness\\" that it probably did in the 90s where the female was going against the typical stereotypes. I was rather annoyed that pretty much all the male characters in the book (save a few exceptions) were portrayed as dumb or annoying, etc. And I thought it a little unfair that when some of the princes were trying to save Cimorene, not knowing that she was in no danger, Cimorene wasn't more grateful. I'm all for equality between men and women, but prefer equality as opposed to smart girls and silly men. But, that said, given when this was published, and probably the point it was attempting to make at the time, I'll give it five stars since other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the story!The plot kept me guessing and I found it hard to put the book down. And now that I've written this review I find myself eager to read the next book in the series :)"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is all about character. Cimorene is a princess who is tired of being a princess. She hates learning how to be proper and ladylike, and what she really wants most is to fence, study Latin, and learn how to cook really elaborate desserts. When her favorite activities are all taken from her and a marriage to a very proper and very conventional prince is proposed, she runs away.Where is she to go? To a dragon, of course! Instead of fighting the dragon or becoming its prisoner, though, Cimorene becomes library assistant/pastry chef/best girlfriend to a female dragon named Kazul. Along the way, she also befriends a witch, a much-bullied fellow princess, and a Stone Prince.The one thing that is lacking in this book is a sense of well-guided suspense. The book does have a plot (wizards trying to interfere in the lives of dragons), but it's a little meandering and nowhere near as engaging as Cimorene herself is. Also, Cimorene falls into the category of those characters that are so self-assured, who always land on their feet, so you never really worry about her. This deprives the book from a measure of suspense that I think would be necessary to take it to the 5-star level.However, this book is fun, clean, whimsical, intelligent (chock full of funny allusions to other fairy tales) and I recommend it. I also plan on reading the subsequent volumes in the series."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dragons, wizards, witches, talking animals, disappearing ledges, and magic. What else could a lover of fantasy books want? Did I forget to mention a rebellious princess? The book doesn't exactly tell a new story. Princess Cimorene prefers male activities, disdains marriage, rebels against her parent's wishes, and even runs away from home. Yet Dealing with Dragons by Patricia Wrede's is fun and contains enough new twists (including one that involves a bad wizard) to make it worth adding to your fantasy reads.Cimorene's parents expected their princess daughter to dance, embroider, draw, and practice royal etiquette. Cimorene preferred instead to fence, practice magic, and cook. In this way, the book fails to break from the cliche tale about a bored female who prefers male activities and disdains marriage.It did not really surprise me then that her parents forbade all her improper pursuits. In this way too, the book fails to break from the cliche tale about the royal parents who want their daughter to act like a proper albeit stuffy princess.One day Cimorene's parents took her on a trip which she supposed to be an improvement over staying home-until she realized her parents were taking her to meet a potential suitor. Um, should I say again that this was not an unexpected twist? Nor was her decision to run away.Sounds as if this book disappointed me, doesn't it? It may surprise you to know: It didn't. I like Wrede's style. She immediately makes me feel as if I am reading a fairy tale. I also appreciate her humor, which somewhat makes up for the cliches in the first few chapters. And, truth to be told, when not a guise for anti-male or anti-marriage propoganda, I am a sucker for a well-told tale about a rebellious princess.As for the rest of the book, it contained enough twists and revelations to leave intrigued about the sequels. One however made no sense: Cimorene meets a talking frog while at the palace who never appears later in the book. His only role is to encourage her to run away and to direct her towards the dragons. How convenient! The rest of the scenes were suspenseful and fun: Cimorene runs away to live with dragons. They turn out to be as dangerous as you might expect fire-breathing creatures to be, requiring her to develop an anti-flammable potion. Knights come to rescue Cimorene, inspiring her to seek a spot to post a sign that warned suitors to stay away. Along the way, she encounters a not-so-pleasant wizard. He plays a critical role later in the book, but I'm not going to play spoiler here. You'll have to read the book to discover how his role and that of princes, witches, caves, and spells figure prominently in this fantasy adventure.Despite its imperfections, the book wriggles into my imagination. Like I said, rebellious females make for intriguing characters. Futhermore, amidst visits from princesses and cooking lessons, plenty of danger and fantastical creatures abound. And, while most loose ends are tied up at the end, there is enough is left to my imagination to both satisfy me and to leave me desiring more stories about Cimorene and her dragon friends."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This was my absolute favorite book when I was 9-12. I really want to read it again. First book that i could ever remember reading and still my favorite."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"What a joy to read this novel! I laughed from the opening pages! Wrede has an adorable wit that seasons every page, laughing in the face of traditional fairy tales. Tradition and what's \\"supposed\\" to be done in the fairy kingdom is just not what our main character Cimorene wants to do. What starts out as a quest to be happy turns into a bit of a mystery for her and her dragon to solve and becomes quite perilous at the end! Wonderful turn of events on the story. I highly recommend to all readers and lovers of fantasy fiction, young and old."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene, the youngest daughter of the King of Linderwall, was a very reluctant princess. She wore her long jet-black hair in braids instead of curled and pinned like her sisters. She had the best tutors in dancing, embroidery, and etiquette, but Cimorene found it all very dull. She preferred to sneak away and take classes in fencing, magic, and economics. Her parents wouldn't hear of it, and put and end to that nonsense. When she was old enough to marry the prince of Sathem-by-the-Mountains, Cimorene rebelled. She did what any reluctant princess would do; she ran away and became the princess for the dragon Kazul.Patricia C. Wrede's young adult novel, Dealing With Dragons, spoofs fairy tales as it develops a fascinating arc between the rebellious princess and Kazul, a powerful and dangerous dragon.Readers will laugh at the connections Wrede makes to familiar fairy tales. We all know witches melt when a bucket of water is tossed on them, but in Cimorene's world water mixed with suds and lemon is what is needed to dissolve a wicked wizard.From first page to last readers will be flipping pages to see how Cimorene survives life with her dragon friends and perhaps help them out of life threatening predicaments. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene's parents aren't sure what to do with her. She is tall, thin, dark haired, and her personality is totally unsuitable for a princess. All of her sisters had turned out fine but Cimorene is bored out of her mind by the things princesses are supposed to do, so instead she learns everything they are not, like magic, cooking, fencing and many other strange skills. When faced with an arranged marriage, she does the only thing logical - she finds a dragon to offer her diverse services to.This book is light and funny, playing with the stereotypes found in fairy tales and fantasy while still being a compelling tale in its own right. I recommend this to both boys and girls, as I have known people of both genders who adored the book. I would recommend this to late elementary schoolers or middle schoolers, depending on their individual reading abilities. This book would also be very cute read aloud."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I enjoyed this story, and the sequels, as a young girl. Wrede creates a magical world that has a unique feel while incorporating common elements from fairytales. I've read in several times since and still enjoy it. Dealing with Dragons is very much a girl power book - almost all of the good main characters are female, Princess Cimerone rejects the staid life society thrusts upon her and charts her own course, and the King of the Dragons ends up being a female (King is just the title of the job, designating nothing about gender). It is well written, something that can certainly not be said of all fantasy novels written for this age group, and the story is fun and engaging."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing With Dragons is one of my all time favorite books.

The book is about a princess Cimmorene who asks a dragon to capture her. The book is full of evil wizards, befuddeling dragons, and complicated potions.

Patricia C. Wrede beats the other authors by far! Her books enspire me to write many of my novels, which I mainly keep to dwarfs (My favorite characters of fantasy).

The adventure begins when Cimorene, a princess, runs away from her palace because of not wanting to marry a prince. She meets Kazal, who is my favorite character of her first book, and becomes her princess. She endlessly has to talk knights who want to rescue her, and sometimes it gets downright silly!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is simply wonderful.

I can't get enough of her clean humor and fairy tale parodies. My copies of her books are falling apart and I have been very disappointed to find that most of her books are out of print!

She doesn't like etiquette or embroidery. She's her own person. A great example for a young woman! She certainly doesn't want to marry some dumb prince. When a frog suggests she get help at a shanty near the forest, she finds herself in the company of dragons. Normally this would frighten a princess, but Cimarene charms one of the dragons into letting her be a dragon's princess - that way she would properly not have to get married! She gets along swimmingly with her dragon Kazul. With the help of a stone prince, a sweet but flighty dragon princess friend and a very clean witch, Cimarene ultimately saves the dragon kingdom from the evil wizards' plot to overcome the kingdom using magic from the Caves of Fire and Night.

It was amazingly refreshing to read books that had no profanity or pronography; just pure creative fiction. The Enchanted Forest Chronicals are books that I never tire of reading.

The first thing I wouldn't change is the description. I wouldn't change how she wrote it in the point of view she used. The things I would change would be the names of the characters.I would recommend this book to some of my friends because it's a wonderful."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"DEALING with DRAGONSBy Patricia C. WredeDealing with Dragons is about princess Cimorene whose parents arranged her to marry the dullest man, Prince Therandil. Her lady-in-waiting had told her so Cimorene wined that would rather be eaten by a dragon than marry Therandil. A frog told Cimorene that she could be eaten eaten by a dragon. The frog told her the way to the dragons. Cimorene was really desperate and followed the frog's advice. After endless walking she finally arrived at the dragon Kazul's cave where she meets the dragon. Together they had an adventure fighting away bad wizard, finding mysteries and many other things. The main characters of the story are Cimorene and Kazul. They are also my favorites because Cimorene is a girl and acts like a boy, and Kazul who is the nicest dragon I know so far. This story is an interesting book I have read and extremely fun to read.Dealing with Dragons reminds me how my sisters and I were at the dinner table when my mother went out for a minute to phone somebody. We decided that this was our chance to act like pigs, to slobber our food in our mouths, to eat with our hands or with our mouths on the plates. We had so much fun; we didn't notice my mother coming in. Her mouth fell open; we were caught in act. Our mother became upset and said that it was uncivilized. In Dealing with Dragon Cimorene wanted to sword fight, cook, to do magic, but her mother caught her and told her it was improper. We don't always want to be proper we just want to have fun. Can't we fulfill our dreams even when we are not proper or civilizedDealing with Dragons is very interesting and funny. I did not like the book - I loved it. My favorite parts were when Cimorene murmured, \\"I'd rather be eaten by a dragon\\" and when Cimorene was looking for a plant called feverfew with her friend Alianora. I also liked when Cimorene and her friend saw the wizard Antorell who was picking a purple plant called Dragons bane. Dragonsbane is deadly to the dragon. When Cimorene finds out what the wizard are up to it is very mysterious. The book doesn't have any parts I dislike, but if I could change something, it would be that the wizard's son Antorell fell in love with Cimorene. That would make the book more interesting and even funnier.I recommend Dealing with Dragons because I really had fun reading it, and I want other people to have laugh and have fun with this book. My sister recommended Dealing with Dragons to me, and She was right. It was fun to read and extremely interesting (it even had some cliffhangers). I am also recommending Dealing with Dragons because it has fantasy a bit like The Never Ending Story. Dealing with Dragons has alot of action and many weird or Ironic fairy tales.People who like wizardry stories, mysteries, action and fantasy will love this book, just like I do. Dealing with Dragons is a good fantasy book, a good guidebook how on to act with dragons most important a book that explains not to be eaten by a dragon."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Who knew that an author could write engaging fantasy while effectively skewering every famous fairy tale out there? The characters are wonderful, interesting people, the plot is quick and simple, and the humor is great. I'm a fan of Grimm and Anderson's fairy tales, and I loved all the inside jokes! (There's even a reference to The Chronicles of Narnia in the second book: anybody who can spot it deserves a cookie) If your looking for something light and easy, while still being interesting, give the Enchanted Forest Chronicles a try..."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I stumbled on Dealing with Dragons in my school library when I was hunting for something good to read. It looked intriguing, so I picked it up, borrowed it, then took it home and read it. It was so good! I'm a sucker for fantasy and magicry books, and this fit in perfectly. It's about this girl, or rather princess, Cimerone, who is bored sick of her life. So she runs away to the dragons, and becomes one of the dragon's, Kazul, princess. The couple of chapters after that are just how all these people come to try and rescue her, and she doesn't want to be rescued, so she sends them away. Then the plot thickens. The wizards are being extreme pests, and they do all sorts of awful things."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"The pleasant but &quot;improper&quot; Princess Cimorene of the kingdom of Linderwall goes through experiences much like any other princess of the time. However the way she reacts to these ordinary pratices of normal princesses is hardly ordinary. The story tells of how she volunteers to be a dragons princess which is simply &quot;not done&quot;. However this is an acceptable job for a princess nontheless and she is not rejected by the dragons. Princess Cimorene becomes Kazul the dragons princess and they get along quite well. She does jobs for him such as organizing his treasure and cooking for him along with various other things. But things get quite complicated when some wizards start roaming around dragon territories unwanted. They interfere with the dragons greatly especially considering dragons are allergic to wizards. But in the end all the problems work out and Cimoerene has a very acceptable new job. This is a wonderful book of fantasy and magic that is definitly worth the time to read it. I've read it 3 times already and everytime I pick it up i still find it hard to put down.You should definitly pick up this book somewhere and I promise you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I used to read a lot of fantasy as a kid, but Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles is the only one I can solidly remember. I used to read over and over about stoic men, hysterical damsels, and the like, and when I came across this book it was if I had been freed.Ms. Wrede does an excellent job at writing a lighthearted book while still keeping it exciting, and proving that girls do have a place in fantasy. I don't know if as I guy I would have enjoyed it that much, with its cooking and cleaning and sensibility, so thank God I'm a girl.I think the best part about this book, and the entire series, is that even though Wrede seems to be writing mainly towards young girls, she is writing to young girls who love dragons, running away to find their destiny, and doing what needs to be done. There's no swooning or waiting for prince charming in sight. Cimorine was an inspiration to me, and always will be."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is not your everyday fairytale princess and in the book Dealing With Dragons, Cimerone does not do many practical princess things. Patricia Wrede changes the old-fashioned, well-liked stories without getting stuck in a perfectly correct fairytale. The traditional characters keep their charm beginning with this first book of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. With her trademark fun and exciting form of writing, Wrede creates a charming world with wizards, dragons, and knights, giving you details to make your imagination take flight.It all begins with a talking frog and an exasperated princess of Linderwall. Ever practical, Cimorene, plans her escape and decides she will be a dragon's princess. Adopted by Kazul, a female dragon, as her \\"Chief Cook and Librarian\\", Cimorene starts a whole new life filled with cherries jubilee, Latin, fire-proofing spells, soap and water, and intrigues for the dragon throne.Cimorene is joined by other interesting characters, like the nit-picky, clean witch Morwen, fellow dragon princess Alianora, and the sneaky Society of Wizards. The action is fast-paced and exciting, but what really makes this book great is Wrede's witty, smooth humor. The plot doesn't leave things unexplained. Wrede is a great writer, accounting for all her details in the end. Dealing with Dragons is very satisfying and totally fun! A must read, at any age, especially if you like whimsical fantasy with a touch of humor and a dose of common sense!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is a great book for anyone! Ecspecial those who don't think dragons are all that bad. Also this is a book for just about anyone no matter how well they read ecspecially kids. I read this book when I was in 6th grade and then the whole series after! In grade school I had a hard time reading I even had to be tutored for my reading problem. I was very picky about what I read and this was someting I really liked that shoule tell you something about this book. As a matter of fact I enjoyed this so much I've been looking for it every where for years! I'm so glad to have found it here. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't think your son or daughter can read it I think you should read it to them! They will be begging you to read the whole series!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is very differnt yet very tradtional in its story. It is differnt because of Cimorene and Kazul but traditional because of the way most princesses have long golden hair and the giants that ruin villages. This is a wonderful book to read and has the funniest refrences to traditional fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty. This is a book for everyone."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Miss.Wrede's books are full of imagination. I have read all four of these chronicles. I have reread them over and over. They are something to remember. Her characters are wonderful. THe books she wrote are full of adventures and humourus parts. I hate it when people critisize the books that are good. Read these four books! Starting from the order. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This funny light reading is sure to keep you interested from cover to cover. The unusual princess featured in this book is tired of &#8220;what is done&#8221; and moves on out of the castle to do what she wants without the restraints of the king and queen, eventually finding a dragon and learning about the evil that threatens their race. The humor and mystery in &#8220;Dealing with Dragons&#8221; makes it interesting for everyone.The plot is steady save for the slight twists and turns that reveal many familiar (and yet humorously different) fairy tale elements, such as a talking frog (who is not a prince) and the wizards (who are the evil counterparts to witches, and not vice versa). The plot makes this book simply a page turner that&#8217;s hard to put down.The author uses language easy enough for any middle school student, but the word choice effectively creates humor, suspense, and mystery, taking the level of language to meet its full potential and making the book easy to read but still enjoyable for all age groups.A small and slight drawback is the fact that the humor in this book is partly based on the accepted facts of other widely known fairy tales. The humor is best understood with some background knowledge of fantasy stories.Another bad spot of this book is its minuscule length. This may not be the book of choice for those who enjoy a long, heavy reading.Perhaps the most commonly complained about feature of this book is the plot. To some people, the previously mentioned humor twists are distracting elements that stray from the main storyline.I personally do not agree with the cons mentioned above, having found a chuckle or a laugh on most every page. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy humor and slight mystery (with not much drama) and short, light reading, enjoyable even after reading it multiple times."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is a great book in my opinion. It is fairly short and pretty easy to read. Therefore you can read it in a day or so. Its also pretty funny. I found myself chortling every so often. And the most humerous part of it is that it makes recelations to other stuff. e.g. The book talks about a magic ring at one point and says \\"its not like those good rings that make you invisible or...\\" And you know it has to do with LOTR. It has other stuff like that too.The plot goes as follows: A young princess isnt like her sisters. Instead of long wavy gold hair she has raven black hair she likes to tie in a bow. To get away from marring a idiotic prince she decides to become a dragons prince (a dragon maid, cook, etc.). Which is highly unusual considering dragons usually have to kidnap princesses for that job. But she offered and even asked the princes who tried to rescue her to go away. The rest of the book goes through the young sable-hair princesses life as a dragons princess (but not boring whatsoever). There is a mixture of hilarous belivable characters throughout the book. But thats not all. There's a band of evil wizards who want to destroy all dragons... Can a young dragons princess figure out what their up to?There is three books following Dealing With Dragons all of which have the same set of characters with new ones added on each book. Their aways added little segments of action througout the books to keep the reader grasped.I recoment this book to lots of everyone unless you hate funny books that involve an Enchanted Forest and Princess who doesnt need protected and a female King Dragon. :)!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I thought this book was one of the best books i've ever read!

It has dragons, wizards, witches and stone pirinces! The blurb on the back cover pulled me right in, \\"Take one bored princess, make her the seventh daughter in a very proper royal family, have her run away, add one powerful, fascinating, dangerous dragon.\\" After each chapter, I felt like I had to keep reading and reading. The first chapter has the main character Cimorene talking to a frog! It already is reeling you in. And it just gets better and as you keep reading.A princess named Cimorene is so sick of her boring life. Plus she has six perfect proper sisters. While Cimorene was out in the garden, she meets a talking frog who tells her to run away and when she sees a hovel walk straight up to the door, knock three times, snap her fingers then go inside. Cimorene takes the frog's advice and runs away. She does exactly what the frog tells her to do, but when she steps inside and it is pitch black every where she turned, and the door is shut behind her, things aren't looking too good for Cimorene princess of Linderwell.I recommend this book to anyone who is into fantasy, but I think anyone would enjoy this book. I like books that start out with excitement, and keep you reading. A great book by Patrica C. Wrede."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"For those readers who are tired of the stereotypical fantasy princess who sits on her hands and waits for a prince to rescue her, Cimorene is a breath of fresh air. Cimorene is not the kind of princess her parents want her to be; she is bored by sewing, dancing and etiquette and wants to learn magic, cooking and swordsmanship. The final straw comes when her parents have arranged for her to marry. Instead she runs away.In Cimorene's world dragons often kidnap princesses, who then must be rescued by a daring prince. The dragons live in a massive network of caves in a mountain range, and their captive princesses get together to socialize and commiserate with each other, wondering when they will be rescued and by whom. Not Cimorene. She does the unthinkable: Cimorene volunteers to be a dragon's princess. Her offer is accepted by Kazul, a female dragon with an extensive library and treasure trove that need organizing. In time, Cimorene becomes a combination of cook, maid, secretary and close companion to Kazul.In between dissuading knights from rescuing her, organizing Kazul's belongings and cooking for dinner parties, Cimorene finds herself in the middle of foiling a plot to take over the throne of the dragons. She is aided in her efforts by the captured princess Alianora and a prince who has been partly turned to stone. At the end of the novel Cimorene delights the reader by defying their expectations and...well, I'm not going to spoil it for you.Dealing with Dragons is a pleasant surprise in that it has a somewhat feminist perspective: Cimorene wants to be who she is and do what she's interested in, never mind the fact that she's a girl. She is smart, independent and capable of handling her own problems. Not only that, the book has humor. Dealing with Dragons is a novel I have enjoyed more than any other novel I've read in quite awhile."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is about a princess who doesn't like to be proper. So she goes and takes advice from a frog, and goes to a place far away. After listening to the frog she goes looking for a dragon. Once she got to a tavern full of dragons she thought maybe this isn't such a good idea. A yellowish-green dragon suggested that they eat her. But a grayish-purplish dragon takes her in as his princess. She stays there for about half a year with little problems along the way. But at the end??? If you want to find out what happens read the book Dealing with Dragons. I would recommend this book to people because it is very detailed. When it describes something it makes you feel like you're actually there. When a gust of wind comes you get blown away, or when a dragon breathes fire the room heats up. This book is fun because it keeps you guessing and on your toes. People who like adventure, mystery, and just reading should read this book. This book is set back in about the 1400's."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Genre: Humor/ FantasyThis is a fairytale turned upside down.

With the help of a witch, a stone prince, a fellow dragon's princess and some buckets of soapy water, Princess Cimorene might just save the day.These is a great story.

Cimorene is great new twist into the traditional world with her non-princess appearence and personality. She's got a tomboy attitude and she means business! Its a great story that will keep you wondering what this girl will do next.

A great read for all ages!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"When I first picked up this book it looked totaly cool. My favorite charicters are Morwen, Kazul, and Cimorene. I like Morwen because she so sensibel, Kazul because she took Cimorene in, and Cimorene because you have to like the main charicter! When I got started on the book I finished it in a afternoon. When I read this book I started reading my Mom parts. She loved it! Now that I'm on to the fourth one I've been reading the first book over to my mom. We're only in the sixth chapter. My favorite parts when Cimorene is pretending to be a foolish as her sisters when the wizerds come. I don't think my sister has read it but I did suggest it to her. I suggest this to people who like fantasy, adventure, and girls who are the heoros. I say this is a antidote to those horribel storys with helpless girls in it."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I loved this book By Patricia C.

Wrede is a fantastic author who makes the fantasy and dreamlike thought of dragons seem real and very possible in our world. It is a wonderful book for another reason as well. It deals with how teens feel when their parents won't let them do something that they want to do and make them do something they want to do. I hope this review helps you all and I hope you love the book as much as i do, along with the other Enchanted Forest Chronicles!!ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites. It is a &quot;must read&quot; in the genre of juvenile fantasy. This first book in the series of four is by far the best. Gradually the tales lose strength by number four, but all are definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because I'm very interested in young adult fantasy books. I found it in the library one day and was interested in reading it. It is a really good book if you like the whole fairy tale thing with princesses and dragons. Basically, the whole book deals with a unique princess who doesn't quite fit in and decides to live with dragons. She does that and spends the rest of the book living with them. If you want the details, you'll just have to read the book. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I read this book about a year ago and it was great! The story is about a bored princess named Cimorene who is absolutely sick of learning how to be a lady, so she decides to run away from home and have adventures. (The best move she ever made if you ask me) After following the directions of a talking frog, she befriends and becomes the princess of the mighty dragon Kazul. All in all this was a funny, lighthearted tale that makes fun of just about every fantasy story and fairy tale that has come out in the past five hundred years or so. Though some of the jokes may be lost on readers not previosly well read in fantasy, it is still an excellant and well written book with lots of strong female characters."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"_Dealing With Dragons_ is a light-hearted and fun story of Princess Cimorene, a clever and resourceful young heroine who, tired of being &quot;proper,&quot; decides to wander off in search of a dragon.

There, she encounters wild adventures, evil wizards, and rule-breaking dragons. I reccomend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I have read this book at least 25 times since I bought it last year. It's just the kind of book I love. I completely agree with Cimorene on everything. The only book that is possibly better is the sequel, Searching for Dragons. There needs to be more books like this!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"The book Dealing with Dragons is one of the most fantastic books I have ever read. It held my interest and made me feel good. Between adventure and happiness, Patricia C. Wrede catches your attention and makes you want to read it over and over again.In the book, the characters were really willing to go and figure out why wizards have been snooping around the Mountains of Morning. That's one of the reasons I liked this book so much. My favorite characters are Cimorene and Kazul. As Cimorene runs away from the castle she meets a kind dragon named Kazul, who lets Cimorene live with her. Later in the book wizards secretly working with a dragon named Worag, who wants to be the king of dragons and is trying to get rid of Cimorene and her friends. In this it was a wild adventure for princess Cimorene.The book Dealing with Dragons was not a boring book. The author Patricia C. Wrede was able to hold the interest of the reader throughout the story. The description of scenes was really descriptive and you could picture them in your head. There were sad and funny parts throughout the book. One of my favorite parts was when Cimorene and Kazul visited Morwen the witch. Cimorene rode on Kazuls back while she was flying over the tall trees. I was imagining that I was on Kazul too.After reading this book, I learned many different things. I also couldn't believe how good this book was. The major situation was trying to figure out what the wizards were up to. This book will leave you wanting to read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Wizards, dragons, magic, and a run away princess. If you like those things then you will love \\"Dealing With Dragons\\" by Patricia C. Wrede. When Cimerone runs away to a little house in the forest, that a toad told her to go to, she meets some scary dragons. But almost before the dragons ate her, another dragon came and saved her. And now she works for the dragon, Kazul. When one of the dragons killed the king, all the dragons have to have a challenge to see who well be the next king. Will Kazul become the new king or will she die trying?I think the theme for this book is that just because some people don't like something doesn't mean you shouldn't like it. Because some people thought Cimerone was crazy that she was living with a dragon and she didn't care about what they said. I think Patricia wrote this book to tell about people that have everything they could ever have and all they want is freedom to do what they want.\\"That doesn't make it proper, dear,\\" Cimerone's mom said. Cimerone never wanted to be a princess. She liked to do fencing, magic, and cooking. But she never liked being a princess. I would recommend this book to people that love to read about fantasy's and adventures. Also if they like dragons, witches, and magic they would like this book!

To avoid meeting another prospective husband, Cimorene runs away from home and finds herself the princess of a dragon. Unlike the other princess' within the dragons' community, Cimorene willingly works for Kazul and assists her with her magic, housekeeping, cooking, and other most un-princess-like jobs.

She is called princess Cimorene. unlike her 5 sisters, who are all perfectly normal proper princesses, all having long blond hair and sweet dispositions, Cimorene is tall, with jet black hair.And instead of wanting to do embroidery and dancing lessons, Cimorene would much rather take fencing and magic lessons. But after her parents (king and Queen of Linderwall) ban her from taking magic and fencing lessons, Cimorene decides to do something about it. She runs away to become a dragon's princess. After almost being eaten by a hungry, not so nice,dragon, she becomes the dragon kazul's princess. While with Kazul she befriends another dragon's princess, has an encounter with a jinn, and has to deal with some very tricky, nasty wizards who are determined to kill the dragon kazul.This was a very well-written book. It had many fairy tales mixed in, while still making Sense. For being a book about a princess, it was very original; I've never seen any other book like this one. It has alot of adventure and just the right amount of humor. I like how each chapter starts with \\"in wich...\\", it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere. This is one of those books where are never bored reading it; it's non-stop fun from beginning to end. This is a book you could read in one day.There reallly weren't any negative points in this book, because it's so good. Maybe it could have been a little longer, because I always feel like there should be more. That's really all I can think of; it's such a good book, there are hardly any negative points in it at all.If you want to find out what happens between Cimorene and Kazul, and the wizards of course, Then definitely read this book. Partricia C. Wrede did a wonderful job writing this book (and the whole series) If you like fantasy stories, improper princesses and mischeivous wizards, then read \\" Dealing with dragons\\" by Patricia C. Wrede."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing With Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede was fairly good, and entertaining. Lots of people have read it. DWD is a popular novel, and it is about a princess named Cimorene. Of course, she's not at all interested in becoming a 'lady', what is totally expected of her. That's why she runs away, and becomes a dragon's princess-- with pleasure. While Cimorene's not fending off annoying rescuers, or trying to not get her head blown with fire in the heat of a dragon argument, she also has to save the King of Dragon's reserved throne from dangerous wizard who intend to do nothing but evil-doing."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing with Dragons is probably one of the best books i have ever read!!

Even if there are no pictures in this book it is still an amazing book that i would recommend to anybody!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimerone of Linderwall is everything a princess shouldn't be. She isn't short like her sisters, or as pretty (or dumb). She doesn't want to learn about embroidery, lady-like manners, how to bow perfectly, and, least of all, how loudly it is permissible to scream when being carried off by a giant. So she bullies her father's people into giving her fencing lessons, magic lessons, cooking classes, and many other things. Finally, she has had it. The royal family takes a vacation up to the mountains, and there she finds that she will be married to the son of the royal family that lives there. She runs into a mountain full of dragons, and becomes the dragon Kazul's princess, cooking and cleaning and practicing her Latin skills. She makes friends with the dragon Woraug's princess, Alianora, and, with Kazul's and the witch Morwen's help, she thwarts a plot by the local wizards to interfere with the choosing of the dragon King.This is definitely a good read! It was humorous, and you can tell that it started out as a regular fairy tale, but Patricia Wrede has made it much, much better by doing this. Dealing with Dragons was only the first, and I hope to be reading the other three very soon!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing With Dragons is the type of book where you read the last sentance and you wish it had lasted longer. You wish that it didn't have to end. A book where you can't WAIT to get your hands on the sequal! I finished this book in less time than i expected it to take me to finnish. I fell in love with the story and the plot from the moment the characters were introduced through the climax to the moment where all of them were settling down again. What isn't there to like about this book? It isnt at all like the ideal fairy-tale with fragile princessses and heroic knights. Princess Cimorene isnt the average princess who spends hours learning ediqitte and manners and when to faint. She Prefers fencing and magic, all of which are \\"absolutely unheard of\\" according to her parents. But when she finally finds the life she has always wanted, its with a dragon named Kazul. Now take the princes that want to rescue her in spite of tradition and imagine how they would feel if the princess refuses to be resuced! That, my friends, is a story you dont want to miss! Each page is full of action and irony and lovable characters with realistic goals and traits. :)"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book by Patricia C. Wrede is an amazing fantasy 'princess' story that veers from the 'Anderson/Grimm' norm. Princess Cimorene was a black-haired tall princess who enjoyed reading, cooking, fencing, and 'non-girl' things. She was very unlike your typical youngest sunshine-blonde bashful beauty that princesses in fantasies often turn out to be. She was, however, not acceptable in this way at the palace, and, as she was to be married to an idiotic prince anyway, decided to leave the castle. She met a frog who pointed her in the right direction and eventually found her way to many adventures with a sensible purple dragon, an unwitchy witch, and many other delightful characters that will make you laugh and smile throughout the book. I could not put this book down because it was so delightfully entertaining. I had to go out and buy the other three and Ms. Wrede's short story collection, all of which I would also most definitely recommend! Buy this book right now! You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is great! It is for everyone! It is about a princess named Cimorene.

She goes with one named Kuzul. She makes friends and finds an exciting new life. But something evil is about...I'm not going to tell the end but its great!

I love this book and it is seriously my new favorite. This was a beautifully written book that contained great, clever wit mixed with daring predicaments and hilarious humor! This is truly the best book on my shelf! I can't wait to read the rest of the series!! I LOOOOVE THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing with Dragons Book One- The Enchanted Forest ChroniclesCimorene is bored to tears with being a princess. She hates the embroidery and the dancing lessons and the etiquette. But she is interested in all the things that are improper for a princess to learn, like fencing and magic and juggling and Latin.\\"When she was fourteen, her father discovered that she was making the court magician teach her magic.\`How long has this been going on?' he asked wearily when she arrived in response to his summons.\`Since you stopped my fencing lessons,' Cimorene said. \`I suppose you're going to tell me it isn't proper behavior for a princess.'\`Well yes. I mean, it isn't proper.'\`Nothing interesting seems to be proper,' Cimorene said.She's not really your traditional princess; you know the type: golden hair, sapphire eyes, and a little foolish. That's why she decides to run away before she is forced to marry a dim-witted and extremely handsome prince.On her runaway, Cimorene meets a cave full of large and very toothy dragons. A female dragon named Kazul takes Cimorene in as her princess, after Cimorene volunteers herself for the job, which is unheard of. Through her adventures of learning how to be a dragon's princess along with the nuisance of knights who try to rescue Princess Cimorene, (even though she does not want to be rescued) Cimorene makes a few new friends. Her friends aren't the type of friends a normal princess should make. Cimorene becomes good friends with another captive princess, a very clean and not so very evil witch, and a prince who has been turned into stone who is more like a statue that can move and talk. As Cimorene's story unravels, she and her friends discover a plot to cheat in the contest of who will become the next King of the Dragons which involves some very deceitful and sticky wizards.Dealing with Dragons is a phenomenal story of bravery, life long friendships, and trust that will appeal to readers of all ages. I think pre-teen and teenage girls will especially enjoy this fictional novel because it presents a girl who is brave and intelligent and not afraid to put herself in danger for the sake of her friends. The minute I picked up the book, I became entranced in the world of dragons, princesses, and thrilling adventures.To me, a really great book is one that when you finish the last sentence on the last page and close the book, part of you stays in the book ready for the next time you open it. Dealing with Dragons is not just a great book; it is a wonderful book. Getting caught up in the world of Cimorene and her friends is only part of this book that readers will treasure.Dealing with Dragons is a totally unique book, unlike any others I have ever read. Patricia C. Wrede does a marvelous job in writing Cimorene's story. Wrede was born in 1953 in Chicago, Illinois. She sold her first book Shadow Magic in 1980. Her latest books she wrote along with Caroline Stevermer in 2004 were Sorcery and Cecilia or the Enchanted Chocolate Pot and the sequel, The Grand Tour."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book is one of my favorites in all the world. It starts out when Princess Cimorene is bored of all the lessons a Princess is required to have and bored of Linderwall, her kingdom. When she finds out she is to be engaged to a Prince (a rather stupid one), she decides to run away. She meets up with Kazul, one of the most powerful dragons in the land, and is hired as the dragon's princess. (Kazul had to do some convincing the other dragons, because they wanted to eat Cimorene.)Anyway, Cimorene meets up with some pretty shady wizards,and soon finds out that they are up to no good. Armed with soapy, lemon water, a fireproof spell, and a few friends, she prepares to outwit the wizards and have all sorts of amazing adventures.Dealing with Dragons is a laugh-out-loud funny book that you won't be able to close for 5 minutes."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I picked up this book because I was interested in dragons and had cleaned out most of the library. I found inside much more than I bargained for. Princess Cimorene from Linderwall is the seventh daughter in a royal family, and the least proper. She takes lessons she isn't supposed to, hates dancing, learning when and how loud to scream, and all that stuff. She wants to do things, other than sit around and look pretty. The adventure begins when Cimorene is supposed to marry Prince Therandil, a brainless knight. She gets advice from a talking frog, and is so annoyed with Therindil and being a Princess that she follows these strange orders.Cimorene then volenteers for dragons, and is accepted into work by Kazul. There she meets witches, evil wizards, princesses, a jinn, and, of course, Dragons.When the wizards try to sabatoge the dragons trials to pick a king, Cimorene and her friends Princess Alianora, the witch Morwen, and the stone prince, who lacks a real name, do something about it in this humorous and well written book. My only complaint is that the word 'rather' is said often.My favorite part of this book was the dragons. Most of the books have dragons as the villains, and wizards as the friends to the heroes. I never understood this consept, because nothing is entirely good or bad. So this book was a breath of fresh air from the belief that Dragons = Bad.I would recommend this book to anyone, even if I wouldn't think their personality fits this type of book. I liked more adventurous stories, and I still loved this book."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"If you are waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out then you should read this book!

Cimorene becomes princess to the dragon Kazul and life is alot more interesting.As soon as you meet Cimorene you'll want to visit her everyday.

There are a few twists to the tale, and it's definitely the best of the four books. I have fond memories of reading it when I was much younger and recently went back through it and enjoyed it as being very light reading fare as a break from some of the heavier stuff.

Still, as a standalone novel, it's a satisfying read with an ending that is not TO BE CONTINUED so that you aren't blackmailed into buying another book."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I found this book entertaining.

Within her time there she deals with annoying knights, troublesome wizards, and a stone prince. My only complaint is that it was more for younger kids then older.

It is the best of the four Chronicals. It is about a princess who doesn't want to be the &quot;typical&quot; princess. But her parents do. So she talks to a talking frog and finds her way to a cave full of dragons. At first she is scared, but after a while she befriends the dragons. She becomes the princess, or servant, of one of the dragons, Kazul. Together the princess and Kazul fight wizards, get help from a witch, concoct many spells, find a genie, as well as many other exciting adventures to numourous to be put into words.

My favorite thing about this book were the dragons, because they could talk and they were one of the most funniest things in the book. The princess Cimerene was strange because she had jet black hair and wore it down instead of in braids and stuff. She was taller than most princesses and she hated learning what princesses were supposed to learn. She learned fencing , magic, Latin and cooking instead. If you like funny things read this book."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"That was truly the best book ever!!!

My friends have not read this series. I don't know why. I LLOOOOvvedd it! Its about a girl who hates acting proper. Her parents were going to make her marry a klutz prince named Therindil. She wants to learn more interesting stuff, instead of embroidery, dancing, and what note to scream on when being captured by a dragon. She tried to bribe her protocal teacher into teaching her about politics. Her parents found out and stoped the lessons. Then she made one of the knights teach her fencing, her parents eventulay found out about that too. Everybody tried to get her to be more proper. Even her fairy godmother. So one day she just cried out &quot;I wish dragon would eat me!&quot; And a frog asked her what was the matter and gave her directions to a place where somebody can help her. It turned out the place was full of dragons. She also found out dragons take in stray princesses to do they're chores. One female dragon named Kazul took Cimorene in because Cimorene can cook Cheriees Jubille.I could just go on and on but I won't I'll just say what my favroite part was. Okay its when Zemenear the head wizard of the wizards society (The bad guy). Visits Cimorene, and brings along his son Antorell. To give them both a wrong impression about her, she pretends to be like one of those silly ordinary princesses. It's so funny!

The many sly allusions to traditional fairy tales and the subsequent 'adjustments' are very humorous. Cimorene and Kazul are deliciously unusual characters and the wizards are appropriately (but incompetently) nasty.The first in a consistently good series, Dealing With Dragons will have you laughing out loud. It has something to offer for everyone, not just hard core fantasy addicts. Light and frothy, this series is perfect for summer reading. If you like the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, also try Vivian Vande Velde's A Hidden Magic for some similar fun."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Patricia C.

Wrede. The main characters are Cimorine, Kazul , Morwen and a wizard and his son. Cimorine is a princess who's father is the ruler of a very wealthy and peaceful kingdom. She has three sisters that are perfect and have already been married off. They are all blonde with blue eyes, quiet pretty and perfect princess. She on the contrary has raven-black hair, towers over even her father, and takes fencing, archery, cooking and magic lessons. It's not that she wants to be contrary, she just is.

Distressed, Cimorene runs off to live with the dragon Kazul, being very careful to be polite, for she knows it might be dangerous to be rude to a fire-breathing dragon. However, Kazul and Cimorene become fast friends, and together, search for a way to rid of a band of evil wizards, who are plotting to destroy the dragon civilization by helping an evil dragon become king.

She deifes the usual constraints of the medeival genre blatantly and laughingly. Her book catches the reader off guard several times and makes him laugh and appreciate her wit.

The other books follow in this order- Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, and Talking to Dragons. Half the fun of these books are noticing the mixed-up fairy-tales! The story: Princess Cimorene of Linderwall is not your odinary princess. She doesn't like being a princess and when her parents want her to marry a boring, rather uncharateristic prince, she decides to run away. Accepting some advice for a frog, she offers to be a dragon's princess, and the dragon Kazul takes her in. She finds herself happily setting in to a life of cooking cherries jubilee, visiting witches and meeting jiins.

This is like a 10 star or something! So i must give the book what it deserves. The plots are very good. they make you sit up if you're on your bed. sit at the edge of your chair jump up and down if you're standing. The names are very original and very creative. Cimorene, Mendanbar, Kazul. These are not names you would usually find in books. Thses are very modified (well not very) tales and are rib tickling. they are also very suspensive. You have to read these books. They are as good as Harry Potter! They go a long the same lines yet at the same time are completely different. They have many of the same characters, yes i'll give you that, but they are in no way similar. Who can call Antorrel and Zemanar good? WHere as Harry is the hero. Who can say that dragons are good in HP? In DWD They are good. If you are a die hard fan i strongly recommend that you read these!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene was a bit out of line compared to her other sisters.

All three of which her parents banned.Then her parents forced her to wed Prince Therandil.(Cimorene said, she would rather be eaten whole by a dragon) So Cimorene ran away. Guess what she found? Dragons! Cimorene became Kazul's (the lady dragon) princess and found her new life much more fitting.

Things get complicated when Wrede adds a few wizards to the brew, as well as a sinister plot or three and some soapy washwater with lemon juice. I highly recommend it!

How she becomes the dragon Kazul's princess, deals withunwanted rescuers and meddlesome wizards is presented by Wrede with a wicked senseof satire towards all the traditional fairy tale conventions.Unlike many series, all three following books of the series live up to the high standards setby the first.

The second in the series is also recommended, but I found the later books diminishing returns--enjoyable for their own sake, but not as much a delight as this first.Note: 3 stars, for me, is a pretty good review, 4 is for extremely distinguished works, and 5 only for those I consider classics. Most of what is published is, unfortunately, a 2 or less."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"What? Only five stars?!? I need more to do this series justice! Patricia C. Wrede writes marvelous fantasy. It's like &quot;Mixed-Up Fairy Tales&quot; or something, but funnier, more engaging, and ripe for repeat reading (I just graduated from high school, and I just finished reading the entire series for the third time in a matter of days). These are timeless tales. Even her NAMES are inventive. Cimorene, Mendanbar, Kazul, Morwen, Telemain, Daystar, Shiara...and let us not forget Zemenar and Antorell. The chapter headings induce chuckles immediately, simply by their existence. She writes in a style that incorporates intelligent fantasy with enjoyable humor. The characters are some you would like to know personally. And nowhere else have I seen as unique a discussion of magic in its many forms as in these four books. I did notice a trend of centralization. Dealing was Cimorene's book. Searching was Mendanbar's. Calling was Morwen's. Talking was Daystar's. I wish the series was not concluded, because I'd love to see Telemain's book. And perhaps Kazul's book could be somewhat of a prequel. Oh, and what about a book from Antorell's perspective? That would make for an incredibly funny story. The Enchanted Forest and its surrounding is a world I want to know about. Not many authors can create an entire world that entices the reader so greatly. But Mrs. Wrede has. Unlike the Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide series, which got progressively worse, each book in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles compares to the original, as fresh and brilliant as ever. Needless to say, this series is one of the best ever. I have not really sampled a lot of the adult fantasy by Piers Anthony and Anne McCaffrey and such, but I doubt they can compare with the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. This is not mindboggling fantasy like the Lord of the Rings trilogy: this is fun. Oh, and remember: &lt;points finger&gt;...&quot;Argelfraster.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is a good female role model and this story is an interesting twist on the story we all know, about a princess being captured by an evil dragon and being rescued by a prince. Instead, Cimorene runs away to live with the dragon and has trouble chasing away all the annoying rescuers! I read it a pretty long time ago, but I remember it was better than I expected. I like fantasy a lot, but I really hate when it gets into mythical creatures--centaurs, unicorns, dragons &amp;c. My fantasy choices are more along the lines of The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman. Even so, this book was really funny and even exciting in parts and anyone who wants a nice light-hearted fantasy with strong female characters should give it a try. You'll probably laugh out loud in some parts. I don't know if you'll want to read all of the books though. I haven't but I might give it a try. --Grace, age 14"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I was in the library because I had some spare time between classes, and I didn't see any good books.

She then handed it to me and said, &quot;You have to read this. It is the best book in the world.&quot; I went home, read it, and finished it the next day. I couldn't put it down. When she asked me that day if I had read the book and if I liked it, I replied with an enthusiastic yes. If you read this, you will love it. It is very well written, has a great plot and a great story. It, like most great books, never gets boring. I would reccommend this to anyone, even adults."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"My son loves listening to books in the car that are aimed at kids slightly older than him. He adored Percy Jackson's adventures, and we've tried quite a few other books. This is the first one that has captured his interest in the same way, without it being scary in any way. He doesn't like any book where there are bullies, or of course too much violence. So I am very happy with this series. I am also happy with how the story encourages young people to follow their own minds, and use common sense."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"It's been almost twenty years since those afternoons when I sat on the floor with my classmates and listened, enraptured, while the teacher read us \\"Dealing with Dragons.\\" I'm not usually a big fantasy fan, but this book gripped me from the start. I enjoyed every word, and after we finished reading it, I bought my own copy. Over the course of the next few years, I read it several times. This week, for the first time in fifteen years or so, I read it again.It was every bit as good as I remembered - possibly even better. It's rare to read a novel that comes this close to doing everything right. Wrede skews fairy-tale conventions with irreverent wit and obvious affection. She uses a fairly standard fantasy setting, and yet makes it her own, bringing it alive with everything from exotic yet believable character names to colorful social customs. The heroine, Cimorene, is absolutely delightful: a smart, witty, kind-hearted, thoroughly unconventional princess who finds herself bored with the usual princess pursuits and stifled by her parents' insistence that none of the things she actually finds interesting are sufficiently \\"proper.\\" When she learns of their plans to marry her off to a dull and unpleasant prince, she runs away and ends up offering herself in service to a dragon. Her new life is exciting indeed, but when she stumbles across an evil wizard's sinister plot, she finds herself faced with more excitement than she bargained for!The novel is tightly and cleverly plotted, but the way events play out never feels at all forced or contrived. This is a fairy-tale world, after all, and meaningful coincidences, familiar devices, and flawlessly happy endings are exactly what we expect. Wrede fulfills these expectations, but in her own way. She neither blindly embraces the conventions nor rejects them outright, but embraces them and makes them her own. Readers who enjoy fairy tales and have read many of them will especially enjoy this novel's freshness and cleverness.I'm tempted to say that the only problem I have with this novel is that it was over much too soon - but I can't even say that, because there are three more books in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. I'd recommend buying the box set. Once you read \\"Dealing with Dragons,\\" you won't want to stop until you've read them all."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Dealing with Dragons by: Patricia C. WredeDealing with Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede is the most Amazing book ever. Do you like things like dragons, princesses and wizards? If yes, then this is the book you have dreamed for.Cimorene, princess of the Kingdom of Linderawall is not a normal princess. She fences, learns Latin, and makes cherry jubilee. Her life gets more terrible when she is asked to marry Prince Therandil from a nearby kingdom. There she meets an enchanted frog which gives her advice to live with dragons. Now this book mainly takes place in the enchanted forest and the mountains in which the dragons live.As Cimorene gets used to her new life, she has many problems. She first has to get rid of the knights that come to rescue her. She keeps on telling them that she doesn't want to be rescued. She also wants to make a fire proof spell in case Kazul, the dragon that's her owner, accidently breaths fire on her. Just as things are starting to look up, the evil wizards start attacking the dragons by doing nasty tricks on them. How will Cimorene, along with her friend Allianora and the stone prince save the dragons and the Collin's stone from the powerful wizards.This book is filled with adventure and quick thinking. It shows that you can still beat powerful enemies with quick thinking. I love this book and I hope you do to!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I began my journey to Linderwal. I happily joined Cimorene on her adventures as the dragon Kazul's princess. I couldn't stop biting my nails because of all the excitement in the book Dealing With Dragons. It is an incredible book. It has everything a book needs, excitement,adventure, and some romance. The main character is very brave, smart, and believable. Cinorene isn't the normal princess; she is sick and tired of being proper and doesn't take anyones opinion. With such a strong mind, Cimorene runs away and becomes the dragon Kazul's princess. She turns down all the princes that try to save her. Like she needs saving. One of those dragons could take a prince down in one punch. If anyone needs saving it's the princes who try to save her. I definitly think you should read this book. And the last thing I have to say is \\"enjoy\\"!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This book was probably one of my all-time favorite books growing up (yes, even after I became a Harry Potter fan). The book has humor, interesting and diverse characters, and an intricate yet fast-paced plot. Like what you'd see from JK Rowling, Wrede put an enormous amount of effort in fabricating this 'world' for her characters; the details are delightful and are never too much.You can envision this book as a dignified novel version of some of these Disney/Pixar fantasy 3D animation films (i.e. Shrek). In fact, I would love to see this book adapted into a feature film!Most importantly, this book really renewed my interest in reading when I was around 11-12 years old (I am now in my 20s and hindsight is of course 20/20). I devoured the Enchanted Forest Chronicles and other books in this genre after reading Dealing with Dragons. I strongly suggest this for any kid bored by the over-detailed unimaginative stuff out there."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"The first in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Dealing With Dragons follows princess Cimorene as she says \\"Screw this!\\" to her boring life as an obedient princess and decides to run away to a dragon instead of marrying a dull prince. She happens upon a den of dragons and is \\"adopted\\" by a protective female dragon. Cimorene finds that life is considerably more interesting living with dragons, spending her time chatting with the other dragons' captive princesses, fending off the droves of princes attempting to \\"rescue\\" her, learning about magic, and uncovering a dastardly plot by a corrupt group of wizards.The book is filled with sweet lessons and numerous instances of sly humor (taking good-natured jabs at fairy tales and people in general). While I am an adult and enjoyed the book, it is probably best suited to the pre-teen age group for which is was written. A part of a series, but for those reluctant to get involved with a multi-volume fantasy story, this book stands well on its own. Recommended for all ages, but especially pre-teen girls."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is a spunky and smart princess who uses her head and doesn't let others do her thinking for her simply because \\"she's a princess\\". She goes through all sorts of trials, but she gets through them. Sometimes on the (good) advice of others, sometimes by luck, but most often it is through either preparation or sound reasoning. Cimorene builds a good circle of friends around her and does her best to help out her friends and those she cares about, and even those who want to eat her. She isn't a patty-perfect shero who fears no monster, conquers everything at the first attempt, and saves the day without mussing a single perfect golden lock. Nor is she the patty-perfect princess, as the pattern is set by her country. That's what's so appealing about this book: the princess Cimorene. And the humour and adventure, of course. I would recommend it to just about anyone. It's an awesome book that I would recommend for anyone. It is focused more towards girls, but it's got a little of something for just about everyone. Humour, princesses and knights, witches, magic, adventure, and dragons! I mean, what more do you want? There's nothing offensive in this book, and it's a great book for a family, too.

I just read and loved the book Dealing with Dragons. Patricia Wrede is one of my favorite authors and has written a number of books. In a world of magicians, dragons, and witches some of the funniest characters take place. In a small village next to the mountians of morning and the Enchanted Forest, a princess was born. Now, you might think that she was a regular princess, with curly golden hair and a clear complection, but princess Cimminerene had stright black hair and freckles! As she grew older she wanted desperately to leave her old boring life and become a dragon's princess. A rare honor to her, but a disgrace to any other princess (you see dragons got their princess by kidnapping them). So one day she gathered up her long dress skirts and hiked up the mountians of morning to where the dragons lived. There she met Kuzal, a polite and well - mannered female dragon talking with her friends. After the discussion of being her Princess Cimminerene finally pusraded Kuzal to agree to let her be Kuzal's Princess. From then on Kuzal and Cimminerene had many wonderful and daring adventures together. They melted dozens of wizards, cast spells, and even talked with a few cats.

She meets up with dragons, one of which is in need of some more handkerchiefs, and finds herself a (female) dragon's princess (Which Cimorine states clearly: \\"She's not my dragon; I'm her princess!\\").Please, please read this book, and you'll never be sorry! It's the greatest book.I have also read the sequels, and they're just as good. Trust me, you'll LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Cimorene is the seventh daughter in the royal family of Linderwall. Everything she has to learn as a princess is terribly boring, and everything she wants to do is considered \\"improper.\\" When she learns she is soon to be married off to a dim-witted (though admittedly handsome) prince, she takes the advice of a frog and runs off to a small hut in the woods. What she finds in the hut is astounding: Dragons. After getting over her initial shock, Princess Cimorene volunteers herself as a dragons' princess. One of the dragons takes her up on her offer and Cimorene's adventures begin.This rollicking tale of a spunky princess is one of the best fantasies ever written. It's extremely humorous and Cimerone's exasperation at a \\"proper\\" life is hilarious. When a prince comes to try and rescue her, she sends him back home with his tail between his legs. This fearless and endearing princess brings the book to life and her no-nonsense attitude keeps the pages turning. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite fantasy books, and has been for the past couple of years."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Princess Cimorene, the youngest of eight, is firmly convinced that she is the only being in Linderwall with a brain in her head. She is, well, different: tall, black-haired, and, to her royal parents' great dipleasure, as stubborn as a mule. She'd rather study sorcery and economics and cooking instead of etiquette or embroidery. Upon finding herself betrothed to the Prince of a neighboring (emphasis on boring) kingdom, she takes a frog's good advice, finds a decrepit hut in the wilderness, and enters just in time for an argument between three voices who may or may not decide to eat her. Thus begins the first story about Cimorene's adventures among the dragonkind.Consistency is a problem for humorous fantasy on the novel scale, and this light-hearted pastiche runs into its share of slow spells. What elevates \\"Dealing with Dragons\\" above the morass of lackluster fantasy is Wrede's energy: she writes with brevity and zest. Still, the book disappoints when it goes from the sparkling fancy of:\\"Speaking of dragons, where's yours?\\" \\"She's gone to the Enchanted Forest to borrow a crepe pan from a witch she knows.\\"to a non-story about sneaky wizards and whatnot. Besides primitive villains who are not even funny, the novel suffers from moments of extreme contrivance: small, irrelevant details are always obvious as set-ups for upcoming plot twists (hmm, why did Cimorene pick up a pebble in the Caves of Fire and Darkness?). Wrede very successfully pokes fun at the fairy-tale tradition, only to get trapped in the less appealing cliches of modern fantasy when it comes time to build a plot of her own.Still, more than a few episodes are both clever and funny (like the knights' continual efforts to save Cimorene from \\"captivity\\"). The young princess is a cohesive, effective heroine, while her friendship with the dragon Kazul develops along realistic paths. Two and a half nights of harmless fun. The sequel is already in my reading pile."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"This was definitely one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. &quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot; is about a princess named Cimorene. (The book is written in a third-person view.) She is not as pretty as her sisters, but she's not as dumb either. Cimorene is very bored with life as a &quot;proper&quot; princess-she doesn't want to learn how to scream as she gets carried off by some creature or another. She wants to lead a more exciting life. The last straw comes when her parents try to make her marry a prince who she doesn't even love. She gets her way when she comes upon a group of dragons, among them being the polite female dragon named Kazul. She becomes the dragon's princess, and soon becomes caught in the conspiracy of some unfriendly wizards. This book is a fantasy story, but it also has humor in it, so it's good to read if you're looking for a light book. The characters are very pleasant, and humerous, and I was absorbed into the story. I reccommend this book for people who like fantasy, but who don't want anything too heavy. This book changes a lot from beginning to end, in terms of meeting characters, getting to know characters, and solving problems. There are three other books, all sequels, that are in this series: &quot;Searching for Dragons,&quot; &quot;Calling on Dragons,&quot; and &quot;Talking to Dragons.&quot; If you like fantasy and some comedy, you'll like this book!"},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I love this book because it centers around a strong real woman that many can relate to. I LOVE the way that Patricia C. Wrede takes the ideas and storylines from other fairytales and uses them in the plot of her book as the accepted way things are done, like how the Stone Prince had to use the tin dipper rather than the gold and jewel incrusted one.The way Cimorene revolts against all things proper and sets new rules for her life and the people around her makes this book wonderful to read many times over."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"Reading Dealing With Dragons was an enjoyable way to spend an hour of my time. It was not great, but it was not bad either. I appreciated that Cimorene was unlike most princesses, yet not unlikable. She was not spoiled, or disagreeable, just a normal girl that wanted to have some fun. I also appreciate that the story is more complex than simply how a girl spends time with a dragon. The wizards vs. dragons plot was entertaining, and all of the characters here are delightful. Since this is a children's book it is not overly complex, and it is not bogged down with unimportant details. A perfect balance of humor, adventure, and mystery. Short, sweet, and to the point, Dealing with Dragons would be a great book to read to children, or a nice book to sit down with and escape for a little while."},{"Title":"Dealing with dragons (The Enchanted Forest chronicles)","review":"I thought this book was FABULOUS!

When her parents finally give up on changing her ways of thinking, they decide to marry her off to the prince of a neighboring realm. Cimorene has other ideas and volunteers to serve as a dragon's princess. The dragon, of course, accepts her offer and Cimorene goes to work for the dragon. When several princes, including her betrothed, come calling to rescue her, she explains to them that she does not want to be rescued from the dragon. Later, she discovers a sinister plot between the Wizard Society and a turncoat dragon and works to prevent the dragons from granting kingship to the traitor.

The Princess Cimorene seems to have a bad case of brain cloud, running away from repressive parents only to enter drudge service to a dragon -- but it's a she-dragon, so that's all right then.The main character is snotty, mumbles passive-aggressively, and demonstrates that acting stupid and vain is the only way to deal with unscrupulous wizards. Not what I would call fine role-modeling for girls of any age.Male characters (human and otherwise) are without exception either clueless morons or cruel and devious, up to no good. The narrative is overly-descriptive, full of needless, distracting detail. Action is often sluggish to nonexistent -- pages of boring conversation. Attempts at humor by alluding to classic fairy tales fall flat. Identification or empathy with characters at zero.Suffers from a common writer's pitfall: It Fails To Entertain. During evening storytime, we skimmed and abridged the last half of the book, just to make an end ASAP.Other reviewers and commentators have claimed that since males get better treatment in the author's related books, I should cut some slack on Dragons. Really, you couldn't pay me enough for the time lost in tediously plowing through those works.

Why is it lesbian fiction should contain contempt for males? Are all lesbians male hating radicals. Well, none of the ones I know personally are, but to much lesbian fiction, erotic or otherwise, seems to portray this. That belongs in a political or philosophical treatise, not in something that is supposed to contain erotic fiction.

The dialogues are very realistic, useful bits of daily encounters. The recordings are very well done, at speeds that seem realistic yet are undoubtedly controlled to make it feasible for a second or third year learner to grasp them with a few (ok, maybe more than a few) repetitions.

They are right. Wittgenstein really had an intention to \\"prove philosophy to be a worthless activity\\". He possessed a method of his own: 1)looking at a traditional philosophical problem 2)analyzing it 3)finding inconsistencies in the logic of the problem or conceptual confusion involved in formulation of this problem. Whether or not he was right in thinking that this method is capable of solving ALL philosophical problems, there are some interesting arguments in this book.I would like to list some of them to give an impression of what this book is like.Famous PRIVATE LANGUAGE, for example, is directed against a version of scepticism called SOLIPSISM. (solipsism is the view that any assertion of the existence of external world and /or minds of other people is meaningless because we can perceive only contents of our own mind). Rather then trying to find an argument justifying the inference of the existence of other human minds from the observable human behavior, Wittgenstein challenges the common-sense conception we have of our consciousness (the one we share with Descartes). His perspective is interesting, especially the idea that our familiarity with our sensations is dependent upon our understanding of language.Another argument, which I call VISUAL ROOM ARGUMENT, concerns itself with the supposedly private nature of perception (looking, imagining). Problem which Wittgenstein discusses is so subtle that readers who didnt previously \\"discovered\\" this problem independently will not understand what the hell is he talking about. Those, however, who already felt troubled by it will be puzzled by sheer power of Wittgenstein intellect, when they grasp the connection between the this problem and the cluster of other problems concerning personal identity.Apart from \\"dissolving\\" traditional philosophical problems, Wittgenstein also provides some simple but precise observations that drive us to the boundary of the territory where reason could be applied. He discusses the process of reading by urging us to engage in series of practical experiments, such as reading the numbers on wrist watch, while observing our mind processes in a way he suggests, or reading a line of nonsense while silently \\"saying to ourselves\\" meaningful sentence and then comparing the experience to our ordinary experiences of reading. Wittgenstein never forces us to adopt any particular doctrine (apart from his philosophy of language, which became rather notorious in academic circles), but anybody who will perform these experiments honestly will certanly look on his own mind from different perspective.--------------------------Those who dont have any philosophical education need not worry. Wittgenstein despised philosophical jargon. He didnt use word \\"solipsism\\" in the private language argument. You wount find any logical formulas in PI. (this is not Quine). There is no references to other philosophers (apart from one or two mentions of Frege and James). HOwever Wittgenstein is not easy. Logical rigor of analytical philosophy can be overwhelming to those used to reading of Nietzsche and Kirkegaard."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"One aspect of this book that makes it important for simply that contribution is the notion of \\"language games.\\" If language produces reality, different languages produce different realities. In this book, German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein developed the related notion of \\"language games,\\" islands of language, unique each to itself, not wholly translatable one into another. Each of us inhabits a particular language game, he claims, which channels how we see things and understand the world and our places within it. Again, language shapes meaning and understanding and interpretation. The world is disclosed to us through our specific language game. If we live in different language games, we see different worlds. This concept entails, as philosopher Chantal Mouffe says, \\". . . a critique of the rationalist conception of the subject [i.e., the knowing, reasoning human mind] that indicates that the latter cannot be the source of linguistic meanings since it is through participation in different language games that the world is disclosed to us.\\"This is a serious attack on the Modern conception of the human as a reasoning being who can affect change in desired directions through the exercise of that reason. Thus, reason does NOT allow us to see the world as it is and to change it as we wish in a manner leading to progress. The concept of language games is key for many postmodern thinkers.If we think through language and the use of language is thought itself, what is perceived is indistinct from language use. The two cannot be separated, since language governs interpretation and perception and thought. To revisit the phrase from Wittgenstein, different people play and live in different \\"language games,\\" that is, their languages lead them to see the world differently, to conceptualize things differently from those in different language games. So what for the person interested in politics?In the final analysis, this means that whenever we try to understand the world, it is through language, through interpretation, since we cannot directly perceive reality outside of our language. This begins to suggest the likelihood that one's own culture or society or polity does not have universally \\"true\\" answers to key questions of human existence; our culture develops answers within its language game that make sense at that particular time for that culture. All is interpretation of uncertain texts within different language games.Certainly, this is a strong argument. Many disagree that language per se shapes our views of reality.

The original German is given side by side with the English translation by G.E.M. Anscombe. Philosophical Investigations, like the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus of 1918, is unconventionally organized. There are no chapters and no subheadings. Each numbered paragraph tells its own story. Large blocks of paragraphs deal with a single topic. For instance, the first thirty-eight paragraphs of Part I deal with the question of meaning. A given theme is treated at some length, dropped and is picked up again later on and in connection with another problem. This, plus Wittegnstein's unorthodox views may make the book difficult reading.Wittgenstein's chief philosophical principle is that there are no philosophical problems. There are only philosophical muddles engendered by inattention to the proper uses of linguistic expressions. All of his main discussions in the book are general questions about language; not that language is the subject matter of philosophy but rather that an important, but not the only, function of philosophy is to clear away philosophical puzzles by tracing them to their source in linguistic muddles. Beyond the therapy lies the possibility of proposing different ways of talking, each of which, insofar as it is free of linguistic puzzles, may be a profitable way of looking at things analogous to \\"a new way of painting...\\" (p. 128, paragraph 401).Wittgenstein's therapeutic method is best understood by seeing it in use. However, an inadequate idea of it may be conveyed by means of a general characterization. In the space allotted, I can do no more. To understand a linguistic expression in a given context describe the way(s) in which that expression functions in that context. Context is, in the last analysis, social context because languages that communicate, i.e., languages that are languages, cannot be private. This is not an empirical hypothesis but a statement of logical necessity. In the philosophy of psychology, this thesis is usually called logical behaviorism. Another way of putting Wittgenstein's general therapeutic prescription is this. To learn the \\"proper\\" meaning of a linguistic expression, investigate the ways in which we would learn or teach the use of the expression in specific contexts. We must pay particular attention to the ways in which the learner could get the wrong ideas about how to use the expression. We must also remember that the same utterance may function in many different kinds of contexts. Wittgenstein takes great pains to show the rich variety of usages. Clarifying meanings can be done only within an already existing language. This principle relates not to the ways in which language comes into existence but rather to the ways in which it functions as a means of communication.The question of meaning in a way underlies every other question in the book. Here is a partial list of the many philosophical problems discussed: meaning, use and understanding; logical behaviorism and its consequences for the conception of philosophical analysis; thoughts, things and words; states of mind and conduct (as against involuntary action); sameness and difference of meaning, induction, deduction, memory. One would have to write such an extensive article even to begin exploring the method and cogency of Wittgenstein's philosophizing on these questions.When one mentions philosophical analysis nowadays, Russell, Moore and Wittgenstein come to mind as the three fountainheads of three important 20th-Century styles of philosophical analysis. Wittgenstein's influence on Oxford philosophers and through them, and also directly, his influence on some 20th-Century American philosophers is enormous. These philosophers have used, though by no means slavishly, the Wittgenstein way of doing philosophy and their work is very suggestive. One need not agree with one's philosophical colleagues in order to admire the quality of their work. Suggestive philosophical processes and products, even if alien to our own ways of doing philosophy are, unless prima facie absurd, oftentimes more stimulating than agreement. For this reason, if for no other, Wittgenstein and the Wittgensteineans deserve serious attention."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"The Investigations cannot be approached as &quot;another work of western philosophy&quot;, the way we might approach Aristotle's Metaphysics for example. There all that is required of us is a careful reading of the text and a subsequent piecing together of arguments. It is akin to purchasing a piece of furniture disassembled, a desk for instance, and slowly by way of instructions piecing together the parts until we have a recognizable product. Such exercises don't demand originality. In fact, originality directly conflicts with our purpose. If I were to become inventive in my piecing together of the desk what I end up with will most likely not look like what the parts were meant to resemble. The same goes with Aristotle.Yet, Wittgensetin demands such inventiveness. Lest we forget, these are investigations. We are gathering evidence and weighing alternatives e.g. this picture of language is at home here but what about here? Such questions do not presuppose firm conclusions only fruitful lines of enquiry. Here we are not interested in piecing together structures but seeing what lies around the structures already built.

After that, just read this text carefully and don't rush. W is very clear, though he has somewhat of a rambling style, and it is not that difficult to understand what he thinks the purpose of philosophy should be: dissolving philosophical problems by whatever method is suitable - mostly by seeing how ordinary language is misused to create confusion. This is not to say that there aren't real philosophical problems, but that many call more for clarification rather than a solution.You may not agree with W's approach to philosophy, but if you are interested in modern philosophy it's hard to dismiss his plea to examine the way you are asking questions.

Broad (who did not understand nor like him). \\"Not offering the chair of philosophy to Wittgenstein would be like not offering the chair of physics to Einstein!\\" I think of him as the Einstein of intuitive psychology. Though born ten years later, he was likewise hatching ideas about the nature of reality at nearly the same time and in the same part of the world and like Einstein nearly died in WW1. Now suppose Einstein was a suicidal homosexual recluse with a difficult personality who published only one early version of his ideas that were confused and often mistaken, but became world famous; completely changed his ideas but for the next 30 years published nothing more, and knowledge of his new work, in mostly garbled form, diffused slowly from occasional lectures and students notes; that he died in 1951 leaving behind over 20,000 pages of mostly handwritten scribblings in German, composed of sentences or short paragraphs with, often, no clear relationship to sentences before or after; that these were cut and pasted from other notebooks written years earlier with notes in the margins, underlinings and crossed out words, so that many sentences have multiple variants; that his literary executives cut this indigestible mass into pieces, leaving out what they wished and struggling with the monstrous task of capturing the correct meaning of sentences which were conveying utterly novel views of how the universe works and that they then published this material with agonizing slowness (not finished after half a century) with prefaces that contained no real explanation of what it was about; that he became as much notorious as famous due to many statements that all previous physics was a mistake and even nonsense, and that virtually nobody understood his work, in spite of hundreds of books and tens of thousands of papers discussing it; that many physicists knew only his early work in which he had made a definitive summation of Newtonian physics stated in such extremely abstract and condensed form that it was impossible to decide what was being said; that he was then virtually forgotten and that most books and articles on the nature of the world and the diverse topics of modern physics had only passing and usually erroneous references to him, and that many omitted him entirely; that to this day, over half a century after his death, there were only a handful of people who really grasped the monumental consequences of what he had done. This, I claim, is precisely the situation with Wittgenstein.Had W lived into his 80's he would have been able to directly influence Searle, Symons, and countless other students of behavior. If his brilliant friend Frank Ramsey had not died in his youth, a highly fruitful collaboration would almost certainly have ensued. If his student and colleague Alan Turing had become his lover, one of the most amazing collaborations of all time would likely have evolved. In any one case the intellectual landscape of the 20th century would have been different and if all 3 had occurred it would almost certainly have been very very different. Instead he lived in relative intellectual isolation, few knew him well or had an inkling of his ideas while he lived, and only a handful within philosophy have any real grasp of his work today. He could have shined as an engineer(he has an aviation patent), a mathematician (he sketched out a proof of Euler's theorem, since shown to be valid and grasped the psychological foundations of math , incompleteness, infinity etc., as no one else (afaik) has to this day), a physiologist (he did wartime research in it), a musician (he played instruments and had a renowned talent for whistling), an architect (the house he designed and constructed for his sister still stands), or an entrepreneur (he inherited one of the largest fortunes in the world but gave it all away). It is a miracle he survived the trenches and prison camps (while writing the Tractatus) in WW1, many years of suicidal depressions (3 brothers succumbed to them), being trapped in Austria and executed by the Nazis (he was partly Jewish), and that he was not persecuted for his homosexuality and driven to suicide like his friend Turing. He realized nobody understood what he was doing and might never (not surprising as he was half a century ahead of psychology and philosophy, which only recently have started accepting that our brain is an evolved organ like our heart.)PI was not published until 1953, 2 years after his death and can be viewed as two quite different books. Part one is from his middle or W2 period and Part two is from his final or W3 period (which overlaps extensively with his books LWPP1 and 2), when his ideas crystallized into a unique and amazingly deep and prescient description of behavior. Although W wrote thousands of pages and is the most discussed philosopher in modern times, only a few have any real grasp of what he did and how it anticipates in detail many of the latest advances in psychology and philosophy (descriptive psychology). It is essential to first read some of the commentaries on his work by others. One of the best is that of Daniele Moyal-Sharrock (DMS) whose 2004 volume \\"Understanding Wittgenstein's On Certainty\\" is mandatory for every educated person, and perhaps the best starting point for understanding Wittgenstein, psychology, philosophy and life, since it explains the unconscious, axiomatic structure of animal behavior. Next I would suggest the writings of Daniel Hutto, especially his \\"Wittgenstein and the End of Philosophy\\"(2004). However (in my view) like all analyses, they fall far short of grasping his unique and revolutionary advances in describing behavior by failing to put them in a broad evolutionary and contemporary scientific context, which I will attempt in skeletal outline here. Finally, all of Searle should be read, with special attention to \\"Rationality in Action\\" and his more recent works. Though Searle does not say and seems to be unaware, his work follows directly from that of W.To say that Searle has carried on W's work is not to imply that it is a direct result of W study, but rather that because there is only ONE human psychology (for the same reason there is only ONE human cardiology), that anyone accurately describing behavior must be voicing some variant or extension of what W said. I find most of Searle foreshadowed in W, including versions of the famous Chinese room argument against Strong AI. Incidentally if the Chinese Room interests you then you should read Victor Rodych's xlnt ,but virtually unknown, supplement on the CR--\\"Searle Freed of Every Flaw\\". Rodych has also written a series of superb papers on W's philosophy of mathematics --i.e., the EP (Evolutionary Psychology) of the axiomatic System 1 Primary Language Games (PLG's) of counting as extended into the endless SLG's (Secondary Language Games) of math. I will also note that nobody who promotes Strong AI and CTM (Computational Theory of Mind) seems to be aware that W's Tractatus is the most striking and powerful statement of their viewpoint ever penned (behavior is the logical processing of facts). Of course decades later (but before the digital computer was a gleam in Turing's eye) he described in great detail why CTM was a bankrupt point of view that must be replaced by psychology (or you can say this is all he did for the rest of his life).Wittgenstein (W) is for me easily the most brilliant thinker on human behavior of all time and this is his most famous work. His work as a whole shows that all behavior is an extension of innate true-only axioms (see \\"On Certainty\\" for his final extended treatment of this idea) and that our conscious ratiocination emerges from unconscious machinations. His corpus can be seen as the foundation for all description of animal behavior, revealing how the mind works and indeed must work. The \\"must\\" is entailed by the fact that all brains share a common ancestry and common genes and so there is only one basic way they work, that this necessarily has an axiomatic structure, that all higher animals share the same evolved psychology based on inclusive fitness, and that in humans this is extended into a personality based on throat muscle contractions (language) that evolved to manipulate others (with variations that can be regarded as trivial). This book, and arguably all of W's work and all useful discussion of behavior is a development of or variation on these ideas. Another major theme here, and of course in all discussion of human behavior, is the need to separate the automatisms which underlie all behavior from the effects of culture. Though few philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists etc explicitly discuss this, it can be seen as the major problem they are dealing with. I suggest it will prove of the greatest value to consider W's work and most of his examples as an effort to tease apart not only fast and slow thinking(e.g., perceptions vs dispositions--see below), but nature and nurture.In the course of many years reading extensively in W, other philosophers, and psychology, it has become clear that what he laid out in his final period (and throughout his earlier work in a less clear way) are the foundations of what is now known as evolutionary psychology (EP), or if you prefer, psychology, cognitive linguistics, intentionality, higher order thought or just animal behavior. Sadly, almost nobody seems to realize that his works are a vast and unique textbook of descriptive psychology that is as relevant now as the day it was written. He is almost universally ignored by psychology and other behavioral sciences and humanities, and even those few in philosophy who have more or less understood him, have not carried the analysis to its logical (psychological) conclusion, nor realized the extent of his anticipation of the latest work on EP and cognitive illusions (the two selves of fast and slow thinking--see below). His heir apparent, John Searle, refers to him periodically and his work can be seen as a straightforward extension of W's, but he does not really get that this is what he is doing. Other leading W analysts such as Hutto and Moyal-Sharrock do marvelously but (in my view) stop short of putting him in the center of current psychology, where he certainly belongs.I eventually came to understand much of W by regarding his corpus as the pioneering effort in EP, seeing that he was describing the two selves and the multifarious language games of fast and slow thinking, and by starting from his 3rd period works and reading backwards to the proto-Tractatus. It has been extremely revealing to alternate W with the writings of hundreds of other philosophers and evolutionary psychologists (as I regard all psychologists and in fact all behavioral scientists, cognitive linguists and others). It should also be clear that insofar as they are coherent and correct, all accounts of behavior are describing the same phenomena and ought to translate easily into one another. Thus the recently fashionable themes of \\"Embodied Mind\\" and \\"Radical Enactivism\\" should flow directly from and into W's work. However almost nobody is able to follow his example of avoiding jargon and sticking to perspicuous examples, so even the redoubtable Hutto (see below) has to be heavily filtered to see that this is true. However, even Hutto does not get how completely W has anticipated the latest work in fast and slow, two-self embodied thinking (acting).W can also be regarded as a pioneer in evolutionary cognitive linguistics--the Top Down analysis of the mind and its evolution via the careful analysis of examples of language use in context, by exposing the many varieties of language games and the relationships between the primary games of the true-only unconscious, axiomatic fast thinking of perception, memory and reflexive emotions and acts (often described as the subcortical and primitive cortical reptilian brain first-self functions), and the later evolved higher cortical dispositional conscious abilities of believing, knowing, thinking etc. that constitute the true or false propositional secondary language games of slow thinking that are the network of cognitive illusions that constitute the second-self personality. He dissects hundreds of language games showing how the true-only perceptions, memories and reflexive actions of system one grade into the thinking, remembering, and understanding of system two dispositions and many of his examples also address the nature/nurture issue explicitly. With this evolutionary perspective, his later works are a breathtaking revelation of human nature that is entirely current and has never been equaled. Many perspectives have heuristic value, but I find that this evolutionary two systems view not only lets me understand W, but cuts like a hot knife through the frozen butter of all discussions of behavior. To repeat Dobzhansky's famous comment: \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\\" And nothing in philosophy makes sense except in the light of evolutionary psychology.The failure (in my view) of even the best thinkers (with a few possible exceptions) to fully grasp W's significance is partly due to the limited attention \\"On Certainty\\" (OC) and his other 3rd period works have received, but even more to the inability to understand how profoundly our view of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, politics, law, morals, ethics, religion, aesthetics, literature (all of them being descriptive psychology), alters once we accept this evolutionary point of view. The dead hand of the blank slate view of behavior still rests heavily on most people, pro or amateur and is the default of the second self of slow thinking conscious System 2,(which is oblivious to the fact that the groundwork for all behavior lies in the unconscious, fast thinking axiomatic structure of System 1). System 1 is more or less equivalent to \\"mirroring\\"(Goldman), \\"neural resonance\\"(Gallagher), \\"biosemantics\\"(Millikan), and \\"biosemiotics\\"(Hutto). Steven Pinker's brilliant \`The Blank Slate: the modern denial of human nature' is highly recommended preparation, even though it is now dated and limited in various ways, and he has no clue about Wittgenstein, and hence of what can be regarded as the first and best really deep investigation into the foundations of human nature. Also, he seems not to grasp that the Blank Slate view is an expression of the cognitive illusions that constitute our mental life.The common ideas (e.g., the subtitle of one of Pinker's books \\"The Stuff of Thought: language as a window into human nature\\") that language is a window on or some sort of translation of our thinking or even (Fodor) that there must be some other \\"Language of Thought\\" of which it is a translation, were rejected by W, who tried to show, with hundreds of continually reanalyzed perspicacious examples of language in action, that language is the best picture we can ever get of thinking, the mind and human nature, and his whole corpus can be regarded as the development of this idea. He rejected the idea that the Bottom Up approaches of physiology, experimental psychology and computation (now we say Computational Theory of Mind, Strong AI, Dynamic Sytstems Theory etc) could reveal what his Top Down deconstructions of Language Games (LG's) did. The difficulties he noted are to understand what is always in front of our eyes and to capture vagueness (\\"The greatest difficulty in these investigations is to find a way of representing vagueness\\" LWPP1, 347). And so, speech (i.e., oral muscle contractions, the principal way we can interact) is not a window into the mind but is the mind itself, which is expressed by acoustic blasts about past, present and future acts (i.e., our speech using the later evolved Secondary Language Games (SLG's) of the Second Self--the dispositions --imagining, knowing, meaning, believing, intending etc.). As with his other aphorisms I suggest one should take seriously his comment that even if God could look into our mind he could not see what we are thinking--this should be the motto of the Embodied Mind.Some of W's favorite topics in his later second and his third periods are the different (but interdigitating) LG's of fast and slow thinking (System 1 and 2 or roughly PLG's and SLG's), the epiphenomenality of our second self and mental life, the impossibility of private language and the axiomatic structure of all behavior. The PLG's are utterances by and descriptions of our involuntary, System 1, fast thinking, true only, nonpropositional, untestable mental states- our perceptions and memories and involuntary acts, while the evolutionarily later SLG's are descriptions of voluntary, System 2, slow thinking, testable true or false, propositional, dispositional (and often counterfactual) imagining, supposing, intending, thinking, knowing, believing etc. A useful heuristic is to separate behavior into Intentionality 1 and Intentionality 2 (e.g., Thinking 1 and Thinking 2 etc.) He recognized that \`Nothing is Hidden'--i.e., our whole psychology and all the answers to all philosophical questions are here in our language (our life) and that the difficulty is not to find the answers but to recognize them as always here in front of us--we just have to stop trying to look deeper (e.g., \\"The greatest danger here is wanting to observe oneself.\\" LWPP1, 459).W makes these points throughout his works in countless examples and again his whole corpus can be regarded as the effort to make them clear. After all, what exactly is the alternative? W showed over and over that standard ways of describing behavior (i.e., most of philosophy, and much of descriptive psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, etc.) are either demonstrably false or incoherent. Once we understand W, we realize the absurdity of regarding \\"language philosophy\\" as a separate study apart from other areas of behavior, since language is just another name for the mind. And, when W says (as he does many times) that understanding behavior is in no way dependent on the progress of psychology (e.g., his oft-quoted assertion \\"The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a \`young science' --but cf. another comment that I have never seen quoted \\"Is scientific progress useful to philosophy? Certainly. The realities that are discovered lighten the philosophers task. Imagining possibilities.\\" (LWPP1, 807). So, he is not legislating the boundaries of science but pointing out the fact that our behavior (mostly speech) is the clearest picture possible of our psychology and that all discussions of higher order behavior are plagued (as they are to this day) by conceptual confusions. FMRI, PET, TCMS, iRNA, computational analogs, AI and all the rest are fascinating and powerful ways to extend our innate axiomatic psychology, but all they can do is provide the physical basis for our behavior, facilitate our analysis of language games, and extend our EP, which remains unchanged (unless genetic engineering is unleashed to change our EP--but then it won't be us anymore). The true-only axioms most thoroughly explored in \`'On Certainty'' are W's (and later Searle's) \\"bedrock\\" or \\"background\\", which we now call evolutionary psychology (EP), and which is traceable to the automated true-only reactions of bacteria, which evolved and operates by the mechanism of inclusive fitness (IF). See the recent works of Trivers and others for a popular intro to IF or Bourke's superb \\"Principles of Social Evolution\\" for a pro intro.Beginning with their innate true-only, nonempirical (automated and nonchangeable) responses to the world, animals extend their axiomatic understanding via deductions into further true only understandings (\\"theorems\\" as we might call them, but of course like many words, this is a complex language game even in the context of mathematics). Tyrannosaurs and mesons become as unchallengeable as the existence of our two hands or our breathing. This dramatically changes ones view of human nature. Theory of Mind (TOM) is not a theory at all but a group of true-only Understandings of Agency (UOA a term I devised 10 years ago) which newborn animals (including flies and worms if UOA is suitably defined) have and subsequently extend greatly (in higher eukaryotes). Likewise the Theory of Evolution ceased to be a theory for any normal, rational, intelligent person before the end of the 19th century and for Darwin at least half a century earlier. One CANNOT help but incorporate T. rex and all that is relevant to it into our innate background via the inexorable workings of EP. Once one gets the logical (psychological) necessity of this it is truly stupefying that even the brightest and the best seem not to grasp this most basic fact of human life (with a tip of the hat to Kant, Searle and a few others) which was laid out in great detail in \\"On Certainty\\". Incidentally, the equation of logic and our axiomatic psychology is essential to understanding W and human nature (as DMS, but afaik nobody else, points out).So, most of our shared public experience (culture) becomes a true-only extension of our axiomatic EP and cannot be found mistaken without threatening our sanity. A corollary, nicely explained by DMS and elucidated in his own unique manner by Searle, is that the skeptical view of the world and other minds (and a mountain of other nonsense including the Blank Slate) cannot really get a foothold, as \\"reality\\" is the result of involuntary fast thinking axioms and not testable true or false propositions.I think it is clear that the innate true-only axioms W is occupied with throughout his work, and almost exclusively in OC (his last work), are equivalent to the fast thinking or System 1 that is at the center of current research (e.g., see Kahneman--\\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\", but he has no idea W laid out the framework over 50 years ago), which is involuntary and unconscious and which corresponds to the mental states of perception and memory, as W notes over and over in endless examples. One might call these \\"intracerebral reflexes\\"(maybe 99% of all our cerebration if measured by energy use in the brain). Our slow or reflective, more or less \\"conscious\\" (beware another network of language games!) second self brain activity corresponds to what W characterized as \\"dispositions\\" or \\"inclinations\\", which refer to abilities or possible actions, are not mental states, and do not have any definite time of occurrence. But disposition words like \\"knowing\\", \\"understanding\\", \\"thinking\\", \\"believing\\", which W discussed extensively, have at least two basic uses (or, one might say, in philosophical contexts, one major use and one abuse) or language games. One is a peculiar philosophical use by exemplified by Moore (whose papers inspired W to write OC), which refers to the true-only sentences resulting from direct perceptions and memory, i.e., our innate axiomatic System 1 psychology (\`I know these are my hands'), and their normal use as dispositions, which are acted out and which can become true or false (\`I know my way home').The investigation of involuntary fast thinking has revolutionized psychology, economics (e.g., Kahneman's Nobel prize) and other disciplines under names like \\"cognitive illusions\\", \\"priming\\", \\"framing\\", \\"heuristics\\" and \\"biases\\". Of course these too are language games so there will be more and less useful ways to use these words, and studies and discussions will vary from \\"pure\\" System 1 to combinations of One and Two (the norm as W made clear), but presumably not ever of slow System 2 dispositional thinking only, since any thought or intentional action cannot occur without involving much of the intricate network of the \\"cognitive modules\\", \\"inference engines\\", \\"intracerebral reflexes\\", \\"automatisms\\", \\"cognitive axioms\\", \\"background\\" or \\"bedrock\\" (as W and later Searle call our EP).Another point made countless times by W was that our conscious mental life is epiphenomenal in the sense that it does not describe nor determine how we act. It is an obvious corollary of his descriptive psychology that it is the unconscious automatisms of System 1 that dominate and describe behavior and that the later evolved conscious dispositions (thinking, remembering, loving, desiring, regretting etc.) are mere icing on the cake. This is most strikingly borne out by the latest experimental psychology, some of which is nicely summarized by Kahneman in the book cited (see e.g., the chapter \`Two Selves', but of course there is a huge volume of recent work he does not cite). It is an easily defensible view that most of the burgeoning literature on cognitive illusions is wholly compatible with and straightforwardly deducible from W.Probably the leading exponent of W's ideas on the language games of inner and outer (the \`Two Selves' operation of our personality or intentionality or EP etc. ) is the prolific Daniel Hutto (DH), who teaches at the same University as DMS. His approach is called \`Radical Enactivism' and is well explained in numerous recent books and papers. It is a development of or version of the Embodied Mind ideas now current and, cleansed of its jargon, it is a straightforward extension of W's 2nd and 3rd period writings (though Hutto seems only dimly aware of this). He is also author of the best deconstruction I know of Dennett's preposterous claim to be following in W's footsteps (in fact Dennett is just repeating most of the classic mistakes in grandiose fashion and hasn't a clue about W). But of course one must read Searle too and the title of his famous review of Dennett's book says it well \\"Consciousness Explained Away\\". Incidentally, unlike most philosophers and other scholars, who make little or no effort to give the general public access to their papers, Hutto has put nearly every paper (though of course often just proofs and not the final paper) free online at www.academia.edu.Here, as throughout W's works, understanding is bedeviled by possible alternative and consequently often infelicitous translations from often unedited and handwritten German notes, with \\"Satz\\" being frequently incorrectly rendered as \\"proposition\\"(which is a testable or falsifiable statement) when referring to our nonfalsifiable psychological axioms, as opposed to the correct \\"sentence\\", which CAN be applied to our axiomatic true-only statements such as \\"these are my hands\\" or \\"Tyrannosaurs were large carnivorous dinosaurs that lived about 50 million years ago\\"(and since this is an unavoidable extension of our psychology, what does this imply about creationists?).Regarding my view of W as the major pioneer in EP, it seems nobody has noticed that he very clearly explained several times specifically and many times in passing, the psychology behind what later became known as the Wason Test--long a mainstay of EP research.The view that even the brightest philosophers do not really grasp the context in which they are operating is perhaps most strikingly illustrated when they attempt to define philosophy. In recent years I have seen such definitions by two of those I hold in highest regard--Graham Priest and John Searle, and of course they mention truth, language, reality etc., but not a word to suggest it is a description of our innate universal axiomatic psychology and its extensions. Priest, by the way, has noted that W was the first to predict the emergence of paraconsistent logic.Finally, let me suggest that with this perspective, W is not obscure, difficult or irrelevant but scintillating, profound and crystal clear, that he writes aphoristically because we think and behave that way, and that to miss him is to miss one of the greatest intellectual adventures possible."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"This is a book which at one time was worshipped. It was taken to be the holy text that gave the true answers to the philosophical puzzles that graduate students in philosophy were puzzling over. Wittgenstein was the hero and his manner of ' doing philosophy' of walking and holding his forehead, and waiting in silence and thinking for long stretches of time while puzzling it out was imitated by his many followers. The 'Investigations' did not like the 'Tractatus ' before it present the system that would tell the whole truth , answer it all , as it were. It instead put the focus on philosophizing as an activity. And it is a remarkable, enigmatic, aphoristic text rich in suggestions and quandaries. It truly is a book that presents perplexing questions and makes it seem as if ' thinking' is a most serious and difficult business.From the work come key concepts which have been added to ' vocabulary ' of philosophical. Wittgenstein 'Seek the use not the meaning' puts him of course in the company of the pragmatists. The concept of ' family resemblance' in defining a concept in which one does not see a single clear definition, but rather sees 'variations' whose ' meanings overlap' as in a Venn diagram is another powerful tool of analysis. ' Letting the fly out of the fly bottle' another metaphor for philosophizing too suggested the turn to ordinary language and everyday common experience as central for philosophizing. And this away from the formal abstract logical thinking of 'The Tractatus'.Another point. The 'Philosophical Investigations' is a hard book to understand. And part of the mystique of Wittgenstein is the sense of his incredible ' genius mind' which most of us even those studying philosophy, cannot grasp.My own sense is that if you ask trivial questions you get trivial answers. And that of course much of the metaphysical and religious discourse philosophical analysis, logical positivism dismissed as nonsense is precisely what is important. 'The Investigations' opens more in the direction( I believe) of allowing for these kinds of meaning. But I am not sure about this.Another point. I do not pretend to understand not only not fully, not even ' largely' 'The Investigations'. The sense of not understanding though puzzling over it of course said something to me about my own ' lesser powers' in philosophy.Years later I would simply recommend to readers of the work to not take it with the kind of seriousness we did then. Take it as an interesting text, even a poetic text, and parse it and find meanings in it which hopefully will enrich your life and philosophical understanding.Do not pray to it. Wittgenstein was a great mind , but a mind to be studied and understood, a frail and fragmented mind also, and not to be worshipped."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"Very poor binding.

Of course a glimmer here, a flash there,but often enough philosophers are so caught up inchasing down truth that they have forgoten the tools thatwill get them there. But then there is this little jewel, apiece which is not so much a linear argument as a chorus ofvoices, a play of the mind's inclinations both profound andridiculous.In Philosophical Investigations, you will not findanything resembling the traditional forms of argumentation,and it is often difficult to discern who is sayingwhat and with what tone (which is fascinating because,unlike the Socratic dialogues, there is only one 'person'speaking). But one thing begins to crystalize as you diginto the work: Wittgenstein has an acute attunement tolanguage and its fine meshing of both system andabberation, of logic and eccentricity. If you are sometimesamazed at the fact that we speak, and most often without asecond thought, and if you as well sometimes wonder whyanyone would wish to make our language 'better' or somehowmore 'perfect', then you should find this work of small,seperated paragraphs stimulating."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"For some reason I keep this book around, although I do not understand it. When I read through it, I feel I must be missing something. It is said that sometimes Buddhist masters smack their students with reeds during their meditations to blast them into awareness. When I read this book, I want to smack Wittgenstein, to get him to clearly explain to me what the heck he is talking about. It always seemed to me that you don't have to explain the use of language. Everyone understands language from the time they know how to use it. Yes, words refer to things. We know this intuitively. The whole process is muddied up if you try to explain it. I said to my nine-year old boy recently, who is in a smart-aleck stage, \\"watch what you say!\\" And he retorted, \\"Well, I can't really watch what I say. You can't see your words.\\" And I said, \\"HEY! You know what I mean.\\" And there it is for me. I like reading this book, because it feels like mental exercise to do so. But I wonder what he was thinking, because I am not sure what he is getting at. I took a Wittgenstein course in college that had six students in the class, and I got an A. I remember being puzzled how I could have gotten an A, since I felt I did not really grasp what W. was saying. Maybe, as another reviewer recommends, I should just read through it again, slowly and carefully. It is a perplexing book, but I cannot deny its beauty.

Wittgenstein's flirtation with Logical Positivism blinded him to the reality that the hard mathematical sciences can only take us so far. Words constantly change in meaning. Each and every human being on this planet creates new words and reinterprets the old. There is no such thing as a literal language; relativism is the inescapable norm. The interpretation of a word is always in constant flux from one moment to the next. Words mean different things to different people. Context is everything. No word can escape a possible complete reversal in meaning. All words have majority and minority interpretations. A computer software spell checker, for instance, is at best a modest guide. The user must still be a relatively good speller to obtain any value from a so-called spell checker. People, regardless of intelligence and education, will forevermore interact with each other by a never ending process of inventing new expressions of meaning. We experiment until we reach a reasonable certitude, not certainty, of understanding. The use of body language, voice inflection, irony, hyperbole, or sarcasm can change the entire meaning of an uttered word. The subjectivity of the interpretation of words is a major reason why we sometimes fail to communicate effectively. A workable consensus is the best we can strive for. This is also why artificial intelligence will unlikely evolve to the point where we will ever engage in a give and take conversation with a machine.Language is essentially a Liberal Arts Discipline. The virtue of prudential judgment solely enables us interpret words. Frustration and madness threatens those who wish to believe otherwise. Wittgenstein desired the security blanket universe subtly promised by the Logical Positivists. Within this school of thought, the existential mysteries of life and death are deemed unworthy of even an acknowledgment. The hard sciences are perceived as more comforting and absolute. A person with such a mind set hesitates to learn how to walk the proverbial tight wire without a net. It is doubtful whether Wittgenstein ever came to grips to the realization that while human language leaves much to be desired, we still might with some effort be able to form viable relationships with other individuals and their accompanying social groups. Regretfully, the wrong headed nihilistic speculations of the philosophical deconstructionists seemed to hold sway over Wittgenstein throughout his intellectual life. Bertrand Russell, a friend of this controversial figure, thought that Wittgenstein was vastly overrated. I also agree with this assessment. The fame of Wittgenstein is due more to the courage of his convictions, a willingness to risk his life, and iconoclastic life choices than the pure brilliance of his thinking. Investing time and energy in Wittgenstein's aphorisms and essays will at least give one a glimpse into one of the dominant minds of our modern world. I would also recommend the reader obtain a copy of Ray Monk's biographical study--Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius.--"},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"I think many readers are turned off by the broken up nature of the text. The format does not bother me. Wittgenstein freely admits in the preface that he did not have time to finsh the book or do it justice. Instead we have a series of numbered paragraphs/thoughts/ideas/questions. My favorite investigateion, if I were to pick one, was #47, that was a highpoint of the book for me. Look that one up for a taste of the book.He is boiling down communication to its bare essentials or building blocks. He focuses on what it takes to truly convey a meaning to someone else. Most of the thoughts seem to explore language as a communication tool coupled with shared experience and intuition.Maybe I've read other authors who explored these concepts before I've read Wittgenstein. Maybe this truly was ground breaking at the time, I'm no historian or profesional philosopher (if there is such a thing). It is certainly worth reading but it is not on my list of favorites. The book didn't change my world view. Maybe I just agree with him and look through a similar projectory as his world view. I was really optimistic going into this book, but can only give it a 3 because I will probably never read it again. 4 is for books I will probably read again, 5 are my favorites."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"What you see is abnormal writing.

What did he do?"},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"To say that something is outside my frame of reference should tell me more about the current form of my sense-method than the value ,of spirit ,of my reaction to an external work.It is what I am internally which measures out my response. And it is my response which generates an objective distance from a piece of thought as much as it brings a closeness, a kinship. And the response is a factor of my being able to see objectively the value states of my association with material I have had cause to have at hand.I subject myself to formed thought written by others considering their work to be an expedient narrowing the choices, the selection of methods for deriving my own system for illustrating the different frames of reference sustaining association, the need to privacy in the act of absorbing another work.It is not logical elements that gives me a sense of error. It is the very general environment which describes (a landscape complete).But a complete environment means just that, complete. Not complete as a whole, filled with identifiable and necessary elements and the elements are constituents and can have elucidative practices made upon them. But complete in how it distinguishes by defining imposition upon the world. A statement has place as a work of inference, reason with method. But overall, the act must coincide with a tangible necessity which elementally anticipates a responsive gesture. And subsidiary gestures are made predetermined by the local conditions-language allows no constructivism. A picture can only have a local meaning (as much as a language). Although a picture can have meaning it is also known generally for what it is, a picture. And so a book can have a meaning. And in it's way of information and structure the meaning can be of a gradient, great or small. Yet it is still in reference what it is, what it is correctly surmised to be, a book. And a book is general to culture and so known as a thing and type.And the skills required for reading the book are certain. But a person who does not possess the skills required is no less involved in the world.Yet the skills can be described. And they can be shown in a way which arrives at a culmination of logical processes indicating that a nucleus lies at the bottom of that type of perception. And the center is central only in its reference to order in process. And the process is imposed as an act upon the book as much as the book by its nature of thought is imposed upon the world. The limits established by the process are shed away from reality as they post notice to declare order evolving from the processes own critical center, the increasing complexity of reference spreading outward concentrically automatically refers back upon its own method, its immediately previous statement, and defines as archaic, valueless, its necessary past. And in doing so it, as a must (which it is engineered to be), by its design-order, extinguishes any objective reference to inter-relative privacy which regardless of subject and intent is the origin point of the act of written extension before the fact.A series of remarks have a method of reason. They are examples and show more as indications (not as pseudo-empirical diagrams). They gesture in sense. And a gesture is more subtle because it causes no breaks in the flow of personal direction. And the reference's influence is partial not meant to change the course of focus. No immediacy is perceived by the individual in as much as the gesture is not referentially dramatic. And references which are pseudo and illegitimate are posed against immovable states of affairs. And a non-rigid reference is part of acknowledgment, a break in an obscuring focus where the nature of an association is seen not as what definitely is but rather noted naturally in the passing of time, for a moment. It is a not transcendental by any means, but rather a holistic and therapeutic instance of priority cognition. And here priority is defined as a unnatural relation, a fixation extending from the individual to a medium conveying propositional forms, written, verbal, or pictorial which by their intention convey autocracy.Such associations seem to numb the senses by imposing rigidity, a false sense of discipline that takes form as an internal structure, a mindset. And this mindset conforms to traditional knowledge practices. It acts, in function, as if to endorse them, support them. And it is within the confines of this area of rigidity that the central \`I' of function is logically premised from. All responses are there. All definable parts of elucidation are there. All limbs and organs complete, but only as allowed for that environment. The being inhabits only those edifices, walks those streets, speaks that language. And the result is a forming, a fixing of parts. And although apt description of being-in-place (once given) can be accepted, the sense behind the language does not quite fit because it is singular in its description-habitation. And this singularity excludes outside conditions which are defined as extras, i.e., superfluous functions."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"Wittgenstein was cryptic in the extreme. This has been mistaken for wisdom. Though he was considered an oracle by the 20th century he is likely, as was Herbert Spencer, famous in his own day, to be ignored by the subsequent generation.This is not a book to spend much time on if you have real philosophical problems to solve. If you are looking for curios in the history of philosophy, by all means spend an hour."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"The two greatest works of philosophy of the 20th century are, I believe, Wittgenstein's PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS and Heidegger's BEING AND TIME. The famous distinction between Analytical or Anglo-American Philosophy on the one hand, and European or Continental Philosophy is symbolized by these two books. I have to confess that I found the Wittgenstein absolutely fascinating, and has become one of the most important books in my life and library. I have studied the Heidegger, but perhaps because of the extraordinary moral failings in his life (he was a member of the Nazi party from 1933 to 1945, though he apparently was more of a fan of Nazism than Hitler, his great break with Hitler being that he saw the Jewish problem as being an intellectual problem, and not a biological one, i.e., he felt like traditional anti-Semites that Jews need only change their beliefs to be reintegrated into society, while Hitler felt the problem was in their blood, and the only solution was isolation of the Jews or their destruction), or perhaps because of the tortured and obscure mode of writing that he felt he had to use to express his thought, I found the Heidegger to be remote, uninteresting, and inaccessible. Ultimately, not worth the effort. But BEING AND TIMES's status as a classic is incontestable.As a grad student in philosophy at Yale and the University of Chicago, I was subject to a growing conviction that most university professors teaching Wittgenstein should, perhaps, not. The problem is that most American professors teaching Wittgenstein teach him as an extension of Russell, Tarski, and Carnap. Their background is logic, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science, and their philosophy of language is rooted in logical and scientific issues. Although Wittgenstein was interested in these issues, there is a definitive amount of information that indicates that while he possessed a knowledge of mathematics, logic, and philosophy of language, his own philosophical background was much, much broader. His own cultural concerns ran much more broadly than most of these professors. It is not merely that they have not read Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Lichtenberg, Karl Kraus, Goethe, or the prayers of Samuel Johnson: they have no interest in doing so, and little sympathy for these writers, whom Wittgenstein himself found congenial.One is, therefore, in a dilemma with Wittgenstein. Unless you have taken several courses in philosophy, taking up the PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS can be an almost overwhelming challenge. Most of the books on Wittgenstein are either weak or very misleading because of a lack of sympathy with his wider interests.For an ordinary individual, perhaps well read, but not especially knowledgeable of the work of philosophers like Russell and Frege and against whom he developed much of his thought, my first recommendation would be not to read the PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS, but to read instead Ray Monk's biography of Wittgenstein. This is a excellent biography, and does a very good job of acquainting the casual reader with the highlights of both Wittgenstein's thought and life (and his life was a very interesting one indeed, in contrast to Heidegger, whose life, apart from his involvement with Nazism, was pretty uneventful). I would then recommend that one try reading one of Wittgenstein's other books first. I believe that either ON CERTAINTY or ZETTEL or CULTURE AND VALUE would be a much easier way into Wittgenstein's work than reading the INVESTIGATIONS."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"Philosophical Investigations is a classical work in the history of philosophy. It is a book which holds a position similar to that of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Plato's Meno and Heidegger's Sein und Zeit.Let's take a look at Wittgenstein's investigations. I have presented Wittgenstein's life in my review of Ray Monk's Wittgenstein biography, let me here focus more on his philosophy.Wittgenstein starts with a quote from St Augustine. Augustine belived that the principal function of language is to refer to external reality, he believed that all words function similar to names and according to Wittgenstein he seems to have held the view language is learned through ostensive defintions. Wittgenstein, however, rejects this referentialist view of language, believing that language is far more complex than what Augustine thought. Language is an activity, or connected to a number of activitites, which Wittgenstein called language-games. Language-games have different puprposes, not all of them are centered around refering. There are many contexts for using words and many kinds of speach acts. While the logical positivists believed that the meaning of a statement was its method of verification, and Frege believed in two different entities (Sinn and Bedeutung), Wittgenstein rejects these views. According to this thinker from Vienna, meaning is use, and to understand a linguistic expression is to master how to use it and the accompanying techniques, not mereley to understand the verification principle, grasping some Platonic/Fregian entity or have some sense impression in one's head (Locke).Language is behaviour, practive give the words their sense according to Wittgenstein. This also relates to the private language argument, presented in paragraphs 199ff. Wittgenstein argues that the rules of language must be public and behavioral. It is not, as some like Peter Winch or Kripke have thought, an argument for the principle social nature of language, but for the behavioral aspect of rule-following. Mental terms, according to LW, cannot enter into the language without intimately being connected to overt behavioral patterns. Thus the mentalism of Hume and Locke is rejected, and Wittgenstein shows how knowledge must be more than just access to private sense data. There goes Russell, the British aristocratic sensualists and the Cartesian idea of priveleged access. Sometimes Wittgenstein may seem like a Marxist: it is the practical part of human life that provides that basis for our thoughts and rationality. Being a rational creature, according to Wittgenstein, is not what the rationalist Descartes thought or the empiricists thought; you cannot isolate the intellect or private sensations, because human rationality is based on practical and concrete, physical behavioral patterns.Througout the investigations Wittgenstein tries to challenge many of the positions held by previous philosophers. He once said that he didn't write for philosophers, but I do think that knowledge of the history of philosophy sheds light over his investigations. he said that WHAT he said would be simple, but understanding WHY he said it, would be difficult.But even though you are not a professional philosopher, you may receive vital inputs from Wittgenstein. If you can grasp the essence of his ideas of language-games, rule-following, form of life, anti-mentalism and conceptual therapy, you will have knowledge of some of his key ideas ideas.If you supply your reading of Philosophical Investigations with Ray Monk's marvellous &quot;Ludwig Wittgenstein. The Duty of Genius&quot; you can understand the horizon of this great thinker. Also important, are Baker and Hacker's books on Wittgenstein.Finally, a word on interpretation. Burton Dreben once had a seminar at the University of Oslo, where he said that if you don't know Frege and Russell, you won't understand Wittgenstein. I completely agree with Dreben that Wittgenstein was much inspired by the philosophers and logicians Frege and Russell. However, one should understand that Wittgenstein was deeply fascinated by poetry, religion and existential questions. Among his favourite writers were Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Kierkegaard. When this is taken into account, one can understand Wittgenstein in depth. Wittgenstein was a thinker with great analytical abilities, but never forget that he had a poetic soul. &quot;I am not a religious man, but I cannot help seeing everything from a religious point of view&quot; he once said to one of his friends. The ideas he had on language-games, forms of life and rule-following should be seen in light of some of the profound and important questions a religious man or an existentialist may ask himself."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"This book inspires heartfelt testimony. My own experience is that it liberates. Wittgenstein introduces a method that's fitted to the questions he treats, so that anyone who is bothered by the same questions can finally get a decent grip on them. The questions I mean are the usual philosophical ones: what is value? what is a fact? what is logic? what makes a thing what it is? what is essence? what is explanation? what is thinking? and so on. But (and this is a clue to his method) the basic question among all of these is about meaning: what is it, what conditions it, and what is the relationship between meaning and world (it turns out to be intimate).A couple of &quot;warnings&quot;: Wittgenstein is not a philosopher who likes jargon, in fact the tendency to jargon cuts directly against his philosophical point that language is just fine the way it is. But he can be weirdly hard to read anyway and very smart people walk away from him bewildered all the time. Mostly (I think) that's because the questions are uniquely &quot;close to us&quot; and Wittgenstein's approach is totally unlike familiar approaches to problem-solving (in science, math, politics, car mechanics, etc.) It's as though we are used to inspecting things at arm's length but what's at issue in these questions changes at arm's length, the problem is only right at our noses. So he takes another approach which you'll have to see first-hand - what he himself called his &quot;new method&quot;. Now every rule must have an exception, and that brings me to the second point. Actually Wittgenstein does rely on some technical vocabulary - nothing far-out, but it can present an obstacle to deeper reading. Words like &quot;sense&quot;, &quot;reference&quot;, &quot;assertion&quot;, &quot;truth-value&quot;, &quot;concept&quot;, and &quot;object&quot; stem from logic and the theory of meaning as Frege developed them. To go more deeply into PI, a person would have to read - or somehow be comfortable with ideas from - at least two of Frege's articles: &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot; and &quot;On Concept and Object&quot; [collected in The Frege Reader, Beaney ed.]. These articles are practically the fountainhead of analytic philosophy and also clear, precisely written, and intensely brilliant. More to the point, they contain many of Wittgenstein's insights in germinal form, and many of Wittgenstein's most significant moves are implicit or explicit criticisms of Frege. So to really get to the bottom of PI you'll probably need to read Frege.Anyway, the bottom line is: if you've come this far, it's for you."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"I recommend your own reading of this Wittgenstein. Do not lean on others to show you the path. LW is clear enough if you go slowly, paragraph by paragraph. No one will know more of him than you. #1Paragraph, for instance, is his take on a piece from a church writer of millenia ago -- not that he's particularly devoted to Christian scholars, but that he uses the piece to show where others are in this matter of learning language from one's elders. From this rudimentary start, he goes on to develop other languages, set in rather a very limited word-language range. He shows how it works within these limited ways of life and cultures. &quot;Purchasing apples&quot; in a store is one scene for us to look at LW. A construction set-up &quot;with four words and four actions&quot; are all of another particular way-of-life, and the total use of a simple language form. Note LW's very simple beginnings. You can easily get the gist of his words and expositions here. Read slowly and carefully. Remember his presentations. He will refer to them again. I recommend that when you return to your reading to continue your study, that you start not exactly where you left off. Start the new readings a few paragraphs before your previous last. Get a running start into the new.&quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; does come with a German text also, but is not necessary for this excellent translation.I find that another who has struggled over this book as you will, can offer some other assistance -- but don't depend on it. As Ludwig Wittgenstein says about those who will come after him in this subject material, it is necessary that you do it mainly by yourself, to get the most out of him and it. Only by immersing oneself in what he is saying, can one come out of it touched, a bit perplexed, but into this new introduction to language, ways of life, Wittgentstein, and yourself.Good luck in your meeting with this most interesting fellow, dead in 1951 at the age of 62, but writing his ideas until a day or so before he slowly died (these latter remarks have been gathered into a book, &quot;On Certainty&quot;).By the way, after his death, his remaining papers and writings have been combined into other books. He gave his all to his calling. Rest assured, you too will have to give something of yourself as you too get something from a most interesting fellow human being."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"I'm not sure how one goes about reviewing a book like this since it cannot be captured in a paragraph or two. Suffice it to say, when I read it in my undergraduate days it was an eye-opener.In his earlier Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Wittgenstein had sought to build a picture of the world by exploring how language mirrors reality in order to capture it. In Philosophical Investigations, a book which became the bible for a whole new way of philosophical thinking (but which he never published in his lifetime), Wittgenstein scrapped all that for the view that language ultimately WAS the world because it contained it. A subtle but powerful difference in the way one sees things. He achieved this not through a traditional and long-drawn out philosophical argument but rather by a series of pithy, note-like questions and answers to himself. The argument does not so much build as unfold, as the reader sees more and more (from a multiplicity of angles) the nature of language as Wittgenstein came to conceive it in his later years. What it did for me back then was to wean me away from a narrow and rigorous positivism, which had previously colored everything I did and said, allowing me to see the value of many of the &quot;non-concrete&quot; forms of life in which we find ourselves. It doesn't answer the ethical or metaphysical questions of traditional philosophy so much as it builds a &quot;world&quot; in which they seem intelligible if one approaches them in the non-traditional, Wittgensteinian way which is so crisply demonstrated here.In this book, no less than in his later teachings, Wittgenstein radically altered (dare one say revolutionized?) the way we think about language and knowledge and even thinking itself. And how we view the philosophical project. If, in the end, we have not given up the struggle to solve philosophical problems in favor of &quot;dissolving&quot; them, which he generally recommends here, it is not because he did not offer us new insight into the matter but rather because his strategy leads to a more open and broader view of the world in which we find ourselves. Because of this book I found greater comfort in the company of the great metaphsyicians and existentialists, for all the fuzziness of their language (which Wittgenstein implicitly criticizes), and learned to feel at ease with phenomenologists and even religionists (is that a fair formulation for those who embrace the concept of deity in any of its many variants?). And that, it seems to me, is what philosophy must be about in the end, about the big questions, Ludwig Wittgenstein's technical queries and explorations notwithstanding. But he gets you there if you will give him the time and attention necessary to crack the world open, like the opaque and rather hard-boiled egg it often seems to be."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"I read the PI as part of a class on Wittgenstein that I took in my final semester of college, and I don't think I would be going too far in saying that it tied together everything I had read up to that point. For me it made clear how and in what sense every preceding philosopher had &quot;gone wrong&quot; and opened the door for a meaningful examination of the language we use not just in philosophy, but in everyday life. In addition, it showed me how the language we use to make sense of the world is a sort of framework that we lay over what is, in some sense, still a mystery. This is the most important and one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Of course, it follows from what is written in the book that different readers will interpret it (and any other work) in different ways. All I can recommend is that you read it and see what you get out of it."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"Could this have been a better book? Philosophical Investigations and Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" were both the \\"precipitate\\" of 20 years of personal exploration of intellectual problems. Darwin had reasons for publishing his work that Wittgenstein did not have. Alfred Wallace independently discovered some of Darwin's ideas, forcing Darwin to rush his work to print. In contrast, Wittgenstein lamented the poverty and darkness of his time and had to hope that his ideas might be appreciated in the future. Given the difficult conditions of its construction, it is hard to fault the form of this book.Is there anyone who could have been the equivalent for Wittgenstein of what Wallace was for Darwin? Darwin and Wallace could both get out in the world and make the types of observations needed to discover the same ideas. Wittgenstein had to create the Tractatus, an experience that eventually led him to reject the conventional approach for trying to explain language. However, other philosophers seemed to be immunized against coming to interpret the Tractatus in the way that Wittgenstein did. Wittgenstein was dealing with ideas that were also starting to be incorporated into other intellectual disciplines, so could Wittgenstein's Wallace have come from another discipline such as computer science?Maybe Alan Turing could have tried to program computers to use human language and in so doing taken another path to the conclusion that formal logical systems cannot account for human language behavior. Unfortunately, when Wittgenstein was done working on the material that was later published in Philosophical Investigations, the first computer programs were just being run. Turing was interested in the idea of artificial intelligence, but the computer hardware was not there in time. That only one man was able to make the intellectual journey described in Philosophical Investigations is the great story behind the story.The problems Wittgenstein confronted \\"from inside\\", by way of introspection, are the problems that neurobiologists are now confronting \\"from the outside\\". For example, Wittgenstein used the \\"duckrabbit\\" as an example of \\"aspect seeing\\". The drawing of the \\"duckrabbit\\" can be seen either as a duck or a rabbit. In Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein made explicit the analogy between the meaning problem for human language and our mental power of aspect seeing. Sure, we can write a definition for a word to put into a dictionary, but does that mean that we have \\"captured\\" THE meaning of the word? No more than seeing one aspect of the duckrabbit means that we know its meaning.Wittgenstein was horrified by the way Freudians had abused the term \\"unconscious\\", so he mostly avoided using it. \\"We remain unconscious of the prodigious diversity of all everyday language-games because the clothing of our language makes everything alike.\\" This one sentence indicates the main point of the entire work and gives a short answer to the question of what went wrong in the Tractatus. Philosophical Investigations is a workbook in which Wittgenstein attempts to march across this central idea in so many ways that eventually the disease of our former way of thinking about language is cured.In the last section of Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein condemns psychology for its conceptual confusion and barrenness, noting that psychologists get bewitched by their experimental methods. Psychology, as a black-box study of the mind, must fail as surely as do the attempts by philosophers to describe mind and language as formal systems.Only after the death of Wittgenstein did the black-box of the mind begin to be opened and understood well enough to start the process of explaining mind in terms of brain physiology. We now know that the human ability to think of something and form a mental image of it (which gets extensive investigation in Philosophical Investigations) is mediated by the spread of activity down into the lowest domains of the visual cortex in a way that reverses the flow of information that makes perception possible. We can now begin to understand aspect seeing in terms of the existence of mutually competitive semantic networks in brains, only one of which can stabilize within consciousness at one time. Our experience of word meaning is just a special example of how our brains deal with fluid concepts and can shrink associative networks around individual words or relax them to encompass phrases or entire sentences.Just as no living organism makes sense outside of the network of life within which it is embedded, nothing within human language has meaning outside of the semantic networks that form inside the brains of human children. Of course, most of the activity of these networks takes place within what George Lakoff calls the \\"cognitive unconscious\\", the ocean of unseen brain activity upon which our introspectively accessible and behaviorally expressible brain activity floats. It will be a fitting tribute to Wittgenstein's courage and vision if the neuroscientists who are working from the outside of the brain to reveal the workings of the cognitive unconscious will be able to join with those philosophers who are working on Wittgenstein's research project and building towards the same goal from the inside. Towards this end, Philosophical Investigations deals with issues that are still very much on our \\"to do\\" list.Is it useful to read some of Frege's work or Wittgenstein's Tractatus before reading Philosophical Investigations? An alternative is to make use of the secondary literature, for example Garth Hallett's thick Companion to Philosophical Investigations. I suggest opening up Philosophical Investigations and pretending that you are sitting right in front of Wittgenstein in a classroom. When he says, \\"now think about this,\\" put the book down and think about it! When he asks a question, write it out in your own words and then write out your answer. If you see a word or phrase that confuses you, write it down in your personal glossary along with the location in the text where you find it. Check in Hallett or online for help with these confusing words. Think in the direction that Wittgenstein pointed."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"There isn't much point in my criticizing Wittgenstein's crowning work, which is without a doubt one of the most important philosophical works of all time. Philosophers must read it.This edition is good, but readers should be aware that it carries only the English text (in Anscombe's translation). The translation is standard and superb, but I advise serious students to consider buying the bilingual edition of the _Philosophische Untersuchungen_ (Routledge)."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"Perhaps something the other reviewers fail to see is the significance of this work. Wittgenstein is one of the most important philosophers of this century and this work is key to understanding his philosophy as it developed in his later years. All to often the lay philosophy-reader is drawn to existentialism and other such soft and questionable philosophies, but to the true student, this work cannot be underestimated. As a purely literary work, however, it is not such a good read; thus the lack of the fifth star."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations;: The English text of the third edition","review":"This is obviously one of the most important books of 20th cent. philosophy, so no point in restating its fine points of linguistic theory etc.More important (to me) is how it makes you feel, particularly since its enduring value will be defined, not by how professional philosophers think of it, but by how its received by ordinary people (who work in drab offices, let's say).Wittgenstein unfolds a strange dialogue with himself and with hypothetical interlocutors. There are various problems presented. But just when your head is hurting from all the possibilities, like a Zen master, LW just disolves the problems with a subtle aphorism. It's a strange feeling, I tell you! Similar to reading eastern philosophy.His aphorisms such as &quot;philosophy shows the fly out of the bottle&quot; or &quot;understanding language is like understanding a way of life&quot; or (the best) &quot;if a lion had language, we would not understand him&quot; have a way of getting under your skin and forcing you to really observe the world in a new way. The other day I was speaking with a female attorney about hostile workplace law and how language can be a tool for keeping women out of certain jobs, and I kept thinking, &quot;This is straight Wittgenstein.&quot; In fact a lot of &quot;postmodern&quot; ideas about language can be traced to this book.Whether Wittgenstein's ideas are technically right seems of more concern to linguists and psychologists. For me, good philosophers give the world fresh insights and new models. And P.I. certainly does that. If you aren't familiar with his work, I would check out Derek Jarman's elegant film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot; (screenplay by Terry Eagleton), then flip through this book and see if your perspective doesn't change and if you don't suddenly break up the next office meeting shouting: &quot;The limits of my language are the limits of my world!&quot;"},{"Title":"Snow (Snow Series #1)","review":"How Calvin Miller develops such character depth so quickly is remarkable.

Yet as simplistic as the story is, Miller manages to infuse some warmth into his writing, keeping the reader's attention even though they know what is going to happen.\\"Snow\\" is the story of a bitter cold winter in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The weather brings together the unlikeliest of characters; Mary, a poor widow with an asthmatic child and the Mueller family - rich through the delivery of coal, stingy and lacking the true spirit of Christmas. Their son Erick takes over deliveries for his father due to an injury, and with one visit to Mary's humble home, falls in love despite his father's warnings. Mary, a widow for three years, has devoted her life and happiness to ensuring that her daughter survives and is at first unwilling and uncertain of her feelings for Erick.The novel runs predictably through a cast of characters that lack depth. Miller focuses too much time on telling rather than showing through his writing; and his insistence on depicting Hans Mueller's germanic accent soon grows old. The reader knows that everything is going to turn out okay in the end. Yet despite that fact, Miller makes some observations about the meaning of Christmas, that while not necessarily new ground, are observations that many have forgotten. \\"Snow\\" is a good reminder of how the spirit of Christmas infuses us all."},{"Title":"Snow (Snow Series #1)","review":"This is a wonderful book about a woman who never gave up her love for God and for her child.

Andy has outdone himself in his latest effort to compress the life and times of Warren Buffett between the covers of a book. The writing is engaging and interesting, it is lavishly drenched with over 800 photos that you will no doubt not see anywhere else, and make reading about the Berkshire empire all that more interesting. Kilpatrick does not skimp on any detail of Buffett's long and stellar carreer in investing. The personal and humorus stories and photos are woven throughout to make it a very entertaining and informative Buffett encyclopedia. Since the chapters, for the most part, are not that long, one can pick it up and read for as long or as short a time as is convienent. All in all,a most complete and exellent record of a &quot;bigger than life&quot; life!A MUST have for Buffett fans!"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett, 2005 Edition","review":"First, I want to mention two constructive feedback about this book. One is that this book is probably only suitable for Warren Buffett fanatics/fans. For general investors interested about Berkshire Hathaway or how Warren Buffett invest, this is probably not the best book to read (as it has so much more info. i.e. more than 1000 pages). Second is that I have read this book more than once and I still don't know how the book is organized (the chapters aren't following chronological order, alphabetical nor topical order), therefore it is quite confusing to read as you progress from one chapter to another. Only after you read enough chapter (or completed the book) then you can put it all in the big picture in your head (from Warren's childhood till his current Berkshire days). Nonetheless, kudos to Andrew Kilpatrick for putting this book together. Moreover, once you know the limitation, this book is easily considered the best book about Warren Buffett in my opinion.Now about the content of the book. You will learn a lot about Warren Buffett and his life, and not only investing topic (investing decisions that he made throughout his career) but his life principles, family, and business in general as well. You will learn about his first job delivering papers when he was 13 (he filed income tax and deducted the bike as business cost), and how he build his first business (pinball machine business), created Buffett partnership, break it up (liquidate), acquire berkshire mills, creating Berkshire Hathaway as investment vehicle, and many other great investment decision/story that he made (Geico, See's Candies, Dairy Queen, General Re, Coca Cola, Salomon, Washington Post, Gillette etc)Buffett concrete rules for investing are:1. Never lose money2. Never forget rule #1I know it's easier said (what he say above about to never lose money) than done based on my 10 years of invesitng experience , but then again I'm no Warren Buffett.In my opinion, here are the 5 strategy/skills that Warren Buffett uses (Mr. Buffett, please correct me if I'm wrong):1. Intrinsic Value2. Margin of Safety3. Temperament (discipline and understanding Mr.Market)4. Circle of Competence (knowing what your circle of competence)5. Common Sense (which I think is the most important factor and encapsulate everything about Warren Buffett.)You will learn that Warren is very good with numbers (calculating in his head) and memorizing so many facts and numbers. You will also learn that Warren is a man with a very good sense of humor.There are so many things/chapters that I like on this book. Let me try to mention two of my favorite sections.One is when Warren need to make a decision who would run Salomon ($150B institution with 8000 employees) within 2 days during their first crisis. There are 12 top-level managers that he interviewed. \\"This was the most important hire of my life\\", said Warren to the Columbia business students. The chapter explain his thought process of this candidate selection in detail. Warren mentioned that the good news (for the students and the candidate) is that he didn't ask what their grades were (laughter). Warren also said, \\"Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. and if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you. if you think about it, it's true, if you hire somebody without integrity, you want them to be dumb and lazy\\" (laughter). And he conclude the topic with this statement which I think is very powerful: \\"Pick the kind of person to work for you that you want to marry your son or daughter. You won't go wrong\\". By the way, he picked Deryck Maughan by the way for his integrity.Another chapter that I really like is how Warren put the audience (of more than 2000 people) through Business School in an electrifying two minutes (The chapter about \\"Generics\\"). See how Warren answer the question of \\"Will developments in the generic brand area hurt coca-cola?\\" which is a very important questions. I'll try not to spill too much and take the joy of reading this chapter yourself but he basically explains in a nutshell (with all the details and numbers) how business and competition works (and using several other example like Gilette, Marlboro, Sam Cola etc) and how he convinced the audience (and me as a reader) that coca cola is considered immune to generics. He explains how one can save $500 for smoking generic brand (vs Marlboro) which is a lot of money. While a man will probably will only save $11 per year by not using Gilette Sensor and probably leave band-aids on his face and an uncomfotable experience for opting for generics/lower quality blades. And for coca cola, the net profit margin is only 1 cents per serving (can) while a lot of the ingredients cost (such as the aluminium close to 6 cents a can, sugar 1.3 ounce per can or 1.75 cents etc) the same regardless for coke or other cola company.I'll stop here before it's getting too long. In summary, If you are a Warren Buffett fans, then this book is for you. If you are uncertain, you can get other books first (potentially less thick book), like \\"Warren Buffet Way\\" or maybe \\"Buffettology\\", and if you like them (Warren) or want to know more about Warren then get this book. I personally don't like it in the beginning but as time goes by (and after I re-read the book/chapters), I changed my mind, this book is a masterpiece.As a Berkshire shareholder, I want to encourage all berkshire shareholders (and potential/future shareholders) to read this book to know more about the person in charge of your berkshire investment. I also want to encourage all shareholders to go to the annual shareholder meeting while Mr. Buffett is still in charge.Last but not least, if I have to sum this book up in a word or two, I would use the word \\"WISDOM\\" to describe this book, though I have a strong feeling that Warren will disagree with me and think that the more suitable phrase is \\"COMMON SENSE\\"Happy Investing!Sidarta Tanu"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett, 2005 Edition","review":"Warren Buffett, the American Icon, is captured beautifully in these 1500some pages.

Mary was the foster child of the Altman's. She often went to visit the Wakefield's, walking home with either Elizabeth or Jessica from school.Jessica noticed that Mary was far too close with her mother. She felt jealous and resented Mary's easy going ways in their home. She noticed that Mary was always following her mother around, chatting and laughing with her. Sometimes, she felt ignored because her mother was busy talking with Mary. One day, she approached her twin sister Elizabeth and told her of her observations. She said that Mary didn't really go to their house to be with them - it was really to be with their mother. She asked Elizabeth not to invite Mary to their house anymore. She made it clear that she didn't want another sister!Elizabeth, realizing that Jessica really resented Mary's presence in their house, tried to avoid Mary at school. She would run off after school or pretend to be busy with her newspaper work. Mary noticed this and felt very hurt. Elizabeth, who is really a warm and understanding person, decided to tell Mary the truth. She told Mary that Jessica no longer wants Mary to visit their home because she didn't want to have to share their mother's attention with anyone.Since then, Mary avoided the twins. She would sit alone in school and really looked miserable. During one occasion, Mary had a chance to sit beside Jessica. She gave Jessica a gift and told her that she really wanted to be friends again. Jessica was surprised and pleased when she saw that the gift Mary gave her was a gold and silver bracelet Mary had worn so often and which she really liked. She also needed some help in typing some recipes to be published in a book in school. So she decided to be friends with Mary again. She even invited Mary to go her house after school for snacks.While they drank grape juice in Jessica's kitchen, they read the master newspaper article Elizabeth wrote about someone who gave a talk about proper dressing in school. Unfortunately, Jessica accidentally spilt the grape juice on the paper. The ink ran out and no matter how they tried to blot the paper, the whole article which Elizabeth wrote was erased. Afraid of Elizabeth's reaction, Jessica proceeded to fill in the missing paragraphs with her own ideas. Mary typed the article on the paper.That evening, Jessica overheard her parents saying that the Altman's have decided to adopt Mary. Despite Elizabeth's warning that she should not repeat that information to anyone else, Jessica decided that it was such good news and everyone should know about it. The Altman couple were so nice and finally Mary would stop following her mother around since Mrs. Altman would made a very good mother. Just before going to sleep, Jessica wrote an additional sentence in the Elizabeth's article in the master newspaper. It read: &quot;Mary will be adopted by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Altman&quot;. Jessica was sure that Mary would thank her for putting that in.Come the following day, Elizabeth and Mary were both horrified with what came out in the newspaper. Elizabeth went straight to her advisor to say that she wants to redo the article. Her advisor said that the article was more &quot;fun&quot; than her usual articles and if she would only correct the spelling errors, it would really be perfect. This made Elizabeth feel worse. She really wanted to kill Jessica - specially after Mary confronted her, telling her that she didn't want to be adopted by the Altman's because she believes that her mother is not really dead, as was told to her by a certain Annie who brought her up after her mother left and disappeared. Mary said that she was sure that her mother was somewhere still trying to find her.After school, she went home directly and told Mr. and Mrs. Altman that she didn't want to be adopted because she believes her mother would one day find her - even if it was already 7 years since her mother left her. The Altman's understood her and respected her decision.Mary forgave Jessica for writing about her in the newspaper. Elizabeth managed to forgive her twin sister as well and all three became good friends once more.One day, a woman came by the school to ask about Mary. Elizabeth noticed that the woman resembled her mother. She told the woman that Mary was with her twin sister in their house. She offered to walk the woman to her house. On the way, the woman asked a lot of things about Mary, about the Altman's and whether Mary was happy there. Elizabeth asked her if she was Annie. The woman said no. Suddenly Elizabeth's heart jumped. She asked the woman if she was the mother of Mary. Tears sprang to her eyes as the woman admitted that she was Mary's mother. She said that she had been looking for Mary for a long time.When they reached the Wakefield's house, Mary instantly recognized her mother and ran to embrace her. The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Robinson and said that Mary's real name is Mary Elizabeth Robinson. She explained that she left Mary to the care of her neighbour, Annie Gaccio, when she had to go to attend to her dying mother. After the funeral, she went back only to find that Annie had kidnapped Mary. She went to the police but no one could trace Annie. No one could trace Mary Robinson either.When Annie Gaccio was recently caught by the police stealing from a department store, she denied knowing any Mary Robinson. A policeman said that maybe they will try to search for a Mary Gaccio - in case Annie had changed Mary's surname.That search led her to Sweet Valley and to Mary. Realizing that Mary was very happy living in Sweet Valley, Mrs. Robinson accepted Mr. Altman's offer to help her look for a job there. Mary was very happy to be with her mother at last and to continue staying at Sweet Valley. She really liked her friends and her school.Elizabeth and Jessica were so happy for Mary. Elizabeth altered the newspaper article, retaining most of what Jessica wrote and adding &quot;Written by Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield&quot; making Jessica very happy. The school newspaper won in a contest and the recipe book which Jessica, Mary and their other friends wrote was selling well.More importantly, Jessica and Elizabeth realized how lucky they were that they had parents who loved them and took very good care of them.Review by: Alexandra Rodriguez age: 10"},{"Title":"A Hundred Billion Stars","review":"The book gives a clearly written, easily understandable account of some aspects of modern astronomy.

Bolt writes in the introduction that La Fontaine's fables were not, of course, new in the seventeenth century, but \\"for the quality of his writing and the brilliance of his wit, La Fontaine has to be the king.\\"*Bolt maintains La Fontaine's sing-song rhythm and rhyme, making \\"The Hare and the Tortoise\\" a great read-aloud choice for children graduating from Mother Goose. Potter's illustrations are whimsical fun as usual and a variety of animals adorn every page. \\"The Hare and the Tortoise and other Fables of La Fontaine\\" is highly recommended for children from 2-12."},{"Title":"Hare And The Tortoise","review":"Bolt's taken La Fontaine's work and translated a passle into plain English, a feat that required updating the syntax, flogging the rhymes until they obeyed, and making a decent stab at meter. English is a scrappier language for rhymes and rhythms compared to those slick Latinate tongues, and nobody since John Donne has managed to make it sound like it just popped out of your mouth that way, unless you are a rap star.Bolt makes the poetry flow like conversation, discarding an even meter when it doesn't suit the lines or finishing a sentence regardless of where the rhyme falls. The result is a more natural sound than if it had been hobbled rigidly to its couplets.Then there's the fables themselves. Many, like the title story, have been done to death. But did you know the tortoise taunts the hare at the end?\\"I've won! I don't know where you'd beIf you'd a house to lug like me!\\"What attitude. I love it!Many of these fables may not already be familiar, like the haunting \\"The Man and the Mirror,\\" about a man who at first cannot believe the ugly mug staring back at him is his own:These mirrors caused him such dismay,At last he hid himself awayIn a far corner where he knowNo mirror would offend his view.Eventually, he sees his reflection in a river and realizes it's time to get a life:The mirrors stand for others who,By being faulty through and through,Show us that we are faulty too.And I usually scoff at the \\"faux naive\\" school of illustration, but it works here. Potter emulates colonial American folk art, like something you'd see in an old needlepoint or a more sprightly version of Edward Hicks' Peaceable Kingdom paintings.She does away with perspective, going for a flat picture plane so the characters (both people and animals) frame the text. She used gouache, a type of watercolor, and a palette rich in cheerful spring hues.This is a keeper; one you'll refer to again and again, and useful for life lessons, just as they were originally intended when set into ancient Sanskrit before working their way into many other languages before La Fontaine."},{"Title":"Fishes of the Great Lakes region, (Cranbrook Institute of Science.

After reading it twice, I still don't know what they did, how they did it, or if they did anything at all. Did the author make real money? How much and when? Errors abound in this little tome. Some are trivial like the one about Alaric being a Goth (he was a Visigoth), the Swiss Franc is 140.6 to the dollar (impossible!), CoIogne Re is a reinsurer (it's Cologne Re) etc. Other errors are more serious especially the emphasis on value investing. Logic proves that value investing suffers from two errors: begging the question and vague definition. Which is more valuable? Philip Morris which is going nowhere or Microsoft? The text of this book runs only 69 pages and after that there is filler with previously published letters from Warren Buffet and others attached as Appendices 1,2 &amp; 3. Appendix 3 looks like an ad for Tweedy, Browne and its form of so called value investing. There are several pages of explanation of why Tweedy underperformed the market and the main reason seems to be that they bought and held the wrong stocks at the wrong time. They don't like technology because they don't understand it and, boy have they suffered for that ignorance. Too bad their holdings are in Swiss Francs and must have lost over 40% of their value because of the strength of the dollar. I could go on about the stale jokes, the misprints, the irritating repetitions, the lack of an index, but why bother? Some books were meant to be chewed and digested, some were meant to be tossed."},{"Title":"The Proof of the Pudding: (What Has Worked for Us) a Three-Way Approach to Successful Long-Term Investing (The Contrary Opinion Library)","review":"This is a well-written account of Herbert Hart's extensive experience in the world of investing and how it has worked for him. This is not a long book, one can finish it in one session. It is very readable, and very funny. Mr. Hart's sense of humor shines through almost every other sentence. He captures the attention of even the most easily bored reader.The book is also an excellent guideline for how to invest your money, even when you need to start small, as most of us do. I am sending it to my 23-year old son, and I hope he will follow Mr. Hart's wise counsel from the beginning, - including his tips on how to be frugal. As for me, I am going to revise my portfolio to follow Mr. Hart's system more closely. It has worked for him!"},{"Title":"Against the Musicians (Greek and Latin Music Theory)","review":"I found this book enjoyable for a few different reasons:First, it is a good source for an introduction to the ancient school of Skepticism in western philosophy. Greaves gives a helpful synopsis of the main figures of this school and their methods, especially Sextus Empiricus.Second, you don't have to know Greek! Of course the book includes the Greek text and references that would profit anyone wishing to read in the original.Third, the subject matter of music (what it is, its practice, effects on beings, etc.)I think is more interesting and accessable to the experience of the general reader, as opposed to drier topics Sextus wrote on (like grammer).Fouth, the detail of footnotes in the text would be invaluable to anyone wishing to dig into the study of ancient music.Fifth, one can read through the text in an evening or leisurely afternoon.This book would be enjoyed not only by readers of philosophy or classics, but I think musicians would enjoy going through its provocative arguments as a stimulus to clarify their own views on the nature of music."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"Excellent stuff!

I believe those guides are still a must if you travel in East Asia, India, China.Nevertheless 'Greek Islands' (2010 edition) is disappointing. Some examples:- We were unable to know where to go. The head description for each island looks like a copy of the Tourism Office leaflet. Everything is unparalleled. A guide that doesn't guide.- In a given island, we were often unable to know where to go. For instance, Kalymnos: how could we know that the best places were definitely Emporeios or Masouri ? After reading the guide, we regretfully spent 2 days in the capital city...- Accomodation: I am not sure I appreciate the tendency to regularly recommend double rooms at more than 50 euros. Who is this guide made for, knowing that even in August you can easily get a room with a kitchen for 30 euros (there are exceptions like Mykonos)? This guide does not talk to backpackers anymore. Probably because it was not written by backpackers.Tony Wheeler, come back !"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"This is a great guide book for a trip to the islands.

Try Acropolis House instead."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I usually find Lonely Planet guides very helpful but not this time. Our cruise stopped at seven ports in Greece and I had hoped to use this as a self-guide to avoid the exorbitant prices of the shipped-planned excursions. Three of our ports (Naplion, Gythion, Pylos) were not in the book at all or barely mentioned. In the book's defense, I will say that these towns were ports on the Peloponesian peninsula, not islands.

I referred to this book on our Greek Isle trip quite frequently and I was hardly ever disapointed. We took their advice and found the best food we've ever eaten in a little town on the island of Tinos. This restaurant grows their own vegetables, milks their own goats, and of course has the requisite cat or two hanging around. I have to say just finding that one restaurant was worth the price of the book. That said, I thought it could have been a little more detailed and included more out of the way type places.

As well, I found the Cadogan (Dana Facaros) Greek Islands guide, while not completely written for the backpacker to be more helpful, with all of the basic information needed, fantastic writing and a satisfactory Athens chapter.

(One would expect city guides to have, say, _more_ information, but sadly no.) The same is true for LP Greek Islands, which uses the same stock descriptions to talk about virtually every island, really giving very little sense of how the flavor and atmosphere is different in the different places, and with very few photos to give you a sense of what each island looks like. Ferry information is minimal but sufficient, but if you're looking for information on alternative lifestyles, look elsewhere. Even the section on Mykonos, a famous gay retreat, barely acknowledges it as such!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"We had two guidebooks with us on our three week trip to the Greek Islands in August 2004. We went to four different Islands, and Lonely Planet found us better food and accomidations at every stop.

I usually prefer Fodors, but I think it was out of date and needs a refresher!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"We love lonely planet guides, generally they are our travel bible. Where to stay, what to eat, and what to see these guides usually have it all. This particular guide however is clearly lacking in all aspects. This book fails to insight any sense of adventure, inspiration, creativity, emotion .... The description of each island fails to captivate ambiance of each locale. It was fairly clear to us after being on our trip for a short period that the writer chose the most obvious descriptions and recommendations readily accessible. Consistently restaurant choices were located at the center of the town directly beside each other right in front of the bus stop. Did the writer actually go to these island and try some the local cuisine? Or we're his arthritic limbs too weak to venture more than 30m from the bus stop? I don't understand how the author missed going to marjos or talking about the local cheese in andros. Personal taste and under 60 demographics aside, the book was also lacking in key features that other lonely planet guides possess such as useful maps, when to get a motor bike vs a mtv to get to remote beaches, and where to see awesome views or drinks. I think this book would been better titled as lonely old mans guide to collecting a paycheck. Try another guide book!!!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"It has been very helpful in planning my trip.

I do wish there were pull out maps all in one section so it would be easier to see where are the islands. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone planning a trip."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"Lack of information is the big feature of this guide. Where to eat and stay is the worst thing in this book. So if you think to choose a hotel or restaurant forget it! Choose another guide. Lack of criticism concerning sights and places to visit is another minus point. Lonely Planet guides are very narrative. Like Frommer\`s guides these guides should rate sights and places."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I took Lonely Planet Greek Islands and Greek Island Hopping on a recent trip to the Greek isles and Athens, and by the end of the trip I opened LP only for its eating recommendations (which are pretty sparse, but still better than Greek Island Hopping, which has none). I found LP to be inferior to GIH in virtually every respect. The information is not detailed enough to give a good picture of the islands and towns (making it hard to prioritize which islands to visit), the maps are frustrating in their lack of detail (not to mention that the number of maps is much less than in \\"Island Hopping\\"), the writing is uninspired, and it is overpriced for what you get (only $2 less than LP's full Greece guide!).It did have some good restaurant recommendations, for which I am appreciative (try Levantis if you're ever on Paros!) because it's easy to pay a lot for bad food in Greece. Yes, that's true everywhere, but I'd take issue with anyone who tried to argue that the quality-to-price ratio isn't much lower in Greece compared to places like Italy, France, or even next-door Turkey. Even with food, Lonely Planet still didn't have all that many recommendations and its descriptions on how to find the places were lacking (I don't know how many places were described as \\"just off the main street\\" or something like that). Given that many of the towns it describes do not have an accompanying map, that's a problem.LP has built its name on its usefulness to the independent budget traveler ... but its guides are often hit or miss for me. I'd put LP Greek Islands in the \\"miss\\" category: get \\"Greek Island Hopping\\" instead."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"Finally a guide built for travelling. Stitched and perfect-bound to endure many one-handed readings, drops and spills. Used this for a few Cycladian islands and Athens, on a mid-level budget and was as satisfied as can be. Great recommendations -- what to do and what is a waste of time (very helpful) and they seem to find a number of gems off the beaten path. I can't say enough about the maps which are included for every island and most towns. Every other guide seems to think that this is non-essential information, leaving you to hunt for a local map at your ports of call. Buy this ahead of planning the trip as their direction and suggestions may have a significant impact on your itinerary."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"Like its companion book (Lonely Planet Greece), this is an excellent guide (but just to the islands)! It is concise, reads very easily, and gives good common-sense recommendations on what to see and where to stay. It is as up-to-date as you can reasonably expect with changing prices and euro/dollar fluctuations. A very, very practical guide from the budget tourist to middle class. Excellent pictures, very good maps, a fine job! It reminds me, in a way, of the Michelin guides to Europe. Having said that, Lonely Planet Greece gives you basically the same information on the islands, plus mainland Greece, for just a few dollars more. So unless you are flying into Athens and going only to the islands, you are probably better off with the parent book.Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I own a LOT of Lonely Planet travel guides and have always been happy with the insider information they provide. This book, however, is lacking in MANY ways. First of all, there are hardly any photos. Secondly, it seems like the same island description has been pasted onto each island. It goes something like this, \\" This is one of the most beautiful islands....\\". Lastly, it falls way short in hotel listing. In Mykonos, for example, the book only list 3 hotels in budget, 3 in medium price range, and 3 deluxe hotels. You've got to be kidding! All that's listed as far as excursions in Mykonos is the number of a travel agent and a gay cruise. Sorry,..not interested...in either!! I want descriptions and suggestions. Did Lonely Planet really ever visit all of these islands? VERY disappointing!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I spent the entire summer of 2000 backpacking the Greek Isles. This book was an indispensable tool over the course of 15 different islands and Athens. Most of the travelers I encountered (a few Americans and loads of Aussies, Kiwis, Brits, Swedes, and more) had this exact book. The lodging details, maps, recommendations, and descriptions were very accurate- as accurate as you can be in a compact package such as this. I entered my journey relatively unprepared and this book was truly a lifesaver. I was living in Italy when I started and just \\"winged it\\" from there. With this LP Guide, I was able to be quite spontaneous and just look up details of upcoming islands as I needed. The other travelers I encountered who used this book were also universal in their praise. Any travel guide that can help me this much for 3 months is, I repeat, indispensable. Now do yourself a favor and don't do what the typical American traveler does which is i)staying just a day on each island, ii)only seeing Athens, Santorini and Mykonos, and iii)trying too hard to cram 10 European destinations into 10 days. Take some time off and appreciate the cultures! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I used this book for Crete and Santorini and it just didn't get the job done. Fortunately, I had Let's Go Greece 2005 with me as well. It had much more accurate and useful information, at least for the the two aformentioned islands.LP Greek Islands is useful for keeping your Athens cafe table from wobbling, though. So, it has that going for it."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I really felt like this book should get just three stars, but compared to most other travel guides about the Greek Islands it is definitely one of the best ones. However, I was disappointed that it lacks the kind of detail and good street maps that many other Lonely Planet guides offer. There must be something about the Lonely Planet guides for Greece because the one for Crete is really substandard. And since this book contains the same kind of information about Crete but in a condensed format, it means you really get short-changed on that island. Like I said, this is definitely one of the better guides about the Greek Islands, but I have to say I think the Eyewitness Travel Guide for the Greek Islands edges it out slightly. I should point out that I do not typically use travel books to find hotels and restaurants because those subjects always leave out tons of other options and are often outdated. I find the web more useful instead. This book does include a lot of that information, which I essentially ignored. If you like that kind of information in a book then you might prefer this one over the Eyewitness Travel Guide."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"Amongst books for budget travellers going independently to the smaller islands its two competitors are &quot;Greek Islands, the Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;Greek Island Hopping&quot;. They're all good. Of course if you're going on a cruise to Mykonos, Delos, Santorini and Rhodes you don't need these books and you'd be as well off with Frommer, Fodor or Eyewitness. It doesn't have as much detail as Greek Island Hopping (my favorite for taking with me, now that Grock's Candid Guides are out of print)but unlike that book it covers the whole of Crete. Some stuff is obviously lifted from the same authors' book on Mainland Greece. For example there's a page on the Greek railroad system which is not going to help you much on the islands."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"I have been hopping in Greek islands 3 times now and I have had plenty of guide books with me.

While using this book in Greece I had the nagging suspicion I must have bought one of those books.For example, the book reviews several beaches on Patmos but doesn't mention a single hotel around Grikos Beach, even though there are at least half a dozen places to stay. Also, I'd expect a book to do more than just list the beaches on an island--but to let us know which ones are crowded, which are nearly inaccessible, and which beaches are hidden \\"gems\\". The books gives no such information, leaving you to waste time finding it all out yourself.Also, the book doesn't indicate which beaches can be walked to and which require your own wheels or some other form of transport.The book's information regarding ferries and connections was completely inadequate, making it impossible for us to plan a ferry trip before reaching the place we planned to leave from.Finally--don't bother with this book if you already have LP Greece. The islands book is just a shorter version of Greece w/o the mainland--literally word-for-word."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Greek Islands","review":"This was my first of many 'Lonely Planet' trips. The Athens hotel reccomendation (our first stop) turned out to be a small place with a lovely breakfast served on the communal 4th floor balcony filled with tropical plants and overlooking the Acropolis.

The time setting of this book is 90 later as page 51 states: \\"This is not the nineteenth century, the day of the rustler and gun-fighter; this was the day of satellites and moon voyages.\\"This book has Louis straddling both the 19th and 20th centuries, with the hero, Dan Sheridan, living out his life a few years after the Korean conflict. Part of the experience and knowledge from that armed conflict will help him and another man with whom he served in Korea face the people now trying to kill both of them. Since Louis taught survival courses during his years in the Army, much of that survival training is embedded in this story taking place in the Verde River Valley, Yavapai County, Arizona. This is an area laying just east of Phoenix, Arizona.The narrative continually swings back and forth from the present to the year 1872 when two men, Clyde and John Toomey, met their murderous ends. Decendents of the people who bushwhacked the Toomeys now without deed live on the land they stole from the Toomeys. In the process of writing his book, author Dan Sheridan seeks not only to save several lives in this outdoor adventure, but also seeks justice for the 27 men killed 90 years previous, by seeing the rightful heirs get their property back.Within this story a Bisley colt has part of a diary in the barrel of the gun, and this helps get Dan Sheridan's interest, plus it gives him information about the Toomeys. This is interesting to me too, for in a 1937 William Colt MacDonald story published in Western Story Magazine (3/6/37), entitled \\"Skelton Gold\\", a Texas wrangler buys an old .45 in Paso City with a map to hidden treasure in the barrel. Is this only a coincidence?

As he proceeds he finds that the account deals with events that, while seemingly forgotten and settled history, have spilled over into the present with frightening consequences.Louis L'Amour's THE BROKEN GUN is a sensational read that reminds us that, in the West, some things change while others remain alarmingly the same.THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"The Broken Gun","review":"this is the first L.L. book i had read now ive read about 3/4 of them and im only 11 he is a great author"},{"Title":"The Broken Gun","review":"This 1966 novel is unusual ,but not unique ,in L'Amour's work in having a then contemporary setting .Its hero is Jim Sheridan a Western novelist ,a veteran of both Korea and Vietnam,who discovers then eponymous gun and more importantly a portion of a diary concealed inside it.The diary dates fromthe 1870's and is partial account of a trail drive from Texas to Arizona .At the end of the drive the cattle owners,John and Clyde Toomey, had simply vanished along with 27 men and 4000 head of cattle.Sheridan has always been fascinated by the Toomey case and sets out for Arizona to do further research in the hope of turning it into a novel.He makes no secret of his intention to do so.A man named Manuel Alvarez sends Jim a note saying he has information that might help but is murdered before he can pass this on.Not only that but one of his brothers has died in mysterious circumstances and Pio his other brother,a skilled guerilla fighter ,has gone into hiding .Also involved is a powerful local rancher Colin Wells who is keen to get his hands on the diary to prevent the exposure of a family scandal and who does not scruple to try to kill Jim when he cannot buy him off.Jim and Pio join forces against Wlls and his henchmen.The book is in essence a traditional Western with a land dispute plot that has served in several genre titles but L'Amour has tried to give it a contemporary twist which does not quite cut it for my taste .The women -Wells' calculating wife Doris and his neighbour whose land he covets,Belle,are particularly sketchilly done .Its a tad Rambo-ish in places when Jim and Pio display their militarily honed fighting skillsThe book is a solid read but the auithor was at his best when at his most ;raditional in Western settings and eras This is not his best but a reasonable quick read for action lovers all the same"},{"Title":"The Broken Gun","review":"1st of L.L'amour's book I ever read in th 1980's.

His description of the assault on the 4 minute mile barrier is fascinating but also memorable are his recollections of the Helsinki Olympics (where Bannister failed to achieve a medal), and his success at the Commonwealth Games where the only two sub-4 minute milers met face to face for the first time.It's now about 40 years since I first read the book and I was very pleased it was republished in a commemorative edition.Reading the book again was a joy. The book went very quickly and had most of the excitement of when I first read it. It was not surprising tha the prose and impressions seemed less mature than when I first read them, but that was to be expected as Bannister wrote the book when he was in his twenties.I was disappointed that the pictures were not the same as the original edition, with perhaps too many pictures of Bannister in later years. The original pictures of the Helsinki Olympics and other competitions were an integral part of the book and it's a shame that they were missing.Bannisters achievement in breaking the Four Minute Mile was a milestone (pardon the pun), as was the fact that he did it as an amateur and while he was in the middle of his medical studies. In my opinion his book is also a great achievement and is certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"Roger Bannister sets about telling the story of his historic record 4 minute mile but in the process he reveals that there is more to life than just running.

It could just be his British demeanor, but I found narrative rather enjoying."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"Bannister not only was the greatest runner of his time, he also was a incredibly thinking and balanced man.

Bannister writes very well and I am happy to say that I too am a runner...I could only imagine the struggle he went through to break that barrier.Every distance runner should read this book for motivation."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"A must read for any athletics enthusiast. Deep and meaningful analysis of training for a true champion of his day."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"It is amazing how vivid it all came back to me, since I was about 8 years old and the name Bannister became passed around. What is exceptional about this account, is how chosen pivotal athletes seem to be in their respective sports, so that when we read their stories there is much to be mined. After reading this offhand, medical student's on-the-run account of those heady days, I am even more convinced how special he was to the sport and the discipline of life. Like Ray Berry, Johnny Unitas's wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts in the late fifties, Bannister possessed an incredible self-awareness and keen analytical skills that pre-date the modern athlete. Outsiders only see the athlete, but inside is the scientific mind at work, attempting the impossible feat of cheating nature and man's limitations. It was apparent to this reader early on, that Roger Bannister was about to make larger contributions in the medical field as well. It was also gleaned how foolhardy Steve Prefontaine was in his training habits by letting his heart run free; Bannister explains how the body had to be trained for higher performance, not just willed. Bannister's philosophy about running appears clinical, serving notice to all, that the pathway to a widened life is unrestricted if one leads an examined life."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"May 6, 1954: 3,000 spectators, a number of competitors, one runner with a historic goal.On that afternoon, Sir Roger Bannister broke through a mythical barrier, running one mile under four minutes. It was accomplished during a meet between British AAA and Oxford University at Iffley Road Track in Oxford.This 1955 autobiography is more than a chronicle of his chase for immortality; it is an exploration into disappointment on the international stage - he did not medal in the 1500m in the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games - self-sacrifice and the balancing of a number of goals on a variety of tracks in life.While runners will never tire of the story of this challenge within the mind and body, those who have never laced up a pair of racing spikes can appreciate a spirit of motivation that can be applied in all facets of the daily grind.\\"The man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win,\\" says Bannister. And those words resonate on the drive to any finish line."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"Short read, perfect for the summer vacation on the beach. A really talented man, amazing what he accomplished considering some of his training ( smoking and hung over collegiate). The book is very literate, and illustrates a personal side of an accomplished doctor."},{"Title":"The Four Minute Mile","review":"A great story about a great runner! You keep reading only wishing that he had put more about his career. It reads really slow and much of the book could be skipped over. I recommend the book if you are looking for a background of Bannister starting from birth. I was looking for something about his running."},{"Title":"The Victorian Home in America: With Over 250 Illustrations","review":"15 years before this book appeared, the author, born in Austria but converted to a love of Victorian architecture upon his arrival in the US, produced &quot;The Gingerbread Age,&quot; the first popular volume that dared to express admiration for a period in building then considered the nadir of the art. In his Foreword to this work he talks of the &quot;torrent of fan mail&quot; that followed. It's not saying too much to maintain that his work was responsible for the eventual revival in Victorian architecture which began with the hippies creating Painted Ladies in '70's San Francisco and swept the nation in the mid-'80's. Having established the true quality of post-Greek-Revival, pre-World-War-I houses, he turns here to a deeper analysis and description of the different major styles--Gothic, Italianate, octagons, Mansards, Queen Anne, Richardson Romanesque. Lavishly illustrated with bw photographs, floor plans, and reproductions of period pictures, its text written in everyday language with little specialized jargon, and provided with a large appendix listing where to view existing Victorians and a sound list of books to go on to, the book concentrates chiefly on exteriors, though some views of notable rooms are included. If you're looking for good basic overviews of domestic building of the era, Maass's two books are indispensable to your collection. As a social historian, I consult them often."},{"Title":"The Victorian Home in America: With Over 250 Illustrations","review":"Over two hundred black and white illustrations blends an architectural survey with a history of Victorian times from 1840-1900, examining the many styles of town and country homes of the times and describing both interiors and exteriors.

When someone loses a child this book speaks lovingly and with great sensitivity to the pain of such loss. I recommend it for helpful perspective about the pain of loss, which is not entirely removed by knowing that God is truly in control at all times.

A vivid picture of plantation life, guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Plantation","review":"I honestly don't know where to begin with reviewing this book. This is the third book within the past year that has left me speechless. This book has worked its way onto my all time favorites list which includes The Help and Kindred. I have never heard of Fern Smith-brown and I don't remember how I came across this book but I'm so glad that I did! The story was absolutely amazing. I didn't want the story to end. I fell in love with the characters and felt like I personally knew them because they were written so well. The author did an excellent job with the scenery and dialogue between characters. She stayed true to the vernacular of the times. I actually felt like I was transported back into time and lived among these people. The author stayed true to everything that happened during the Civil War error. She even incorporated some of the events that happened. Harriet Tubman even made an appearance in the story. The book is only 219 pages long but with the way the story was written, the author was able to keep the story moving along at a steady pace and wrapped everything up nicely in the end. I normally don't like books that contain reincarnation mixed into the plot but this story was so well written that I hardly even noticed it!I loved these characters so much that I actually felt a sense of loss and sadness when the story came to an end. There were parts in the story where I laughed out loud and there were moments when i wanted to cry. All of her characters had a profound effect on me. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it will reveal too much of the story and I want you, the potential reader to experience the wide range of emotions that i felt while reading it.There was only one event where I experienced a negative response and that was when one of the main characters had died. The character's sister didn't attend the funeral. That was totally unexpected for me. The character's sister was completely dropped from the story after the their father had died earlier in the story. You never hear from the sister again. I highly recommend this book. I wish I could give this book more than five stars!"},{"Title":"It Seems Like Only Yesterday: Mining and Mapping in Arizona's First Century Vol 1: The Yuma Years","review":"A biography always has a way of including many other local histories, events and names.

Not only are &quot;all the usual suspects&quot; covered (Derrida, Foucault, Kuhn Habermas, etc.), but they are covered by the leading commentators in the philosophical world (Barnes on Kuhn, Giddens on Habermas, Philp on Foucault). Most remarkably, however, the essays are well written, clear, and comprehensive. The book has become a staple on my syllabi."},{"Title":"Return Grand Theory Hn Se","review":"Quentin Skinner has done an admirable job bringing together the nine authorities whose essays comprise this little collection. Giddens, Barnes, Hoy et al. all work hard to condense the difficult material they are discussing into 15-20 pages chunks digestable by the modern college student.Not to be overlooked is Skinner's introduction. Wide ranging and thoughtful, it corrals the great panorama of twentieth century philosophical thought into 20 pages. He reviews the life and death of \\"Grand Theory,\\" its momentary eclipse by the \\"Empirical Theorists\\" of the early to mid-twentieth century and then the rebirth catalogued in the present volume.Skinner defines \\"grand theory\\" as \\"abstract and normative theories of human nature and conduct\\" on page 1 of his introduction. It could be argued that some of the theorists included in the volume do not really conform to this definition and, indeed, the essay on Foucault does little to link him to grand theory. This is a minor criticism, however, and detracts little from the value of the overarching unity Skinner imposes on the collected theorists. Lastly, though published more than twenty years ago now, the copious reference to (then) less well-established scholars such as Rorty, Kristeva and others keep the volume quite up to date.Overall, a valuable contribution."},{"Title":"Seeing the Wider Picture","review":"We are in the time of the 'New age'.

The author slides Leia Graham from modern Westmister, Maryland to the same town during the era of the American Civil War. Using the magic of a costume prepared for a modern Gettysburg reenactment, the author slides Leia through a kind of reverse Underground Railroad in the basement of the home she is visiting. Confused and out of her time period, Leia passes herself off as a widow recently arrived from Baltimore. Rather than restate the plot, let me tell you what is outstanding about this book. First is author's creation of Leia herself, who manages to convince those in the past that she belongs by using her own ingenuity and her knowledge of the Civil War Time period. The author not only develops an outstanding love relationship between Leah and Brant, but she develops a solid relationship of respect between Leia and the non-slave African-American maid, Hettie. This is a more mature relationship than between Scarlett and Mammie in *Gone with the Wind* because Ms. Bayne's characters are more rational, perhaps even more intelligent. I like the way other characters handle Leia accidental use of modern terms like &quot;ego&quot; and &quot;flashlight.&quot; Leah tries to cover-up gracefully, but Brant is amused. The author handles a number of time and character point-of-view shifts so smoothly that one hardly notices the change. The book is filled with twists in the past and turns in the present, yet Ms. Bayne maintains an emotional intensity and she keeps the story rolling in both time periods. Like most good writers, Ms. Bayne handles the male and female points of view with equal dexterity. The lovemaking is handled tastefully at a G or PG-13 level, but there is no doubt about what is going on. This is an outstanding time-travel romance, by an author who should soon be discovered by a large public."},{"Title":"The Will of Time","review":"Robin Bayne takes her readers onto the other side of history to show that time, itself, can be fickle!

And when we seek health care guidance and advice, we want to be certain that that advise is from an expert source and someone we can count on for delivering sound recommendations.Dr. Louis Sportelli has captured the essence of a leading non-invasive, non-drug health profession, reducing a complicated and oft misunderstood care paradigm to a simple to understand writing on the benefits of chiropractic care. As we explore new directions in health care, especially us baby-boomers, we are all looking for a solution to our aches and pains, effective diet, nutrition and excerise regimens and a true understanding of the reasons for our changing physiologic function.

There's more practical and useful information in this book's 50 easy reading pages about common sense health care than I've read anywhere.If you've read or heard contrary information about the benefits or usefulness of chiropractic care, this book should put any of those concerns to rest.

No Mercy does exactly that. It traces the spider web of think tanks, endowments, and conservative politics from group to group. The authors provide an excellent path from the eugenics and racist Pioneer fund in the early '30s and how it, and other groups, intermingle. The details on the ultrasecret Council on Foriegn Policy, the Landmark legal foundation, and many, many others.In fairness to the reader, this book is not a light read. The story is not fluid. It's a book for the serious political researcher, journalist, or political scientist."},{"Title":"No Mercy: How Conservative Think Tanks and Foundations Changed America's Social Agenda","review":"This book was helpful in seeing how conservative institutions have influenced numerous issues, but it did have several flaws. I would recommend it, as there are few books on the topic, and due to the quality of the research, but with these disclaimers:1. The authors come from a decidedly left-of-center perspective, which tilts how they view the world. Hence a moderate group may be described as a mildly conservative one. This is not a major flaw obviously. 2. Much of the material is rather dry, as in most real research. This isn't pleasure reading, and shouldn't be bought as such. 3. Satire is used way too much in title headings - it's not as bad as in some books, but pretty blatant, and it distracts from the quality of the work. 4. The opinion that liberals and others on the left should be an equal part of the debate so that we get a balanced picture is good, but the idea that those groups should rely more on think tanks and foundations is silly. The book's major point that I got is how those vehicles remove thought from the process in favor of ideology, and encourage close-mindedness. If liberals copy think tank stratagems, it's their loss. I personally would hope all ideologies abandon these inherently systems.Anyhow, I'd recommend buying this or borrowing it from the library, but with these reservations and the caveat that you shouldn't expect too much."},{"Title":"No Mercy: How Conservative Think Tanks and Foundations Changed America's Social Agenda","review":"This book is primarily interesting as insight into the mindset of the radical left. Having largely failed in a contest of ideas, many on the collectivist end of the political spectrum have been groping for a palatable reason to explain their waning influence. This book provides the comforting fiction that the far left's failure does not result from internal problems ut rather from an evil cabal of right wing think tanks. The book is an excercise in self-deception that is at points fascinating. It lays out a simplistic worldview where ideological opponents are motivated by money, not conviction. Framed this way, the left can continue to blame its troubles on others while avoiding serious introspection.Unfortunately, the authors play fast and loose with the facts. Funding data is exaggerated and not placed in context. In addition, the common sense thesis that people tend to fund causes with which they agree -- rather than think tank researchers being willing to say anything for cash -- is never really considered. In short, this book is a fairly clumsy attempt to dehumanize the right while ignoring bias in the authors' own idological home. It may make those on the left feel good, but it won't contribute to your understanding of what makes the opposition tick."},{"Title":"BAGATORIALS: A Book Full of Bags","review":"About 6-7 years ago, I picked this book on a whim at the local college bookstore.

That they were printed on the stores bags make it all the greater. If only all stores challenged us with ideas like this."},{"Title":"Maimonides,: A biography","review":"Solomon Zeitlin (born in 1886 or 1892 and died in 1976) was one of the great Jewish historians of the twentieth century. He was the professor of rabbinic studies at Dropsie College in Philadelphia, PA. He was a very ingenious innovative thinker, although he was not always correct. He felt, for example, that the Dead Sea Scrolls were documents composed in the Middle Ages, but virtually all other scholars recognized that the Dead Sea Scrolls were written or collected by the reclusive somewhat mystically-minded Essenes who ceased to exist around 70 CE.People would, therefore, turn to his book on the greatest Jewish philosopher Maimonides (1138-1204) to seek an innovative approach, a new insight. However, if this is what people expect to find, they will be disappointed. Fairness requires one to point out that Zeitlin wrote his biography in 1935 when there were very few Maimonidean studies.What did Zeitlin say about Maimonides?Maimonides' Life\\"Maimonides,\\" Zeitlin wrote, \\"was a thorough aristocrat not by reason of wealth or birth but by virtue of learning and intellect. He regarded scholarship as the acme of human attainment,\\" and by \\"human\\" he included non-Jews. He \\"was essentially a rationalist. He placed reason above all faculties. He regarded superstition as a species of idolatry.\\"Thus, for example, the current practice when reading the Torah in the synagogue, is to call up a kohen, a descendant of Aaron, for the first honor, even if the individual is a fool. Maimonides objected to this practice. He insisted that a scholar should be given the privilege even if he is not a kohen. Yet, Maimonides felt that scholars and rabbis should not be paid for their work. Study and rabbinical work are human duties and people should not be paid for doing what is right. Scholars and rabbis should engage in other gainful employment no matter how humble. Needless to say, the rabbis rejected both of these ideas.Most scholars have no idea why Maimonides' family went from Spain, where Maimonides was born, to Morocco. They left Spain when Maimonides was a youngster because of the persecutions initiated against Jews in Spain. But, the trip to Morocco is puzzling because the Moslems in Morocco persecuted the Jews just as they were persecuted in Spain. Zeitlin explains that the family traveled to Morocco because that country had scholars and academies in medicine and mathematics that could help quench Maimonides thirst for knowledge.Zeitlin takes a middle path in the controversy whether Maimonides and his family declared themselves to be Moslems in Morocco to escape being killed while observing Jewish commands in secret. Some scholars say they made a declaration; others deny it. There is no clear proof either way. Zeitlin contends that Maimonides only disguised himself as a Moslem whenever he went out of his house, but never made any declaration. All he had to do was wear a turban and speak Arabic. This, says Zeitlin, solves the problem why the rabbis, who so viciously attacked Maimonides in his later life for his rational ideas and sought ways to defame him, never mentioned that he had once converted to the Moslem faith.Yet, Zeitlin recognized that Maimonides set forth a new philosophy of Judaism that is applicable in times of forced apostasy: Jews may utter words accepting another religion to save their lives, as long as they do not transgress Jewish law.Zeitlin notes that there was a dispute between Maimonides and Samuel ben Ali, the head of the academy in Babylonia who felt that he was the religious leader of world-wide Jewry. Most historians are convinced that the basis of the dispute was that Samuel disagreed with some of Maimonides rational teachings. However, Zeitlin contends that \\"the underlying reason for the dispute was that Maimonides stressed his national point of view, namely that the supreme leadership over the Jews should be vested in the Exilarch (the secular leader of Babylonian Jewry) and not in the Religious Head of the Academy.\\" Zeitlin compliments Maimonides: \\"In this Maimonides proved himself a pioneer of Jewish nationalism.\\" It seems clear that if Zeitlin were alive today, he would reject the view of many right-wing people in Israel that the government should be run, as in Iran, by religious leaders. He would probably also insist that there should be no religious party in the Israeli cabinet.Maimonides' philosophyIt must be recognized that Zeitlin did not seem to know that Maimonides wrote his books and letters for two audiences. Zeitlin may have known that many scholars, but not all, advocate this understanding of Maimonides' writings, but he wrote this biography as if he did not know of it.Maimonides knew that virtually all the people of his generation would be unable to understand and accept his rational understanding of God and the universe. He also understood that he must not force his views upon people who cannot accept them. Thus, for example, when he wrote a letter to the Jews in Yemen to console them about the hardships they were suffering under an intolerant government, he told them that there was a tradition in his family that prophecy would be resumed shortly, and since the resumption of prophecy would come just before the advent of the messiah, and the messiah will bring peace to Yemen, the Yemenite Jews should bear their trials because they will be over soon. He said all of this even though he did not believe it.Zeitlin did not know this. And as a result, he was convinced that Maimonides believed that the messiah was coming soon and, therefore, Zeitlin takes the position that Maimonides felt that he should create a constitution for the soon to be reestablished Jewish state. Thus, Zeitlin contends that: \\"In this book I have endeavored to show that Maimonides was a nationalist.... In expectation of the Jews (returning) to Palestine, he drafted the Mishneh Torah, as a Constitution.\\"People criticized Maimonides for not including sources and differing opinions in his Mishneh Torah. Zeitlin writes: \\"Since a constitution does not give the names of authorities, he did not mention the names of individual scholars.\\" Needless to say, if Zeitlin is wrong and Mishneh Torah is not a constitution, but a collection of the Torah commandments as the rabbis understood them, a code book is also not a legislative history containing discussions of various opinions.Zeitlin curiously felt that \\"Maimonides met opposition (from some rabbis) not because of his philosophical views, for similar opinions had been expressed before him by other thinkers. The issue against him rested upon his reason for the (Torah) precepts (that he explained in the third volume of his Guide of the Perplexed).\\" This seems unlikely. First, the explanations of the biblical commands were based on his philosophical beliefs and did not stand alone. Thus any attack against them was an attack on his philosophy. Second, while other philosopher, such as Abraham ibn Ezra articulated a worldview in his Bible commentaries that resembled the philosophy of Maimonides, ibn Ezra did not write a book on philosophy and did not make a significant impression upon the general population as Maimonides did; therefore there was no need to attack him.Some specific pointsThe thirteen principles of JudaismZeitlin accepted the notion that Maimonides believed all of the thirteen principles that he wrote, even though other scholars insist that he wrote them for the general population of Jews, but did not accept them all himself.ProphecySome scholars are convinced that Maimonides understood that prophecy is a higher level of intelligence, an understanding that any person can attain, no matter whether the person was a Jew or non-Jew. Zeitlin disagreed. He understood Maimonides to say that prophecy is a special gift. \\"The mere possession of (intellectual) abilities does not make one eligible unless God bestowed upon him the gift of prophecy.\\"The soul and the world to comeZeitlin describes Maimonides concept of olam haba, generally translated \\"the world to come,\\" even though Maimonides most likely understood it as \\"time to come,\\" as a time when the human's \\"soul\\" contemplates God, just as the angels do. This is a problematic statement. Maimonides defined \\"soul\\" as five parts of the physical body, such as the digestive system, and included thinking. Thus, Maimonides spoke of the human's thought living after death, not the \\"soul.\\" Second, Maimonides defined \\"angels\\" as everything that does God's will, including rain and winds. Thus, it is doubtful that Maimonides would think that angels spend time contemplating God.This idea that only the soul survives death, according to Zeitlin, was Maimonides' original view. However, he later changed his mind and said in his thirteen principles that he believed in the resurrection of the body and soul. Zeitlin came to this conclusion because, as previously stated, he did not know that Maimonides wrote some things, including the thirteen principles, for the general unthinking population.MessiahZeitlin recognized that Maimonides did not think that the messiah is a supernatural being.Mishneh TorahMaimonides wrote in the introduction to his code of law, Mishneh Torah, what Zeitlin called the \\"Constitution,\\" that he composed this work so that Jews will not have to search in the Talmud (also called, Gemara) for the law. Many scholars of his own day and today are convinced that Maimonides was saying that Jews no longer need to use or study the Talmud since they now have his book, Zeitlin argued that: \\"From all that we see...he did not want to dispense with the Gemara.\\"Maimonides decided many laws contrary to the spiritual leaders of Babylon who preceded him, the Gaonim. Zeitlin writes that Maimonides made his decisions because \\"he appealed to a common sense of justice.\\"SacrificesZeitlin recognized that Maimonides knew that \\"Sacrifices were permitted the Jews as a compromise,\\" an idea that excites and disturbs many Jews. He understood that Maimonides \\"admitted that sin could not be removed from a person and transferred to an animal (during a sacrifice).\\" The sin offering sacrifices \\"were of a symbolic character to impress man and induce him to repent.\\"How to read the TorahZeitlin points out what Saadiah Gaon, Abraham ibn Ezra and others said before him: \\"If science and reason contradict the words of the Torah, such words were to be allegorically explained but were not to be dismissed, for they are divine.\\" By this, Zeitlin probably meant that Jews may interpret Scripture but they may not abandon halakhah.Reason for the biblical commandsSignificantly, contrary to the notion of some mystics such as Nachmanides, Zeitlin writes: \\"The keynote of Maimonides' interpretation of the precepts was that they were for the benefit of the people themselves rather than for some advantage to God.\\" Maimonides summarized the purposes of the Torah commandments as three advantages: they communicate true ideas, they aid people in improving themselves, and they help better society.SummaryThere is no writer on Maimonides whom everyone agrees is correct; there are simply too many different views as to what the master meant. Zeitlin offered no radical interpretations of Maimonides, although he may have been the first to suggest that Maimonides wrote his Mishneh Torah as a constitution for a resurrected state in Israel within a short period of time. His idea that Maimonides never converted to Islam, but only wore Moslem clothing and spoke Arabic and only appeared to be a Moslem, may also have originated with him.Zeitlin' s failure to recognize that Maimonides wrote some items as \\"necessary truths\\" for the general population who needed to believe in such things - such as the imminent arrival of a messiah and that the body and soul will be resurrected - led him to many conclusions that other scholars dismiss. These include his principal notion that Maimonides wrote his Mishneh Torah for the immanent new state, his view on prophecy and what Maimonides actually believed in his thirteen principles."},{"Title":"Study Guide to Microbiology: An Introduction","review":"This is not the textbook.

After 1835, William Walker, its compiler, signed his name &quot;William Walker, ASH&quot;-- that is, Author of Southern Harmony. He was rightly proud of his achievement. The book includes the best of early-nineteenth-century American hymns, including many written by Walker himself. It was an influential source for many subsequent hymnals.Southern Harmony is a shape-note hymnal, in which different notes have different shapes, enabling easy transposition between keys. The sopranos sing descants; the melodies are in the tenor voice.And what melodies! The tunes (and lyrics) of this book will stun you with their plain-spoken power and beauty. Some (Amazing Grace, Rock of Ages) are familiar; some (Resignation --&quot;My Shepherd Will Supply My Need&quot;-- and Wondrous Love) are becoming better known; others have been arranged by contemporary musicians such as Alice Parker and Mack Wilberg. Many dozens of others are gems waiting to be mined.The melodies in this book tend to display their Gaelic origins. Most are based on a pentatonic scale. Many are in minor keys, and many more are modal (especially Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian). Harmonies are primitive but forceful.This is an important part of our musical heritage. Anyone interested in church music will find Southern Harmony an inspiring collection that amply rewards hours of study."},{"Title":"The Southern harmony and musical companion: Containing a choice collection of tunes, hymns, psalms, odes, and anthems : selected from the most eminent ... of music, and plain rules for beginners","review":"Sadly the print is dim and hard to read.

Roger Lonsdale has been very thorough in collecting and in many cases often recovering works that have been lost to publishing for decades. I used this anthology for a particular purpose (researching 18th-century women poets of the laboring class) and was gratified to discover not only more poems by Mary Leapor and Ann Yearsley than I have found elsewhere, but also a number of amazing poets whose work I have never before encountered: Elizabeth Hands and Janet Little among them.If you read this book for no reason other than curiosity, you too will find satisfaction: the poems in this anthology were not chosen merely for the sake of inclusivity; they are brilliant, funny, honest, tragic, witty, philosophical, gentle, and sharp. You will find scissor-like pairs of couplets and blank verse as high and stately as Milton's. There is a great deal of poetic originality, and a great deal of the neoclassicism that was almost the currency of the period's poetry--often, however, used in an unexpected way one would never think to find in one of the canonized male poets of the century.These poems are so far from being the dregs of 18th-century literature that my only serious complaint about the anthology is that it is too short. A number of important poems, for instance Mary Collier's \\"The Woman's Labour\\" and Mary Leapor's \\"Crumble-Hall,\\" have been abridged, very regrettably as they are well worth reading in full.The mainly biographical introductions to each poet are satisfactorily lengthy (when one considers how little information is readily availble about many of the more obscure writers) and, I feel, make up for the lack of annotation to the poems themselves, an addition which would have made the book much longer and surely far pricier.I'll leave you with two quotations from poems in the anthology. First, from Elizabeth Hands (a servant and later a blacksmith's wife), part of her 1789 \\"Poem, on the Supposition of an Advertisement appearing in a Morning Paper, of the Publication of a Volume of Poems, by a Servant-Maid\\":The tea-kettle bubbled, the tea things were set,The candles were lighted, the ladies were met;The how d'ye's were over, and entering bustle,The company seated, and silks ceased to rustle:The great Mrs. Consequence opened her fan,And thus the discourse in an instant began(All affected reserve and formality scorning):'I suppose you all saw in the paper this morningA volume of Poems advertised---'tis saidThey're produced by the pen of a poor servant-maid.''A servant write verses!' says Madam Du Bloom:'Pray what is the subject---a Mop, or a Broom?''He, he, he,' says Miss Flounce: 'I suppose we shall seeAn Ode on a Dishclout---what else can it be?'...And secondly, from Sarah Egerton, the unhappily married daughter of a landowner, part of her 1703 poem \\"To One who said I must not Love\\":Bid the fond mother spill her infant's blood,The hungry epicure not think of food;Bid the Antarctic touch the Arctic pole:When these obey, I'll force love from my soul.As light and heat compose the genial sun,So love and I essentially are one:Ere your advice, a thousand ways I triedTo ease the inherent pain, but 'twas denied,Though I resolved, and grieved, and almost died....Wearied at last, cursed Hymen's aid I chose,But find the fettered soul has no repose.Now I'm a double slave to love and vows:...Distorted Nature shakes at the control,With strong convulsions rends my struggling soul;Each vital string cracks with th' unequal strife,Departing love racks like departing life;Yet there the sorrow ceases with the breath,But love each day renews th' torturing scene of death."},{"Title":"Eighteenth Century Women Poets: An Oxford Anthology","review":"I was missing someone special very much when I ordered this marathon of poetry by women, quite sure I would find within its 556 pages the dulcet tones and winnowing words of love poems to feed my soul!How wrong I was!As Claire Tomalin, reviewer for the &quot;Independent&quot; summed up:&quot;..Lonsdale has resurrected more than a hundred witty women and set them glistening and pulsing with life and spirits before us..&quot;The 323 Poems are arranged chronologically, each with a biography of its author, and appear to have been be selected for their political and social comment, and for their &quot;cleverness&quot; rather than for the lovesick sentiments I had anticipated...In fact , one at least &quot;The Gentleman's Study,in Answer to(Swift's) The Lady's Dressing Room &quot;, is startingly horrible, reminding us that these were earthy, somewhat bawdy times,with a use of imagery so repulsive that I was quite nauseated, as the background notes duly advise us:&quot;..The Gentleman's study is not recommended to readers of a nervous disposition. Laetitia Pilkington states that her mother , &quot;upon reading the Lady's Dressing Room, instantly threw up her dinner' and the following rejoinder might well have the same effect.&quot;The majority of the writers are leisured class and titled ladies, with much irony of the Jane Austen style in evidence, as the exaqmine the popular male opinions of lady poets, or middle and upper class reaction to servants turning their hand to poesy..housemaids writing poetry? What next?And there are rebellious poems and humble poems; poems that decry woman's lot in life, and poems that claim contentment, poems on the love of children, and mourning the loss of children, poems about marriage, and widowhood, and poems about the single life...I suppose it must be said that the style of many of the poems is dated, though there is some blank verse in the collection, and some appear too deliberate, too artfully contrived for our modern approach. And if you would look for romantic poetry of the wistful, lovesick kind, this is NOT the anthology for you!But if you are a searcher for the soul of woman through the ages, if you would look for the brainpower and wit of women, and if you are a student of feminism, this would be a worthwhile addition to your reference shelf.As &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; summed up:&quot;....sparkling collection of more than 100 witty women...&quot;"},{"Title":"Eighteenth Century Women Poets: An Oxford Anthology","review":"I got this book for a class on 18th century women writers, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoy it.

The story itself is a step down from the adventure that is The Gods of Mars and fails to come close to the excellence of A Princess of Mars. That being said, this is still a fun story.Burroughs concludes his trilogy with a chase across Mars. The story picks up 6 months after The Gods of Mars. John Carter follows the kidnappers of his wife across river, desert, jungle, fortress and ice. The story itself is, as with all the Martian Trilogy, quite entertaining. However, this book cuts almost all the human interaction out that made the first two books the classics they are.I have read this book some ten times, and I still enjoy it. As I've grown older I have discovered many Sci Fi authors and stories, but none that enrapture my imagination like the original Martian Trilogy by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This is a must read for anyone who enjoyed the first two books, as it actually has a final conclusion."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs did not intended to write a trilogy, but his 1914 pulp novel &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; completes the story begun in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and continued in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and finally brings John Carter and his beloved Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium (i.e., no cliffhanger this time around, boys and girls). The story picks up six months after the conclusion of &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; with our hero not knowing whether she is dead or alive in the Temple of the Sun of the Holy Therns where he last saw here with the blade of Phaidor was descending towards her heart as the evil Issus, queen of the First Born, had locked his mate in a cell that would not open for another year. However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"If I had to be stuck on a desert island with only ten books, the Barsoomian trilogy (Princess of Mars, Gods of Mars, and Warlord of Mars) would be three of them. Warlord wraps up the tale as Carter takes up the trail of the incomparable Dejah Thoris, following her captors to the hidden cities of the polar regions, culminating in a battle that settles the future of Barsoom. All the breathless adventure, daring swordplay, hairsbreadth escapes, and dry humor you could ask for. Even more in control of his material than in the other two excellent volumes, Burroughs challenges himself both to keep in the established material about Barsoom and still invent new elements. If you have not read the Barsoomian trilogy, and you love SF adventure, buy it NOW! You will re-read it with delight the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I will be 70 in three weeks and in that time I have never read any book or books by any writer that has ever held me \\" in the ready to defend myself while reading \\". I have many times while reading ERB books found myself at a point of feeling the excitement and the emotion of the moment, to the extent of having my hand knotted-up as if I were holding a sward and fighting for my life. He has such a way with words that he brings the moment alive in your mind. I love to read any of his books above any other writer. I have many other writers in my collection, but ERB is FIRST in my opinion. Now my opinion and $.50 might get you a cup of coffee don't you know."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"&quot;Psychologists tell me that... too close a scrutiny of my mental activities might prove anything but flattering; but be that as it may, I have often won success while the thinker would have been still at the endless task of comparing various judgements.&quot;Edgar Rice BurroughsThe Warlord Of Mars1914&quot;Burroughs [was] no one's candidate for Great World Writer, but [was] a man who understood story values completely.&quot;Stephen KingForeward to Night Shift1977Was Edgar Rice Burroughs a man of towering intellect? No - I doubt even his most devoted fans would say so. Was he, in Mr. King's amusing phrase, a &quot;Great World Writer&quot;? Again, no - even the most forgiving literary critic probably wouldn't bestow that title upon him. Was he, however, a born storyteller with a (literally) wonderful imagination? That I don't think anyone would seriously argue.Burroughs' Martian novels, as I have said elsewhere, are great fun for both the the young and young at heart. Think Errol Flynn in outer space and you've got the basic idea. Escapist fiction doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This book was written in 1913 and is still being read today, in 2011. It lacks the punch it carried when written, everyone knows too much now about the conditions on Venus and Mars but when we read fantasy we set aside certain facts, Hence Burroughs writes as though the conditions on Mars are earthlike, except for gravity, permitting John Carter to be Superman for his day. Earth at that time gloried in war, although face to face combat was disappearing. But not so on Burroughs worlds, his hero John Carter gloried in his fighting ability, using antique weapons. The warriors of Venus and mars acknowledged his prowess and spread his fame all over. How then did Burroughs create tension, and hold interest? Carter's opponents were not his physical equals, so there were more of them. Also knowledge not known to Carter was available to them which they could exploit to their advantage and impede John Carter, Burroughs never let this knowledge be great enough to defeat Carter.So it was in Warlord of Mars. He sought his wife, the beautiful Dejah Thoris, so beautiful that she was stolen (kidnapped) and taken with some of the highest rulers of Mars to become their wife, not polyandrous, but one would prevail. So John sets out to foil their plans. He trails these men. Along the way he determines their purpose. He makes friends with various Martians, some piratical, some unknown to the other nations of Mars, but he unites them and unites Mars as much as possible given its warrior culture. If you like action there is a lot of fighting. Coincidences occur to allow the story to proceed but after all this is almost one hundred years ago, time enough for almost anything to happen. Frankly I read it for its old time appeal, or I should say reread it from seventy or eighty years ago. Try it, you might like it."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Sometimes the first three books are referred to as a trilogy as the first two books have cliff hangers. Of course we know this is not the end due to the number of book written.In this part of the story we left John waiting at the Temple of the Sun. Everyone knows that he as not long to wait until his old nemeses' devise a plot of revenge. Soon John, while in the process of chasing the capturers of Dejah Thoris, will come up against untold and unfathomed barriers to the end of the world.

These are really such fun books that you have to love them.

It is a direct continuation of the first two in the series--\\"A Princess of Mars\\" and \\"The Gods of Mars\\"--and a reading of those earlier titles is absolutely essential before going into this one. Here, Carter tries to rescue his princess, Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of some particularly nasty villains. In his relentless pursuit, one that makes Indiana Jones look like a slacker, Carter travels from the south pole of Mars to the forbidden lands of the north. He encounters many varieties of monster, such as the apt and the sith, and gets into more fights and cliffhanging situations than a reader would believe could be packed into a mere 160 pages. The pace of the book is furious, never pausing for breath, and the final battle in the north polar city of Kadabra, in which the combined armies of Barsoomian green, red and black men attack the yellow tribes of the north, is thrilling in the extreme. What amazing films these first three John Carter novels would make, if done faithfully and with the requisite ... million thrown into each one!So why the 3-star rating? Well, there are numerous problems with the book that prevent me from giving it top grades, despite the fun I had reading it. For one, there are countless inconsistencies and implausibilities. For example, it is difficult for the reader to accept that Carter's enemies cannot recognize him, just because he has smeared some red tint over his skin. Difficult to believe that Carter is able to scale the side of a tower in the pitch black of night. Difficult to believe that Carter (or any man) could live in a pit for nine days without food and especially water. Verrry hard to believe that Thurid, Carter's archenemy, could carry the struggling captive princess over a foot-wide ledge without toppling into the abyss beneath. Impossible to believe that Dejah Thoris couldn't recognize Carter by his voice alone, despite his yellow-man disguise. All these are hard to swallow in the extreme. As for the inconsistencies: It is stated that Carter saved Thuvia from the Warhoons in book 2, when in actuality it was Carthoris, Carter's son. The city of Kaol is said to be rendered invisible by the forest that surrounds and tops it, but later it is stated that this forest is cut back from the city. Huh? Worst of all is the aforementioned tower-scaling scene, in which dusk becomes early afternoon in a matter of minutes. Here's something that Ed Wood would have appreciated! This day/night confusion is straight out of \\"Plan 9,\\" but for me is the hallmark of incredibly sloppy writing and even poorer copyediting. Further, Burroughs' descriptions of the Valley of the Therns, and its geographic proximity to the land of the First Born, are simply impossible to visualize. Throw in a bunch of misplaced modifiers and some awkward turns of phrase and you've got a real mess of a manuscript. So why did I have a tear in my eye by the book's end, when Carter gets his rewards and the entire city of Helium turns out to greet him? I guess that the power of storytelling can outweigh petty matters of consistency and grammar. And Burroughs WAS a great teller of tales, and this book IS as thrilling as they come."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Keeping in mind that much of the outer space and Mars-related science fiction in this book is far out-dated--almost comically so--Warlord of Mars is really a quite enjoyable book, even today. Edgar Rice Burroughs, perhaps more famously known as the creator of Tarzan, is the consummate story-teller. This is richly plotted fantasy with highly suspenseful action scenes; strong imagery; clearly defined characters; and an inexhaustible pool of creative names like Barsoom, Dejah Thoris, and the Therns, which sink into a reader's psyche and never wear away. Burroughs is one of the classic writers of yore, capable of putting their hero in one seemingly impossible predicament after another, yet managing to extricate them at the height of suspense by some clever trick every time. No matter how many times we read this stuff, it never gets old.The John Carter series is mandatory reading for all serious sci-fi buffs. And one should definitely read the first two books in the trilogy before taking on this third and final edition. Long live John Carter! --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The title says it all. It's a great series, I just haven't had time to read it yet. Sorry for the useless review, I was just tired of looking at it pending."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"\\"Do you know where we are going?\\" she said.\\"To solve the mystery of the eternal hereafter, I imagine,\\" I replied.\\"I am going to a fate worse than that,\\" she said, with a little shudder.\\"What do you mean?\\"-- _The Gods of Mars_In a delightful article, \\"Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Fate Worse than Death,\\" Richard D. Mullen (1969-70) gives a detailed table of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels from 1911 through 1915. In them, he lists the times and circumstances in which a heroine is threatened with rape (the \\"fate worse than death\\") and how she is saved in the proverbial nick of time. (As you may know, an Edgar Rice Burroughs heroine is frequently unclothed but always pure and virtuous.) For those readers interested in such statistics, there are 76 cases recorded by Mullen.In _The Warlord of Mars_ (_Argosy_, 1913-14), there are at least three such incidents recorded for our moral edification. In each case, Dejah Thoris is the threatened heroine. In the first case, she is threatened by the yellow Martian king Salensus Oll (even his name is oily). In the second instance, she is kidnapped by the white Martian Matai Shang, his brave but ruthless daughter Phaidor, and the black Martian Thurid. And in the third case, she is menaced by a band of yellow Martians, who plan to preserve her \\"as a plaything for [the] nobles\\" (151).Mullen states that in each case, Dejah Thoris is rescued by the stalwart John Carter. This is certainly true of the first and third cases. But it is not strictly true in the second case. Carter certainly _attempts_ to save her, but he is not really very effective. It is disagreement and double-crossing among the villains that really preserves the honor of the Princess. (Burroughs heroines are frequently rescued by the hero, or they may save themselves. On rare occasions, the menacer may have a change of heart. Sometimes Providence-- in the form of lions, earthquakes, or passing pterodactyls-- may lend a hand.)All of the previous incidents occur in the latter chapters of the novel. But the sharp-eyed reader may have noted that I said that there were \\"at least three\\" fate-worse-than death scenarios in _Warlord_. There is in fact a fourth one as well, and it is truly remarkable. Near the end of chapter one, Matai Shang and Thurid, on friendier terms than they are at the close of the novel, are in a boat plotting how to make John Carter's life more miserable. Unbeknownst to them, Carter is following in another boat and listening to them. They have Dejah Thoris prisoner. Thurid generously allows Matai Shang first turn: \\"You shall have your way with her before another day has passed\\" (15). Carter refrains from slaying \\"the vile plotters\\" (16) only because they are the only ones who can lead him to Dejah Thoris. And then... _Matai Shang never gets around to having his way with the princess for the next twelve chapters_! This is not quite a record in Burroughs's novels. In _The Gods of Mars_, we learn that Thuvia has been a slave to the white Martians for 15 years without being molested. Still Dejah Thoris's good fortune is certainly worthy of comment.One final note. The female speaking in the quote above is _not_ a virtuous heroine. It is the imperious, willful, sometimes villainous Phaidor who will attempt to kill Dejah Thoris on several occasions. Perhaps some future Burroughs scholar will compile a list of Not So Nice Girls who are menaced by the fate worse than death."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read.

He is a cunning, inteligent man from Earth who goes to Mars and is made hero of the planet. He works his own way to get things done which is very strange for the Martians.

It took a little while to get acclimated to who was the good and who was the bad, and how they all worked together (or against each other).The book is basically one HUGE fight scene. It has pretty awesome descriptions, and is endlessly creative in the people, and places he visits on his escapades. There is never a boring moment, and there are very few breaks in action. Read it at a time when there will be few interruptions because it is hard to put down (as the hero is almost always in mortal peril)"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs concluded John Carter's first cycle of adventures on Mars -- sometimes referred to as the Martian Trilogy -- with the serialized publication of The Warlord of Mars in 1913-1914. At the conclusion of the previous installment, The Gods of Mars, the future of John Carter's beloved princess Dejah Thoris was in grave doubt. Having proven that the centuries-old Martian worship of Issus was falsehood perpetuated by power-hungry members of the Holy Therns and the First Born races, Carter set about destroying the religious infrastructure in order to free Barsoom from the false promises of the Issus-worshippers, where devotion is repaid with slavery and violent death. But Carter's quest to spread the truth is not without a price, as in repayment for his actions Carter's enemies lock the one he holds most dear in the vault at the center of the Temple of the Sun -- a room that can only be accessed once per Martian year. Seconds before the door closed, Carter saw Dejah Thoris nearly stabbed by Phaidor, the daughter of the head of the Therns and his avowed enemy since he spurned her romantic overtures. Living with the torment of not knowing whether his beloved wife is alive or dead, Carter has worked furiously to discover a way to free Dejah from her prison -- but his enemies will do anything to get to her first and claim her as their own. Fighting men who have nothing to lose, Carter chases news of Dejah across Barsoom, confronting countless new enemies, challenges, and even climates in his single-minded quest to save his imprisoned wife.The Warlord of Mars is the slimmest of the first three volumes in Burroughs's John Carter of Mars series, but it is every bit as action-packed as its predecessors. Unlike the first two Carter novels, there is no prologue from Edgar Rice Burroughs, no preface to the following action from Carter to his \\"nephew\\" and guardian. The action opens a few months after Carter deposed the fake goddess Issus , with our hero deep in the throes of his search for a way to rescue the imprisoned Dejah and Thuvia, the latter a former Thern slave instrumental in aiding Carter when he returned to Mars in hostile territory at the beginning of the second novel. Whereas the previous novel saw Carter dealing essentially a death blow to the age-old Martian religion, exposing it as a cult, this follow-up adventure is largely concerned with the fall-out of that successful assault and sets up endless possibilities for future battle with the false religion's deposed leaders. Is there ever any question of Carter's ultimate success? No -- but that is part of the fun and magic of these books. Burroughs was a master craftig non-stop action sequences and building tension and suspense in his novels. Just when you think that surely Burroughs's imagination must be tapped out, he introduces new people, places, and customs to challenge Carter's seeming invincibility. Predictable? Sure, such is perhaps the nature of pulp fiction. But in the hands of a master like Burroughs, he proves that the journey is always a worthwhile and entertaining ride.John Carter's third Martian adventure is just as fast-paced a rollicking adventure ride as its predecessors, and serves as a fitting capstone to the first \\"trilogy\\" within the overall series. When he was first introduced in A Princess of Mars, Carter was a man without a country or purpose, forced to make his way in a wholly alien world. In The Gods of Mars, Carter returns to Barsoom after an absence of ten years, and has to fight to reclaim the life he built with Dejah Thoris's people. The Warlord of Mars brings Carter full circle, forcing him to fight for the life he wants on his new home, culminating in a rather touching recognition of Carter's place and the esteem in which he's held by his adopted countrymen and friends. Having never explored pulp fiction of this ilk until recently, I remain thorougly impressed by Burroughs's work and in no little awe of his standing as a trailblazer in the science-fiction world. Barsoom is peopled with colorful peoples of wildly varied cultures, fascinating landscapes, and never-ending posibilities for adventure and death-defying escapades.These novels are sheer fun from start to finish. I adore John Carter's completely over-the-top, unbelievable invincibility and his old-fashioned heroic charm. I love how much he adores Dejah Thoris -- it could be argued that he's the anti-James Bond, since Carter is just as ridiculously perfect and appealing to women, but he's very much a one-woman man, and his love story appeals to the old-fashioned romantic in me. :) Snappily plotted, well-written, imaginative, and endlessly adventurous, The Warlord of Mars confirms me as an avid John Carter fan, and happily there is no end in sight when it comes to exploring Burroughs's backlist. Barsoom and its people are a world I love getting lost in -- escapist entertainment of the highest order."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"It is just fun, that John Carter can come back to earth and tell his experiences on Mars and that go back to have more adventures."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This book (as part of the series) created the genre. To think this book was written 100 years ago amazes me. Yes, the story is simplistic in today's terms, the characters are a bit 1 dimensional but overall, the complexity of the world he created and the images he paints are fantastic. This is no Lord of the Rings but then again...it wasn't intended to be.The is a fun story with the universal theme of good vs evil. The protagonist really can't do any wrong and is always chasing/fighting for his woman (e.g Popeye). Much of the terminology is a bit dated and/or doesn't even commonly exist in our current vocabulary but that also makes it more interesting.I read the story quickly, felt fulfilled in where it took me, and wanted to read more...what more can you ask for in a story?"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Love the John Carter of Mars series.Burroughs has to be one of the best Science Fiction writers ever.

The first three books were indeed intended as a trilogy, and were marketed as such in the early part of the 20th cenury, in &quot;THE ALL-STORY&quot; magazine. The fact that the first three books cover a continuous story, with a definite conclusion in this third book, also points to it being written a true trilogy. Please do not allow yourself to be confused by the fact that 7 (or 8) more &quot;John Carter&quot; novels succeeded this one."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"This is the third book in the series of 11. It finds our hero, John Carter, awaiting the barsoomian year out, in hopes of finding Dejah Thoris still alive. This book has several twists and turns in it, as expected for those who read the first two books.Like the two books before this, the author has created a superb mix of science fiction and adventure. The fast moving action in this book did cause me to read it much quicker than I planned. Once I started, I had a difficult time putting the Kindle down to take a break. Rather than repeat what was in the other books, this one takes us further around Barsoom, and explores the polar regions. Along the way, John Carter managers to unite the various fighting tribes and cultures into a single force.Although these books were written almost a century ago, they are timeless. I constantly marvel at the author that imagined the possibility that earthlings were not the only inhabitants of the universe, before space travel was even remotely possible. Today, we have Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica and numerous other space travel shows to help generate the idea that we could travel to unknown planets in the future. For Edgar Rice Burroughs to have imagined the travel and characters he did was truly amazing, in my humble opinion. I believe only more time will tell us if he was correct in choosing Mars as a habitable planet.Upon completing this, the third book in the Princess of Mars/John Carter series, one could easily conclude the series is finished. This volume has a definite ending, unlike those first two books. Enjoy this book, but be warned, there are 8 more books in the series, to be read with joy and amazement."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"I first read one of this series when a kid. I don't know how I came across it, but I was so fascinated that I read every one I could get from the library -- probably most of the series. That was a long, long time ago.I often thought of John Carter, and even started a book of my own based on similar principles. Nothing much came of it, except that my son and his friends would pass around and read each chapter as soon as I finished typing. I would sit with them and tell them about John Carter of Mars. They were very interested but, unfortunately, the local library did not stock any of the series.When I searched Burroughs on Amazon, I came across the John Carter series and felt as if I had found an old friend, missing for sixty years. I downloaded them and once again read every volume, almost straight through.Burroughs knew how to tell a story, and freed himself from the constraints of earth gave free rein to his imagination -- which never was that much tethered. A key attraction to Burroughs is that he feels no need to be politically correct. Even in his own time, much of his theories were out-of-date. His concepts of race, honor and merit cannot be expressed today, even in fiction. I suspect this is why the libraries do not make his books as available as they should be.I particularly think these books make good reading for young teenage boys. Some would object to the racial overtones, but these are part of the plot. Mainly, Burroughs teaches honor, bravery and loyalty -- traits that are considered quaint and antiquated today.This is the last of the series, and should be read last. Once done, you may feel as I do, having rediscovered an old friend."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Book Three of the John Carter of Mars series is an exciting story.

I have seen one movie made from this series, and it wasn't that good. Now, Disney has gone all out to film \\"John Carter\\". Yes, there will be differences in the film as opposed to the book. But from what I have seen, there are many characters in the movie that I feel I know personally. I am looking forward to seeing this film like no other that I can remember.I first read the second and third of these books when I was just a kid more than 45 years ago. I had no idea, at the time, that there was a third book in the original trilogy. I eventually bought a \\"two-in-one\\" hard copy (from a book club) of what I thought was the only two books in the series (The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars). I read that book so many times that I had to apply glue to the spine a few times to keep pages from falling out.A great many years later, I was in a book store and decided to look for copies of the book that I had bought and loved as a boy, as my copy was getting pretty worn. Imagine my surprise when I saw a shelf full of the tales of John Carter and Mars.I was thrilled about finding that there was a book that predated the two that I had, and I strained my bank account when I found the rest of the series on the same shelf.

After I read the entire series, I wrap them in plastic wrap and put them in a drawer beside my bed. Every few years, I get them out and read them again. You just can't beat a classic.One would hope that with the new movie coming out that Ballantine will maybe offer a complete set of these books.

One of Burroughs great strengths is his sense of drama, and his ability to make fantastic heroes believable.But in Warlord of Mars, he goes just a bit overboard. Coincidence as a major plot device was always one of ERB's weaknesses. In Warlord nary an event goes by that isn't influenced in a major way by unlikely coincidence. Because his books are so much fun, we forgive him for this. But it just happens too often in Warlord, and it detracts from the book.Still, this is a fun read, and a must read after the first two books, because you are going to have to follow through to see when and how John Carter and Dejah Thoris finally are reunited. We meet a new Barsoomian race, and have a final confrontation with villains we first met in \\"The Gods of Mars\\". Its nonstop action from start to finish, and introduces what was undoubtedly one of the first, if not the first, \\"dungeon crawls\\" in fantasy literature.Warlord concludes the opening trilogy of John Carter and Dejah Thoris.

Our hero chases his beloved from one pole of Barsoom to another, encounters another race of Mars, the yellow men, and kills, cliff-hangs, occasionally stumbles, and eventually rescues his princess.On the one hand, only one new race was introduced in this book, the yellow men, to compliment the green, red, white, and black men (and I'm limiting it to sentients). This is a little disappointing, as his average is down, but some of the monsterous creatures introduced, like the sith (lower case to distinguish them from the Sith ofStar Wars Prequel Trilogy), are very impressive and add to the story.Like all of the Barsoom stories, \\"Warlord of Mars\\" has the values of a different era. These are not self-rescuing princesses, everyone recognizes John Carter's Earthly superiority, combat is recognized as a viable approach to problem solving, and so forth. But the series is free of the sarcasm, irony, and self-righteousness that are hallmarks of contemporary fiction. These books have an authenticity that has been lost in an era of over-sensitivity and pessimism.Leave critical thought and excessive sensitivity on the porch, go on to Barsoom and enjoy.E. M.

This one is easily as good as the first two. Since these were written a full century ago (A Princess of Mars - book one - was published in 1912) some of the terminology is a bit antiquated and certainly what we now know about Mars quickly puts the kibosh on any of the terrain or life forms described in the story; But probably then, as now, the reader should enjoy these stories as fun, escapist romps, and not worry so much about the details, and in that I was successful.I have a heck of a time tracking down good physical copies of these books to read, so it may be awhile until I arrive at book four - but make it I shall. Very enjoyable, I suppose I should get around to some Tarzan as well.Also, if you are fan of this style of book, I highly recommendSpace Vulture."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The Warlord of Mars++++++++++++ caution contains what some might construe as spoilers++++++++++++++++++The Warlord of Mars is a science fiction novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the third of his famous Barsoom series followingThe Gods of Mars (Townsend Library Edition). Burroughs began writing it in June, 1913, going through five working titles; Yellow Men of Barsoom, The Fighting Prince of Mars, Across Savage Mars, The Prince of Helium, and The War Lord of Mars.The finished story was first published in All-Story Magazine as a four-part serial in the issues for December, 1913-March, 1914. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in September, 1919This novel continues where the previous one in the series, The Gods of Mars abruptly ended. At the end of the previous book, John Carter's wife, the princess Dejah Thoris, is imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun by the vile pretender goddess Issus. It is said one has to wait an entire Barsoomian year before the room the prisoner is in revolves back to the entranceJohn Carter discovers that a First Born knows the secret of the Temple of the Sun and he and the Holy Hekkador Matai Shang want to rescue the Holy Thern's daughter, who is imprisoned with Dejah Thoris and another Barsoomian princess, Thuvia of Ptarth. John Carter follows them in the hope of liberating his beloved wife. His antagonists flee to the north, taking the three women along. Thereafter John Carter follows them untiring into the north polar regions where he discovers more fantastic creatures and ancient, mysterious Martian races. These he overcomes in battle, and is later proclaimed \\"Warlord of Barsoom\\" by his allies. This book is the last to feature Tars Tarkas, John Carter's ally, in any major role; indeed, the green Barsoomians of whom Tars Tarkas is an oligarch disappear altogether from most of the later novels.Characters* John Carter: Protagonist of the first three novels. Carter is an American Civil War veteran, transported to the planet Mars by a form of astral projection. There, he encounters both formidable alien creatures and various waring Martian races, wins the hand of Martian princess Dejah Thoris, and rises to the position of Warlord of Mars.* Dejah Thoris: A Martian Princess of Helium, who is courageous, tough and always holds her resolve, despite being frequently placed in both mortal danger and the threat of being dishonored by the lust of villains. She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, jed of Lesser Helium and granddaughter of Tardos Mors, jeddak of Helium; highly aristocratic; and fiercely proud of her heritage. She is the love interest of John Carter. She was imprisoned by the Martian false deity Issus, at the end of The Gods of Mars. A central character in the first three Barsoom novels, whose capture by various enemies, and subsequent pursuit by John Carter, is a constant motivating force in these tales.* Tars Tarkas: A Green Martian, who becomes the ally of John Carter and at his behest, the overlord of his clan. An archetypal noble savage, and considered John Carter's first and closest friend upon Barsoom.* Thuvia of Ptarth: A Princess of Ptarth, who appears in The Gods of Mars as a slave girl rescued by John Carter from the Therns. She is later imprisoned with Carter's wife Dejah Thoris, in a prison which can only be opened once per year and remains by her side until the conclusion of The Warlord of Mars. Like many of Burroughs' heroines, she is tough, courageous, proud, and strongly identified with her aristocratic position in Martian society.Burroughs vision of Mars was loosely inspired by astronomical speculation of the time, especially that of Percival Lowell, who saw the planet as a formerly Earthlike world now becoming less hospitable to life due to its advanced age, whose inhabitants had built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. [ Lowell was influenced by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, who in 1878, had observed features on Mars he called canali (Italian for \\"channels\\"). Mistranslated of this into English as \\"canals\\" fueled belief the planet was inhabited. The theory of an inhabited planet with flowing water was disproved by data provided by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions which found a dead, frozen world where water could not exist in a fluid stateA million years before the narrative commences, Mars was a lush world with oceans. As the oceans receded, and the atmosphere grew thin, the planet has devolved into a landscape of partial barbarism; living on an aging planet, with dwindling resources, the inhabitants of Barsoom have become hardened and warlike, fighting one another to survive. Barsoomians distribute scarce water supplies via a worldwide system of canals, controlled by quarreling city-states. The thinning Martian atmosphere is artificially replenished from an \\"atmosphere plant\\".RaceThe world of Barsoom is divided by the territory of White, Yellow, Black, Red and Green skinned races. Each has particular traits and qualities, which seem to define most individuals within them. This concept of race is more like a division between species than ethnicity.The Warlord of Mars introduces the Yellow Martians, supposedly extinct, whom John Carter finds in secret domed cities at the poles. They are black-bearded, exceptionally cruel, and keep slaves, acquiring these by using a giant magnetic device which sends fliers off course, and allows the Yellow Martians to capture the occupantsNumerous novels and series by others were inspired by Burroughs' Mars books: the Radio Planet trilogy of Ralph Milne Farley; the Mars and Venus novels of Otis Adelbert Kline; Almuric by Robert E. Howard; Warrior of Llarn and Thief of Llarn by Gardner Fox; Tarzan on Mars, Go-Man and Thundar, Man of Two Worlds by John Bloodstone; the Michael Kane trilogy of Michael Moorcock; The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, Through the Gates of the Silver Key by H.P. Lovecraft, the Gor series of John Norman; the Callisto series and Green Star series of Lin Carter; The Goddess of Ganymede and Pursuit on Ganymede by Mike Resnick; and the Dray Prescot series of Alan Burt Akers (Kenneth Bulmer). In addition, Leigh Brackett, Ray Bradbury, Andre Norton, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Alan Dean Foster show Burroughs' influence in their development of alien cultures and worlds.A. Bertram Chandler's pulp novels The Alternate Martians and The Empress of Outer Space overtly borrow a number of characters and situations from Burroughs' Barsoom series.Robert A. Heinlein's novelsGlory Roadand , and Alan Moore's graphic novels of Allan and the Sundered Veil and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II directly reference Barsoom.In Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer's World of Tiers series (1965-1993) Kickaha, the seriThe Number of the Beastes' adventurer protagonist, asks his friend The Creator of Universes to create for him a Barsoom. The latter agrees only to make an empty world, since \\"It would go too far for me to create all these fabulous creatures only for you to amuse yourself by running your sword through them.\\" Kickaha visits from time to time the empty Barsoom, complete with beautiful palaces in which nobody ever lived, but goes away frustrated.L. Sprague de Camp's story \\"Sir Harold of Zodanga\\" recasts and rationalizes Barsoom as a parallel world visited by his dimension-hopping hero Harold Shea. De Camp accounts for Burroughs' departures from physics or logic by portraying both Burroughs and Carter as having a tendency to exaggerate in their storytelling, and Barsoomian technology as less advanced than usually presented.Furthermore, his Viagens Interplanetarias series of novels and short stories, especially those set on Krishna, one of Tau Ceti's inhabited planets, owe much to the premise of feudal co-existence alongside advanced technology pioneered within the Barsoom series.In 1989 Larry Niven and Steven Barnes published \\"The Barsoom Project\\", where a futuristic form of live action role-playing games (LARPs) is based on the Barsoom books.The Mars-based novels of Kim Stanley Robinson (published from 1992 to 1999) also offer several nods in Burroughs' direction.The 2008 novel In the Courts of the Crimson Kings by S.F. writer S. M. Stirling is an alternate telling of the Princess of Mars story but this time the princess is a very powerful character indeed.DC Comics character Adam Strange's method of transportation, the Zeta Beam, recalls the way Carter is transported to Mars.In the Commonwealth Saga novels by Peter F. Hamilton a group of humans who undertake unprecedented and often illegal genetic modifications of their own bodies are known as the Barsoomians, in apparent reference to Burroughs' creation.Richard Corben's Den series also appears to be inspired by the Barsoom series. It features a hero, Den, who mysteriously arrives naked on a (largely) desert planet where he becomes a great warrior and where the humanoids wear no clothes. Many of the creatures resemble the description of the white apes of the Gods of Mars. Like John Carter, he also receives great physical prowess from arriving in Neverwhere, although Carter's prowess stems from gravity, whereas Den undergoes a complete physical transformation.In Stephen King's novel The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three, Eddie Dean compares the All-World and the quest for the Dark Tower to a Barsoom novel.The John Carter of Mars series was also felt to be one of the inspirations for the Dark Sun Dungeons & Dragons game world setting.In A Wizard of Mars by Diane Duane, the main character Kit is a major fan of the Barsoom series and a long dormant wizard artifact recreates Barsoom as Kit imagines it to communicate with him.I highly recommend this book and series to 12 -18 year olds who enjoy swashbuckling adventures and tales of derring-do.Gunner March, 2012"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"ERB continues his epic adventure of John Carter into the Gods of Mars. Great illiteration and storytelling makes for a great read...start at the beginning and keep on going...on to Warlords of Mars"},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs did not intended to write a trilogy, but his 1914 pulp novel &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; completes the story begun in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and continued in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and finally brings John Carter and his beloved Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium (i.e., no cliffhanger this time around, boys and girls). The story picks up six months after the conclusion of &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; with our hero not knowing whether she is dead or alive in the Temple of the Sun of the Holy Therns where he last saw here with the blade of Phaidor was descending towards her heart as the evil Issus, queen of the First Born, had locked his mate in a cell that would not open for another year. However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs covers vast expanses of Barsoomian territory in John Carter's whirlwind pursuit of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The gentle pokes in the eye at religion, evolution, science, and even racism continue but do not impede the readability of the story. Burroughs demonstrates his superb grasp of story-telling and the construction of adventure settings with a flair unsurpassed by any other writer of the 20th century.Carter finds himself charging headline into a myterious northern world where ancient and legendary yellow men have survived in the harshest Barsoomian environment imaginable. Coincidentally, in classic Burroughsian fashion, Carter uncovers an incredible weapon which could destroy the fragile alliance of Barsoomian nations he has assembled in his long battle with the evil Therns.The first three books of the John Carter series (A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars) foreshadow the most breath-taking adventures that role-playing gamers could imagine three generations after ERB wrote these stories. These books also provide a glimpse into one of the most amazing and detailed worlds of fantasy and space opera ever to see publication. It's hard to imagine how anyone who loves action adventure, swashbuckling stories could go wrong in purchasing these books."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"It starts with a chase that doesn't slow down until the very end.In this third of many tales that occur on Barsoom (Mars), John Carter is hunting down his beloved princess, Dejah Thoris and Thuvia, Maid of Mars.Just barely over 100 pages, this is yet another quick, enjoyable read in the Sword and Planet subgenre of Science Fiction. Having read all but two of the Martian Tales of ERB I felt a bit too much Dejah Vu, if you catch my meaning. Indeed it makes one wonder why and how these women manage to get captured so frequently.There are a few notable moments to be had. I especially liked the brief encounter of John Carter with Torkar Bar and the scene in the appropriately named Pit of Plenty.There are also a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of the STAR WARS movies. The land of Okar reminded me at times of Hoth, with its cave creatures. Also the scene before John Carter is cast into the Pit reminded me a little of Jabba's palace with Princess Leia.John Carter himself comes across as a very strange character indeed. On the one hand he is clumsy enough to sneeze at the most inopportune moments, fails to realize why his Princess can't recognize him and completely forgets about things lurking behind curtains that he just spotted a moment before.On the other hand, Luck seems to favor John Carter in that despite some of these fumbles, he always manages to get out of a bind.It's hard to criticize these tales for what they are--Science Fiction of the light, buttery, fluffy popcorn variety--but just once I'd like to see John Carter get into a truly nasty situation.One where he may not even come out physically and mentally unscathed."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Burroughs' creative peak was clearly in the timeframe when he wrote this. He had begun three of his four primary series and was rapidly gaining fame and fortune because of his breathtaking tales of adventure and romance. This displays no flagging of his creative juices. Burroughs takes Carter from one end of Mars to the other with some amazing creations on display in the interim. Here Carter has matured and but for two slips, betrays none of the stupidity usually associated with pulp heroes. (Unfortunately Burroughs made up for Carter's intelligence in later books by having Gahan of Gathol and Tan Hadron of Hastor become just shy of braindead.) With all the wonders on display in the book, though, one major flaw shines through: the ending. For those who have not read the book, you may want to look away at this point. Right after a spectacular extended fight scene which must leave the reader breathless, Burroughs has Carter face Thurid and Matai Shang in what one would expect to be the tour de force finale when good conquers evil and makes all well in the world. Only--well, it doesn't quite happen. Thurid and Matai Shang are running like scared rabbits when Carter catches them just as they turn against each other. Then someone else saves the day. Why Burroughs ended the book this way will always mystify me unless he really felt the butchery Carter would wreak on these two villains would offend sensibilities. The bloody deaths of both Thurid and Matai Shang at Carter's hands would have made for a great passage in the book. Instead, a literal deus ex machina appears to rescue our superman hero. If not for this anticlimactic scene, the book would deserve five stars. Ah, well..."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs novels have been handed down to me from my father who received them from his father. I just wanted to let readers know that around the age of 15 or so, I read all of Buroughs' novels. From the Tarzan stories to Carson of Venus to John Carter and Mars to the westerns to everything. Even though you can see the similiarities in all in how they were written with the same segments, I thought all the books were fascinating and well done. Considering the fact that these were written as early as 1900, the stories of Mars and Venus show the brilliance of Rice Burroughs. Lets not forget about David Ins ( i believe that was his name ) and the stories of the earths core. Burroughs was well ahead of his time and I am greatful that I was able to enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"First written in 1914, this series of John Carter novels is perhaps the start of the science fiction writing about Mars. Ray Bradbury traces his Martian Chronicles to reading these as a child. This is high on action and around every turn there is a life-threatening event across the Barsoom landscape. John Carter \\"the prince of Helium\\" must fight with his beloved \\"pet\\" Woola, \\"As large as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs, he was indeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his ten short, muscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty\\". One review called John Carter \\"a natural man\\", which seems appropriate. There is the undying love for Dejah Thorus and the final sly \\"Why not?\\" as he draws her close after the triumphs. Carter is a man of courage, and that word spoken from an unknown ally, leads him out of the tortuous Pit of Plenty. This might be considered the third of the trilogy started with \\"A Princes of Mars\\" and continued with \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but in fact there were 7 more John Carter stories."},{"Title":"The Warlord of Mars","review":"The series has great action and imagination.

Once again Burroughs does a terrific job of world building, creating another wonderfully detailed landscape. Inhabiting the polar regions are once again well developed and complex peoples with interesting cultures, heritages, traditions and histories. Punctuating the suspenseful story are great battles of epic scale and heroism befitting Burroughs' noble and honorable John Carter.Reading Gods of Mars is necessary to fully enjoy Warlord of Mars as the two form a complete story.

In his opinion unless anything is not proven by science it is false. This is plain ignorance. There are shortcomings to the scientific method as any true skeptic would know. For instance one of the main tenents of science is that of repeatability to verify causal relationships. If a thing has no repeatable cause and effect relationship, it must be false and a coincidence. However using this argument science can deny some of its own claims. Why hasnt anyone argued that because penicillin hasnt cured some of the diseases it has cured before, then it must be a quack medicine. It has failed the test of repeatability. The hypocrisy is evident, and it shows through in this book. Scientific method is nothing more than skepticism in an empirical mode. I have nothing against the scientific method and skeptical inquiry, since this is nothing more than common sense. However, I do have a problem with pseudo skeptics and scientists who hide under the banners of science and skepticism to promote junk as this author wrote. I will agree that there are frauds and liars in the alternative health field, but this is true of any field. This book is nothing more than the promotion of a new religion which is scientism. As is true with any religion, you will have fanatics who will believe what they want, no matter what the evidence is for the other side.

There are crooked people in every profession. when doing a hitpiece on homeopathy, he claims that most of the deans of america's pharmacy schools told him that homeopathy did not work and should be banned. A few questions during a telephone interview constitute scientific proof? He conveniently failed to mention that all of america's establishment medical schools receive enormous amounts of research funds from drug companies. Besides, how can a pharmacist who has no knowledge of homeopathy give a worthwhile opinion? People like Mr. Butler say there is no scientific proof to substanciate the claims of alternative treatments. But when proposals are made to study alternative treatments, people like Mr. Butler say there is no need becuase they already know it does not work. This betrays establishment medicine for what it is, a secular religion. When someone viciously attacks his opponents, as Mr. Butler does, it is painfully obvious he cannot win his argument."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to Alternative Medicine","review":"You can't have 'alternative' biology and 'alternative' physics, but yet the Cult of 'Alternative' medicine seems to think they are immune to scientific analysis, empirical testing, facts and all those other \\"nuances\\" that get in the way of their faith.I see the majority of the reviews come from this Cult of true believers who no doubt found this searching for more scripture to preach to them. \\"What's this? Something that goes against my preconceived notions? Blasphemy!\\"In actuality this book is NOT an attack-piece. It is a series of findings compiled by licensed professionals taken from well-documented, peer-reviewed, established sources such as JAMA and many other medical journals who used methods such as double-blind testing and chemical analysis to reach their conclusion. You see in science, the conclusion comes AFTER the research. This is the fatal flaw in the 'alternative' medicine field: much like with so called 'Christian' science, they have established the conclusion first and then seek to bend the 'evidence' to reach their pre-conceived end. (i.e. The Earth is only 600 years old this is why carbon-dating MUST be inaccurate). That is, of course, when they even ATTEMPT to use science to explain their outrageous beliefs. More often than not 'alternative' health is based on secondary sources (my friends mother swears the blood of a virgin cured her hangnail!) or ancient scripture (what worked in 16th century rural Asia MUST be better than today because those Asians were SO in tune with their bodies and so mystical and wise!) and ignores all evidence to the contrary (hangnails clear up naturally and 16th century rural Asia wasn't the healthiest place to be.)Unfortunately this belief has permeated into society and has gotten away with a lot of fraud and false-hope by becoming an unquestioned 'alternative' to serious treatment. The book focuses in on how this developed as well as what causes a person to accept the irrational claims made by 'alternative' medicine con artists like Deepak Chopra and Andy Weil. The information in this book can be a great source of knowledge and comfort for any person who is seeking a truthful and honest look at alternative medicine and finds themselves awash in a sea of new age health books written with no sources or references and 'alternative' health gurus and self-proclaimed 'doctors' who speak like children and never back anything up."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to Alternative Medicine","review":"If you are looking for an informed criticism of alternative therapies you will not find it here.

This book is NOT a guide to alternative medicine by any means. Nor is it written by someone who even knows anything about alternative medicine.The publisher is the first clue. Prometheus books has a website, go check it out. They have many books like this one. They publish many books that are skeptical in nature - without being objective, fair minded, or even informative. Some of them bother to sound scientific, while others, like this one, don't even pretend.This book is written with one focus, to discredit everything that is NOT conventional medicine. I do mean everything, even alternative treatments that have been proven again and again reliably by science.Of course the other blaring aspect of this book - there is not one mention of the huge problems inherent to conventional medicine. It talks about being taken by charlatans, about alternative \\"quackery.\\" But it never mentions the drug companies, perhaps the biggest and richest charlatans going. It never mentions the rate of iatrogenic death (deaths caused by medical treatment), now either the 3rd or 4th leading cause of death in the US. Don't believe it - look it up - those stats are readily available on the web. Obviously conventional medicine has made amazing and life saving advances. But is is in no way infallible.This book is written by a true believer who is pointing the finger at what he doesn't like or believe in. There is no credibility, no \\"science.\\" It is just a cheap shot at trying to discredit every alternative medicine. A more truthful title would have been something like: \\"The consumer guide to quack medicine - in my opinion.\\" This is only a good read for people who already believe that conventional medicine is the \\"true\\" way to heal."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to Alternative Medicine","review":"The author of this book clearly doesn't give a lick about the people he is &quot;protecting&quot;.

This book is simply a finger-pointer with no content.The authors often cite that the only people claiming that certain treatments or products work are those who stand to make money through distributing those same treatments or products. However, no one ever seems to point out that the medical and pharmaceutical industries stand to LOSE a lot of money if these alternative treatments and medicines are acknowledged to be valid forms of treatment.Books like this only validate the idea that the medical community can't come up with solid evidence that these alternative medicines DON'T work.

Unless Lindsey and her son, Todd, agree to become his instant family to help him woo a major client. If Lindsey doesn't agree, she'll brak her son's heart, but is gaining custody of a cat any reason to marry?My review...the storyline was interestng and I enjoyed the first half of the book. However, the constant bickering and Lindsey's complete failure to recognize Max's good points, made the romance very unbelievable. Why on earth would Max love a shrew like her? Her agreement to pretend to be his wife was hardly upheld. She did nothing but glare and show disdain. I understand why she wanted to protect her son, but her one-dimensional thinking hardly would lead to a man falling madly in love with her. I don't like \\"romances\\" that are love-hate and unfortunately this had far more to do with dislike than love. For a much better read, try Flirtation River by Campbell. It's one of my favorite romances and shows how love can realistically develop between two characters that seem so different. Unfortuantely The Lady and the Tomcat misses the mark."},{"Title":"Teta, Mother, and Me: Three Generations of Arab Women","review":"The impetus for this lively, emotionally engaging exploration of three generations in Makdisi's maternal line came from her conflicted feelings about feminism and the traditional domestic-centered woman's role as well as the friction between the two cultural influences in her life - East and West.Her father was an affluent Christian Palestinian who immigrated to the US and became an American citizen. He returned to Jerusalem to honor his mother's dying wish, \\"but never really forgave her for deflecting him from what he had seen as his destiny in the New World.\\" Her mother was Lebanese and Palestinian, the daughter of a strict Baptist minister and his European-mission educated wife (Teta) who was, in turn, daughter of an Evangelical pastor.Makdisi and her siblings (which include the late Edward Said, professor, writer and pro-Palestinian activist, and the historian and writer Rosemarie Said Zahlan, who was also a pro-Palestinian activist) grew up with American passports, though she was born in Jerusalem in 1940 and grew up in Cairo.\\"Until 1948, and the Palestine war, our family moved regularly between Jerusalem and Cairo. For Palestinians, the year 1948 was a time of movement, of scattering, of families breaking up and moving apart. It was a time of breakdown, of entropy.\\" Though a child and sheltered somewhat from outside events, she recalls the upheaval in their Cairo home as a stream of relations - distraught refugees - moved through.\\"In 1948 the heart of our family was torn out, and the centre of our existence was broken....It is only recently that I have come to understand how deeply affected we have all been by the Palestinian experience, how we have lived our lives in its shadow. Most of all, though we have lived well and done well and accomplished much, though we have made many deep friendships throughout the world, since 1948 we have been outsiders - not only my parents, but their children, and, I fear, their children's children as well.\\"Makdisi does not dwell on \\"the Palestinian experience\\" in this book, which is as much biography and history as it is memoir, but its long shadow is always visible.As she moves backwards and forwards in time, she describes an arc - a move towards an ideal of \\"modernity,\\" synonymous with westernization, that carried her grandmother and mother farther from the extended family that gave women support and strength into an isolated role in the nuclear family.This movement began with the values her grandmother absorbed in the mission schools and culminated in her own marooned existence in an affluent Washington DC suburb, frustrated, bored and conflicted between her role as perfect mother and housewife and her ambitions to be something in the world.A century-long embrace of Western culture is clearly to blame in her mind, though Makdisi certainly does not advocate a repudiation of all things Western. Instead she concludes her book with a call for a new synthesis of priorities, which combines the \\"sustenance\\" of home and family with a connection to the outside world. Well, sure. In the best of all worlds, anyway.Makdisi grew up thinking her grandmother led a sheltered, isolated, domestic existence, comfortable but limited. But as she researches this book - getting her own mother and uncles to write memoirs and delving into the history of the time, a more rounded and nuanced picture emerges of a woman who endured war and tragedy, love and loss, who worked to build her husband's congregation and who, during WWI and again after her husband's death, struggled alone to keep her family together with little financial support.Makdisi's mother, Hilda, continued the move away from Arab customs, filling her house with European furniture, dressing in the latest Western fashions, adopting Western tableware and eating habits. No one seemed to regard any of this as a rejection of Arab culture at the time - it seemed more a matter of fashion and sophistication.Only in retrospect does Makdisi see how it isolated her mother and grandmother from other women and robbed them of matriarchal status later in life. Yet her grandmother was miserable living with her mother-in-law and the matriarchal status seemed to work best when the financial power rested with the matriarchal generation.Makdisi makes a number of generalizations that readers may quibble with. While I don't know the joy and comfort of the extended family (and it certainly does not appeal) I do know you cannot extrapolate middle class American life from the homogenous confines of an affluent D.C. subdivision. Miserable in her isolation there as a newlywed (as I too would be) I wondered why she didn't move into town, which they could easily have afforded.The book touches on a century of culture and upheaval - the European occupation and recarving of boundaries after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, various ensuing rebellions, the rise of Zionism in a land where Jews had always lived and the belated reaction of alarm, the bitter legacy of exile and rootlessness following the 1948 war.She does not explore any of these events in a deep political way but rather notes how each specifically affected her family. Perhaps this is why she does not touch on certain issues, such as the practicality of co-existing Israeli and Palestinian states and the repeated Palestinian rejection of partition.This is a book filled with rich history, cultural detail and colorful anecdotes, all of which help illuminate a place and people that seem to grow more remote and frightening with every passing day. Makdisi is a fluent and visual writer, with a foot in two cultures and her book should be read by anyone with an interest in the Arab world.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Teta, Mother, and Me: Three Generations of Arab Women","review":"I grew up in Cairo and now living in the US.

In tracing her mother and grandmother's and her own personal story and the families that surrounded them, Makdisi takes the reader on a journey that shows the meaningfulness of geographical origin in the arab culture as well as the inherent ability to change, transform and relocate.This memoir presents an opportunity to encounter in a very human way the event of the partition of Palestine and its effects on families' lives. It is broad in scope touching on everything from questions of class, the situation of women, colonialism, raising a family in a time of war, social movements and the upheaval of governments, being stateless, suffering loss...This book is recommended to the patient reader who is serious about garnering a deeper understanding of this area of the world or the related subject matter in women's studies.It is worth noting that Makdisi is the sister of Edward Said.

This was a class of wealthy, European educated, mostly Arab Christians who became not only nationalists but highly knowledgable about the world. Because of their connections and the fact that they were inter-related with Arabs across the middle east they were very worldy.The Said family were two generatiosn removed from Baptist Arab converts in Lebanon who had immigrated to Palestine and then on to Egypt. They had summer homes both in Jerusalem and Lebanon. Theirs was a life of luxory and western ways, western dress, western values and eventually western self hate.THis memoir covers the period 1940-2000. We are given insights into life after the flight from Palestine in 1948, life in Beirut during the war and insights into the arab world. Despite being a 'housewife' Mrs. Said is not really immigrating to Lebanon when she marries a Lebanese instead she is merely returning to her homeland. This is where the memoir is problematic. It covers up the very unique status of the Said family trying instead to put them in a larger arab morass which they do not exist in. There is little difference in the upbringing, wealth and outlook of the Saids and their western counterparts in the richest sections of London or New York. This is not an account of Arab women because 99.99% of Arab women do not live like this jetting between capitals and conversing in multiple languages.Despite attempts at portraying her family as refugees one has only to compare the memoir with the truth of the many homes of the family to see a more complete picture. If this memoir is interesting it is interesting because the female protaganist did nothing for women's rights and gives us a journalistic account of life in the Arab world, a biased account of course covring up PLO atrocities, during the period.Seth J.

But it was a great surprise to me to find George Eliot writing of this so long ago - and I think there is little doubt where her sentiments lay (but then the issue in 'Silas Marner' was clouded by the involvement of the innocent and victimised, versus the guilty and self-possessed - but I'm sure that was written by design to emphasise a point).For a while 'Silas Marner' is a detective story. I had always thought Edgar Alan Poe was the originator of the detective story - but perhaps 'Silas Marner' may have been a trigger. This is an interesting mystery because we know who the culprit is and who the victim is - but will the culprit be exposed? and if so, how? For me, the circumstances of the crime was a little contrived but it did create a stimulating situation. But then the events of the story overtake the mystery and displace its resolution. When the resolution does come it is a real shock, not only to the reader but to characters as well - the ending is gripping and brings forth such desires for the four principle characters that I found it quite breathtaking to read.Some reviewers have bemoaned the use of this novel as a student reading text. I agree with them. I remember struggling through books inappropriate to my time when I was a student. It is only when people get older that they start becoming attuned to their history and the background to their society. The first George Eliot novel I read was 'Adam Bede' and its portayal of the Methodism I grew up with as an innovative cult was fascinating. But, as a youth, I'm sure it would have been just wierd. What would I recommend as a student text? Something current and engaging. As I have suggested elsewhere Philip K Dick's 'A Scanner Darkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"The plot of this book was very anbsorbing.

I thought it would serve as a good intro into her work but the novel was far too simple in prose and spirit. While there is nothing wrong with the story of spiritual rebirth that's all it adds up to - a story. For me the definition of great literature is not just a good story but something which takes advantage of the art of writing by plumbing into the heart of humanity and translating it so the reader can feel what has been written. To put it simply, great literature can not be translated into a movie without losing what made it so great. This book can be easily translated into a movie as there is not much going on outside of the story. No deep character analysis, no discourse on anything really outside physical perception. From the plot the book should have been a very emotional read but it wasn't. Eliot's prose wouldn't allow it. She really serves as an outsider looking on these characters and situations rather then someone intimately familiar with the emotions and thoughts which make up the themes of the book. So, in turn, I felt like an outsider reading it. This would make a good movie where the story and physical emotion are the most important aspects, but as a novel it doesn't do the craft justice. In terms of English Victorian era literature Silas Marner just can't compare to novels by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Tragedy without compassion, a story ending with just deserves, with out loosing sight of the reality of life for the times."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"so sorry that i accidentally got my loaner book wet and had to buy a replacement. the cost for this product was a little much for such an &#34;old&#34; book, but was sure glad to find it so that I could get it replaced!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"The audiobook is read professionally.

I was very pleasantly surprised. In a few places, the language is a little tedious. Mostly, it is read with a lively colorful and varying voice, that brings the novel vibrantly alive. That is saying a lot since it is piece of writing that is almost 150 years old."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"If you're required to read this book in high school, then kudos to your teacher for introducing you to George Eliot.Having said that, when I was in high school, I wouldn't have appreciated George Eliot either. She was a master crafter of literature, choosing words thoughtfully and laying patiently the foundation of characters, observations, storylines to form a more perfect novel. In other words, to most high school readers of classic literature, her books can be boring.But wait at least 10 years, pick up her works again, and find yourself pulled into stories that simultaneously take you back to provincial Victorian England while portraying the lives of characters who could be your friends, family, yourself.Silas Marner is a wonderful precursor to Eliot's Middlemarch. The story focuses on the main title character, of course, following this sad little weaver from the time he was a respected member of his community to the moment he was cast out to his wandering and settling in sleepy Raveloe where he seeks to be left alone. Betrayed by his best friend and rejected by his fellow worshippers at Lantern Yard, Silas loses faith in God and people. He means to live the rest of his life in Raveloe, shielded from the God who failed him and from people who would only disappoint and hurt him.He passes the next 15 or so years of his life, shunning society who responds to this odd-looking stranger by alienating him. Silas finds solace in weaving, weaving, weaving, accumulating gold for his work, and transferring his love to these gold pieces.Silas' core is shaken again by a shocking event, and he is in danger of soon dying a broken man. He is restored when a little girl with golden curls toddles into his life. He comes to believe the gold he lost came back to him in this \\"golden-haired replacement.\\" And from then, Silas is slowly drawn back to life, back to society, back to faith in God. The little orphan he saves and names Eppie ends up saving him.Sounds like a simple almost sappy story, no? Under George Eliot's pen, it's a wonderful telling of faith (in God, in people, in life) lost and found because of unconditional love for a little child. But it's also much more than that. The story explores themes of alienation, societal rejection of otherness and being different, questions of where one fits in society and how that role is interdependent on one's participation in society as well as its acceptance of one on what terms, love of course as a restorative panacea, love between a father and his adopted daughter trumping all, and so many different aspects of life and its challenges and rewards.All of these ideas are so expertly presented and turned over, my eyes were sometimes stopped dead in their tracks by a passage that I would then reread several times to appreciate the beauty of its truth and language. I'm about to date myself (I'm currently in my late 30s), but I just had to share one of the most memorable observations I'd read in a long time. It's about Godfrey Cass, a man who seems to have everything, except a child to call his own:\\"Meanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never *can* be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dulness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good.\\"I don't think George Eliot is saying here that Godfrey is silly for wanting a child when he has everything else a man could possibly want. It is the idea of many men and women never being able to be truly happy and forever chasing some thing, which they find is lacking in their life at that time, because they're sure that thing will make them happy. This is the classic middle crisis, but it is universal in us all to desire what we can't have and to think our happiness depends on us getting it. It doesn't of course.I say this book is a precursor to Middlemarch because we start to see in this novel George Eliot's beginning of writing novels with distinct townsfolk full of characters as memorable as the main characters -- folks that populate a village and are as recognizable as your kind neighbor, local bartender, neighborhood elder. I'm thoroughly entertained George Eliot's creations here: Mr. Macey, Dolly Winthrop, Squire Cass and his brood, Nancy and Priscilla and their respectable kin.So why did I not give this 5 stars? Honestly, it was too short. Much time was spent on Silas and his life before finding Eppie, but not enough was flushed out in the story after. I loved the chapter when Eliot described how this old bachelor is suddenly befuddled by the two-year-old he's adopted and becoming a father to her. Where does he begin? And when Eppie turns 3 and mischievous, it's hilarious to follow Silas as he tries to discipline his precious...and can't. Those little nuggets are treasured by this newish mom. But it comes to an end too soon and Eppie is next seen as an 18-year-old girl about to embark on her new life.The second part of the book feels hastily completed. Loose ends are tied up; difficult conversations improbably take place and are resolved in one day; Silas' journey to his old life at the former Lantern Yard and back home to Raveloe is rushed; and Eppie's story has its happy ending.Had George Eliot wanted to keep writing to flesh out all these paltry scenes, I would have happily kept reading and delighted to have given this book a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Don't read the review following this one unless you want all the plot points revealed.If you've read George Eliot before, you know to expect interweaving plot lines, good characterizations and moral themes. This story is shorter than Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, therefore not as deep in its levels and plot lines, but still absorbing and satisfying.It's the story of a bitter man, older than his years; a young child who changes him, and how their lives are interweaved with the lives of another, wealthy family. It's filled with life: tragedy, comedy, scenes you want to read out loud. George Eliot is a wonderful writer, one who can transport you to the English countryside and to the time period so you feel like you are there, and you always care deeply for the characters.I think very young readers might find feel there are \\"too many descriptions,\\" but I found it very entertaining all the way through. And I love those old-fashioned endings, where you find out what happens to everyone."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner / 0-553-21229-X\\"Silas Marner\\" is a wonderful story of maintaining perspective in life - a tale extremely comparable to Charles Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\". In the height of his youth, when he is healthy, happy, and totally in love, young Silas is betrayed, cast down, and taught the 'lesson' that only the criminal and avaricious get ahead in life. He moves to a new town and abandons any attempt to connect with the society around him, instead focusing on hoarding his wealth and lovingly counting his money nightly. When his precious hoard is stolen, Silas is again crushed, but the arrival of a small \\"angel\\" - a little orphan girl with golden curls - starts him down the long road to redemption.A powerful aspect of this novel is the use of foils and counterparts against the main character as he learns his life lessons. The members of the local nobility live out their seemingly \\"perfect\\" lives unhappily, having not learned the lesson that Silas has learned through his exploitation as a lower-class member of society. By the time the local nobility realize what a treasure Silas' adopted orphan would have been in their barren home, it is too late; only the poor and miserly old man truly understood in time the value of living life for the sake of another.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I think the reader made all the difference.

Making a review of George Eliot's extraordinary oevre is like wandering into the panel lined smoking room of a centuries old men's club, settling into an over stuffed leather easy chair and taking a quantum leap backward...to sentences that actually charm, to pacing that suggests rumination, to the astounding gender explosion of this amazing woman's body of work so finely capturing a man's experience regardless of gender in writer or reader.

In his home-town, Silas Marner is wrongly accused of a heinous murder, forcing the poor weaver to move to Raveloe; there, his life-savings are stolen by a greedy aristocrat. Through this fictional character and his grievances, George Eliot brings tremendous support to the idea that Providence will mend things and make them whole, and that we can survive our trials by trusting in this goodly power. Although the plot develops slowly, it is engaging. You cannot help but sympathize with Silas when his reason for living- his money- is taken from him. He is devastated, and when neighbors come to offer support, he remains speechless. Life seems to have crushed him with its unfairness. It is at this point of despair that Providence intervenes, bringing an orphan girl to Silas' cottage. Silas finds her mother dead in the snow, but still he &quot;had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by whihc [the arrival of the girl] could hav ebeen brought about&quot; (115) The little girl, Eppie, transfroms Silas' reclusive life into one full of love and new happiness. Eppie comes to life as she &quot;toddles about&quot; and &quot;clings&quot; to weaver, who receives her affection awkwardly. Eliot shows, through heart-warming descriptions, how fate has blessed Silas by its miracles. Silas learns that the key to contentment is to remain optimistic. He learns the truth of neighbor Winthrop's advice: &quot;. . . isn't there Them as was at the making on us, and knows better and has a better will? And that's all we can be sur eon, and everything else is abig puzzle to me when I think on it&quot; (148)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Life is what happens while we're busy making other plans...\\" John Lennon's lyric are words to live by in this hardy Victorian chestnut about a simple miser who finds love at his doorstep one snowy evening.Published in 1861, George Eliot's novel has a reputation for dreary earnestness that kept me away from it for quite some time, until I decided to make an effort at reading all the books I successfully avoided in high school. \\"Silas Marner\\" turned out one of the easier assignments, not only because of its shortness and simplicity, but for Eliot's engaging manner of writing, which feels less wedded to its time than even more famous writers of her generation like Dickens.Marner is a weaver and a kind of social exile who sets up his home and business in the English country town of Raveloe. Not happy but content, he spends his time either working or sleeping, his sole recreation being the counting of his gold coins. All this is suddenly taken away from him, but Silas's misfortune turns out to be a blessing, pushing him out of what had been a rut-like comfort zone.\\"Our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us,\\" Eliot notes early on in Silas's transformation. \\"There have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud.\\"There's a lot to like about \\"Marner\\" the novel. The title character is a real treasure of literature as Eliot describes him, not because he's particularly exciting so much as because he's so readily identifiable, especially with those of us who are old enough to know disappointment in life. Many reviewers here compare him to Scrooge; Marner is a materialist and a bitter social outcast, but unlike Scrooge he retains a certain palpable sympathy and humanity throughout. This in turn makes the character's journey more compelling.Eliot captures a pastoral vision of English village life that feels absorbing and affecting, even if it is a bit gauzy. Her philosophic asides are marvelously quotable without ever getting in the way of the narrative. Her plot twists are well designed and hardly predictable, at least to me; I was especially impressed by how she dealt with a long-absent antagonist late in the story.But here's an odd criticism for a Victorian novel: It wasn't long enough. That's actually a problem, as the central game-changing transformative act of \\"Silas Marner\\" takes place when the novel's already half-over, and from then on the story speeds toward a spotlessly tidy resolution. The development of Silas's relationship with the others in his village, and with the little girl that changes him, feels rushed.To want more of a book is thin criticism of what is there. Perhaps a solution might be to read it again, for Eliot's ruminations on how people deal with the specter of misfortune, using various designs to try and ward it off, are both deep and charming. Her metaphysics are a trifle muzzy (I'm not sure if she was a Deist or an agnostic; maybe she was both at various times) but her take on the human condition comes across as well-grounded and relevant. She is a keen social critic, but not a blanket one; her take on organized religion manages to be both dubious and positive.In short, this woman with a man's nom de plume is very hard to pigeonhole, which also goes for her nifty novel. To adults like me of a certain age, the title may suggest boring homework assignments thankfully dodged, but \\"Silas Marner\\" is a real treat worth picking up."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is a great classic that tells a wonderful truth. I loved reading about the village and how mysterious it was. George Eliot twines a great story about a lonely man who keeps to himself until a surprise shows up at his house.

I picked it up the for the first time when I was 15 years old. It was required reading in English class. Being a cynical teenager, I balked at it at first. As the class got into reading it, I was totally taken with the complex story line. I loved it. It is one of the best books I ever read and reread. A few years ago, I mentioned it to an English teacher who jokingly asked me to \\"compare and contrast the moral revelation between Scrooge in a Christmas Carol and Silas Marner\\". Well I replied, Scrooge changed his ways and realized what was important by being confronted with the unlikely encounter with the supernaternal; Silas Marner came to his realization through \\"bad eyesight\\". My answer brought much laughter, which of course was my intention. Read this book and love it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Like so many other American high- schoolers I with great difficulty went through this work. Years later I subjected one of my children to the same ordeal when she needed to write a book- report. And this because I found then and now, this moral tale of redemptive love to be moving and instructional. For young people and I expect for most readers today the complexity of Eliot's language is an obstacle to be overcome. She writes the kind of sentences the masters of style have been teaching Americans not to write for years. But she writes with great intelligence and intuition, great moral feeling. The story of the weaver unjustly accused of a robbery, who retreats into his own private world and who is later redeemed by his meeting and taking care of an orphan child is one which cannot help but touch the heart. And as Hawthorne said when the heart is touched we begin to be .And this work comes alive with the old codger's care for and love of the orphan child. Like Scrooge the other great scowling isolato of nineteenth century Literature he exemplifies and proves the greatest moral lesson of all, that in loving and caring for other human beings we become human ourselves.Who can make it through the difficult language will find not only a very detailed and convincing description of English village life in the early nineteenth century but also a warm tale of the human heart healing itself through love."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I first read Silas Marner when I was 18 years old, and loved every word. I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to \\"get into\\" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"There are few great novels about people who are basically good and who are, in the end, rewarded for it. I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Jan 28 2010 - Melvyn Bragg discussed this novel with leading academics in the UK. See [...] where this can be listened to............SILAS MARNERPublished in 1861, Silas Marner is by far Eliot's shortest and seemingly simplest work. Yet beneath the fairytale-like structure, of all her novels it offers the most focused expression of Eliot's moral view. Influenced by the deconstruction of Christianity pioneered by leading European thinkers including Auguste Comte and Ludwig Feuerbach, Silas Marner is a highly sophisticated attempt to translate the symbolism of religion into purely human terms.The novel tells the story of Silas, a weaver who is thrown out of his religious community after being falsely charged with theft. Silas is embittered and exists only for his work and his precious hoard of money - until that money is stolen, and an abandoned child wanders into his house.By the end of her lifetime, George Eliot was the most powerful female intellectual in the country. Her extraordinary range of publications encompassed novels, poetry, literary criticism, scientific and religious texts. But beneath her fierce intellecualism was the deep convinction that for society to continue, humans must connect with their fellow humans. And it is this idea that forms the core of her writing."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Newspaper readers were invited recently to submit their choices for the greatest works published in the English language. When the choices were totalled, two works by Shakespeare featured in the top ten. Also featured, I was pleased to see, was a novel by George Eliot. Internet users, familiar with her works, will probably guess which of her novels was chosen. For those unfamiliar with her works, the best one to start with is \\"Silas Marner\\", a much shorter one. It is short, it is easy, it even works well in schools (as I can testify), and yet it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.George Eliot sets her 1861 novel in the early decades of the nineteenth century in rural England. Silas Marner is a weaver. In the pattern that life weaves, he usually features as a victim. Because he is unjustly \\"framed\\", he loses his reputation and his betrothed in the town where he grew up. After years working as a weaver and living like a hermit in a rural district then, he is robbed by an unknown thief who uncovers and makes off with the cache of gold guineas Silias keeps under his floor. Happiness and joy come to Silas, however, and at the end of the novel he is told, \\"Nobody could be happier than we are\\".George Eliot tells her tale with a mixture of womanly sympathy, sharp observation, tact, and humour. Her depiction of a long-gone past, and her clear pointing of right and wrong impulses, give the story qualities that are sometimes found in morality plays or in fairy tales. Don't skip over the scenes in the local inn, the Rainbow, where the simple-minded rustics discuss relevant issues, including the existence of ghosts.For those who appreciate hearing good literature read aloud, I recommend the unabridged audio format of \\"Silas Marner\\" where the reader is Andrew Sachs. As you might expect of this fine English actor, who made Manuel from Barcelona so memorable in \\"Fawlty Towers\\", he is especially wonderful in portraying the argumentative, credulous, muddle-headed rustics that foregather at the Rainbow. His reading extends for nearly seven hours."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I use Silas Marner with many of the students I tutor because it so effectively portrays that there are consequences to wrong actions.

Silas is a modern-day tragic hero, with a twist; his tragedy is turned into a fairytale wonder, and the rich nobility ofthe Cass family (the local Squierarchy) have tragedy and sadness.This book is important reading for anyone interested in starting out with Eliot, and more so as a powerful and moving story from which everyone can learn!

I'm a particular fan of writers from the late 1800s, but this story's plot line, set in an earlier period, snagged my attention. I fully anticipated enjoying \\"Silas Marner,\\" even though it falls in a period a bit more obscure to a modern reader.Alas, I am that modern reader. When Silas Marner was center-stage, the story moved along, and it was hard not to empathize with the false accusations he endures and the self-exile he chooses. I enjoyed the plots twists from darkness and isolation to deeper darkness, and finally to unexpected redemption. The appearance of the little girl, though less enigmatic than the synopsis implied, was a nice touch. Despite these highlights, I found myself plodding through numerous pages and scenes. The writing has some high moments, but it violates so many of the modern rules of fiction-telling, telling us instead of showing us, pounding home its points instead of letting them simmer just below the service. I truly wish English teachers would use creative minds of their own, instead of succumbing to intellectual pressures and pushing books with little accessibility or interest to a new generation of readers.I can fully understand this book's appeal to readers of its day. It wrestles with certain issues of class and status, with the hypocrisy of the rich and the religious, and the superstitious but honest efforts of the working class. I'm glad to have entered the world of \\"Silas Marner,\\" but, sad to say, I was also glad to leave it behind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This book IS slow...it's a Victorian novel, and full of descriptions of the people and the countryside, which makes it seem to drag in places. You have to have patience to read Victorian novels, and remember that at the time they were written, most people did not travel much, a journey of 5 miles in a carriage took an hour in good weather and on good roads, riding a horse that distance would take half an hour to 45 min, depending on the ablility of the horse and skill of the rider. Without TV and movies, people had limited opportunities to see scenes of other places than where they lived, so writers needed to describe scenes in detail. It is this richness in detail that attracts me to Victorian novels. I was not bored at all by this book.Silas Marner is a complex character, a nearsighted weaver, given to \\"fits\\" (possibly petit mal seizures), not handsome, and not wealthy enough to overcome his ugliness. He is betrayed by a friend, which puzzles him, rather than angers or embitters him. His neighbors distrust him, though they bear him no ill-will, for he comes from \\"outside\\" the village, and lives a short distance outside the village. The rift--such as it is--is partly due to Marner's nature, partly due to the villagers' natures. He becomes a miser, partly because he needs something to love, and gold is what he has....this becomes the object of his affections. Not because he cares to be rich, but simply because he loves the gold.He is robbed one evening. The thief is Dunstan Cass, a younger son of Squire Cass. Dunstan is a drunkard, a wastrel, a thug, and a blackmailer....he is blackmailing his older brother Godfrey (weak willed and spineless, easily led by the stronger-willed and cunning Dunstan), who has married an opium addict and kept the marriage a secret from his family, for fear his father would disinherit him. He pays Dunstan to keep silent. At one point, Godfrey collects rent from a tenent farmer, gives the money to Dunstan to buy his silence, and hopes not to be found out. However, he is unable to raise the money to repay his father for the rent he stole. He gives his prized horse to Dunstan to sell, but Dunstan kills the horse in a hunting accident. Dunstan walks home, past Marner's cottage, sees no one home, remembers the stories of Marner's hoarding of gold, finds the money and makes off with it. Marner comes home from his short errand, finds the money gone, and is devasted. He seeks help in the village to find the theif. But by this time, Danstan is gone, and the help the villagers can give is both confused and useless. The money is never recovered, and Marner almost loses his mind.During the New Year's party at the Manor, Squire Cass, his family (minus Dunstan) and his guests are enjoying themselves, not knowing that Godfrey's secret wife is coming with their child to force Godfrey to acknowlege her and pay child support. However, she drinks opium, loses her way in the snow, and heedlessly falls asleep under a furze bush. The child, about 2 years old, toddles aawy, a short distance to Marner's cottage, and enters while Marner is at the open door, in one of his \\"fits\\". He comes to, and sees the little girl asleep at the hearth. He traces the child's footsteps back to where the mother lies, frozen to death, under the furze. He runs to the manor to summon help, for he knows the village doctor will be at the party. Godfrey goes out with the doctor, for he has a suspicion who the woman is. He is relieved to find her dead, for this frees him to marry the girl he really loves.Marner insists on raising the little girl as his own child. Godfrey occasionally gives money or goods to Marner to \\"help\\" with the raising of of the little girl (called \\"Eppie\\" after Marner's sister, who died in infancy) but the bulk of the assistance comes from the villagers. Impoverieshed themselves, they nevertheless share what they have with the weaver and his child, and gradually their suspicions of Marner ease, and they become friendly with him.Fast Forward, to 16 years later: Eppie has become a beautiful young lady, loved and courted by one of the village boys. Godfrey and his wife, Nancy (whom he married shortly after discovering his first wife dead) are childless. Godfrey finally confesses his early marriage to Nancy, and tells her that Eppie is really his own child. Meanwhile, Dunstan's body is found, in the bottom the the stone pit, long filled with water, now drained. The bags of gold Stolen from Marner are with him. Godfrey is horrified by Dunstan's crime, and wants to make right all the wrongs done to Marner by the Cass family. He and Nancy decide to adopt Eppie, Nancy with the desire of righting a wrong, Godfrey with the desire to salve his conciense (he has a conciense, it's just a weak-willed one). They approach Marner and Eppie in Marner's cottage, and tell them the story, and that they would like to adopt Eppie, and give her all the privileges, comforts, and advantages that wealth can provide. Maner, thinking of Eppie's future, agrees, though it breaks his heart. Eppie, however, thanks Godfrey and Nancy kindly, but turns them down flat. She has no desire to leave the only father she knew, the villagers she's known all her life, and the young man whom she loves. Godfrey and Nancy leave, saddened and chastened.This is a story of redemptive love. Godfrey is redeemed by Nancy's devoted love of him; rather than berating him or leaving him for his early indiscretions and marriage, she continues to love him unconditionally. Silas Marner is redeemed through his love for Eppie; she literally changes his life, and he is a new man after she comes to him. The gold that Dunstan stole is returned to him, and he no longer cares about it. The desire to hoard is gone. The villagers are also redeemed; the man they formally shunned as an odditity and outsider is accepted into their homes as one of their own, and even the most belligerant village man (the farrier) is softened when Eppie comes to visit. Eppie, had she not been saved by Silas Marner, would have been an orphan and sent to a workhouse as soon as she could walk and feed herself.This is also a story about choices, and how making a decision can affect your life. Godfrey choses to marry in secret, and that choice leads to a life of fear, even after his wife's death, fear of people learning his secret, fear of his new wife learning his secret....he is never free of fear, until he chooses to confess his transgression. Marner chooses to keep the child, though he knows doing so will change his life, not necessarily for the better. A good-hearted village woman chooses to help him in this endeavor, rather than continue to shun him, and her life is enriched as a result.The differences in the lives of the rich and the poor is well definied. The rich, dispite all their wealth and privilage are the poorest in spirit. They are the useless idlers, the parasites, the criminals. The villagers, despite being impoverished, owning little or nothing, uneducated, are the richest, in terms of happiness and love.This is a powerful book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I may only pity the plight of American society, for time and time again I hear complaints lodged against the British literary canon (indeed, even the American canon) that the books written long ago simply hold no relevance and plod along with no point. There is no relevance to an outcast being condemned in Victorian society for being an outsider and different? But certainly this country has no racial problems, particularly as we are so incredibly lucid and politically correct. Look at how openly we welcome outsiders into our society. We are nothing like the people of Raveloe.Is this George Eliot's masterpiece? No.Yet what parent hasn't felt the dilemma Siras faces with his future with Eppie? Who hasn't had their faith deeply questioned by a deeply-felt wrong in the world? Who hasn't felt the guilt of being unable to speak the full truth to those loved the most?Oh, the plot isn't there. That may be the point, for can the life of a man who lives without the presense of love and only ambition call his existence a plot?

This is an interesting story and a recommended read. Is it pure gold? No. That is an over-statement. It is not another \\"Notes From the Underground\\" or \\"Death of Ivan Ilych.\\" It is a bit of a romance smaltz novel, and it is short. It is a long short story. But it is different from what one might think. After all, consider the author and the times in which it was written.The novel does have a measure of charm. The title is taken from the name of the lead character. He is a weaver in a small English town. One might say that he is a very dull character. But he has a few interesting events in his life - which I will not reveal here. There are only four interesting characters that run the complete length of the novel. They all live in the same small village. Also, there is a secondary set 3 or 4 characters. These are interesting and almost Dickens-like characters who drift in and out of the action.Coincidences give away the plot. That is a weakness. After 100 pages or so, or about 60% through the read, it starts to become clear what will happen. And, from that moment going forward it follows a most predictable script. Still, it is well written and colourful, and the novel does hold some delightful surprises.The novel is a quick read.Recommend. It ranks 4 stars."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I expected a masterpiece, instead I suffered through a predictable plot with religious overtones that were a little too heavy-handed & unsubtle."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is an excellently written book with many applicable themes. Although written in the 1800s its central theme and life lessons are still relevant today, truly making Silas Marner a classic. Because the book was written in the 1800s many words and the style of writing are hard to follow. This makes for a slow read, and although very descriptive, beats around the bush at getting to the point. For that reason alone i give it4 stars.The central theme here is the reedeming power of love. We see this in the evolution of the protagonist Silas marner. Silas is an old miser living in the English town of Raveloe. Silas was not always a miser. In his previous life in Lantern Yard he was falsely accused of a crime, and had his fianc&egrave; stolen by his best friend. As a result of these events, Silas became hardened, denounced God and moved away. For years he spent his time weaving cloth. He grew attached to his money, particularly the gold guineas. On the other side of the story we meet the antagonist Godfriey Cass. Godfriey is the selfish spoiled grown son of Squire Cass, the richest man in Raveloe. As the plot unfurls we see how these two very different peoples problems and lives intertwine, and through the power of love a life is restored, consequences are dealt, and the realization that nothing ever stays hidden.In sum the book is powerful for the reader who chooses to pay attention. When it gets bogged down with details, just keep reading knowing something great is around the corner."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"A rather sentimental tale of the recluse who regained faith and the ability to love his fellow man. If this didn't have the name George Eliot on it, I doubt this would still be in print, cause honestly, there isn't much to see here (move along.) Middlemarch is fan-freakin-tastic, don't get me wrong, but this one is nowhere near to that status. The story itself is rather unexciting, and there isn't (to my eyes) a depth of examination by a probing mind to merit serious study. Poor kids, having to read this in school! There's so much better, so much more worthwhile...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"SILAS MARNER/ By George Eliot/ David Campbell Publishers Ltd. *****What is faith? Faith can be something one believes in without knowing if it is really there. In the novel Silas Marner, George Eliot makes clear how a weaver loses faith in God. The weaver [Silas Marner] regains belief when he finds a little girl around the age of two wondering around his cottage. He raises her [Eppie] and becomes very close to her. While raising Eppie, Silas takes her to church to be raised and taught like a Christian. This novel has a great shift when his love for Eppie starts changing his personality. George Eliot describes Silas's as a person with no hope. He describes the lost of devotion when his best friend steals a bag of money from a dying man. His best friend then blames it on him. The decision was left to God; whether or not he was to blame. This method convicted Silas, which is when he decided to loose all his faith. Silas hesitates when he finds out that Eppie is Godfrey's daughter.Sometimes having faith can help people continue their daily activities. This novel is really captivating, and interesting. It can make you understand the different ways in which God protects his children. When Silas was to busy avoiding confrontation with God, God put Eppie on his path. If you are a person in need of finding yourself it would be a great idea to read this novel. It focuses in the struggles one has throughout their lives. The many obstacles one will have to go through to know that at end everything will be alright. Sometimes it helps to know that there is someone waiting for you on the other side. This novel's rating is a five because it captivates the readers mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I'm sure there are other good versions of Silas Marner available on CD or audiotape, but I must express my admiration for the reading by Andrew Sachs in an excellent unabrdiged edition of this Victorian classic. I was perhaps fortunate that I was not forced to read this book in high school when I might have found it a chore, so I approached the story with an open mind. Sachs manages beautifully to convey the inner life of Eliot's characters through his acting talent and his choices of slightly differing voices for each individual. A great reading of a great novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This is an odd little book, but it's a good one. It's odd because the famous story of the old miser who is redeemed by taking in an angelic little girl to raise doesn't really even begin until half-way through the novel. This was definitely a surprise to me, but it wasn't a bad one. It ends up that there is a lot more to this novel than I thought there would be. In that first half of the novel, George Eliot brilliantly elucidates the fallen nature of both Silas Marner and the community. They're are revealed to be such selfish and sinful people. They are all in the throws of despair, lamenting their plight as humans and questioning a God who placed them in their lives. Eliot is really wonderful at capturing the need of each individual for redemption and also that need in the community as a whole. The individuals are criticized as is the unfair societal structure. Into this fallen world comes the angelic Eppie, and that's when the story really picks up. Eppie is the catalyst of grace offering redemption to Silas and the rest of the community.Silas Marner is really an extraordinary little novel. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book (especially after you get through the first half) with a lot of valid criticism and some hope. It's a really beautiful little classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Long ago George Eliot breathed some life into these characters and their world of Raveloe, and if you look in on that place and time through the words on these pages, you'll find that things are still very vibrant there today. \\"Silas Marner\\" lives on because of the outstanding prose style and moral connundrums Eliot lays down as the foundation of her story.Her descriptions of people and places are so beautiful, her command of language so complete, and her style so refreshing, that it makes the world these people inhabit seem more alive and real than the worlds other authors attempt to spin. Her dialogue occasionly lets slip a touch of upper class pride, but overall her characters are expertly drawn, well filled out, and entertaining.The moral underpinnings of the story make it seem like a fable almost, but Eliot fortunately leaves final judgement of her characters up to the reader. Seeing Silas vindicated after so much going wrong for him made this worth the read for me. Despite some of the harsh realities of the class differences depicted, it is pleasant to watch the goings on in a small English town and to see Silas Marner at last catch some breaks and come into his own as a person. Even if it's a little unrealistic, heck, it's a novel so that's part of the fun.The choices we make for ourselves only determine part of our fate, Eliot seems to say with this story. Other things are not up to us, and those happen to us independent of any choices we make. I enjoyed pondering my own fate that way, through the lens of the little world of Raveloe. For such a short book, \\"Silas Marner\\" packs a lot of power in both language and meaning. This was my introduction to the work of George Eliot, and now I look forward to reading some of her other works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage? Quite a bit. As we read &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and watch him caress the only thing he has to love, the gold he's hoarded after so many years, we share in his grief when he comes home and sees it's been stolen. And the fact that it was the ne'er-do-well son of one of the town's most important people makes us more sympathetic. For each day, there are so many Silas Marners out there today, men and women who feel they are outsiders and who are victimized by those in a higher social rung. But we learn with Silas the more important meaning of life, when his old stack of gold is replaced by the new....the golden tresses of the child who wonders into this cottage to change his life forever. With rich characterizations, George Eliot creates a story that will move even the hardest heart. But look beyond the surface and see the indictment of the townspeople as well, who forced Silas into the outside, and then who welcome him."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"For any true connoisseur of life's ironies, there can be few finer than the fact that the radical Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) is chiefly remembered for this completely traditional and eminently conservative tale. We needn't rehearse the elements of the story in detail because virtually every English speaking youth on the planet reads it in school. Just to jog your memory, Silas Marner is a devoutly religious weaver who is unjustly accused of theft. He moves to Raveloe where he becomes fairly reclusive both because he wishes it so and because the villagers find him odd. He devotes himself to the accumulation of wealth, but is once again devastated, this time when he is the victim of theft. Ultimately he is redeemed by a young girl who wanders up to his door. He raises the child and they come to love one another as Father and Daughter. The lesson being that neither religious fanaticism nor the love of filthy lucre will suffice to save a man's soul, but the basic love between two humans will do the trick.It's a fairly simple and straightforward story about the capacity of love to heal spiritual wounds and make damaged beings whole, hence its power. Her other novels are in vogue right now, particularly the unreadable Middlemarch, but this is clearly Eliot's best and one of the most affecting novels of the 19th Century.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"A powerful novel about despair and redemptiom, when everything in Silas's world was gone something unexpected happened to replace his gold with a new golden life.Always darkest before the dawn.Hope for the hopeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"THIS BOOK HAD A LOT ABOUT LIFE IN IT AND WAS A GOOD LESSON TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TENDANCY TO DO THINGS BEHIND OTHERS BACKS.

It was written by a woman, who found it necessary to use a man's name because of attitudes in England in the nineteenth century. It is built around problems that all of us face in our lives, such as, \\"How important is money?\\" As in all great novels, the characters change as the plot develops.SILAS MARNER is a realistic novel because it portrays life in a real and believable fashion. The author, Mary Ann Evans, who used the pen name, George Eliot, pays careful attention to a few distinguishing details about here characters and settings.For example, we can see Silas Marner, the central character of the novel, with his pale skin and undersized body. We know how he looks with his large, near-sighted, bulging eyes. We can see the important-looking village of Raveloe, which lives peacefully in opulent neglect.When I was a teacher, I directed many high school sophomores to read SILAS MARNER. Most students dreaded reading the novel included in their literature textbooks. Once they met Silas and spent enough time with him to become acquainted with his unique personality, they became eager readers of this well-crafted classic.It has some of the same qualities that madePride and Prejudice (Vintage Classics)an endearing and enduring novel. In both works, the idyllic English countryside is an enjoyable escape from everyday life. There is romantic courtship in both, but the romance of SILAS MARNER is not the central theme; therefore it is not as compelling as that in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Since the readers are not required to become obsessed with yearning for romantic fulfillment, young guys who were in my class felt free to enjoy it. (Sixteen year old young men are still self-conscious about these matters.) Both books contain the same kind of satire buffered with compassion. In both novels we laugh with the local rural and village people. Because the language in SILAS MARNER is less complex, adolescent readers enjoy it more than they do PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.When as a student I first read SILAS MARNER in high school and when I read it with my students, I considered the coincidences plot weaknesses. Life doesn't work that way, I thought. Now that I have experienced a life of incredible coincidences, I no longer find anything in the book unbelievable. Events caused by Silas Marner's catalepsy seemed unlikely, but now they represent no problem.Theft with its resulting bitterness provides conflict with which the readers can identify. Earlier I found it difficult to believe that the lightning of theft could strike twice, but that part of the plot is one more realistic element now. Other twists and turns with their ironic mysteries are typical of human life as I have lived it.All the parts of the novel that seemed to be a contrived fairy tale are now a vignette of life. Even if I could not believe it all, the book would still break my heart the wayForrest Gumpdoes with its twists and turns of satirical accounts.When I enjoyed SILAS MARNER in my twenties with thirty teenagers at a time, I did not notice the shaping of Silas' religious beliefs as much as I do now. I remember that the students and I were indignant about the way Silas was duped by the evil church members at Lantern Yard. Now I have compassion for them, especially William, as well as for Silas.Mary Ann Evans showed the futility of idolatry. All my students understood the disaster of worshiping money. If I could return to my students, I would like to ask them what they thought of the villagers who seemed to rely on the habits of their church to bring them close to God. Could we discuss that in the 21st century? I feel sure we would discuss the addiction to narcotics as it is realistically portrayed.SILAS MARNER is a great English novel not difficult to read, but rich in insights. It shows what is evil and what is good in human hearts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This is a very touching story.

Repulsed by his appearance and cataleptic fits, he is ostracized by the community. After losing his faith and having his fortune stolen from him, his fortunes change over time.The fascinating subject is not Marner but the town, Raveloe, whose characters are of particular interest. It is interesting how Eliot spends more time discussing their thoughts and actions than the does Marner, the title character.I was interested in this book from reading Middlemarch and found Marner to be decidedly more entertaining, but not as in-depth. Yet there are important themes found in Marner--the loss of faith, the good of the community vs. the rights of the individual, and the importance of social class (this is present in every British novel).Marner is a masterpiece--written by a woman in the nineteenth century, the book's unassuming nature belies its importance as a great literary work. It is also an entertaining book to read, and not too difficult, seeing its short length.

Godfrey Cass repents of his sordid past; acknowledges his parentage of Effie and confesses all to his forgiving wife Nancy.George Eliot wrote this short novel in 1861 prior to beginning her long and largely forgotten novel \\"Romola \\"The novel reminds this reviewer of the tale woven on the loom of Dickens imagination called \\"A Christmas CArol\\" dealing with the redemption of the miser Ebeneezer Scrooge. Scrooge is redeemed by the ghosts of Christmas and the sick lad Tiny Tim.George Eliot was a freethinker who held to a high moral standard of behavior. She knew rural England and its folkways well for it was here she grew to womanhooid. Her use of the customs, dialects and culture of the British peasantry is superb. She was before Thomas Hardy on the literary landscape and surpasses that great author in her ability to delve deeply into the human heart in conflict with itself.Many readers may have been turned off to Eliot through being forced to read \\"Silas Marner\\" in high school. These readers deserve to reread this beautiful parable of love and redemption. \\"Silas Marner\\" was the favorite novel by George Eliot. It deserves to live as long as the English language. Its message of loving hope is eternal."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"&quot;Silas Marner&quot; by George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is a wonderful book about love, betrayal, responsibility and the authoritative role that religion can have on someone's life. You travel with Silas Marner (the main character) as he finds himself through the love of a child. You see him abandon his previous life and travel far away as he starts again in a place that is unknown to him. You encounter the Cass brothers who have everything to hide and nothing to give. You will see through this novel how lies can only seep you in farther and how chance can give you everything back. This novel will have you wondering what happens next and how people will get out of trouble. You'll see Silas go from a lonely man to a law abiding citizen of his little town and how friendship and neighbors (in any form) can be helpful. The best thing about this book is that you'll see how the love of a child can change everything about a person from what they believe in to how they live their day to day life. BEWARE...you will have to get over the obstacle of reading the first couple of chapters before you get to the &quot;meat&quot; of the book. Don't fall into despair and throw the book away!!! Keep on reading. Everything in the first couple of chapters is needed. DO NOT SKIP IT!! I promise you will find yourself loving this book just as I have come to love it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I've just spent the day reading this book. It's one of those stories that unexpectedly warms the soul and grips the heart.The plot is simple: Silas Marner, a naive young weaver, is betrayed by his best friend. Deeply hurt, he leaves his home for a village where he cares for no one and has no connections. He becomes increasingly reclusive, focusing only on the his weavings and the gold they'll bring. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, Silas covets his gold until it's the only thing he's living for. And then the gold is stolen.It takes a miracle for the gold to come back in the form of a fair-haired, trusting little girl whom Silas names Eppie. Once, the gold robbed Silas Marner of the outside world; now, it comes back to help him reclaim his joy.I'm fifteen years old and will remember this story for the hopeful message it builds up, but I know anyone be uplifted when they get to know Silas and Eppie."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I have to begin by saying I took a Victorian Literature class in college about 11 years ago. I had to read this book... and I did not like it at all.As another reviewer mentioned, I am now thirty and read it again. I now love this story! It is a story of loss, love and redemption.A miserly Silas Marner loses the one thing that makes him feel complete, at least he thought it did. His stash of Gold gone Marner opens up to the people around him for the first time in years. He also meets the little girl who changes his life forever.Silas Marner is a story about finding love and learning how to love someone else. It is also about the miniscule value of possesions as compared to the relationships we can build with those in our lives.Read this book... If you read it before and hated it, or have never read it... It is well worth your time. This classic story written by George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) will change your view of the world."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner became a bitter, lonely miser after he was accused of stealing church money. Declared guilty even though he wasn't, Marner lost his relationships with friends and loved ones. He moved away to a small town and secluded himself from any social activities or events. The people in this new town didn't bother him, but they thought he was strange and evil. Silas found his security in his gold which he stored up in his house. His treasure became his only companion. But when his gold was stolen one night, Silas thought he would die right then and there. He had no reason to live. Then one day, a little girl walked into his home and into his life. Her mother had died, leaving her as an orphan. So Silas adopted her and raised her in a poor hard-working sort of way. But, she loved him and he loved her. The treasure that Silas had lost had returned to him in a new form. He began to socialize with the people in his town, and no longer did they think he was weird or possessed. This girl brought about changes in Silas' life. He discovered that there are some things more precious than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage? Quite a bit. As we read &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and watch him caress the only thing he has to love, the gold he's hoarded after so many years, we share in his grief when he comes home and sees it's been stolen. And the fact that it was the ne'er-do-well son of one of the town's most important people makes us more sympathetic. For each day, there are so many Silas Marners out there today, men and women who feel they are outsiders and who are victimized by those in a higher social rung. But we learn with Silas the more important meaning of life, when his old stack of gold is replaced by the new....the golden tresses of the child who wonders into this cottage to change his life forever. With rich characterizations, George Eliot creates a story that will move even the hardest heart. But look beyond the surface and see the indictment of the townspeople as well, who forced Silas into the outside, and then who welcome him."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This is George Eliot's most compact novel, but it is a stunner.It is basically the story of loss of faith, and its replacement--first, by money, then (when the money is stolen) by love. It is also a secular resurrection story: Silas, after losing his friends, his faith, and his fiance, becomes a reclusive, obsessive weaver, who is essentially dead to society and himself. He hoards his money, but when it is lost, he finds the baby, Eppie, who is a greater treasure, and who essentially restores his life.It is also a terrific study in Class Conflict--a favorite of Eliot's. Silas, of the lowest (almost serf) class, is hardworking, honest, helpful, whereas the Casses, Dunstan and Godfrey, are both aristocratic scoundrels. Dunstan steals Marner's money; Godfrey attempts to steal his child.The language may be daunting to modern readers, but it was standard prose for Victorian novels. Oddly, the most difficult chapter for readers today, Chapter 6, was the one most loved in Eliot's day: it is a tour de force of local dialect of the Midlands.Eliot, as usual, sees clearly, almost like God: she knows everyone's flaws and strengths, and is harsh on what causes harm to others; but she is always generous-hearted and understanding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is a classic.

My parents adopted 3 children, so I love this story's look at adoption and how it's the love and time put into raising a child that are important; being related by blood doesn't matter. This book shows that our mistakes can't truly be hidden; they will always be there in the back of our minds bugging us until they are exposed in the end. So it's best to take responsibility for our mistakes and go through the repentance process, instead of hiding mistakes for \\"convenience.\\" I love how Silas is healed from his suffering and gloom through the love of a child.

They use first-class voice actors and sound effects. However, this version does not quite reach the level of the original book. It is not that there is any lack of quality, but just that something is lost in translation when a book is dramatized. No matter how good a dramatization is, it loses some of the depth of the book.However, this dramatization is high-quality entertainment and I highly recommend it.

And as the book went on, I almost felt myself getting dimmer,more cut off from society. It was rather sad.The book isn't the best representative of what life in 19th century England would have been like, but it is a very good picture of how uncultured people treat other people from other lands. It's only when misfortune falls upon that person, do they accept them.I absolutely loved the fact that Silas found a \\"golden-haired replacement\\". That was the sweetest thing I've read in my life, how he instantly wanted to protect her and give her the best things in life. Godfrey seemed nice at first, but as the book uncovered his past, I started to like him less and less. He needed to act like a man, buck up and take control of his life, and not be constantly cowed by his father. I can understand due to the time period why he thought Eppie would come with him and Nancy, but still, the way he kept asking even after she said no the first time was rude.The book was very uninteresting in the beginning. I had to force myself to read it. It was only after Dunsey stole Silas's money that it began to be interesting. Still, it was a sweet book and I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"George Eliot is the best woman author I've ever read. She had God-given talent that you or I, no matter how much we read, no matter how much we write, could not consciously replicate. She had something which can't be taught, a kernel of genius hidden somewhere in the brain, which was allowed to express itself...to our collective benefit.Silas Marner, while not perfect, is something recognizably special--a book with lingering phrases, a book with extraordinary insight, a book that instates the reader with the feeling that the author knows what the hell she is doing. It's a book that matters.I know what you are afraid of: you are afraid this book will be a bloated succession of tea parties and persiflage with mutton-chopped vicars. No fear: the plot is credibly organic, and moves along briskly, wrapping itself up in just over two-hundred pages. It should hold your interest so that you can discover the ten or so gem-sentences dispersed throughout. Sentences that are not just airtight, but that meld with your mind, and cause an \\"Aha!\\" reaction. You know what I'm talking about.Perhaps the most convincing signal I can offer of my sincere regard for her abilities is the fact that I'll now seek out her other works...something I can't say about Virginia Woolf, for instance, whose literary inferiority to Eliot I would take as axiomatic. (Ironic, isn't it--or maybe not--that feminists seem to esteem Woolf more highly than Eliot?)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner by George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Evans, is a well-written story, made more so by the fact it was written by a woman in the Victorian Age. The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"The fact that Amazon has so many editions of Silas Marner available indicates that it is truly a classic if it is still being read more than 150 years after it was written.It is unfortunate that some high school reviewers (or former high school readers) feel that they had this book \\"forced\\" on them. Yes, the English language has changed since the early 19th century, especially for American readers of this British author.My suggestion would be to listen to \\"Silas Marner\\" as an audiobook, perhaps while reading along. I recently finished listening to this fine book narrated by Margaret Hilton, but I couldn't find her rendition among the titles available here. I'm sure there are many fine versions available.So, give this tale a listen, and let the language flow into your ears.

I must have been nearly illiterate when Silas Marner turned up as part of my 9th grade English class. By all recollection, the text was reprinted into our English text book for that year; and it was a class-wide assignment during that year.My best memory is that I couldn't read it; I couldn't understand a thing about it; it was daunting. Somehow, I got a good grade in the class: it was either that the standards had already fallen or maybe that it was just the Cliff's Notes allowing me to escape the experience with pretense that I may have actually read it at the time.So, it happened to come across my desk four decades later (February 2013); actually it showed up on my Kindle app when we purchased the complete works of George Eliot, when my wife wanted to read Middlemarch --- who knew that George Eliot was a pen name for a female author of the early 1800s, at a time when only male authors could garner a readership.I suppose a theme of man's moral certitude and the perseverance of man's spirit could be a central message here. But I wasn't struck with a particularly artistic nor elegant narrative. It all seemed a bit on the stilted side, although with some flowery language sprinkled in. The unfolding of events is more or less just told straight out, and not revealed using a colorfully narrated unfolding of events.I ploughed through it with a sense of duty to complete something that I only pretended to complete in high school. And I was immensely relieved to discover that it wasn't unreadable, as I had thought all these years.

Eliot opposed the cheery images of villagers happily frolicking in their quaint but comely homes. She intended to inject a lasting note of rustic realism in the person of Silas, a character deliberately conceived as a fairy tale creation. By depicting the metamorphosis of Silas from one of twisted values to one of traditional humanistic ones amidst the background of the pastoral fairy tale, Eliot was able to present a believable tale of personal redemption that made use of the political, economic, and social changes that were transforming England from a rural to an industrial based economic system.Silas is initially seen as a sympathetic character who suffers from a false accusation of theft in his small rural village. It is this village that connotes a totality of pre-industrial images of which much of England's older population still retained vivid memories. After his journey to Raveloe, he lives in a small cottage where he works as a weaver and slowly accumulates a hoard of gold which he keeps buried in the floorboards. He likes to play with his gold in a non-productive manner that now calls to mind the similar antics of the cartoon character Scrooge McDuck, both of whom saw their treasure only in terms of watching it grow. This gold is the central symbol of the book, for when he encounters the golden haired Eppie, he transfers his fascination from coin to strand, a changeover which mirrors a similar melding of gold as non-functional to gold as human functional in that a growing capitalist society began to include increasing numbers of newly rich middle class entrepreneurs who put their gold to productive use. As Silas raises Eppie from baby to young woman, he similarly raises his own consciousness so that the bitterness that led him to Raveloe he now sees as but the first step in his redemption. It is not only his ability to shed his bitterness that marks his emotional growth. He now can reintegrate himself into the community of men that he symbolically discarded when he entered the isolation of his secluded home. He further comes to trust in a Higher Power that he was sure had discarded him earlier. Finally, through Silas, Eliot shows that personal redemption also includes the belief that justice delayed is not justice denied. Contrapuntally, the one who stole the treasure for which Silas was blamed did not escape justice. He was killed by falling into a stone pit. Godfrey Cass, who refuses to identify himself as the true father of Eppie, is punished for doing what Silas does willingly. Godfrey must endure seeing his daughter raised by the very one whose purse is dwarfed by Godfrey but whose heart dwarfs Godfrey's. In the regeneration of Silas' nearly lost humanity, Eliot shows that as long as one has someone to care for, then the giving of care results in its return with interest, sort of like investing gold rather than hoarding it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I would say that it is very difficult to read, but that makes you want to understand.

There is not enough tragedy or bittersweetness at the end to make you think about it constantly and writhe in the pain of the characters, thinking, if only. I really get into books like that. But this book, however good and painful throughout ended TOO happily. I do like the fact that Silas had to endure so much. It made it a tempestuous book, and painful to read.

Evans crafted a beautiful plot, and captivates the readers once the background chapters have been set up, and the action begins. It is rare that such a book in our day and age exists, and it is nice to read the popular things that were back in that day and age. I, being in high school, had the option of reading this book or Evans' other brilliant novel, \\"Middlemarch\\". I thought this might be an excellent read, so I chose this.At first, I thought I had made the wrong choice and thought of switching to \\"Middlemarch\\" before it was too late. It starts out slow if you are reading Eliot for the first time, but the mind is only preparing itself to the odd language of the period (thank goodness it isn't Old English). However, once the background of Lantern Yard and Raveloe have been given to us, along with Silas Marner's history, we dive straight into the plot -- Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, Nancy Lammeter, The Red House, The Rainbow, Silas, Eppie, Molly, Priscilla, Squire Cass, Dolly Winthrop, Aaron -- all characters and places which set us into the story. With the dialogue and tension perfectly set, it is no wonder why this has become a classic.Perfect for a classroom, Silas Marner promises each person who reads it a lesson in what really matters to the heart -- in Silas' position, I would have chosen the golden locks too."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I cannot more agree with the reviewers who say Silas Marner is slow moving at the beginning, and that it is slow moving for the first half of the story, however I find that Silas Marner is not actually a story, more a biography, or a discription of the times. The scenes are that era are very vivid; the characters are very true and clear. Silas's betrayal, his 'death' and his obsession with money are reflected in the monotony of the book, just when you begin to feel the story has completely lost track of any clear-cut line, something new happens. Then, Silas is reborn, he remembers who he has been and his family. The most wonderful thing about this book is its summing up, happy ending. Nothing is left hanging, this book definatly has a good ending, and a book with an ending such as this is clearly the work of a gifted author; such as George Eliot. Do not read this book in search of thrilling plot, and captivating characters, read it for it's planning, and mostly for it's joyful conclusion."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Middle March\\" is often regarded as George Eliot's greatest novel but \\"Silas Marner\\" is undisputedly a novel foray by the Victorian authoress into the realm of the rustic. First published in 1861,this masterpiece has transcended much beyond the bars of time and even in the 21st. century retains its ambition to tell a colossal saga in a genteel fashion boldly underlined by a conversational tone. \\"Silas Marner\\" is a brief and tightly cultural story invoking a symmetrical plot and adroit symboism to depict the tale of a linen-weaver who loses everything in his life only to discover them in a more divine,vibrant and concord dimension.Silas Marner is a poor,hapless linen-weaver who leaves his own village after being framed in a robbery case by his friend William Dane who goes on to marry his lover Sarah. Ignominy,betrayal and a haunting sense of being abjectly wronged conspire to lead him elsewhere and Silas Marner finds respite from his unforgiving past in the village of Raveloe. Here none is cognizant with his bitter history and Silas becomes a \\"simple weaver\\" and all the more enigmatic for it. He creates an atmosphere of mysteries around him and remains confined in this narrow scope of self-development for fifteen heavily limping years. He hoards up a massive amount of gold and silver but favours miserly expenditure. And then when everything gives the impression of being normal and steady,life takes a sharp bend for Silas Marner and forces him into a strange world.Running parallel with this story of a diminutive figment of the domain of village is the gentryfolk version of a life inndated with posh manners and biting apprehensions,this too in Raveloe. Godfrey Cass is the eldest son of the Squire who succumbs to his brother Dunsey's blackmail and leaves him his horse to sell. Dunsey Cass epitomises all that is lavish and bad and nonsense and grotesque and crooked and deceitful and cunning in a gentry society. He kills the horse in a freak accident and then to save his skin,steals the money from Silas Marner's dilapidated house. At the heart of \\"Silas Marner\\" lies his robbery---it lends an excuse to George Eliot to intersect two different,and at times poignantly contrasting,worlds and in this scheme,the reader is invariably led to ruminate on William Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",where the two parallel stories,one concerning Antonio's plight thrusted upon by Shylock and the other describing Bassanio's endeavour to win Portia,coincide at the critical junction to shape the drama into the right posture. This comparison is not to say that Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" and Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" resonate with each other but goes a long way really to prove tat the intersection of the various works of literature are not that detached from the intersection of events in a single work of the same.This robbery transmutes the eponymous protagonist of the novel from \\"a half-crazy miser\\" to a God-fearing man of depth and substance. That very same night Silas Marner's house is radiated by the return of the lost gold and silver pieces in a more divine and colourful form:\\"a tamp's child\\". Silas is bold enough to accept her as his daughter and despite being a bachelor,he undertakes for the development of the girl-child he baptises as Eppie. Eppie's growth and realisation of the world in the subsequent years spent amidst poverty and few glimpses of fortune results in Silas's own comprehension and rise from a one-dimensional figure to a pluralistic person,\\"There's good i' this world---I've a feeling o' that now;and it makes a man feel as there's a god more nor he can see,i' spite o' the trouble and the wickedness\\"---this may seem as the ultimate realisation of Silas Marner but it's not as much the understanding of Silas about life as the authoress's recurrent theme:that life,despite all the human,divine and unforseen forces perpetually thretening to distort its shape,is always beautiful.\\"Silas Marner\\" is virtually a ballad inprose and so inevitably always soaked in a gentle reassurance of poetic justice. Throughout these pages,the reader discerns elements of ballad structure,most notably in instances where the vivid flow of the tale is punctuated by phiosophical discourse. George Eliot's general framework of things in this book is great and occasioned with touches of delicate humour and subtle satire blent with the accent of superstitions so vehemently disturbing the society during the writer's era---all these features being reflected in the conversation at the Rainbow---augment the authoress's successful employment of a taut and intense yet elaborate and defining language. George Eliot may be focusing on a particular character in this novel but she doesn't neglect the suitable etching of other characters. art is symbolic in tone with singular effigies representing wider landscapes and in \\"Silas Marner\\" this nature is made pretty evident. Geofrey Cass embodies a man repressed by circumstances and personal fears,Dunsey is the sole villain in the piece,Nancy Lammeter proves a dedicated and devoted wife to Godfrey despite illustrating herself of a meek submissive nature bordering on self-denial,whilst Dolly Winthrop is the most accomplished of women characters in the novel,a constant source of sometimes vain but forever honest judgement and help to Silas Marner.George Eliot's language in this book is typically idyllic with a stunning coupling of narration and dialogue,the former being personal as well as philosophical and the latter neither lofty nor mundane but in essence commonplace and genuine. Dunsey's end is an apt revelation of the writer's belief that truth can never be obscured or erased. The book doesn't attempt to keep many mysteries from the reader---Eppie's father is forever a known person,Dunsey's ultimatum is never in doubt and the conclusion isn't that difficult to fathom. \\"Silas Marner\\" is not a superb classic only for the easy flow of its plot but also for the easy fairy-tale gratifications that it manages to combine with massive social and personal insights. This work must rank alongside the best novels of all time and indeed when George Eliot remarks this about Nancy's elder sister Priscillia,\\"She serves a little pepper to sprinkle over the talk---that's the reason why she never puts too much in her pies\\",we can easily qualify this statement to the authoress's ability to weave magic with her own talks and pies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people, when they are at their highest and when they are at their lowest points in life. Marner also writes about the good nature in others that can develop after ones worst moments in life. I really enjoyed this book and hope others will to.-Tipcat"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"On the surface, Silas Marner is a fairly simplistic fable about a jaded weaver who finds solace only in weaving and in counting his gold each night until a little girl appears on his doorstep and he finds meaning and life in her love loosing his obsessions and becoming a well adjusted and well liked person. I can see how some do not find it interesting. It was several weeks after I read it that I realized that maybe Silas Marner was not the main point. He doesn't actually do anything, after all. Everything happens TO him. He simply responds to what happens to him. To rediscover life through the love of a child is a good theme but look at Les Miserables. There is no comparison.Look instead at Godfrey Cass and consider the story with him as the main character. If Silas Marner is actually the counterpart for him instead of the other way around (like a constant in a science experiment), it starts to take on the qualities of a classic. Godfrey Cass is also jaded and harassed but he schemes. He tries to manipulate the circumstances to his best benefit - not in a malicious way, no more than Voltaire's Candide. If we look at it that way, what we have here is an English Candide for, with Silas as the counterpart instead of Godfrey, the moral changes to become, basically, 'Roll with the punches', or - as Voltaire put it, 'We must cultivate our gardens'."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"So, you've savored Middlemarch and reveled in Mill on the Floss. What do you read when you're in the mood for the kind of witty observations and perceptively drawn characters you loved in Eliot's masterpieces? Though more sentimental and simplistically plotted than Eliot's other novels, this slight little fable is nonetheless a rich and rewarding read. It's perceptive, touching and written with Eliot's characteristic grace and gentle humor."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This book is considered a true classic. The story about a miser who was driven from his original home by false acusations to end up as a miserable weaver in a new town. His life changes when he finds a foundling and begins to care for her. It turns out the girl is the daughter of landed gentry who now want her and Silas does not to give her back. The story is not bad, but I do not understand why it is such a classic. I must be missing something because it was originally written in 1861. It is possible I am missing the forest for the trees in this case. It is a fast read and it is not a bad book by any definition."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I bought this because I had just listened to Middlemarch (books on CD, 28 of them) and loved Eliot's writing so much I wanted more. While Silas Marner is good, it does not have the depth of Middlemarch. Characters in Silas Marner are not as well developed as those in MM with all their psychological nuances, ups and downs, ins and outs. Plus, having MM read by such a talented Brit with all the different accents, tones, intonations, and inflections was like having a theatre in the car as I drove across country. The biographical introduction to Silas Marner was well worth it and I intend to review those facts again."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Enjoyed reading it again.

The story is thought-provoking yet heart-warming. The questions and themes this short book presents are so deep and real and need to be thought about. You will be challenged about religion, views of God, light and darkness, and redemption. This book is such an enjoyable read, yet complex and challenging. Read it and you'll want to read it again!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Fortunately, I did not have to read this book in grade school, because I would not have gotten anything out of it at the time. For those interested in character-driven stories and with the patience for 19th-century prose, however, Silas Marner is worth reading.This short book tells the story of a man who more or less withdraws from life after a crushing betrayal, to be eventually reawakened through his love for a child. It's a sweet story, at times saccharine and with some all-too-convenient plot elements, but still, it's a good one. The writing, of course, is excellent, sometimes sarcastic, and peppered with incisive observations about human nature. For the most part, the characterization is excellent; I fully believed in the Raveloe villagers, and even the minor ones are distinct and realistic.But then there is Eppie, the original Pollyanna--so perfect she's more plot device than person. Even when she misbehaves, she does so adorably; as a toddler she never throws tantrums, and as a teenager she's never for a moment rebellious or selfish or withdrawn. She's a fantasy child, with none of the human foibles the other characters display, and it's because of her that the later part of the novel sometimes becomes saccharine.Overall, though, a sweet, enjoyable story from a gifted writer. I decided to try this one before Middlemarch, and it's good enough that I'm eager to try Eliot's major work."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I'm a huge fan of George Eliot, and as always Silas Marner did not lack for literary content and great prose. If you've never read Eliot before this would be a good book to start since it's relatively short. On the other hand, I felt the story lacked the powerful dramatic ending I was hoping for, and so I cannot say it is one my favorites by her. All in all a good read that leaves you with plenty to think about and ponder when you look at your own life and what are the things that are most important to you."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"oor Silas. He can't get a break. After falsely being accused of a crime, he relocates to another village, where he focuses on working and earning money, living an isolated, antisocial existence. He loves his money. In fact, that's all he loves. Then someone robs him, taking every last coin.George Eliot, pen name of Mary Anne Evans, wrote several novels capturing life in 19th century England. Silas Marner, first published in 1861, remains a timeless, moving story of one man's struggle and redemption in the face of adversity. When Silas was a young man, one of his closest friends betrayed him by framing him for a crime and stealing his girl. As if being betrayed by his friend wasn't enough, he was also betrayed by the church; the drawing of lots declared his guilt.Moving to a new town, he earns his living as a weaver, and lives a miserly existence. He had no other purpose in life but to earn and save money. \\"His life had reduced itself to the mere functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended.\\" His only pleasure, all he looked forward to, was taking the money out every night, counting it, stacking it, sorting it, and handling it. Until one night, it was gone.And as suddenly as the money disappeared from his home, a little girl appeared. Silas found the mother frozen by the road near his home. Without hesitation, Silas took on the task of raising her as his own, finding the fulfillment he had been missing all those years: \\"Now something had come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the earnings, drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money.\\"As the mystery of the missing money and the unknown parentage of Eppie, Silas's adopted daughter, come together, the story comes together in a clash of class and family that, while perhaps bordering on melodrama, is nevertheless moving and satisfying. When Godfrey, Eppie's biological father and a nobleman, comes to Silas and Eppie, the reader takes heart in Silas and Eppie's love for one another. On a personal note, I found the thoughts of Nancy, Godfrey's wife, on adoption were interesting. After they lost a baby and weren't able to conceive again, she had resisted Godfrey's wishes to adopt a child. \\"To adopt a child, because children of your own had been denied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the adopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would be a curse to those who had willingly and rebelliously sought what it was clear that, for some high reason, they were better off without.\\" I wonder how widespread this attitude was then, or even today. Certainly Silas's adoption of Eppie contradicts Nancy's view; Eliot clearly strikes a positive note for adoption here.As you might expect from a novel of the mid-19th century, many passages seem overly wordy and unnecessary. But even the dialogue and action that seems irrelevant to the story, like the men chatting in the pub, and the girls chatting as they're getting dressed for a formal dinner, add to the ambience by giving a realistic portrayal of the culture and language of the time.Eliot, decidedly not a believer, has little good to say about the church in Silas Marner. But Christians can don't have to try very hard to resonate with the moral lesson of the novel. The joy and rewards of life can be measured not by how much we save of what we earn, but by how much we give ourselves away in the service of others. James says pure religion is looking after orphans; Silas certainly embraced that call.Eliot's story is timeless and moving, and though it's a bit of a slog at times for the 21st century reader, it's certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I've always heard Silas Marner described as a drab read, a lesser work of George Eliot that is forced upon school children because it is George Eliot's shortest novel. I am happy to report that Silas Marner is neither drab nor a lesser work of Eliot. I found it to be an engaging, ultimately heartwarming and moral story about the true price of gold and human relations. It was a story that in many ways I found to be very relevant to today's society. As Jane Austen did before her, Eliot writes about human characteristics that transcend time.As the story starts, Silas Marner is a happy man with a good job as a weaver, a productive member of his church, a great best friend, and a fianc&eacute;e. Things suddenly take a turn for the worst when Marner's best friend frames him for a crime he didn't commit, and also steals his fianc&eacute;e. Bitter against his fellow church goers and town, Silas Marner moves away to a place where he is not known and where his weaving is prized. Making a good living, Marner values his gold and puts it above all human relations. Things soon change when his gold is stolen and a young child shows up on his door step shortly thereafter. He raises young Eppie as his own, until her real father shows up when Eppie is a teenager and wants to take her back. Will Eppie stay with Silas Marner or go to the father that abandoned her as a child?George Eliot created a wonderful cast of characters in Silas Marner. Silas is the main character, but his neighbor lady Dolly Winthrop, is a wonderful lady who helps him raise Eppie. Squire Cass and his family are also fleshed out and discussed in great detail as their lives often intersect with Marner's. I enjoyed listening to all of their lives. Nadia May was a great narrator. This was also the first book I listened to on my phone from the library. I love the system, but wish that there were more copies of digital audiobooks available to check out!The most fascinating part of the book for me was how George Elliot captured timeless qualities in human interactions and life. My favorite example of this is how a bunch of old guys are together talking about how the youth of today are lazy and nothing like when they were young lads. How often have I heard this talk throughout my life about how the youth of whatever day are terrible compared with older generations.Another example of this is problems with drugs. We hear about drugs in the news often and it seems like a problem just of today, but in Silas Marner, Eppie's mother has a drug addiction that leads her to take one last fix that ultimately kills her and leaves her child an orphan in the snow. The drug of choice may have changed over time, but the deadly effects of them haven't. As I continue to explore Victorian literature this year, I've noticed that drugs play a prominent role in many famous novels of that time.Overall, Silas Marner is a moving, intriguing story, with characters and situations that are timeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"One of the best classics that have been written. I read this book when I was young, and forgot most of it. I watched the movie with Ben Kensley and it was so good that I had to read the book again. The book was by far much better than the movie and I recommend it to anyone that loves period pieces. I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I dutifully read this book decades ago in Junior High School. The sum total of what I remember is the miser and there was something about a girl. It did not make any kind of impression, much less a profound impression. Now, many years later, I decided, for unknown reasons, to read this book again. And I am happy I did.Yes, this is a story of a miser who lives for his gold and silver coins. Having closed himself off from a world that has betrayed him, he finds his only solace in working to obtain his treasure and bringing his treasure out every night to look at it. But he is not a hard or cruel or even selfish man. He is nave and gentle. If he could just get rid of his gold, his life would be much better.Like its main character, the story itself is gentle. The villains hardly ever appear, mercy is prevalent and justice while an important element in the story is nevertheless mild. The story celebrates the quiet, unfashionable happiness of love at home.One of the features of this story is the revealing glimpse it provides of small town life during the era. Those familiar with Eliot's Middlemarch know that few portray small town life more accurately or sympathetically than she does. One has the sense that this is really what it must have been like to live in that time and place. From this accurate depiction, the story develops in such a natural way that new insight is given into why people become misers, and why rigid class distinctions exist even in rural country neighborhoods.The digressive, descriptive writing style prevalent in the Victorian era, is certainly present here, but this is a short book. My copy was only 150 pages. One can enjoy the leisurely pace of the story without having to make a long term commitment to the book. But the book still delivers an arresting climax that stays with me now that the book is done, and I expect I will remember it years from now. I did not remember any of it after reading it for school, but that is the difference between reading against your will and reading for pleasure. Silas Marner is a pleasure!

In training to be a religious man, he is falsely accused of being a thief and is betrayed by his best friend. Marner leaves town in disgrace and moves to a new place, where he mostly keeps to himself, weaving all day to make money. His gold, stored in a secret hole during the day and taken out to be stacked and counted in the evening, is his only companion.When Marner's money is stolen, his world is rocked again, and he lives in devastation and regret. But when an orphan appears in his cabin and nobody steps forward to claim her, Marner finally finds something of meaning in his life.This is a really sweet story of how a child's love can melt even the toughest of hearts. The path to Marner's destruction is long and heartbreaking, and my only complaint about the book is that there is so little about the life Silas and Eppie live together. I would have liked to have seen more of her growing up and the two of them forming a bond."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Question: How can you ensure that a person will hate a book? Answer: Make her read it for 7th grade English class, make sure that the language is old-fashioned, and above all, make sure that the ideas and concepts are over her head. If that's what happened to you, and that's why you have an aversion to Silas Marner, and you are now over 30, pick it up again. Read it twice. Silas Marner is one of the greatest novels in the English language.Yes, it starts out sad, as our pathetic hero looses both his trust in humanity and his faith in God. But the power of love replaces his lust for money, and wins out in the end. Meanwhile, morally poor but financially rich, high-living Godfrey Cass provides a counterpoint to simple Silas. At the end there's a surprise when the fate of Godfrey's evil brother is revealed.When you're all done, before you file Silas Marner on the shelf, go back and read the paragraph about Silas' thoughts when he discovers that his hordes of coins are missing. If you have ever felt sudden extreme loss, you will recognize the stages of despair from disbelief to acceptance \\"like a man falling into dark water.\\" Which is why this book is not suitable for children, and is most appreciated by those who have undergone their own moral redemption.Silas has been the inspiration for many other characters, including Dicken's Scrooge. He has been portrayed in movies, including \\"A Simple Twist of Fate\\" starring Steve Martin. But none is as good as the original. If you haven't read it since junior high, try it again.

In this story, George Eliot (pen name for Mary Ann Evans) depicts a man named Silas Marner, a weaver by trade. He lives happily in his home town of Lantern Yard, until his best friend William Dane betrays him by setting him up as a thief. William then marries Silas' fianc&eacute;e, and Silas is shunned from the town. He eventually settles in a very small cottage in Raveloe, where he spends his days making cloth and other materials for the townspeople. Due to his now secretive and reclusive ways, the people of Raveloe never really come to know Silas, and he lives in solitude, having turned away from his former faith and happiness.But one winter's night, a small orphan girl comes to his house, and everything changes. Silas cares for the child (with the help of his neighbor, Mrs. Winthrop, whose family soon befriends him), and his heart begins to soften.This is a very good representation of the redeeming power of love, and the consequences of a person's actions. For people who enjoy classic literature, this is definitely a must-read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Reviews of this novel, seem to fall into three categories: those written by people who like to read great literature; those written by people who would prefer to read brain candy; and those written students forced to read the novel as a class assignment and,in some cases, would prefer not to read anything (if the third category is discarded, the average rating is much higher).One of the most remarkable things about this novel is the fact it was written by a woman, using a male pen name, in 19th century England when women were generally oppressed, i.e., they were not encouraged to have careers or to do anything outside the home. The story is well known. A man who blacks out during seizures, not remembering what happened, is falsely accused of theft of money from his church. He is shunned by his former friends and becomes a recluse. When he is later robbed of his savings, and an abandoned child appears on his doorstep in place of the gold, his life is changed as he takes responsibility for the child.This is classic literature from that time period, and is most certainly easier to read than many other novels from the same period (students should consider themselves fortunate that they were not assigned to read one of Thomas Hardy's novels).

The text is laid out very well for the Kindle. At this price it is truly a must-read. What a terrific book!This is a tale of how love conquers all. A bitter man, Silas Marner, who was done wrong gave up on humanity and decided to live in a cocoon of his own making. Silas' only joy and purpose in life was making and hoarding money. He spent hours on end working himself to no end all for the purpose of earning, saving, and collecting money. Then one day his money hoard was stolen.

Anyway, if you have the time, patience, and inclination for a good read this is it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.In this novel, Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel.This particular edition contains many extra pieces of commentary, notes and other study aids that will be helpful to the student trying to understand the text, the motivations of the characters, the world context of the story, and different ideas of interpretation."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is a very interesting book. It is filled with excitement and suspense. I liked the book very much, but as a freshman in high school, it was very hard for me to read. George Eliot uses a lot of dialect along with some Old English words in her lovable tale. Eliot tells the story of a lonely weaver. After getting betrayed by friends in his old town of Lantern Yard, Silas moves to the town of Raveloe searching for a new life. His delusions keep him from getting accepted into the Raveloe community. After losing his faith in God and having his money stolen he gets a very special gift from someone he doesn't know, a little baby girl with golden hair. After that things work out for Silas and Eppie. George Eliot tells her classic novel in great detail with a lot of adjectives and metaphors. She has made a great novel that while a challenge is good for everybody. Silas Marner is really easy to comprehend because it is so realistic. I live in a small town and it reminds me of Raveloe. Sometimes I imagine that I am in Silas Marner's place and all my friends are the villagers. I think about what I would do if I was in Marner's place. Eliot also created a great plot for this book. This classic is great because it teaches people about life. It teaches people not to be selfish and to be kind to people no matter how good you think you are. Eliot has made a great book that would be great to read as a family."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner spends his days weaving for the village-folk of Raveloe, weaving and saving, hiding his money in leather bags in the floor of his home. At nights, he counts the money, tinkling it between his hands, memorising the increasing total. He spends little, and has no friends or family. His life consists of waiting to leave his life, an endless weave that seems to have no beginning and no end.But Silas was not always a weaver. As a young man, he was engaged, and living in another town. But his best friend, William Dane, who was jealous of his good fortune and hopeful prospects, engendered a plan to strip Silas of everything he held dear. His hometown, convinced he was involved with the robbery of a senior deacon, accused him of theft and he was forced to leave. He stumbles upon Raveloe and begins to weave, and fifteen years past.It is to George Eliot's credit that a story with such fairy tale qualities is so successful. From the very beginning we are made aware of character-types and ideas, with Silas being an innocent man wrongly accused, and then, as a weaver, a giant metaphor of toil and struggle in an unfair world. The townsfolk of Raveloe, as they are outlined, remain simply that - a thick line that purports to show the broad details of a person, but in no way offers the subtle shading that makes a character come to life and become a person. But this is to the story's credit, for we are not interested so much in depth of character and complexity of situation, as we are in the constant weaving, the endless sadness, of Silas Marner's self-imposed exile.While we learn of Marner's new life as a hoarder, a miser, a weaver, we come to see other characters and situations. There is a young man, Godfrey, who is running out of money and seeks a desperate measure to fix his worries. There is his father, who disapproves of his life and choices. One New Year's, the two stories intersect, and after Silas is robbed of all his money, a young girl, blonde and innocent and nameless, is found on his doorstep. Her mother, an opium addict, is discovered nearby, frozen to death. A father, if there is one, does not step forward.Here, Eliot allows us to know the secret well before Silas or Eppie, his newly christened adopted daughter. Godfrey is the father, and it is a secret he carries with him well past necessary. His duplicitous action is flagged at a very early stage, which sets in our mind the idea that a comeuppance, or a truth revealing set piece, is somewhere along the line. Because this is known - for what fairy tale does not, in the end, end in goodness and retribution and justice for those who deserve it? - we are able to enjoy the experience of Silas as he becomes a good father, and learns how to love.In a sense, the themes surrounding Silas are trite and over-used. The idea of a sad, lonely man discovering the beauty of the world again through love, is nothing new. Yet Eliot's mastery of character and evocation of place allow us to sail along with Silas as he sheds the hard carapace of armour that he has placed around himself. He becomes, as we do, devoted to Eppie. She is a caricature, a purely good and ultimately pure girl who, through the tutelage of her father, understands the meaning of love even where Godfrey, her real father, does not.Eliot makes heavy use of dialect in Silas Marner. As a personal taste, I distinctly dislike dialect, because I find I spend more time translating what is being said than enjoying and understanding the character as they are presented. Yes, it can aid in characterisation and 'realism', but at what cost? Much like Wuthering Heights, several characters in Silas Marner were ruined for me, purely because I had to work so hard at what they were saying. And of course, upon figuring out their obscure words, I realised that they were saying nothing meaningful at all. A great disappointment, that.Throughout, various characters are introduced and then pushed to the background, as needed by the story. When Silas is in difficulties concerning the raising of a child, a goodwife is found, Dolly Winthrop, who provides him with advice and stresses that the child must be christened. Later, a love interest is given to Eppie, because what happy ending does not finish with a wedding?But these are minor quibbles. As a fairy tale, Silas Marner excels. There are good people done wrong, and bad people who come right in the end. There is a happy - or mostly happy - ending for everyone who deserves it, and a few that don't. But more than that, there is the construction of a wholly sympathetic man, and that is Silas Marner himself. Eliot does not stray down an easy route with him - when he becomes a miser, there is sadness, not avarice, in our minds as we sympathise.This novel is considered minor Eliot; it is not hard to fault that estimation. Middlemarch is a towering literary achievement, whereas Silas Marner is merely a single flower in a garden of like experiments with words. But what flower does not deserve to be smelled, at least once?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"While reading SILAS MARNER, I kept thinking of a scene from Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, in which Tara's father and other relatives come to take her back home with them, very much against her inclination. Once Buffy realizes that Tara wants to stay, she states that they can take Tara only by going through her first, which causes the father to ask, \\"We are Tara's blood-kin. Who are you to interfere in her affairs?\\" To which Buffy replies, \\"We're family.\\" The same emotions that I felt watching that episode of BUFFY came roaring back in the marvelous scene near the end of this novel when Mr. Cass decides to reveal after sixteen years of denial that Eppie is his daughter and will take her to live with him instead of Silas when he says, \\"Your coming now and saying 'I'm her father' doesn't alter the feeling inside us. It's me she's been calling her father ever since she could say the word.\\" And Eppie herself adds, \\"And he's took care of me and loved me from the first, and I'll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall ever come between him and me.\\" It is one of the lovelier climaxes of any 19th century English novel.SILAS MARNER is very much a novel about faith and the search for those values that make life worth living. Marner himself seeks early on to find hope in a superstitious religion that ultimately disappoints him, and later in the acquisition of gold through hard labor, gold that is stolen from him. The money is later returned to him, but during the long interval he discovers the power and greater importance of love and simple human relationships, as he inadvertently inherits a young toddler who miraculously appears inside his cottage whom he adopts as his own child. Despite his hurts and crusty personality, Marner in loving the child is brought into the larger community as well, and achieves a kind of happiness he scarcely imagined earlier in his life.These concerns were very real to Mary Anne Evans, better known by her penname of George Eliot. Though of humble intellectual origins, she was precociously intelligent, and no figure of the 19th century overcame such obstacles to become one of the leading intellectuals of her day. In the 20th or 21st century, Evans would have held a chair of religion or literature at Cambridge or Oxford. Instead, she wrote literary reviews on a host of books on a wide range of subjects, made some of the most important translations into English of crucial German theological texts ever made (Feuerbach's THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY and David Strauss's THE LIFE OF JESUS), and wrote some of the most intellectual novels of the century. Eliot's novels are remarkable for their intellectual diversity and depth. Her novels constitute a fascinating exploration for how to have faith in a post-Christian world, and in this way she is the most typical post-Darwinian novelist of the 19th century. Furthermore, during the first half of her career as a novelist, she brought the novel down to earth. If Dickens was unique in writing in his books about many lower and working class characters in an urban setting, George Eliot did much the same for the rural poor. In novels like ADAM BEDE and THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, the bulk of her characters, even the landed characters, are very much below virtually all of the characters in Jane Austen's novels, and set even more off the beaten path than hers. Although she would turn to more universal, less specifically rural characters in themes beginning in ROMOLA and her later novels, SILAS MARNER represents her last exploration of the rural poor. She manages to catch in her pages a rapidly changing world, setting SILAS MARNER in an area where the lone weavers such as Marner were disappearing in favor of industrialized cloth manufacture and the countryside was giving way to a rapidly expanding coal industry (Eliot's part of England is very near what would later be the setting for D. H. Lawrence's coal mining novels, with Lawrence also reflecting in his pages on the changes industrialization had wrought, although he writes from the end of the process while she writes at its beginning).We tend sometimes to think of those who reacted against the Christian faith following Darwin and David Strauss as having forsaken faith entirely, but that is very much not the case. Most Victorians who forsook Christianity looked instead for alternate forms of faith. Take the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who ceased to believe in Christianity, but founded the Royal Society of Psychical Research. Like many of his age, Sidgwick believed that a supernatural realm was essential to provide the ultimate validity of morality, and no longer believing in Christianity, sought to investigate like a 19th century Fox Mulder a wide range of supernatural phenomena to validate some vague form of faith. Eliot in this novel is desperately trying to believe in something. Like Mulder with the poster on his wall reading \\"I Want to Believe,\\" Eliot wanted faith. Not merely that, but she was convinced that there had to be a viable form of faith to make life worth living. She was hardly the atheistic materialist that many wrongly believe that Darwin produced.Just as Sidgwick believed that there was a supernatural order that make sense of morality (in particular instances of self-sacrifice), so George Eliot clearly sees a divine order in the workings of the world. This is illustrated over and over in SILAS MARNER, where everything balances at the end. Although she no longer believed in the Christian teachings, she remained very much a person of faith and ultimately an optimist. By the end of the novel, no bad deed has gone unpunished and no scales are left unbalanced. In the old expression, \\"Bad deeds will out.\\" But it is also a novel of redemption, with Marner finding his anti-social sins being forgiven and through family and friends discovering, very much to his surprise, happiness.Though George Eliot always liked to write superficially simply stories that were in fact paragraph by paragraph commentaries on the intellectual debates of her age (she had, for instance, been reading widely in German and English theorists on the folktale when writing MARNER), her surface simplicity always feels real and unforced. And the story she created is a lovely one, with vivid characters, a marvelous plot, and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. I will confess that I came to this novel much, much later than most others who read the book, and only after having read many of her other books. This is one unquestionably one of her most enjoyable and marvelous works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I was under the sexist opinion that George Eliot was a man. How pleasantly surprising that George was actually Mary Ann Evans, a woman gifted with powerful insight into human behaviour.The story of Silas Marner is that of a wronged man who finds solace in solitude and hoarding. The ritual and monotony of his loom keeps him captive, the reckoning and manifestation of his gold gives him companionship.One day his gold is stolen replaced by a far more precious gem, an orphan girl. An abandoned child offers Silas salvation, a withered miser offers the child a home. Together they change each other and those around them.The story is replete with penetrating behavioural analyses applicable to all of us but just beyond our reach."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. It is timeless and ought to make one pause and think about the priorities in one's life. A must have for a classic collection."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"The book Silas Marner is an interesting book to read. The book starts off slow but gets more interesting as you get into it. It's a good book about how lies can ruin peoples' lives. I am giving a mixed review because it has both good and bad points to it. In the book Silas Marner, there is a man named Silas who lives in a small town. One day he is betrayed by his best friend and gets into a lot of trouble. After that he moves to another town were he is an outcast. He works as a weaver; he was the only one in the town so he made a lot of money. One day something happens that causes great pain to him, but one day someone comes to him and turns his life around. He is happier than he was before because he realizes that there is more to life than his money. The book has many good points to it. It has some good morals to it which are nice to know. One of the morals are that people shouldn't tell lies or keep secrets because they aren't good for the people involved. That is why this book is a good one to read. The book is bad because it was hard to understand what is going on all the time. It wouldn't be a good book for people younger than the ninth grade to read because it is hard to understand. It would be a hard book for younger people to read. It is also slow through the first part of the book because it just gives information and nothing happens. That is why it isn't a good book to read. Even with these problems, it would be a good book for older people to read."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"After Silas Marner's hoard of money was stolen, I was afraid this would be another dreary, Bronte-like novel, full of doom, gloom and cruelty. I almost decided not to finish it. However, I looked up a plot summary online and found that it was not so dark. I'm glad I went ahead and finished the book. The author paints for us all kinds of interesting scenes of life in a small English village in the 19th century. We read of virtue and vice, pompousness and humility, love and devotion, and even of good intentions backfiring.All in all, this is a pleasant read. The good are rewarded and the bad get their just deserts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I give the book Silas Marner a mixed review because although it is a good book with a lot of details, it is hard for younger people to understand. I am a freshman in high school and I found it difficult to read. Geoge Eliot has written a fable about Silas Marner. After his friend blackmails him, Silas moves to Raveloe after losing his faith in the Lord and starts a new life. He gets rich from weaving and becomes obsessed with his gold. His life starts to crumble after something happens and then it all comes back when a little girl with golden hair comes to his cottage.Silas Marner is not the best book because the narrator tried too pack to much information in to this book for how short it is. It is too hard for younger people to read because of the hard words like metamorphosis and the time period it is written in which was the Victorian age. Another bad thing about it is there are too many coincidences in it that makes it seem like a fairy tale; for example, like when Silas has his fits at the most convenient time in the plot. Some good things about the novel are that there are some good morals in it for people to learn. Eliot helps up realize the importance of love, trust and religion as Silas loses and gains these things back again. Some other morals that I learned from reading this book are not to keep lies from the people that you love and to always think about your decisions. All an all, Silas Marner is a good book. I think that George Eliot did a good job on this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I don't know about anyone else, but when I read a plot synopsis on the back of a book, I like for that story to kick in at some point. However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer). A plodding, slow book for the first two-thirds, it picks up somewhat before somehow managing to wrap things up in 10 pages...making me wonder why the book is even this long in the first place."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This book is billed as a reproduction of a classic edition of Silas Marner. It appears as is someone just scanned the pages of a classic edition and bound them together. There is no warmth to this edition.

This is not the edition for anyone who loves the warmth and comfort of reading classic books."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner was a good book. I give it three stars because it is kind of hard to read and the beginning of the book was really weird, but the ending was pretty good.I give it a mixed review because the beginning of the book is very boring because all George Eliot writes about is Silas' life in Lantern Yard and the boring life he leads. The middle and the end are the best parts because they at least have some excitement with some people dying in the snow and the water. I think there should be some more action in the book like fights. I am a freshman in high school, and I thought that the book was kind of hard to read because of the long paragraphs and the hard vocabulary in the book. I do not recommend this book to high school freshman because it is hard to read and hard to follow.Silas Marner is a good book because it teaches you some lessons on life. It has some good morals like to think thoroughly before you marry or before you have kids. I think that George Eliot did a very good job of writing the story with the morals even with the hard vocabulary and the long chapters and paragraphs. I think George Eliot should have written about someone who actually lived around that time because it would have made it more interesting. She should have made the book she wrote more exciting than it was."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Eliot is clearly a master - I've read \\"Mill on the Floss\\" and loved it, and I look forward to reading \\"Middlemarch.\\" However, \\"Silas Marner\\" was a bit of a disappointment. The supporting characters are well-drawn as is the town, which is really the star of this book. I found the character of Silas Marner to be vague and unbelievable. His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly. It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly. The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much &quot;background noise&quot; to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans)wrote \\"Silas Marner\\" in 1861 and it is still being read to date. I read it first in junior high school, so long ago I had forgotten what it was about so I reread it. I had high expectations for it, lasting so long but I was disappointed. First, it is a hard read, her sentences are so long and so convoluted it is hard to maintain the connection from one sentence to the next. In addition many sentences are written phonetically, to create, I guess, the sense of the spoken word in the time period (early 1800's) as well as its sound and locale(Warwickshire, middle England). Add to that the coincidences involved to have the novel generate the correct happenstances of most of its characters and you have a novel incorporating most of the defects most stressed in English writing courses. How could this story have survived 150 years? If the reader is a juvenile he or she empathises with the characters and wants them to get their just desserts, and the reader has an opinion of who gets what. Eliot satisfies these desires and the young reader has read a story with characters who strike a responsive chord with the reader who then keeps the story in memory.Most accounts of the novel speak highly of the effect of Eppie, the supposed orphan, on the protagonist, Silas Marner. But she does not appear until about two thirds of the book has been read and I think this makes her a minor character. The book is primarily devoted to character changes in Silas Marner and Godfrey Cass, that is what the book is about. Yes, Eppie is the major factor in Silas's changed character but first his character must be developed. The same is true of Godfrey Cass, the biological father of the girl. His character is developed independently of her; Nancy Lammeter does her duty towards him but she does not get the attention Eppie does. The title of the book is Silas Marner but he only gets a slightly greater mention than Godfrey, the title must be the deciding factor. I think the book is highly overrated and is a book for juveniles except its construction is so difficult it is hard to praise for young readers. But I think I read it in juhior high, has reading changed for present day youth?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"A wonderful story of love and commitment.

Going in, you have to know that Eliot is a master at words and dialects and that this will not be easy reading. I did find that reading it was tedious at times. It wasn't the kind of book that I couldn't put down or that I'd look forward with eagerness to picking up again.That said, there is much to recommend this book. The morals and the values are excellent. From the first few chapters, you might be afraid that the book is going to be filled with rather amoral, money-grubbing characters, but you will soon find that the good, decent people here are head and shoulders above many people. There is one thing about certain writers of classics--when people are good or evolve from good to better they are superior people. You'd be hard put to find such perfect people. The father-daughter relationship in this book is incredible. I'm always amazed at the classics that have extended families living together and it's all so beautiful. The in-laws become beloved family members and look after the old folks as though they were blood relations. It's a fairy-tale experience, but if you can suspend judgment and believe that people can live together in harmony, not to mention choosing the spiritual over the material, your heart and soul will be warmed by this story.But be warned that although it's a short book there is a multitude of wordiness to get through. You may have trouble with unfamiliar dialects and long sentences that never seem to end, but your patience will be rewarded. There is nothing stereotypical about this story. It's quite unusual, has some twists and turns, and ultimately a very satisfying finish.Just a postscript: I decided to read this book because I remembered a nun who recommended it. She had just had our junior class in high school plow through Eliot's Adam Bede which is considerably longer, but we all enjoyed it. So she said that Silas Marner was good also and several girls groaned audibly. This was all I needed to hear--those groans convinced me that this wouldn't be easy reading for a 17-year-old young woman. But the nun said, \\"Oh, girls...\\" in the most wistful manner. I always wondered what there was about Silas Marner to make Sister look so moony-eyed. Now I know. I had to groan a little through all the verbiage, but I did find the warmth that Sister had evidently discovered."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is something of a rustic parable, in which the concept of wealth is held under a critical, moral light. It concerns a miserly hermit-weaver, who, after years and years of hoarding his earnings--reveling in the shimmer and chime of his beloved coins--is robbed of all his money. Yes--the thieving Dunstan Cass is punished for his wickedness, drowned in a nearby pond. But most intriguing is the way Silas's monetary misfortune marks the beginning of his passage to spiritual wealth. From the moment he is robbed, he is compelled to go out among the townsfolk, and establish relationships with his neighbors. Eliot's description of Silas's coins as \\"children waiting to be born\\" will remind some readers of one of Marx's descriptions of money as \\"monetary larva.\\" But the central transformation in Silas Marner does not occur in the market realm of commodity exchange, but in realm of symbolism and spiritual reformation, when Silas discovers the little \\"orphaned\\" Eppie in the ruddy glow of his hearth. It is, of course, a new, human treasure that Silas discovers in Eppie--one of rejuvenating import. And one of the most poignant scenes in the novel is when Silas confuses Eppie's golden locks of hair with his stolen gold coins, for it offers him a startling, new vision of human wealth. It's rather a queer novel, but not without its charm."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"A simple but beautifully written morality tale.

It has some pretty good points to it because it is pretty realistic, but it has its monotonous spots to it too, like the introduction. Toward the end, the book improved though the beginning was pretty dull because there is so much background information. I wouldn't suggest this book to readers below eighth grade since the way it's written makes it a little hard to follow for younger readers. The novel, Silas Marner, could have more action in it because there wasn't much to keep me on the edge of my seat. The book also could have used some more dialogue between the characters; some of the paragraphs got pretty long and hard to understand. Younger readers would probably lose interest in it because the paragraphs are so extensive. Although the book gets pretty good toward the end, the person reading it has to be patient to reach the exceptional parts. Although it is very challenging, Silas Marner is still a fascinating book because it teaches a lot about trust. The end of the book is pretty commendable because it's suspenseful. I like it more than a lot of other books endings. This book had things transpire that may happen in real life, like the mom dying from an opium overdose. This novel is a really good book to teach about the way one would want to deal with people and the way one may want to be treated. I like this text because it is one of those books that anybody could be able to sit down and appreciate as long as he or she is an efficient reader."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep.

Read it again and I enjoyed it much more this time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"The plot begins like a story about the biblical Job. Silas, a young man, feels connected to his neighbors and his God. He works hard and looks forward to a normal life. But then he suffers an injustice at the hands of his Christian neighbors and blames his community and God. He suffers a self imposed alienation from both. He resorts to greediness. Suffers injustice again and hits bottom. Then the focus appears to turn to how does such a person redeem his faith in neighbors and God? How does a community redeem an outcast like Silas Marner? Also interesting was how the Church functions in the community to provide for the aged and and the disabled. Marner is told he would be taken care of despite the fact that he for years made no contributions to the Church to help it provide for his old age and disability. First rate author, this Mary Anne Evans, and a significant contribution to our great conversation about life, injustice, religion, and the redeeming power of love and loyalty.

It is one of my favorites from classic English literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"I failed miserably at reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, but I loved Silas Marner. I think it was just that my edition of The Mill on the Floss has really off-putting font, and seems really long. At any rate, I sped through Silas Marner, which is a slim little volume, and is quite interesting. \\"Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.\\" (from the Penguin Classics edition). Yes, \\"her.\\" George Eliot was a pen name. My question is, why do we still use the pen name in this case, but Charlotte Bronte's pen name (Currer Bell) isn't used anymore? I might research that...The actual edition that I read called it a moral fairy tale, and I would agree with that term. The book is fairy-tale-like, and highly entertaining, but also thought-provoking, as moralities (and fairy tales for that matter) are supposed to be. The sentences can be very long, but somehow, unlike Charles Dickens, they don't seem overwritten; they seem to fit the tone of the story just right.I loved how the little golden-haired orphan Eppie made her appearance; she is the child of Godfrey Cass, and when her mother keels over, Eppie toddles into the cottage of none other than Silas Marner, who now has a chance for redemption. She is the reappearance of his precious gold that he lost.A chance for redemption. I suppose that's not really the right phrase; Silas Marner isn't bad per se. He's complicated, and yes, he's miserly, but that's because he was wrongfully accused of a crime in his past life. He's just drawn into himself, and he no longer wishes to associate with the rest of the world or have anything to do with religion. But bright little Eppie gives him a chance to get past that and start again. Godfrey too isn't strictly good or evil. He's conflicted, and he's done some bad things which he wants to forget about, and he's done some good things. I won't tell how the book ends, but suffice to say that Silas Marner is an amazing classic novel, for its social commentary, and its humor, and its symbolism. I would highly recommend it, and am thinking of trying to tackle The Mill and the Floss once again. Or perhaps Middlemarch. I do think Silas Marner is a good book to start off with if you're going to read George Eliot; it's short and (it seems to me) less overwritten.My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"It has been several decades since I last read it. It was not an overly exciting read, but well crafted and worth the time. Better use of time than most TV shows or movies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"This was a perfectly agreeable, though not exceptional, specimen of the 19th century British novel. Eliot was a very fine writer in the Victorian style, with an assured, elegant vocabulary and lofty moral sensibility. Like other authors of the period, she occasionally gets carried away with grandiose elliptical constructions yielding minor observations of human nature that could be conveyed much more simply. Here's one that occurs early on: &quot;For the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants.&quot; Translation: powerless people distrust powerful people. Or this gem: &quot;a dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.&quot; Whew. Translation: people believe what they want to believe.OK, so sentences like these fall a bit humorously on modern ears, but that's half the fun of reading this stuff, and Shakespeare did it too. Anyway, these characters are very likeable and the story is engaging. You'll sympathize with poor Silas and fall in love with adorable Eppie, and everything turns out well in the end.

I know I was! And I also know that, because of my age at the time of the assignment, I got little, if anything, from the reading of it. What a dire shame! This beautiful tale is literally filled with credos on how to live a quality and meaningful life! But we, being mere immature elementary students at the time, had most of these teachings allude us completely.'Silas Marner' truly is a literary classic. The author brings to light the life areas of deceit, mistrust, bribery, greed, and eventual unrepentant love through a set of intermingled and memorable characters. Her style is very similar to that of Dickens insomuch that there is not only a riveting plotline that weaves its way throughout the book but a series of side adjuncts which not only give us a firmer grasp of the life and times of a small town but the inequalities that are caused through its income and social disparities.Take the time, as I did, now that you are an adult to grasp the life-teaching tale that our 8th grade teacher so desperately wanted us to glean from this classic novel. It is worth the journey back to a long forgotten academic assignments......"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"It's been so long since I first read this book, so when I recently reread it, it was all new to me.

I had never heard of this particular Elliot book until I acquired the list of \\"1001 books to read before you die.\\" I can see where the language in this book would be troublesome to many young students, particularly if they have little to no experience reading anything from the time, much less anything written in phonetic slang. But the theme should be universal.Short Synopsis - we follow to individuals through the tale, the title character - Silas Marner, a weaver who has had a long run of bad luck in dealing with people who has then holed himself away from society and fills his days with weaving and counting his slowly growing stack of gold. The other is Godfry Cass, a wealthy son of a land owner who's poor in morals and scruples. Through a series of events triggered by Godfry and his brother, Silas is thrust into various situations of both grief and joy. Always Silas maintains his high moral standard and simple way of life and is thusly rewarded for it.As is standard in the literature of the time - the good get what they deserve and the morally lacking get their just ends. The interesting part that Elliot weaves in to the tale is that the unfortunate events that happen to Silas, all end up leading him to true happiness. Now I don't want to give the story away as many others have, but I will say that once you get past the first third or so (where the reader will find themselves wondering if ANYTHING is ever going to happen) the book picks up and becomes very enjoyable.The language may be tough for some, but once you get about 20-30 pages in, you shouldn't have much trouble reading it. If all else fails, read it out loud. On the whole this is a very enjoyable book, though not my favorite - the story is fun and happy and leaves the reader feeling rather warm and fuzzy."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Unlike the tragical nature of Eliot's \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" for example, \\"Silas Marner,\\" is an inspiring, thought-provoking story of a lonely old man who is given a gift that illuminates his life. The story is written in Eliot's astute and intelligent way with words, and also sparks discussion of some underlying themes (such as religious faith issues). It would be wonderful if A&E or the BBC would give it a faithful movie adaptation. We only have Steve Martin's movie, \\"A Simple Twist of Fate,\\" that is loosely based on the text of this timeless story. If you are a fan of Victorian fiction, don't miss Eliot, as her writing differs in style and tone from other works of the era, and offers the reader a lot to sink their thoughts into."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is a wonderful story about life and love. It begins with our hero, Silas Marner, a lonely, luckless old man, being robbed of his life savings. But then a mysterious appearance of a homeless, golden-haired little girl opens up an unexpected new chapter in his life. Silas Marner was a weaver who through loneliness and through life's occurrences becomes bitter and miserly. The theft of his life savings causes him to rethink everything about his life. Ms. Eliot also introduces Godfrey Cass to her cast of characters. Godfrey is a foil to Silas. He is the real father of Eppie, the young girl that Silas adopts. We watch as Silas' lot and outlook on life improve, Godfrey's life dissolves into disappointment, fear and guilt.

Perhaps the characters are something out of Dickens (in their extreem personality types and the idealized heroine). Yet this novel reaches our inner selves, where it is safe to applaud the unselfish and the compassionate, to appreciate social redemption and sincere devotion.Silas, a disillusioned weaver who lives the life of a recluse, has never been accepted by the villagers of Raveloe. Paid in gold for his fine cloth, Marner hoards most of it in an iron pot buried in the sand under his loom. Having lost faith in God, church and his fellow men because of a tragic injustice in his former town, he lavishes his lamentable affection on indifferent gold. Until it is stolen.The theft of this gold--his only friend as it were--leaves him desvastated. Yet fate seems to compensate him by the sudden apperance of a golden-curled baby, who toddles over his doorway one night when he is in a mild catatonic state.How Eppie pulls at his heart and transforms his miserable, miserly life is the soul of this novelette. Evans' weaves a tapestry of tenderness and redemption through juvenile affection. SILAS MARNER remains a contemplative read for students 14 and up, and for all who enjoy British classical literature. The action is in the Heart."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"George Eliot's SILAS MARNER is a literary classic. What does that mean? A classic is a book that has passed the test of time. A book taken out of its historical milieu and placed in a contemporary one, e.g. our 2008 society, and still reads fresh is a classic.SILAS MARNER still reads fresh, if you are a sophisticated reader or have a teacher to guide you through the ground mines of vocabulary and complex writing. However, wrapped inside those is a great story, even a soap opera that students recognize as soon as the Cass brothers are introduced.Two story lines run parallel until they intersect with the theft of Silas's gold. Silas Marner has been in this village for seventeen years, living a life of isolation, while he makes a living as a weaver. Even if he had chosen to live amongst people, he possesses two things that would always hinder acceptance: he is a herbalist and a victim of catatonic seizures. He discontinues his use of herbs early on, but he cannot stop catatonia, which of course becomes a metaphor for his life with others before Eppy appears.It is these quiet seizures that result in blackouts that--bottom line--cause his banishment from a religious community where he was highly respected. In the seventeen years near Raveloe, nothing has happened to change his life with a dead heart. His great love in this time is his growing stacks of gold. He loves it! He idolizes it!Enter Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, two landed gentry, both dissolute in differing ways, both catalysts in the change in Silas Marner's dull life. The younger brother, Dunstan, is a n'er-do-well, a gambler in debt and subject to embarrassment by a man to whom Dunstan owes a great deal of money. He finds gold in Silas's house. On the other hand, Godfrey leads a superficial respectable life, because he too has indulged himself and has a child born out of wedlock.One cold, dark, stormy night two stories intersect: Dunstan steals Silas's gold, then disappears forever, and Silas is devastated by the loss of his gold. However, this loss brings Silas into community. The night the golden-haired child appears magically on Silas's hearth clinches Silas's total acceptance into village life. Silas adopts this child and Dolly Winthrop becomes his guiding angel in helping to raise the child.When the two secrets are revealed concerning Dunstan and Godfrey, the reader cheers Silas on, directs hisses at Godfrey, and stands amazed at Dunstan's revelation.Inside this \\"soap opera\\" is a fabulous story of love and redemption. Without love one man lives a life of solace in gold with a heart dried and shriveled. With love his heart beats passionately and lovingly and makes him live fully with family and friends. No greater lesson can come from a story as one of redemption. From the still-point of one golden-haired girl radiates a life that redeems a man.George Eliot, or Mary Ann Evans, is a genius in depicting the lives of men and women and their influence on others for good or evil. Eppy is the source of good out of sinful circumstances and selfishness on Godfrey's part. Godfrey continues his static life force by not claiming his child at one point and trying to claim her when it is too late. The contrast between one man who has little and the other who has everything is instructive in explaining the ways of the heart.If I were marooned on a deserted island and could take ten books with me, SILAS MARNER would definitely be on the list. It is a great book to teach and listen to students respond to it (and NO, I won't be stranded with students). Watching their faces in class discussion concerning Dunstan's re-appearance in Raveloe is absolutely priceless. Even though the foreshadowing is huge, students never figure out what happens.Just think of all the choices we make in our lives, some irrevocable as to cause and effect. SILAS MARNER is a caution and a beacon to making the right choices. Making wrong choices to hide one's actions, more often than not, results in dire consequences. Silas shows us that right actions produce right results. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"Silas Marner is quite an unusual piece of work.

And all the time Eliot sits on her high horse above them.

It also illustrates how unfair it is to try to reclaim a child you give up. On both the surface and deeper meanings, it is a good novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (New Windmill)","review":"It is interesting to note briefly George Eliot's background when setting out to examine the novel from the standpoint of a moral or religious philosopher. Brought up in a strict evangelical home, and sent to a school institution run along similar lines, she rejected this evangelicalism, forging a sort of broadly &quot;Christian&quot; humanism, which undeniably belonged strongly to Eliot. This is powerfully evident in 'Silas Marner'. Marner's rejection by the Leeds brethren on the grounds that he had stolen the church revenue, (when in fact he had be 'framed' all along,) led to his rejection of evangelical beliefs. As he moves away to ply his trade as a weaver, &quot;his God&quot; remains in the congregation in the city. Faith belonged not to him, but to a particular place. He replaces his religion, with the worship of Mammon - drawing comfort from his gold pieces. When these are stolen, his world falls apart once again. It is then that the child Eppie comes into his life, and becomes his ambition. Thus, she is seen by some as a &quot;Christ-child&quot;, in turning him from is love of the material, but importantly she is seen as the fulfilment of NATURAL JUSTICE - a concept which Eliot clearly espouses. The other predominant theme in the book, is the conflict between Nature and Nurture. As Eppie's natural father - the wealthy Godfrey Cass, a victim of circumstance who disclaimed the child - tries to claim her back at the age of eighteen she refuses. Thus, against the recieved morality of the time, nurture wins over nature, and a poor but contented way of life is chosen over one of status. The other notable feature of the book is its fairy tale quality. The first two chapters serve as an introdution to the scenario, but the third chapter, introducing village life in Raveloe, has a definate fairy tale quality about it, as does the sickly-sweet end. A radical and deeply profound, thought provoking work, it is a must for any student or lover of Victorian Literature, and should not be overlooked as it ha! s been in the past."},{"Title":"Basic Perspective for Comics & Illustration (Volume 1)","review":"This book does exactly what it promises.

Along the way he falls in love with a crew member and hires a hooligan (presumably a skinhead of sorts) to be a driver. Much is made of how little difference there is between the upper class producer and the lower class thug. For some reason Stuart chose not to use real soccer teams in his narrative, which only further hinders the book.

Inside Dreamweaver MX is definitely something that anyone interested in building sites would benefit from, even if you don't use the program!Happy building!Leslie"},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"As an author who has turned down numerous requests to write a Dreamweaver reference book because of how daunting a task it is, my hat goes off to Ms. Gutman, Ms. Ayers, and Mr. Booth for a job very well done. As far as I'm concerned, this is &quot;the&quot; definitive Dreamweaver MX reference work and should not be overlooked. Get it on your bookshelves ASAP."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This book is a meaty tome and worthy of a place on any developers desk. It explores every aspect of Dreamweaver MX - no stone is left unturned. The Authors not only have a great understanding of the software but also of the nature of the web and the requirements necessary to build better websites. It is with this understanding that they take the reader through each chapter, explaining what to do and how to do it.As an experienced developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of information I gleaned from this book.The writing style is accessible and even though there's a lot of it, it never really feels cumbersome. You feel like you're learning at the turn of each page.If I had to pick one thing over everything else that I liked about this book it would be the short interviews with 'real world' people embedded into the chapters.The idea here is to conduct an interview with a developer who actively uses the procedures or elements being discussed in that chapter and to see how Dreamweaver MX helps them to achieve their goals in that respect.Thorough and informative. A well deserved 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This is a very comprehensive book. What impressed me first was the flow of content. It is very well organized and logical. It begins with what's new and moves into the nuts and bolts of using Dreamweaver, such as the workspace, tools and basic things such as text images and so on.This book goes far beyond just using Dreamweaver as a layout tool but it covers a lot of development features such as a chapter on Web Pages with Flash and basic coverage of using ASP, ASP.NET, ColdFusion, PHP, and JSP. The authors cover things such as multimedia issues, what they are, when to use multimedia and how to incorporate it into your Dreamweaver layout. This chapter also pointed out valid reasons for using multimedia such as education, to direct attention to illustrate and many more reasons.Where the bulk of the book concentrates on using the visual tools of Dreamweaver the last portion works with the code. It covers markup languages, writing code and extensions.This book is through and well rounded. I'd highly recommend this book to all user levels."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"DreamweaverMX is a must have book for any site designer's bookshelf and tool box of knowledge.The book gives completeness in a sea of books on the market that just simply want to skim over the top and leave the reader hungry for more knowledge.

My first impression of a book is usually by scanning through it to find answers to any long standing unanswered questions i've had about the app. Well, this book had answers to the first 5 I could think of -- I was sold. Since then it has provided answers to questions i had not thought to ask yet. I depend on this book on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"I found this book to be exceedingly slow to get started and very tedious to work with. While there seems to be a vast amount of information, the flow was awkward and the tutorials took too long to get to the point of anything. I am no stranger to web sites and instructional material so I was very disappointed to have invested in this book only to find it wanting.I believe we all learn best by doing and this book seems to take that approach, however, I continually found the book exploring the minutia of this very capable program, at the expense of accomplishing the stated learning goals."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"There are so many DW MX books out now that it is difficult distinguishing them. This one has some notable strengths and weaknesses.This huge book does indeed cover most DW features but often only lightly. Perhaps the sheer size of it made it hard for me to figure out the organization of the material.I was pleased to see the large number of warnings and tips on DW bugs and pitfalls. Perhaps Macromedia product management would not approve but the average serious reader will love this aspect of the book.As a person who feels more comfortable working the code directly, Ch. 33 &quot;Writing Code in Dreamweaver&quot; is an excellent resource. The extensive section on server-based features &quot;Dynamic Dreamweaver&quot; was also valuable.The book's example code gets bad marks for W3C standards compliance. Learn the tool from this book, not the code. The authors constantly used example code using deprecated tags and techniques. Ch. 9 &quot;Building Tables&quot; was especially bad in this respect. The authors were so eager to teach us the wasteful practice of using tables for layout that they neglected completely to show us DW's extremely powerful and labor-saving features for manipulating true data tables. Ch. 10 followed in the same vein.The authors broke up the material with lots of interviews with people like us, people working the Web. This was a great idea and added impact and motivation to the book."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"INSIDE DREAMWEAVER MXAUTHOR: Laura Gutman, Patricia J.

The material to be gleaned would be similiar to that gained from a two or three day introductory training course.The introductory material is well dealt with and clearly explained, the authors are definately at their most comfortable with this traditional style web design using dreamweaver, and this is the books strongest area.Personally i wouldnt see too much material here which would be of interest to an intermediate or advanced dreamweaver user, the new features are dealt with fairly quickly at the front of the book, and beyond that there is a quick overview of the new data driven dreamweaver using the various technoligies, but useful only as an introduction to these technologies.For the designer the book much like all big overview books of this type offers nothing new, the design examples are very basic, and there is nothing new or challenging, the book is more software centric than design centric, most useful as a reference for the various dialogue boxes and settings, but certainly not inspirational in design terms.The book design itself is somewhat flawed, nice cover, but the interior layout is poorly designed, in a book of this size somewhat understandable as there is such a high volume of content.The various interviews with designers, are superflous, and run in with the body copy to the degree of annoyance, again more a layout flaw, but these interviews are of limited use.I would also question the long delay before introducing the site management tools, in fact first introduced in depth at page 700, these in my opinion should have been integrated earlier.The newest and most exciting side of dreamweaver the data driven side associated with ultradev previously is seriously under represented here, and a very basic overview of the various technologies and a very simple example site is all we get. This section also lacks the flow and confidence of earlier sections.in summary, the book offeres a good tour through the software, and it is a very good learning guide for the beginner to dreamweaver, for the advanced user there is some useful reference material but lacks serious depth in the new areas."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Inside Dreamweaver is a gigantic book that covers everything from basic HTML construction, to DHTML Animation and behaviors, to creating dynamic pages using server side scripting languages such as ASP or Cold Fusion. The sheer scope of its coverage should make it a valuable reference for Dreamweaver users both new and old.Among the new features in Dreamweaver MX is the ability to create dynamic, database driven, pages in either ASP, PHP, Cold Fusion, JSP, or ASP.NET. While the specifics of any of these languages is out of the scope of this book, Inside Dreamweaver provides a valuable starting point, and explanation for these technologies.As someone who's been using Dreamweaver in both personal and professional environments for several years now, I've found several areas of this book to be incredibly helpful. Specifically, the chapter on animating layers, which is something I've played around with on several occasions, but never fully understood.This is the most complete book on Dreamweaver I've ever seen. While I would agree that it is lack in a few areas, it certainly provides a solid foundation and a valuable reference. I also found the interviews to be a nice touch as well as informative."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm not new to HTML, CSS or webwriting, but new to Dreamweaver. This book is literally littered with errors, mistakes and other incorrectnesses. It doesn't look like the proof reader had a bad day; he simply wasn't there! The single chapter about CSS alone is worth looking at other books. It [is not good] is a major understatement. Better look at an online free tutorial for that chapter.Ms. Gutman knows here stuff, so much is clear. But being a teacher is a different profession, and not all can do that. Ms. Gutman clearly can't. A less experienced writer with better teaching skills could do a much better job. I'm currently trying to negotiate a refund from the publisher. I rate this book that bad.I bougth it because it has ASP, ASP.NET and PHP tutorials.Had these been absent, I would have gone for the Dreamweaver MX bible.

Also, being new to Dreamweaver's way of doing things, I found the book to be a complete and thorough walk-through of Dreamweaver's every feature.I enjoy books that take you step-by-step through the process of a thing. Inside Dreamweaver is a great example of that. Each chapter lays the groundwork for chapters to come. At the same time, each chapter (after introductory chapters are out of the way) gives repeated opportunity to learn and solidify skills by doing a fun example.A fun example? Yeah! I had fun. At least one of the authors (maybe more) has a true flair for simple, yet attractive designs. I've been designing Websites and Web applications (in other programs) for 5 years and I enjoyed the &quot;silent&quot; review of simple design concepts presented-not in words-but in the &quot;good&quot; designs themselves.I'm glad to see a book, like this instruct it's readers in correct practices. I meet allot of Webmasters who have &quot;known&quot; HTML for years, yet struggle with the &quot;new&quot; standards, such as XHTML 1.0. I scratch my head at this. Not much has changed! Only now the standards are enforced and deprecated code will fail. I've been a big believer in standards compliance since first reading &quot;HTML 4.0 - No Experience Required (Sybex)&quot;. And now it's nice to see another book, &quot;Inside Dreamweaver&quot;, perform the same service to it's readers by letting them know what is and is not recommended.&quot;Inside Dreamweaver&quot; will instill confidence in the beginning student and provide reliable and accurate review of sound Web design principles for both the new and veteran Webmaster."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Seriously one of the most incredible reference books I've ever come across!I chose to follow this book chapter by chapter as there is so much that's new in Dreamweaver MX, but I will keep it near as a reference manual for a long time.Written in very accessible language, exercises interspersed with the text to break up the long lists of instructions, a CD full of the files that you need to complete the exercises, this book covers everything! Not only did it fully cover Dreamweaver and the upgrade to MX but integrating with Flash, Java, ASP, Coldfusion, Animating Layers... I really could go on for pages and pages here.I recommend this book wholeheartedly, for anyone who wants to work with Dreamweaver MX, weather you're brand new to the program or upgrading or even just want to really understand all the options that DW gives you for building websites.You're covered whether you like to code by hand or drag and drop or a little bit of both (I prefer a little bit of both).Before I got this book, I would have considered myself a power user of Dreamweaver, but I really had no idea - especially with behaviors, extensions and CSS implementation. It's really incredible.A great book that really gets inside a terrific program - I'm giving this book the highest rating!"},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This is my introduction to Dreamweaver and web design, so I am not one to comment on the technical aspects (that is, whether the book has the best technical advice). However, I have read and written enough, and have read quite a few pieces of technical writing (I have 2 other books on Dreamweaver), to know that in terms of quality of writing, this is a winner. The book is actually a pleasure to read! (I wonder if that has to do with the fact that 2 of the authors are women!?) I have finished the first part already and everything is organized logically and explained very clearly--unlike many of the tech stuff out there (including some in the Dummies series) which often leave you scratching your head. (I do notice some minor typos here and there--too bad because the writing is superb.)"},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This is a big book, 1200 pages. It covers everything offered by MX as well as explaining good programming practices. It does this very well. However, I do not consider this a book for experienced users. MX includes so many features that it takes a book this size to just mention them all. Also, the good programming practices takes up almost as much space as the parts on how to use MX. If you are new to MX and to programming this book will give you an excellent start both in using MX and how to develop web projects in an intelligent manner."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Inside Dreamweaver MX is the book that should be included as the manual for Dreamweaver MX. At over 1100 pages long, the extent and depth of material is covered is amazing. It ranges from how Dreamweaver MX is organized (dissecting the workspace, explaining preference settings, setting up the panels, site management, etc), to designing pages in Dreamweaver MX (using Cascading Style Sheets, frames, layers, JavaScript, dynamic pages, etc.) Nothing is left out. Each chapter gives background of the concept at hand. It then has steps to accomplish a given task. Then there are optional exercises (CD contains files) to give you an actual hands-one experience. The exercises really give you confidence in learning the concept.Both beginners and advanced users will find the book helpful. Beginners can use it to create good, solid professional web pages. Advanced users can use this as a manual to answer the question at hand.The book is laid out in a very readable and understandable format. Screen shots emphasize what is being discussed. Note to PC users: all screen shots are taken from a Mac. At times there are differences between the two platforms. However in most cases they are the same. Note and tip boxes are scattered throughout for additional reinforcement and consideration about the topic.For those who want to venture into creating dynamic pages, there's an entire section on using Dreamweaver to this end. This includes an introduction to dynamic site. What follows is a chapter dedicated to creating a website based on each of the various application servers. (ASP, ASP.NET, ColdFusion, PHP, and JSP.) The exercises for this section include a small database to use. Step by step you put the pieces together that Dreamweaver MX utilizes in order create pages based on a database.Bottom line: whether you're just beginning or a serious developer, you will want this book on your shelf. It's thorough and can be used as either a tutorial or a resource.

The three authors must have written the book using a beta version of Dreamweaver MX. Numerous commands that you are instructed to choose simply aren't there. Also, files you are instructed to copy from the CD aren't there or you have to be creative because the reference in the book doesn't match the name of the file on the CD.It is painfully apparent that the collaborative efforts of the three authors failed (in my opinion). As a technical writer/web designer who is an expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but new to Dreamweaver, I read very carefully and follow instructions. When they repeatedly don't work as written, I place the book along with the others in my archives (I don't have the audacity to sell the used, poorly written copy to some unsuspecting fool on Amazon[.com] or eBay).Bottom line? If you buy this book, open the package and immediately put it into the strongest vice you have. When you're through compressing the ten-pound volume, you might end up with one pound of accurate information. The last book of this magnitude that I bought online had 26 pages of errata on their website.In summary, for those of you who are appalled because you gave \\"Inside Dreamweaver MX\\" 5 stars, my advice to you is, \\"follow some of the step-by-step instructions\\" and maybe you will feel my pain."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Inside Dreamweaver MX is an absolute must for novice Dreamweaver users and professionals alike. It's direct and uncluttered approach makes for a book which is both suited to reference and cover to cover reading.As a user of Dreamweaver since it's conception I didn't expect to find much here that would interest me, but I was pleasantly surprised. In particular the 'Under the Hood' chapter and the 'Appendixes' proved a great read. The authors have managed to cover pretty much all bases, and I was pleased to find that the chapters on building dynamic sites, were not just in ASP, but also ASP.NET, ColdFusion, PHP and JSP. Many authors would have settled at covering this topic with just one language example!Novices will be pleased to know that the authors also offer some valuable advice on managing projects and sites as a part of your Dreamweaver 'workflow' and comment from leading community figures backs this advice nicely. The book also covers the newer features in Dreamweaver MX (such as the extended templates functionality) extensively where other publications simply skim the surface.I used to be quite pessimistic about the value of books which 'seemingly' acted as an alternative to the product manual, but Inside Dreamweaver MX really goes the extra distance."},{"Title":"Inside Dreamweaver MX (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Since the book was published in 2002 and I was working with Dreamweaver MX 2004 there were some differences in the directions and what I actually was able to do.

However once I was able to adjust from 2002 to 2004 we were off and running great.This book was able to fill in the blanks of what I already knew in web site design and taught me new advanced features; while teaching me Dreamweaver. I am now sold on using Dreamweaver instead of just scripting all my code as I have been doing.This book has good structure and the ability to build each chapter in such a way that each level up seems easy and quick to master.

Not only does it explains practical uses of the software, it teaches design principles as well. I spent 1 whole day and I finished 500 pages already. Most of examples are easy to follow.

It does a great job of explaining technical tasks and terms without coming across as technical. If you are a current DW designer, this book will take you beyond interface design issues and kindly introduce you to the developmental support that DWMX has become so robust in. If you are currently a developer, this book will give you good reference as to how MX handles ColdFusion, JSP and other common developmental tasks.Of course, if you are altogether new to Dreamweaver, Inside DWMX is a great place to start. I can't recall a single title that was so comprehensive and yet geared towards novices and experienced users alike. It's not the most artistic book out there, but it is full of good no-nonsense tasks and explanations... more than enough to get you up and running without a bunch of unnecessary eye candy."},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"The Machine Gunners, by Robert Westall, is an action/adventure book, which I would recommend mainly to readers of ages nine to fourteen.Possibly younger,seven maybe. Even adults.It is about a boy by the name of Chas McGill and his friends, Audrey, Carrot-juice, Nicky, Clogger and Cem. The book is set during the time of World War II in Garmouth, Northen England in 1941.Chas was the best war souvenier owner in the whole of Garmouth, until Boddser Brown, the school bully found a 3.6 inch nose cone of a German Heinekel III in mint condition. So Boddser was pretty much beating Chas, until one day, after school, whilst walking through his local woods with his friend Cem, Chas discovers an Enemy German Bomber Plane, accompanied by a Machine Gun with 200 rounds of ammunition.They take this finding as a chance to make themselves a base, where they can meet up, and for some of them, even live, along with the protection of a trusty weapon.Each child suffers a dilema or two, some worse than others, but they also manage to overcome them, through the help of their friends. Some of the situations are horrific and unimaginable to know what it was like to be in their shoes.At the start of the story they are all just mates but by the end they are like a family.The story goes on to explain how they did their bit for the war, and ended up with more than they bargained for.It is very entertaining and gripping. It is THE BEST book I have ever read. This is because i enjoyed every minute of it and couldn't put it down.I have very few reasons why i don't think this is a good book, for it takes quite a while to reach the climax, then it draws to an end very quickly and doesn't explain what happens to some of the characters.The Characters:All of them are 13-14 years old.Chas Mcgill: Chas is a jack the lad, common, cheeky, interesting and Very nosey kid. His father works at a mining site and is also an A.R.P Warden (Air Raid Police Warden). He is the main character of the book.Audrey: Audrey is a wealthy girl, who is a Tom boy. She is Stronger and tougher than most of the lads.Cem Jones: Son of the local Undertaker, he gets his name from his dad's job(works in a Cemetery cremating bodies). He is Chas' best friend and is quite a comical character.Nicky: He is a weak feeble boy, whos dad had recently drowned at sea on a ship and his mum was an alcoholic who was a bit loopy. He is also very rich and has a large house, which is being used as a hospice for injured soldiers to recover.Clogger: Clogger is a Glasweigen Orphan thug, with a kind heart, who lives with his Aunt and Uncle. He appears rough, but actually is quite a nice person.I give this book 4 and 3/4 out of 5 stars. An amazing book, tat never fails to impress.By George Teal, 2L"},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"The Machine Gunners is one of the best books I've read recently, combinding an intriguing subject matter and a suspenseful, fast-paced plotline into a great read. I highly recommend it for anyone around the ages of ten to fifteen, though of course this is only a rough guide.This book takes place in a town in Great Britain during World War II. Chas McGill, the main character, has been striving to become the person with the best war souvenier collection in town ever since Boddser Brown bested him with the nose cone from a bomber. He gets his chance when a German Heinkel crashes on the laundary, leaving parts scattered in plain view--and the prize pig of all war souveniers, a functional machine gun, hidden in the cockpit in the hand of the dead gunner. Chas and his friends remove the machine gun, and it becomes a much-pursued secret.After Chas's humiliation at school for fighting \\"dishonorably\\" with his rival Boddser Brown, he bands together with the most unlikely of people: Audrey, Carrot-Juice, Nicky, Cem (short for Cemetary, after his father's profession), and Clogger, who all become friends in order to guard the machine gun and build the underground Fortress which becomes their base and, in a way, a bit of a clubhouse for their soldier games.After firing the machine gun at a Messerschmitt, which ends up crashing into the harbor, the children discover that they're not able to fire the gun again for some unknown reason. Disheartened, they are all gathered in the Fortress one night when Sergeant Rudi Gerlath of the Luftwaffe--the pilot of the shot-down fighter--stumbles into their hideaway. Reacting quickly, they manage to take him prisoner, much to his later disgust (later because he falls asleep soon after he is discovered). Over the course of the next few days, a rough alliance is established between the children of the Fortress and Rudi, and a deal is put forth: if Rudi is able to repair the machine gun, they will give him a boat in order to escape when the German fleet is nearby.When rumors that this has occured and the Germans are invading spreads, Rudi fixes the machine gun and is given his chance to escape. But is it really the Germans who are invading at last? Or will the children take place in a mistake that can turn tragic if the machine gun is fired? To find out, I suggest you read the book: you'll be greatly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"Machine Gunner's is a fantasy like book. But its not! In fact the author (Robert Westhall) was Chas as a young child. This adventure type story tells the tale of a young boy caught up in the trauma of World War 2. Not only are the Germans his enemies, but also people closer to home. His Parents! With all the emotion going on, his family (along with may others) are falling apart. His whole gang have their own problems at home. When he finds a machine gun he knows he can beat Boddser Brown (one of his other enemies) in a competition of collection war souvenirs. But suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand. Him and his friends build a fortress, but when a friendly German stubbles in there hiding place, will he feel the same way about the countries enemies? Suddenly him and his gang are acting like adults. But when Nicky (the weakest gang member) looses his only parent, the German becomes his father figure. Now he is the only adult they can trust.I think this book was written very strongly and emotionally, as it was wrote in third person. It doesn't just tell the reader what is happening, but they get a sense of how the characters feel. I feel that it is for a younger audience, for around 10 to 14 year olds. This book is great when reading with a range of different readers, as the accents of the characters makes the book have the sense of humour. The dialogue is just great! I found the book interesting, as it showed everything that nobody else has. Machine Gunners taught us all, mainly about the emotion of people caught up in the war, which broke there families up!I really like this book, and totally enjoyed reading it. I would love to read the follow up book and find out what happened to the characters. As I have said before; it is very enjoyable to read with a class. When you do read in a group, it is very good to act some scenes out (especially the emotional ones).

I recommend this book to anyone because its full of action but historically it gives you information about what it would be like to live in world war 2 times"},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"The Machine Gunners is a wonderfully written story. The descriptions of WWII life are amazing. All the characters are carefully built up and grow a lot throughout the story. The one drawback to the \\"majesty\\", is the abrupt ending. In one chapter they cut off each story line in somewhat of a cheezy way. No invasion ever happens, and the kids are split up, never to meet again.

A clandestine German machine gun means the difference between cowering in bomb shelters or being proactive.

Westall states that he felt extremely priveliged to have been invited into their secret world.(hence the den in the book). a very detailed account for those interested in ww2 britain - right down to shrapnel collections found under hedges, to chrysanthemums for christmas. an excellent read, and a book adopted by many schools for english tutoring.

Yet the children of Garmouth fight over who has the best war souvenirs collection. Chas McGill discovers the best find ever...a Browning machine gun still attached to a German Bomber. McGill and his friends now have a fortress and a gun capable of smashing though a brick wall over a mile away. How will it all end?The Machine Gunners captures everything there is about childhood adventures. The ones we remember and the ones we wished we'd had.

After ejecting from the plane, the pilot, Sergeant Rudi Gerlath, accidently stumles across the kids' hidden fortress, and is taken prisoner.

There are to many characters!I suggest this book to anyone who wants a good story.Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"This book was an all-time childhood favorite. Military buffs like my younger self will find the setting particularly interesting, but this book will be enjoyed by a much broader audience. It is a classic coming-of-age story that connects with an age-old boyhood fantasy: the desire to go out, build a fort, and fight bad guys--all without one's parents. It's kind of like a G-rated (and much more plausible) Red Dawn. The book's message, moreover, is a wholesome one, celebrating adventurousness and independence and, at the same time, the safety and support that parents and other well-meaning authorities can provide. In sum, a true classic."},{"Title":"The Machine Gunners","review":"When I was in Year 8 at High School this book was an English reading text.

He found the machine gun from a fallen enemy plane that was hit and landed in the woods. Where he and his friend found the gun. The time and place that this book took place in was during the time of World War II in Garmouth, England in 1941.The reason for him keeping the machine gun was because of this other boy. The other boy also collects war items. And they wanted to see who have the best collection of stuff. So the boy was pretty much beating him, until one day, he founded a machine gun, which turn the tides. So he didn't tell any adult at all. So he builds a fort with his friends, to keep the machine gun in secret. But not until who put it to no good use at all.I thought this book wasn't so great. Since this book just wasn't that interesting. It wasn't the type of book that you want to continue reading to find out what's going to happen next. Its climax wasn't way until the end. And it's beginning wasn't the best. It could have been much better than it was. I like war story, but this wasn't as I accepted at all. It didn't have any action at all. And the action was mainly just happening instantly and was pretty dull.

Sometimes it's with you on those trips to the used book store. It was certainly with me a couple of months ago when I stumbled onto this slim treasure alone in the racks, marked down to an amazing $2.98. Looking at the item here on Amazon has given me some insight to the fact that this is one hard to find book on this side of the pond. It's a British import that obviously never got any sort of an American distribution deal, which is a shame, because this is one of those rare volumes that really delivers.The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM from here on out) is certainly a subject that could use a little more light these days. The NWOBHM didn't get enough US press as it was happening, and the passage of time has dulled the memory down to a handful of bands that managed to make it here in the US market. In reality, of course, the NWOBHM was massively important to the development of heavy metal, spawning several subgenres and influencing metal's \\"look\\" and style forevermore.Ok, ok, context. Back in 1980 or so, I was 16 and listening to any heavy music that I could find. The big American bands of the time were the hard rock mainstays of the 1970's: KISS, Nugent, Aerosmith. Van Halen was new on the scene but quickly rewriting the hard rock script. Canada had Rush and Triumph making commercial waves. Zeppelin, Purple, and Sabbath were the old guard of British heavy rock, largely overtaken at that point by punk in the UK, and by poppier hard rock bands like Journey and REO Speedwagon here on the American charts. \\"Heavy metal\\" as a musical form had yet to coalesce, at the time a fluid term that could be applied to anyone from Judas Priest to Aldo Nova.But a funny thing was happening in the UK. A fresh wave of bands were taking the \\"do it yourself\\" approach that the punks had pioneered and applying it to their own style of music. Magazines like Creem and Hit Parader picked up on the most successful of the groups, helping Iron Maiden and Def Leppard to become stars here in the States. Beyond those bands, though, the NWOBHM was largely ignored here is the US. 30 years later, the NWOBHM stands as a mostly overlooked period of metal history. Sure, most casual fans can point to the influence that Diamond Head had on Metallica, but it takes a truly knowledgeable fan to name any bands beyond Saxon or Venom.And wow, THAT'S where this book has value. Author John Tucker spends little time on the name brand bands, and instead takes an in-depth look at the bands who rode in the NWOBHM trenches. There is a TON of background material to be found here, on what seems like a million different bands, some I'd heard of, most that I didn't. Tucker himself has incredible authority to write on these bands, as he was a journalist and musician himself, there on the ground as the NWOBHM was happening all around him. I love his style. You can feel his enthusiasm and deep knowledge of his subject on every page of this book, as he chronicles the ups and downs of dozens of bands. Holocaust, Bitches Sin, Shiva, Satan, Tank, Savage, Girl, Angel Witch, Rock Goddess, goodness gracious, the list goes on and on. This book is a veritable encyclopedia of NWOBHM bands, most of who toiled in relative obscurity for no more than the love of playing the music that they loved. What you get here is 223 pages of living, breathing NWOBHM history, no filler, no waste.Thanks to this book, I've spent countless hours of fun on YouTube catching up on my NWOBHM knowledge. Fortunately you can find most of the bands and songs referenced in the book. This book is a MUST HAVE for any fan of heavy music. It's become a gem of my music lit library. Do what you gotta do to get it. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"New Wave Of British Heavy Metal","review":"Nice book here told from the viewpoint of somebody who was involved with the scene in a minor band. Not a comprehensive type book listing all the bands but focuses on the author's favorites and does have some obscure bands. Nice appendices. A lot of cool tales and quotes. I learned a lot about Neat Records. Back when this was happening all I had to rely on was Kerrang and my local stores heavy metal import section. A nice addition to any metal fans' collection who's interested in the NWOBHM."},{"Title":"Restless (Blaze) (Harlequin Temptation, No 807)","review":"Video taping her boss/best friend's wedding, Paige Cassidy couldn't help bringing the lens back to the tall, broad shouldered stud that &quot;filled out his black tuxedo jacket to mouthwatering perfection.&quot; With his sensuous lips and rugged air, she couldn't help thinking of wild night of passion and hot nights beneath star-studded skies.Page caught the bridal bouquet, and optimistically believes that this time she'll find a man with commitment, marriage and children in mind. She's determined to rise above her background, with the aid of her self-improvement classes, to create a wonderful future. And while a restless man like Jack Mission couldn't possibly commit to a future with her, there are still things that a woman can be learn from such a sensual man.Jack only plans to remain in town two weeks, running the ranch until his brother returns from his honeymoon. When Paige catches his eye with her prim, self-determinism, Jack knows she has no illusions about him. He makes it very clear he's the restless kind of guy, but they both share a need for relief and why not indulge themselves with one another. Never mind Paige is nothing like the women Jack usually keeps company with. And never mind he finds himself slowing down, luxuriating in their sensual experiences in a way he's never experienced before.RESTLESS by Kimberly Raye 0is a credible tease for the reader, as well as for our marvelous heroine. Tempting, seductively leading the reader page by page in a spine tingling, hot blooded romp without culmination, forcing the reader to hold and experience the moment with the heroine, leaving the reader feeling deliciously decadent and ultimately satisfied. Seldom does a romance truly read like a love making experience, from the tease, the climax, to the denouncement with such passion and energy. Very highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Restless (Blaze) (Harlequin Temptation, No 807)","review":"This is the 3rd installment. It's hot and funny.

It does this well. As a bonus, you get some tidbits of history at times. It describes the basic teachings of Buddhism, while adeptly breaking down the dizzying array of different schools into general descriptions without painting them in caricature or in a stereotypical manner. The vast variety of different forms of Buddhism could be a challenge for any author. One could either gloss over them all, or write a bulky, encyclopedic tome - Dr. Guruge balanced this subject well.While I know he is personally enthusiastic about his religion, his book is unbiased and academic - which is refreshing for a Free Thinking, skeptic like myself. It looks at the warts and growing pains (such as schisms and criticisms) fairly. It also looks ahead to \\"Buddhism today.\\" This last chapter may suffer my only criticism - it was too brief. I know how active Dr. Guruge has been, worldwide (his passport probably has stamps from more countries than I am aware exist), in Buddhism during the last few decades, so I know he could have given us much more for that chapter - but, as promised, he was brief.This is a good read for those who want a brief overview of Buddhism."},{"Title":"What In Brief Is Buddhism?","review":"Dr. Ananda W.P. Guruge has had an excellent background as a scholar, educator, and diplomat, and this book reflects his wide academic background in the history and development of Buddhism. He explores Buddhism as it manifests in various Asian countries and leaves implications for the future of Buddhism. He also describes the common elements of the philosophy which bind all Buddhists, whether Sri Lankan or Japanese or Tibetan together."},{"Title":"Trees Wear Glasses, Don't They?","review":"The title may confuse a casual browser - this book is not about trees. It is the heartbreaking story of unbearable loss, grief, and then peace and victory through God's grace. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I turned the pages. Any mother (or father) who has ever loss a son, or is struggling with the spiritual battles that attack our youth across America today, will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Man in Essence: Folk Tales and Photographs from Irian Jaya","review":"This book was published in the honour of Larry Hillhouse, who spent 18 months in West Papua. After he had died of cancer, his parents published some of his photos and the tales he collected in this book.Unfortunately they have done so knowing nothing about Papua.The result is a collection of potentially interesting tales that are not accompanied by any note on which region or ethnic group they come from. This is a pity, as they seem to come from varied regions, judging from those few that contain place names.Ditto the photos and drawings that are used as illustration: no information on what they show or where they were taken. It is obvious though that many were NOT taken where the tale in question was collected - highland photos accompany coastal stories.Even the translation is suspect. Basic Indonesian kinship terms (like adik = younger brother, or kakek = grandfather, but used as grandmother here!) appear as capitalized personal names in the English text!All in all, the tales might be interesting if you just want to read them for their own sake (maybe for children?).But if you are seriously interested in the fascinating oral traditions of West Papua, you'd be much better off buying the following book, containing a more extensive collection of folk-tales/myths from the Lani people and accompanied by great background info:Vernacular Christianity Among the Mulia Daniby Douglas James Hayward."},{"Title":"Sir Henry Fowler (Oakwood Library of Railway His)","review":"From the Foreword by H.A.V. Bulleid -\\"If a prize had been offered in the mid-1920s for the best known and most likeable Chief Mechanical Officer (CME) of the four recently grouped railways, it would have been won hands down by Sir Henry Fowler.Strangely, his most important achievements were not directly concerned with his railway - though that in no way detracts from his value as a Railway Biography subject.His knighthood was earned by outstanding war effort, first as Director of Production for all munitions work throughout the country; and later, from early 1918.as Deputy Director of Aircraft Production which included his relaunch of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough.Why, then, one might ask, should these achievements eclipse his job as CME? I think the answer lies in his early days on the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) under Aspinall. He was the brainiest of the Horwich quartet which included Hughes, Maunsell and Gresley. He won a Whitworth Exhibition in 1891 at age 20 and was put in the Test Room whiles till an apprentice. He soon became the Manager, then added the Gas Department; and performed so well that Derby took him as Research and Gas Manager in 1900. By 1907 he was Works Manager and as the year 1910 opened he was CME of the midland Railway.That sounds grand, but there was a flaw which turned out to be serious: he had spent no time in the Drawing Office, nor on any locomotive design work, and he had no running shed or footplate experience. These empty spaces, coupled with his very sympathetic but hearty approach to discussions, explain why he tolerated three separate LMS drawing offices, all mutually antagonistic!He should have integrated them into a forward-looking team - and he had the data to set their goal-posts from the 2-6-0 and 2-8-0 criteria set out by the Association of Railway Locomotive Engineers in 1918. His biographer finds fair excuses for this failure, which left the LMS floundering with small engines until he adroitly borrowed \`Lord Nelson' drawings from Maunsell in 1927 and got the North British Locomotive Company to design the \`Royal Scot'. But there was no follow-up of new locomotive design and he wisely switched to full time work on establishing the new LMS Research Department (and on his other wide interests) to make way for Stanier to be the CME in 1932. This slightly clouded his last four years with the LMS, as some blamed him for the \`greatwesternisation' of Derby; but his 1932-33 letters from Cairo retain all the usual Fowler nonchalance.Sir Henry never took credit for engines, not even the \`Royal Scot'. He certainly would have credited others for all the achievements in Appendix Three [Summary of Named Locomotives 1911-1941]. I expect he took the blame, if any, for the zero achievement of Appendix Six [Locomotive Project Studies under Fowler].\\"This is an excellent and readable book, well-written and well-illustrated, and well-worth reading.The Contents are -P009: The Early DaysP021: The Rise to CMEP037: Consolidation and WarP051: The War Years IP063: The War Years IIP067: The Return to the Midland RailwayP079: GroupingP093: Back to the CME's ChairP105: The Final Years as CMEP111: Experiments and Final OfferingsP120: Research and the Approach of RetirementP131: Retirement and the Cairo CongressP141: Palestine and the Return HomeP149: The Final YearsP158: Appendices (x7)P166: BibliographyP167: Index"},{"Title":"Code Breakers","review":"This is an exciting national and international intrigue-spy story.

You aren't going to be able to put this book down because you are going to be filled with curiosity about the next event happening. Enjoy reading it......"},{"Title":"Code Breakers","review":"I thought that Code Breakers by D. S. Peterson was a great read. It was edgy, intriguing, sexy and filled with more twists and turns than a high speed roller coaster. It contained all of the elements that I look for in a political thriller/ espionage book. The characters were believable and likable. In fact I found bits of myself in more than one. I liked the way that the characters came from different directions to collide together in maximum action. The secret society intrigued me and really caused me to think. I was also fascinated by the information brought forward on the conflict between the Christians, the Jews and the Muslims. It gave me a new perspective on the issues we are facing in our world today. All that and a little romance to boot. To me, this book is a combination of Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, David Morrell, David Balducci and Janet Evonovich all combined in one. Then it was sprinkled with just a touch of Jim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. I highy recommend it to all and am anxioulsy waiting for the second book in the series."},{"Title":"Depeche Mode Anthology","review":"\\"Depeche Mode: Anthology\\" is a great book for piano players looking to play pieces by Depeche Mode. This book came out in 1991, after \\"Violator\\" and before \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\", so the music in it is, primarily, from the band's earlier days. The sheet music is written for piano and includes guitar tabs. This is a great book to give to a piano playing, Depeche Mode fan.The book covers most of their singles from their beginning to 1991, but has a strong emphasis on the music from \\"Black Celebration\\", \\"Music For the Masses\\", and \\"Violator\\". Here is a list of songs the book has the sheet music for:Behind the WheelBlack CelebrationBlasphemous RumoursBlue DressBut Not TonightDreaming of MeEnjoy the SilenceEverything CountsFlexibleFly on the WindscreenGet the Balance RightI Want You NowIt Doesn't MatterIt's Called a HeartJust Can't Get EnoughLeave In SilenceLie to MeLittle 15Love, In ItselfMaster and ServantThe Meaning of LoveNever Let Me Down AgainNew LifeNothingNow This is FunPeople Are PeoplePersonal JesusPipelinePleasure Little TreasureA Question of LustA Question of TimeSacredSee YouShake the DiseaseShameSomebodySomething to DoStories of OldStrangeloveStrippedSweetest PerfectionWorld Full of NothingIt is a great compilation and the only downfall to this book is some of the songs left out of it. It's well worth the investment for any piano player who enjoys Martin Gore and Vince Clarke's writing."},{"Title":"Depeche Mode Anthology","review":"This Anthology contains most of the early works of Depeche Mode. The CD The Singles 81-85 is where most of the songs in this Anthology can be heard, but there are important hits from '86-'91 as well. The arrangements were made by the composer/arranger/educator Frank Metis, who just passed away in March 2010. They are extremely close to the original songs and are set excellently for voice and piano. Many of the additional musical lines are put in small notes so you can choose which to play. \\"Love in Itself\\", \\"Shake the Disease\\" (great transcription of small solos!), \\"Get the Balance Right\\", \\"People are People\\", and \\"Black Celebration\\" are fun to play. \\"Everything Counts\\" puts any good pianist to work with its cross-rhythms between the left and right hands. This is no longer in print so you'll have to try the second-hand sites. It is a large book and has the physical problem of any music book you use at the piano--the binding can break and the pages fall out. It's still worth it! It is printed beautifully and compared to the newer collection of later works, it's much better, bigger, and has arrangements closer to the songs. Also, most of the old songs are not in the newer collections! Depeche Mode have been photographed with Frank Metis, so they not only approved of the Anthology, but thought the arrangements were good. These are the songs which launched their career. The chord changes are brilliant, the texts are often very deep, and the rhythms are unique. A \\"must have\\" for all pianists/arrangers interested in the first years of one of the leading synthi pop groups of the 80's. So glad I finally got it."},{"Title":"Focke-Wulf Fw 190D - Walk Around No. 10","review":"This book is a fairly good modeller's reference for the FW 190 D-9 aircraft.The first half of the book is a walk-around with photo's inside and out- though not super extensive. This section could have more detail.The best part of the book is the last half which includes color profiles of aircraft featured in b&amp;w war-time photos- great information for tactical markings, and gives a good interpretation of the oftentimes confusing late-war German colors.This book ties in with Kommandeur Decals which brought out 1/48th and 1/72nd scale decals of each of the aircraft featured in the second half of the book (but these may be hard to find now). Each of the subjects featured in the book is interesting in its own right, varying from run-of-the-mill markings to the unusual.Overall, a must-have reference for Dora fans, whether they model or not."},{"Title":"Focke-Wulf Fw 190D - Walk Around No. 10","review":"This book is very good except the wings on Yellow 10 in the book are the wings that belong to the D9 at the Air Force Museum.

You do get to see the entire plane, engine, cockpit, wheel wells, structure of the plane. My favorite pages were the 3-d drawings that showed how the engine cowl and machine gun ammo doors opened and armament system. 4 pages of color plates to show the camouflage schemes and what RAL colors were used (very helpful to modelers).A good book, but not up to the usual standards of other walk arounds I have.

Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"This book has the potential to change anyone's life. Every one has at least one dream, one heart's desire. The authors will help you make it come true. They will explain to you how life is a banquet and will give you the motivation to do anything. By using non specialistic language, they explain how our mind plays all sorts of tricks on us and how we have the power to change that. If you doubt me, just try, for one day only, to eliminate the words &quot;but&quot; or &quot;what if&quot; from your vocabulary for just one day. I bet you can't do it. Well, it's time to get off our but's, stop making excuses and create for ourselves the life we really want. Buy this book now. (But... it's a bit expensive) (But... I am not 100% sure) (But... what if comes too late) (But... I can't really afford it right now) (But... what if I don't enjoy it?) See what they mean? Just DO IT."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"When you first look at this book the size of it can be intimidating but Peter McWilliams has scattered motivational quotes throughout the book which are impressed upon the subconscious mind due to the formatting that was used. That and the well written and clear advice that he gives on how to overcome 'your comfort zone' holding you back from what you really want out of life combines to set you up for a new burst of energy and ambition for the next stage of your life. At least it worked that way for me.The author doesn't preach at you but uses an informal and comfortable style to encourage you to achieve your best at whatever point you are in your life. The exercises in the book can be very enlightening on where you are and why you're there instead of where you want to be. I've done these exercises at different times and they are always useful in 'kicking' me in the pants to get me off my buts."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I picked up this book over 4 years ago. At the time I was in a major 'rut': I was in an unfulfilling job and enduring a bad relationship. It was no wonder that I fell into a state of depression. After reading this no-nonsense 'self help' book, I realized that the only thing stopping me from being happy and reaching my dreams was myself! After much soul searching and serious trepidations I made significant changes in my life, ones which were terrifying, but necessary, so that I could pursue my dream of becoming an elementary school teacher. To achieve this goal I quit my job, ended my relationship, sold my house, and moved back home with my parents. Now, 3 years later, I have a Bachelor of Arts Degree and have just completed my Bachelor of Education Degree. Now there is nothing stopping me from living out my dream of being a teacher.This book helps you realize that whatever it is you want in life, you CAN achieve it, no matter where you're starting from. Many people are in pursuit of 'cash' their entire lives, and the fortunate others are pursuing their 'dreams'. If you are one of those who are discontented with your existence and wish to live a fuller and happier life then I highly recommend reading this book. It may not be a 'cure-all' for your situation but it will likely open your eyes to all the possibilities which exist out there. So &quot;DO IT! GET OFF YOU BUT!&quot;"},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who is ready to change. It is not written for closed minds or closed hearts. I found it a relief that the book did not constantly speak of religion. My beliefs are different from the majority of US beliefs and I am very private about my religion. I feel the book does an excellent job of not pushing religion of any sort. The excercises and ideas within the book are creative and interesting. More than that, they work. Peter McWilliams has inspired me to begin thinking in a whole new way and life has become so much more enjoyable for me. Open your heart, open your mind, and begin your own personal journey. However, as the author himself said in one of his books, self-help books only help those who are ready for them. If you are not, I'm sure this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Do It!

Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I purchased Do It! expecting it to help me get motivated and overcome procrastination. I'm writing this review, not necessarily to be critical, but to inform prospective readers of the book's high content of New Age thinking. I point this out simply because nothing in the book title or description gives any clue as to the authors religious/spiritual point of reference.The reader is guided into such practices as the consultation with an inner \\"Master Teacher\\" (as part of a greater inner \\"Sanctuary\\") and meditative chant (complete with a recommended list of tones for energy, healing, etc). It stops short of stating outright the New Age belief that we are all gods, but it certainly drops hints (i.e. tithing your money is saying thank you to YOURSELF for your abundance). The authors carefully tip-toe around the discussion of any belief in a creator, as if your creator isn't to have any say in what your purpose is or what your highest dreams should be....huh? Moral standards are subject to being completely discarded if they are deemed counter-productive to achieving your \\"Big Dream\\". Nowhere in the discussion of guilt is it even hinted that you might need to seek reconciliation with God or others, guilt is portrayed merely an energy to be used for escaping your \\"comfort zone\\". The authors refer you to Matthew, chapter 7 as a biblical stamp of approval on their ideas, yet they completely ignore the message of the rest of the Book.The pity of it all is that in between all the aformentioned psychobabble is some genuine wisdom, motivation, and downright good ideas, written in a humorous, easy to read style that makes the book hard to put down. I truly believe the book could have been as much or more effective without all the pushing of religious beliefs. If you're into eastern mysticism or New Age thinking you may find this a wonderful book. I give the 3 star rating arbitrarily because I could not in good concience apply many of the practices prescribed by the author, but again, readers of another mindset may find the book extremely useful and motivating."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"This was off the beaten path of some of the motivational books I've read, (A. Robbins et al). It's aphorisms that were on every other page were enlightening, humorous and enjoyable if you like that sort of thing, and I do. The religious overtones, and the meditative qualities of this book lacked something for me. If your looking for that sort of thing I suggest Deepak Chopra's writings. This is good if your in the mood for &quot;Motivation/Meditation Lite&quot;.

Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"During my last battle with procrastination, lethargy and anger at not making headway upon my goals, I purchased Peter McWilliams book \\"Do It!\\". I had reached a point where I was stagnant, and hoped that this book might do like the title suggest and get me off my butt. The book looks huge, clocking in at over 500 pages, but don't let that fool you. It is barely half of that because there must be 300 quotes blocked out throughout the text. I read the introduction and became interested in what McWilliams had to say.McWilliams breaks the book up into six larger sections full of small chapters. He tackles his topic quickly and abundantly. The book begins by explaining the reasons why we procrastinate, working through finding a goal, achieving that goal, and what to do after the goal has been achieved. The most helpful section to me was the first as he explains the reasons why many of us do not achieve our goals. His belief is that going against our comfort zone is the hardest thing to do, and it is this comfort zone that prefers us to procrastinate.I think that the book is above average in motivating you. McWilliams has a way of writing that excites you to the point where you think you can do what you need to accomplish your goals (even if finding a goal is your goal). He provides tips to help you achieve your goal, like needing to work on your goal two hours a day. He uses a handful of exercises to help you identify your goal, but otherwise there is not much interaction for the reader. He also provides a lot of quotes. Some may find quotes motivational. I found them entertaining. There are more quotes than just those that appear in boxes. McWilliams tends to write by using a quote, and then interpreting it and expanding on it to get his point across. So, you need to like quotes before reading this book.I feel like I got something out of this book. It's not the best motivational book, as it didn't make me dive into achieving my goal, but it did get me to think about my goal and what I need to do about it. It also gave me ways to combat the comfort zone. Overall, I think if you have strayed slightly from your goal this book will help you get back on track, or if you are looking for a goal to pursue it may help you identify one."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I have read a lot of self-help books, but this is the first one that actually helped.First off, I would say DO THE EXCERCISES!!! There aren't many of them, they are simple -- though not easy. They force you to focus, to confront yourself and your assumptions about your life.The main thing I took away from this book was a more realistic outlook. The world does not owe you a thing. As Mark Twain said, &quot;The world doesn't owe you anything; it was here first.&quot; I think a lot of people are like me -- it's not that we don't have any dreams -- it's that we have too many. this leads to a sense of not having enough time. It's like being in the perfect library -- there are so many books you want to read, you have a hard time decding which one to start with. Our dreams are often like that. What is needed is a plan. What do you really want to read. Not, I want to read Moby Dick, and then Madame Bovary... the trick, when confronted with too many choices, is to find a more overarching dream -- I want to have read the best American Novels of the 19th Century. Then, as sad as it may make you feel, you drop Madame Bovary. BUT that doen't mean you cvan't come back later.The trick is to START! Often you will find that when you pursue one dream, other dreams you had take care of themselves in the process.Buy this book. It's a quick read -- even with the excercises, and you will come away with a sense that it really is never too late, and that with work, your dreams are possible."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I spend a lot more time reading about how I should go about achieving my dreams, rather than actually achieving them. I have read a disgusting amount of self-help books in the area of motivation and realising and making dreams come true. And here I am, in the process, but perhaps taking more time to make them come true than is really necessary.This is the be all and end all of motivation books. The research that has gone into this piece, the endless and inpsiring quotes, the humour of the authors and the fabulous and down-to-earth method in which the book is written make it the finest of thousands of books on the same topic. Perhaps there is nothing really new in this book that you won't find elsewhere, but the authors work to make the readers realise their power, and the possiblity of their dreams.Granted, I am not one to carry out time consuming exercises in discovering my true passion, which this book contains a few of. I personally have never had the patience for them (perhaps the very reason my dreams are not yet a reality) but I believe they are important, and the authors present them in a way that simplifies the process of motivation.I found this book to be astonishingly good, wonderfully presented and researched, simple, and inspiring, much like 'You can't afford the luxury of a negative thought', another of their impassioned and humourous pieces. I feel like going out there and doing it right now; working to make my dreams come true, and after reading Do It!, I know it is not as hard as I have been led to believe. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Do It! Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"Life was pretty bad for me at the time I read this book. A friend loaned it to me on a whim, he said his mother had sent it to him and he didn't hadn't had the chance to read it. So I took it home and I was transformed over night. I started it and couldn't put it down. Four years later, I have to write a paper for a college class and I keep thinking about the book, wishing I still had it so I could quote from it. I figured I'd try searching for it on Amazon.com and amazingly it was there! Thank God, this book is still in print.

Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was in college and would recommend the paperback version to anyone who is looking for some answers in life. The overall theme of the book is how to deal with procrastination. Many of the questions that we face on a daily basis are easily answered if we just make the effort to look within. This book is light hearted but not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to make changes in your life and be open to facing some hard truths that you may not have known about yourself. Don't be intimidated by the size of the book --close to half of it is really one page motivational quotes. Most of the content is common knowledge but the goal of reading the book should be how to apply the knowledge. Perfect for any age and an excellent gift for those into self improvement.

The inspirational quotes, the undeniable logic &quot;we were taught we could have anything we wanted. What we weren't taught is that we couldn't have EVERYTHING we wanted.&quot; This is so true, and the book is just filled cover to cover with ideas and points-of-view that are easy to accept or easy to dismiss. Since each person has their own beliefs, this book easily covers everyone without offending anyone. I can not emphasize this enough: As a motivational wake up call, buy this book and read it every six months. Drill what he says into your head (only the parts you like, not the whole book is necessary) and you will be happier and more successful. Just reading the book won't do it.

Don't let your fear paralyze you; don't let your mind to work against you. USE your tools. Leave you comfort zone and jump off into the unknown realm of your dreams.

Let's Get off Our Buts : A Guide to Living Your Dreams","review":"I was fortunate to hear Peter McWilliams speak at an Insight Seminar around the time this book was published (1991). \\"Do It! Let's Get Off Our Buts\\" has the same same easy, upbeat style in writing that Peter McWilliams has as a speaker.This is a gonzo book filled on every right-hand page with juicy quotations. You could easily buy the book at this low price for the quotations alone. It's a fat book that encompasses psychology, philosophy (McWilliams is a student of John-Rogers, founder of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness and many other organizations devoted to peace and spirituality), and practical advice--with lots of humor in the mix.I liked his coining of the word \\"selfing\\"--which means \\"doing for one's Self, in the larger sense of Self, as if True Self, or 'To thine own self be true.' It means fulfilling the dreams, goals and aspirations inherent within us. It means living our life 'on purpose.'\\" This term and its definition are, for me, at the heart of the book and what it uniquely has to offer in the bustling world of self-help books.A friend asked me after my book was published, \\"How does it feel to be living your dream?\\" I replied that \\"Your dream is only as good as you are, so you better get ready.\\" This book is an excellent guide to help you get there and get ready for what comes next.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"},{"Title":"Do It!

My exposure has been mostly in the mainframe environment. I decided to make a switch to PC development as I find most of the latest technologies are taking place here. I'm very comfortable with programming and thought nothing about teaching myself Java. I quickly realized that it is very different from the other languages that I have learned! I do know C and that helped a bit, but the whole concept of object-oriented was unfamiliar territory.I originally read Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 2 book but I still wasn't clear. It wasn't until I read Ms. Barker's book, however, that I really saw how to structure an application around objects. In my opinion, this book should be read before reading Mr. Horton's book.I'm in love with this book, with the author's writing style, the examples and development of the Student Registration System case study application!

It's corrected &gt; many fuzzy ideas that I've held about object oriented programming (despite &gt; development in C++, Java and 4gls such as Powerbuilder). The author is clearly &gt; &gt; enthusiastic about her topic and this attitude carries over into her text &gt; and style making this book a good read as well as a valuable reference.

For some reason WROX always seems to find people who can explain stuff straigth to the point. Jacquie Barker has the talent to explain things in such a way that you don't have a headache at the end of each chapter.

I found it easy to read and understand and enjoyed the pace. I found this book to hit upon the very scope it advertised - that is understanding java objects in the midst of learning java. It also set up areas within the book that reviewed earlier areas, which I enjoyed. I was hoping to get into jdbc and persisting object state with databases rather than a text file as is in the book, but instantly found the reason why text files were used due to finding an inexpensive jdbc driver is difficult. DSNs could also be used, but there are other books for that topic. I recommend it.

Jacquie Bakers's Beginning Java Objects, Dr. David Taylor's Object Technology: A Manager's Guide, and - of course - Walter Savitch's Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.Walter Savitch's book is marvelous, repetitive by design; with these three books, there is no place else to go except forward.Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I approached this book as an intermediate Java Programmer. The &quot;Beginning&quot; annoyed me because I was not a beginner. Most Java Books tell you how Java works which is fine. But, this book tells you how to use Java. Now you can take all of your Java parts you know and build a fine application. It an excellent approach to teaching Java. It is a must for beginners and intermediate programmers. It will definiely enhance your coding skills and bring you to mastery on the fast track."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Mrs. Barker goes into excellent detail for a 'beginning' book; the explanations are clear and well defined, along with the code. An excellent starter for those who were new to Java, just as myself."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Finalmente algu&eacute;m escreveu um livro que ensina a projetar software verdadeiramente orientado a objeto usando Java!O problema dos livros de OO &eacute; que eles tendem a ser muito te&oacute;ricos ou muito voltados &agrave; sintaxe de uma determinada linguagem.

As this book can really help you understand what object-oriented programming is , meanwhile the case study will introduce java language in the purpose to walk you through all examples and how to create and implement an object oriented java application.The diagrams and sentences are very clear and easy to follow, the materials is rich and interesting. I think that the author is quite smart as she really deeply understands what a beginner or intermidiate programmer always confuse about what objects is?"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"First let me say despite being published a few years ago this book is still fully relevant as of this review. The author takes a conceptual approach that this much needed for those learning an OOP language for the first time. I'm a PHP programming trying to learn Java. I purchased Ivor Horton's Begining Java 2 book and a few hundred pages in I learned a lot but still lacked the fundamentals of OOP. Jacquie's book has come to the rescue to fill in the underpinnings of objects and how to think about them when tackling software development. When I finish reading her book I'll go back to Ivor's book and continue learning syntax and other important aspects of the Java language. If you're new to OOP definately get this book no matter what language your're trying to learn. Get this in addition to a standard how program in language X book and you'll be doing yourself a favor! Note: I bought the old red Wrox press book and got a great deal, I here the new version is the exact same book with a new cover and no updated material."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"As the title of the book suggests, this book is more about Object Oriented Modeling rather than being a Java only book. This book is intended to be a university textbook. Thus, it has few exercise questions at end of each chapter.All examples in the book revolve around a Student Registration System application developed in java. The organization of chapters is in three sections. First section focuses on basic OO concepts. The second section gives introduction of UML and some Java concepts like Garbage Collection and Exception Handling. Having laid down all the basic stuff i.e. OO concepts and model, the third section of the book is mainly about implementation. It describes GUI Layout fundamentals, Frames, Panels and Listener classes.The book is easy to follow and useful for beginners. I will recommend this book to everyone who wants to start learning OO programming. Basic OO concepts are presented in the book in nice way. I have not read any other book doing it in such a simple way. Other books tend to get more abstract or complicated. This book presents a nice mix of code and OO Modeling."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This is a very easy to read book. Beginners will find it very useful to learn object technology. The downside is that instead of focusing on just one topic, it tries to cover too many things like GUI development and other things. That's why I gave it a four star.I really liked the association matrix method of finding associations between classes. Simple explanations such as Methodology = Tool + Process + Notation that is explained with pictures is really nice.I was shocked to find some of the diagrams being drawn like those that you will find on an email discussion without formal usage of UML notation."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I am doing a course in computing and AI and have had no programming experience before university. I found that I understood the examples in the coursework and recommended reading (Deitel and Deitel), but when it came to writing programmes myself I was confused about syntax etc. This book gave a much more comprehensible explanation of what java sytnax meant, and how object oriented programming works. I would recommend it to anyone beginning programming in java, especially those with no prior programming experience. I also think it would be helpful to those with no experience of OO languages."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This is one of the best Java books I've come across. I found this to be one of the most complete and easy to understand explainations of java objects yet. I learned a lot about the language as well through the introductions in the book. I would highly recommend this to anyone getting started with Java. In fact, this should be the first book you own before purchasing a core language reference."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Before learning Java, you must master OO concepts,without a good background of OO, you won't use Java language,properly. This book go step by step for newbies,it explains clearly the OO concepts, gives a good introduction to UML(as an analysis tool before programming) and of course explains the java language.If you know nothing aboutjava language and OO concepts, this is the BOOK you should buy to start. You will enjoy the first page to the last.The only negative point,is that the answers of the exercices are not available."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Out of the 10 or so books on Java I have purchased, this book is more valueable than those 10 combined.I think this is because most Java book authors aren't good teachers, even though they are good programmers.If I was going to give someone a starting point to learn java, a starting point for someone who has a very basic understanding of programming, this book would pretty much be my recommendation.I came from a strong html background, with a little knowledge of programming through javascript, and now after working through this book I can do the work of a java developer in the web services company I work for. (No longer just the html guy)."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"The subject matter found in the book (especially at the beginning) should be included in all Java programming &quot;how to&quot; books. The author's writing style is very clear and easy to understand. I wish I would have found this book along time ago. Simply put... this book puts it all together."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This book is excellent in teaching you how to design a good object oriented model and how to transform this into a program. The book starts off with a basic introduction of what java is about. Once the reader is familiar with this, the book goes onto explain what UML is about and to combine this with Java (e.g. encapsulation, polyphorism, inheritance etc.) Most books would stop here however,the author goes on furhter to explain why it is necessary to use it and what would happen if we didn't. The book consists of a case study and the author walks through this at a slow pace explaining how to discover the objects and the relationships between them. The initial approach to design is critical and hard for beginners to grasp, hence the author provides you with all the necessary steps to take. This book explains the concept of swing user interface very well. There are many examples in the book on how to create a graphical user interface including the case study. At the end of the book is a working case study program. This book is a must for beginners and I would highly recommend it. I've read other books based on java objects but they coming nothing close to this one (and neither do the prices!!!)"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"When people who have not previously done object-oriented programming begin to learn Java, my experience has been that they mistakenly assume that learning the language itself is the only thing that they need to do. In reality, the most important thing (and in my opinion most difficult) is to learn how to create a good object-oriented design. Before they can create a good design, they need to understand object-oriented concepts and the tools that are available to them such as UML. Jacquie's book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to those concepts and explaining them clearly. It has been said that you cannot explain something well to another person unless you really understand it yourself. If that is the case, Ms. Barker clearly understands object design very well.If you are learning Java or considering learning Java for the first time, I recommend reading these books in the following order:Beginning Java 2 (Ivor Horton)Professional Java Programming (Brett Spell)Beginning Java Objects (Jacquie Barker)These three Wrox titles complement one another very well, and are all well-written and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"In reading Barker's title, one gets an extraordinarily good education into the major considerations for object-oriented design. Although the book's title would imply that Java developers would benefit most, this is a great introductory manual to OOP and Java 2, and perfectly suited for other platforms, as well.It's actually a very helpful, very educational, very entertaining look at object-oriented software design, at modeling, and at proper management of the process in which they are used to create great software applications.Barker does a fantastic job of describing the process and life-cycle involved with designing and coding a system, and centers the concepts presented around an iterative practical application, a student registration system for college. She also bases her method of teaching concepts-first-and-then-code around pseudocode, so the reader isn't inundated by too much syntax while trying to grasp fundamental subjects. Barker also steps the reader through the procedural methods of designing an application, such as creating a vision document and glossary of system-specific terms.In doing so, Barker also uses one of the friendliest voices in her writing that's truly a rarity in technical books these days.Being an ASP.NET developer working almost exclusively in C#, I got a lot out of it. The Java syntax might be a stretch for VB devs; the book also makes for great recommended reading for those just starting to get into OOP or Java. I'd also recommend this book for Microsoft developers migrating up from Windows DNA and ASP 3.0 technologies, as it really does a good job of walking you through OOP/OOD, which in my opinion has proven to be THE major hurdle for many devs in embracing .NET.The only downside I can see about this book is that because of the title, developers non-Java other platforms and disciplines will unfairly look past it, and therefore miss out on the important lessons contained within its pages. The book's key strength lies in the chapters on designing use case scenarios and UML diagrams, which I really enjoyed.It's these unexpected advantages that have put this book in a prominent place in my home library that keep it easily within reach."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I've found that many other texts on introductory Java get you started by saying Hello to the World as soon as the first chapter of the book. Barker takes a different approach by giving just a little &quot;Taste of Java&quot; by executing System.out.println(&quot;Wheee!!!!&quot;) in the introductory chapter. However, from then on very little new Java syntax is seen until Chapter 13, leaving us wondering what happens in the intervening chapters 2-12? As the title suggests, this book is not merely an introduction to Java, but an introduction to objects in Java.These first dozen chapters provide an introduction to object modeling, which every Java programmer, if not every object-oriented software developer, should understand fully. This is where the fundamental concepts of abstraction, classes, object instantiation, method invocations and even inheritance are first introduced, only to be re-introduced as Java-specific syntax later on in the book. Unlike the many other books written on learning to program Java, Jacquie Barker takes the time to make sure the reader understands how to design an entire system in an object-oriented fashion from scratch, by painstakingly taking apart the customer requirements list, specifying use cases, identifying classes and designing both the static hierarchy and the dynamic behavior of all the classes that will be involved. She spends these dozen chapters making sure all that is understood and even drawn out in UML or any similar modeling notation way before the system is to be implemented and actually built. Chronologically this would be what would happen in the real world anyway. There then is no better time to dive into Java syntax and learning the language well than after this extensive object introduction where we are finally ready to program. Obviously the principle of having a sound design reverberates throughout this book. So many times have I attempted to start coding in Java without first using pencil, paper, and my brain. Oh how I wished I had this book at my disposal then.The final part of the book deals with details that make Java useful and unique, such as single inheritance, casting, exceptions, I/O, garbage collection and even Swing, as she introduces these concepts while detailing how to transform the UML model you have just created into actual Java code.The books intended audience seems quite broad, aimed at developers who lack a sound object-oriented design knowledge to students learning both Java and OO for the first time. Personally even with my 4 years of Java experience, this book still did a fine job of finding and filling in gaps in my knowledge of OOD. One thing to note is that this book seemed to me to be best read from cover-to-cover, not so much as a reference guide you would thumb through. Leave David Flanagan's Nutshell series on your desk for that purpose."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Being new to programming, and wanting to get off to a good start, I agonized over which book to begin with. Should I start with Deitel's &quot;Java: How to Program?&quot; Or how about Horton's &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot;? Or maybe Schildt's entry level java text? It was all so confusing! Then I happened upon this excellent book, and I knew immediately that this was the one.Let's face it, in today's programming world the OO paradigm is where it's at. Unfortunately, however, many introductory books focus on code first and object oriented thinking second. This is completely wrong!As children, we learn the concepts of words first, and then later, in school, we learn how to properly organize those concepts into prose. Should it be any different in learning a programming language? I think not.The fact is that one must have a solid understanding of the object oriented paradigm before one can really be an effective programmer, and this book provides the reader with just such an understanding. It is very readable--fascinating, even--and will allow one to better understand what the many fine &quot;introductory&quot; java books such as those mentioned above are really taking about."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"The book is divided into three parts -- object oriented principles, object modeling, and Java. The author introduces objects and modeling first and then moves into Java.You may think that you have enough to do just learning Java without facing design and modeling issues. You may think that you may be better served by concentrating on just the Java language and turning to OOP, UML and the rest of the alphabet later. Well, no.Many Java texts cover language syntax and features, but you never learn what to do with the language after you have learned its syntax and features. You get to the end of the book and all you are capable of doing is writing toy applications -- like the sample code in the book. Oh, boy, some fun, rather like memorizing your ABCs and never learning to read.Java Objects avoids this problem. First, the objects-first structure provides the reader with a context into which to place the language features that are covered later in the book. It certainly made sense to this reader to learn why you might want a \\"class\\" before delving into the details of a Java class.Second, the author uses a long, single, unified sample application throughout the book to demonstrate object oriented programming and Java. She does not bounce the reader from toy application to toy application with the introduction of each new language feature. The use of a single sample application really helps pull principles, modeling and language together.The book is well written and carefully edited, but more important, the book was written by someone who is a gifted teacher. I don't know how she thought of helium balloons to explain object references, but I'll never wonder about references, pointers, or handles again."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I got this book from reading the user recomendations here. I just want to warn people this book is about 900 pages long, and the whole book goes into making just one program (a student registration program for a university). If you have the patience to read a book like this, fine, but for me its a little too drawn out, and nothing I saw thumbing through the chapters jumped out as being interesting or trying to make a point. I have read \\"Head First Java\\" and recommend that book for someone who is trying to make sense of OOP.Edit: I want to update this review by saying that I was too rash in critisizing this book. This book does do a good job of explaining how to plan and organize object oriented constructs to address real world problems rather than just a nuts and bolts overview of OO syntax that most other Java books give. This book however is not a \\"how to program in Java\\" book. You are going to have to move on to other Java books to become proficient in coding."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Always thought of JAVA as intimidating, yet wanted it on you resume? And Object oriented design, why is it so complex and roundabout after all? Obviously, you need to try this brand new book written in a fluid, easy going manner, with real life examples. It starts with the basics of objects, leads you through the design phase, and maintains your attention with realistic and easy to understand figures. All the while, a contant effort is made to relate it to JAVA and C++, and helpfully, a distinction is made between these two most popular languages wherever necessary. It is a must read if you want to take your JAVA seriously."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"New to Object Oriented Programming? New to Java? Read a beginners Java book but confused? Can't quite grasp OOP or Java? Then buy this book NOW!This book is absolute essential reading for ALL Java newbies. Do not purchase a beginning Java book without buying this book as well. It is the PERFECT compliment to any beginner Java book.The author takes you by the hand and babysteps you though the basic and advanced skills of object oriented design. I read Ivor Horton's &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot; and was quite confused, then I read &quot;Beginning Java Objects&quot; and ALL my confusions disappeared.

I started reading it and I understood everything so well because she explains all the small details and mentions some very useful examples. I have only read the first chapters, but I'm learning a lot. Now I'm going to take a Java course at my university and I feel so confident about it. I understand the most important features of the language and I know I'll do a very good job in my class. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Java and has no programming experience at all, or even if you just want to learn about OOP (Object-oriented languages), this book is definitely for you. Buy it, you won't regret it! I didn't!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Having tried to master Java before, I found that all of the books I consulted taught Java syntax without really explaining how to structure an application around objects so as to truly leverage Java's power as an OO language. This book accomplishes what no other book, to my knowledge, even attempts to do: that is, to step through a case study from beginning to end, illustrating first how to think from the perspective of objects, then how to model the application using UML, and finally, how to translate the model into working Java code. It is, in my opinion, a 'must read' for anyone striving to become an accomplished Java designer and developer."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"As an instructor of many intro-level software courses, I have not found a better book to explain object concepts in a more clear and consistent manner than Beginning Java Objects. Jacquie Barker's enthusiastic writing style and her concrete examples guide the reader through the sometimes difficult transition to 'thinking objects,' as well as paving the way to grasping the Java 2 language. A recommended text for any beginning student in software development, especially those who are struggling with how to apply object-oriented concepts in the Java programming language."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I purchased this book when it was published by Wrox Press. I find this book to be timeless. If you are new to Software Development or Java, I recommend that you purchase this book. I develop in Java, a Scrum Master using Agile Development practices and a homeschooling father. This book was/is an excellent resource for teaching the OOP design concepts to my son who is now a Computer Engineering major.Ms. Barker captures the essence of SW design development. Her techniques and descriptions of modeling are REALLY programming language neutral. If you get an opportunity to take a browse at the first chapter, you'll see for yourself that this book is NOT Outdated but STILL relevant today."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the best book for Object Oriented Concepts and design. Though Java is not given in full, I don't feel that is a negative point for this book.I already purchased and read the book when I was in India, but left the book there when I came to US.

She is wrong! I tried and struggle very much with OO until I went and read beginner Java book and then read this book again. This is not to surprising when I think of it. Would you try to teach a child grammar before they can talk? Even the WROX book tree on FatBrain shows that you should read their Beg Java 2 book before this one, but the author says different. I think you should though that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I guess I already learned what this book has to offer by chapters 5 &amp; 6 in CJ2, using the API docs, and looking at the Java Source Code for the API.This book is too basic for _PROGRAMMERS_ (who grasp things quickly) and they will be bored. I guess I feel that if you need this book, you probably shouldn't have chosen programming as a career. A programmer needs to be resourceful and be able to figure out complex puzzles in a reasonable amount of time. This book walks you through &quot;tediously&quot; step by step in agonizing detail the four or five main object oriented principles.That being said, for you non-programmers, this book is great and probably just what you need (hence the 3 stars). If encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are buzzwords that you don't really fully get and can't explain in detail what each is, yet regularly use in conversation, this book could help as well.Different Strokes for Different Folks."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"The OO concepts are explained well and the balloon idea is good but the information isn't very deep and there's some useless material on methodology.

It will help understanding many OOP concepts, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes are a name to few, to beginners or those who are familiar with Java syntax but do not know actually what is going on behind the code. In the meantime those users who know OOP concepts and Java syntax but having problem in modeling those concepts and syntax, this book will definitely help them also.The first part is dedicated to object oriented programming and in the second part, the book tries to model an application using UML and then into a full-blown application in final part using file persistence and graphical interface. Though this book tries to teach java in two chapters, but I think it is not possible for a reader to feel comfortable with that much lessons especially if one has no c++ experience. I think those users who do not have any c++ or java experience can justify my words.Finally the book title clearly indicates &quot;Beginning Java Object&quot;, so if an experienced user gets frustrated with part 1 or any other part, this is not a book fault."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Before reading this book I have read about half a dozen of Java books. I am also a Sun Certified Java programmer. But after reading this book I have totally changed the way I looked at Java as a language.

Especially if you have structural programming experience this book will help you to design and code in an object-oriented manner."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Jacquie Barker has done all people interested in programming a big favour by writing this amazing book. The main things I loved about this book were its a. tempo and b. conceptual clarity. The book wisely starts with an overview of objects and then quickly gets you up to speed on the basic syntax of Java. Then the book spends a great deal of effort on doing a much more thorough introduction to object concepts, very well-ordered and explained, than I've seen done anywhere else. These chapters are worth the price of the book alone. Once this is done, the book then actually goes into good design practices, providing the context for objects (major bonus). Afterwards, the book goes back into Java nitty-gritty. Throughout, a Student Registration System is featured - consistently and clearly.This is a very elegant, informative, thorough book. Most programming books either dive into too much detail too quickly or leave conceptual loose-ends. Jacquie's book, by contrast, is remarkably lucid and well-organized. She also has a great sense of humour.I'd recommend this book to anyone either learning programming or who wants a fantastic review of objects."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Preface: I'm a graduate student in Human-Computer Interaction, and just finished 2 semesters of Java programming at a university.When I buy technical books, I'll usually buy a bunch at a time, because the odds are that at least one book will make the other purchases worthwhile. I bought Java XML, Java Servelets, Mathematics for Computer Graphics, Thinking in Java, and Java Objects.The Java Objects book was my lucky lottery ticket this time, and I didn't really have high hopes for the book at first. However, its conceptual presentation of OOP programming finally made the language useful as a problem-solving tool. I wish my professor had required all us beginner Java students to read this book before actually learning how to write code.In fact, I'm applying the object-modelling skills from this book to the Actionscript language in Macromedia Flash."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Every book I've seen on programming (which is quite a few) discuss the individual pieces of the programming puzzle. There are many books on use cases, modelling, coding, testing, etc., but nothing to explain how all of those parts fit together -- until this book.

The light will come on as you actually see the use case statements, watch her model and then code a complete program from start to finish, step-by-step, using a specific language (not psuedo-code).This is a one-of-a-kind book! Unless one has been recently published, there is no other book that shows the entire puzzle, and not just the individual pieces -- believe me I've looked!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I found this book excellent for understanding OO programming in Java. Most of the books out there spend too much time on the syntax and not enough on how to build classes. I was switching from Visual Basic to Java and this book really provided the understanding I needed. I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn OO using Java."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I've been enjoying this book immensely! I very much appreciate the author's effort to make it so clearly written, well-organized, and easy to read and understand. Her teaching style is great, too, and has been really effective for me. (I actually look forward to reading this book, as opposed to the pain I experience when approaching some other programming books.) As a newcomer to programming, and after having tried out several other intro Java books, I've found, even by just reading the first few chapters of this book, the whole OOP thing and the Java language (what I know so far) are both so much clearer to me... both the concepts and syntax. Time reading her book is time extremely well spent. Cudos to Ms. Barker for the excellent teaching and jump start into Java and OOP!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I really got a lot out of this book. I'm an old Basic and C programmer, trying to get my brain around OO and Java. I have several &quot;Bible&quot; type books that attempt to cover it all, but they all seem to have too much detail on components and such and not enough help connecting the dots. I was still baffled by how you approach a java project like the one I was working on. This book put it all together for me, and gave me a good foundation on which I'm currently adding other methodologies and frameworks.I recently recommended it to a friend and, since the book is 4 years old, I figured I would find used copies fairly cheap (like less than $20). The Amazon price is still up around 60% of the cover, and used copies are only about $5 less than that! In a day when computer books seem to go obsolete in 6 months, I'd say this is one book that holds its value.There are a lot of reviews that seem to recommend reading other books before this one. I guess it depends on the individual needs of the reader. Whenever you read it, I still recommend it. If you are struggling with just getting your Java program off the dime, this book gives you a good nudge!If you're already familiar with Java, UML, development methodologies, etc. and are just looking for some new perspective, this book probably won't add much to your knowledge base."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Perhaps better then Prata's seminol work in C++ instruction.

Last summer I enrolled in a Java programming course at the local junior college in order to update my programming skills (I'm an RPG programmer.) What a waste of my time. While I received an &quot;A&quot; in the course, I merely parroted the examples provided in each lesson. I could bounce balls and sink ships but I learned almost nothing about the Java language itself. And, because the tests were multiple-choice instead of program &quot;snippets&quot; I was able to pass each test with nearly perfect scores; something I couldn't do if the instructor required &quot;real&quot; answers.I have completed only part 1 of the book so far; but, it was enough to enable me to formulate some preliminary Java standards for our I.S. department and enabled me to communicate with the only other Java beginner on staff."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This is a very nice intro to OOP and Java -- with little out fussing too much about syntax.

It is truly a god send! It is the best programming book out there! and I have read dozens and dozens. I've read ivar jacobson's oose book and grady booch's ooad book, plus roger pressman's software engineering book. Those three together are nowhere near as useful for me - as a java programmer - as your book has been.there aren't enough books like this one; one that explains both, the language and the concepts behind implementing the language, very well. i have learned the hard way. just knowing the syntax of the java language will get you nowhere. you've got to know how to implement the language in a systematic way. this book is exactly what a beginner java programmer needs.i sincerely wish i had this book when i was first learning object concepts. in fact one of the many reasons i enjoy reading it so much is because, even though i understand objects and java, your book sort of paraphrases the concepts for me in a way that makes me grok them even more than i thought i had. in particular: that helium balloon analogy is absolute genius on your part. now, if i had references explained to me that way when i first started learning objects, i know i would have got it immediately. a lot of beginner java books do not explain references clear enough. they are usually explained in a way that makes you think the author is more interested in impressing computer science professors instead of clearly illuminating a new concept in terms an absolute beginner can grasp. you have hit the nail on the head! you are a very talented teacher and writer.i disagree with the reader from hong kong, april 18 2001. i think (s)he overlooked the subtitle of the book, &quot;From Concepts to Code&quot;. i think that reader, like myself when i was new to java, made the mistake of thinking that learning the syntax of the java programming language is the same as learning object orientated concepts. they're two different things. as a concept, object oriented analysis and design came before the java programming language. it seems logical then, to me at least, to learn how to apply the methods covered in this book such as, use cases, modelling, notation, etc, if you hope to ever become truly competent in java. with this book i have finally grokked object oriented analysis and design concepts. the syntax of any given language is more or less secondary in the larger scheme of things. I will be able to use what i learn from this book with the java, perl and lingo programming languages. i can't say that for laura lemay's java books. thanks again. please write more books like this!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This book is great start for java and OOP beginners. With this book you will develope a very solid OOP and java concept. If you are a beginner and still looking around for a great book to start, stop searching! This is the one for sure. Not only do this book give you the design concept but also lead you to transfrom the design to java code. This is the most valuable part of this book because most of the other OOP or OOD books only talk about abstrat concepts without code, which is very confusing. I also recommend reading Java 2 by Ivor Horton after this one. With these two books, you can explore further to advanced java topics without any problem. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I give this book a solid, very solid, 5 stars.Be forewarned, however, this book requires discipline. Ya gotta wanna study.There are plenty of books, on the market, that will teach you the semantics of java programming. But, what if you are asking yourself, &quot;Why do professional java developers write their code the way they do?&quot;The answer is because they intrinsically know OO methods and techniques. YOU WON'T LEARN THAT FROM A JAVA SEMANTICS BOOK.Ms. Barker's book takes a different tack. She spends 293 pages, of a 665 page book, explaing WHY the pros do what they do. You don't even touch a source code editor before page 293. That's why I say this book takes discipline. However, those who stick with it, will be amply rewarded.Source code for the book is available at http://www.objectstart.com and you can even contact Ms. Barker herself if you've got specific questions.If java represents your first foray into OO technology, do yourself a huge favor and read this book. You, absolutely, will not reqret it."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I had the first edition of Beginning Java Objects From Concepts to Code sitting on my bookshelf for about 4 years. Meanwhile, I've taken several different Java training courses ranging from beginner to advanced level. I've been part of a development team, and although my role has generally been more of a business subject matter expert, I have also gotten my hands dirty and done some large chunks of coding, debugging, and refactoring other people's code.So what's my point? Well, although I've gotten by well enough in a pretty intense OO/Java environment, I've always felt like it was exactly that - getting by. I finally took this book off the shelf and worked my way through ALL of it over the last couple of weeks, and it really pulled things together for me in a way that nothing else has done. I've read about half of Eckel's Thinking in Java (a couple of times), and most of Deitel's Java How to Program, among others, and they're really great at what they do, but I wish I had worked through ALL of this book before (or at the same time as) reading those. Even though I already had a good understanding of Java syntax, this book helped me understand more than just the syntax of \\"System.out.println()\\".I've seen a couple of reviewers comment on Jacquie Barker's friendly tone, and I certainly agree with those reviewers. I felt like she was a trusted colleague helping me along, but not talking down at all."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Regarding Brad's comment, the 'one program' is complex enough to give the reader a lot of practice in understanding the relationships between objects, and that seems to me (an out-of-practice former COBOL programmer) to be the biggest hurdle in understanding object-oriented programming. Barker's book gives more help in this area than the other Java books I've read. I read Eckel's Thinking in Java, and got lost by the middle of the book. Once I've finished Barker, I think I'll get a lot more out of Eckel."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This is a really good book. It is an excellent introduction to those new to object theory and program modeling in Java, or any object-oriented programming language for that matter. It is obvious that the author really knows her material and is an excellent teacher. Everything is explained in a gentle and easy-to-understand manner, and the sample program developed throughout the book (a college student registration program) was a good choice. I would have given the book 5 stars if it had not been for its miniscule typeface (probably the publisher's decision and not the authors). Also, for those with no prior programming knowledge or experience, I would recommend reading an introductory book about computer programming in general before reading this book. Otherwise, an excellent book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Great job, Ms. Barker! This book easily explains OOP from a Java programmer's perspective.Java Programmers - whether you are just learning Java or you are approaching an intermediate level, get this book and use it along with Ivor Horton's &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot;. These two are a great complement to one another.&quot;Beginning Java 2&quot; will show you how-to code an application, while &quot;Beginning Java Objects: From Concept to Code&quot; will show you the how-to design an application."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I am relatively new to programming, and I chose Java as my first language. I'd put my time into a couple of books to get the basics down, but like most new programmers I was chomping at the bit to learn how all of these mechanics are used in the &quot;real world&quot;. I felt like I had been programming in a vacuum. That is, until I began reading Jacquie Barker's book. It blew the lid off! This book is a godsend! The book introduces all the basic programming techniques, then it moves on to teach software development principles and then finally puts all the concepts together in a comprehensive project. Anyone who has ever been a college student will relate the most to the project she develops through the book, but this should really be standard reading for anyone with a little experience. For anyone who wants to see the big picture AND the details at the same time, there is no other book I can think of that can compare. Not only that, but this is by far the most readable and easiest to understand text I have ever read on programming. Absolutely essential for programmers wishing to put their skills to work right away."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"This book enabled me to understand O-O concepts, e.g., &quot;static&quot; and polymorphism, that I just could not figure out despite having taken a Java programming class, and having read a number of other Java books and on-line tutorials. I was seriously stuck in my ability to progress with the language until I read this book. Now I'm going for the SCJP certification. By far the best book I've found for explaining the O-O paradigm in a way that makes sense to me.Also, I really appreciated the clear and non-confusing code examples. I find many programming books include unecessarily complex code examples, or throw in new concepts in a code example without explaining them first, or letting you know they are coming. This causes confusion and frustration, and interferes with learning. It was refreshing that this book did none of that.I'm greatly looking forward to Ms Barker's next book."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"Teaching object oriented programming is tough. Some of the programmers I have worked with talked a good object game but then created library code as objects. I like how this book tries to teach OO from a different angle.

It is a gem!I have many Java books on my bookshelf, but none of them have been as useful as your's when it came down to the brass tacks - developing an application in Java from a bucket of bolts and nuts to a sea worthy battleship, figuratively speaking.With your book I finally learnt what happens when a professional plans,designs and develops a real-world application. I could take a little peek inside your mental activities and learn from them. And I've learnt a lot. I'm itiching to finish the final two chapters, go through the book again in summary form, and then start on developing my own application using the processes outlined in &quot;Beginning Java Objects&quot;.I'm not a seasoned programmer at all, so far I've dabbled or been thrown in the deep end of Java development with very unpleasant results. Every page of your book made me reflect on my own infamous past as a Java developer (dare I use this term!) - all the things I did wrong, and how much easier I could have had it if you had written your book 4 years earlier. There was just too much rubbish around to mislead the enthustiasts but inexperienced. I dread to think how much bad Java code there is around nowadays.I found your explanation of concepts clear and very easy to understand. The UML design approach that you demonstrated also made it look like a piece of cake. Sure, experience makes everything look easy, but it usually is if you know how it's done. I now know how it's done, and can go forth with greater confidence based on real understanding.It's a rare occasion that I read a programming book from cover to cover, play with the code and be totally inspired by it.I understand that writing a book is a lot of hard work and many hundreds of hours go into it.

It will help understanding many OOP concepts, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes are a name to few, to beginners or those who are familiar with Java syntax but do not know actually what is going on behind the code. In the meantime those users who know OOP concepts and Java syntax but having problem in modeling those concepts and syntax, this book will definitely help them also.The first part is dedicated to object oriented programming and in the second part, the book tries to model an application using UML and then into a full-blown application in final part using file persistence and graphical interface. Though this book tries to teach java in two chapters, but I think it is not possible for a reader to feel comfortable with that much lessons especially if one has no c++ experience. I think those users who do not have any c++ or java experience can justify my words.Finally the book title clearly indicates &quot;Beginning Java Object&quot;, so if an experienced user gets frustrated with part 1 or any other part, this is not a book fault."},{"Title":"Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts To Code, Second Edition","review":"I was anxious to get a copy of this book when I heard Wrox was putting it out and I picked it up as soon as I saw it.

There are some definite strengths and weaknesses to this book.Strengths: The concepts themselves are explained in painstaking detail, using pictures that make them simpler to understand. The order that the author introduces topics seems to be from a top-down direction. Learn the high-level concepts first, and then get into the nitty gritty. If this is how you learn, this book will be good for you.Weaknesses: I would not recommend this book as a coding resource. I'm about halfway through the book, and aside from the very first \\"Hello world,\\" type program, I can't think of a single full-source, functioning program outside of the ones I wrote in the exercises. This is my biggest complaint. Most of the code exists as snippets laced with pseudocode and \\"Details omitted\\" type comments. This makes it extremely frustrating for a long-time legacy programmer who is used to learning by copying an existing program and tweaking it to suit their purposes.I haven't given up on this book (yet), however I was loaned a 4th ed. copy of \\"Java: How to Program\\" by the Deitel brothers and it seems to be more my speed. Loads of functional source to reference and copy, as well as pages of exercises that build on each other in a comprehensive fashion.

He tells the reader to make three important choices each day: the choice to act, the choice of purpose, and the choice for principles. David K. Hatch gathered stories of greatness from decades of Reader's Digest books to help illustrate Dr. Covey's principles of greatness.Together, these men have put together a great book that neatly lays out seven sections, each with three principles illustrated by one or more stories and/or anecdotes from Reader's Digest along with comments and insights by Dr. Covey. The content of this book is easy to work with.

I've read 54 pages and skimmed other sections of the book and it's just not my cup of tea.I think I jumped the gun on ordering it from Thomas Nelson's book club because it said \\"by Steven Covey and David K.

In reality, it is basically a compilation of short stories and quotations from Reader's Digest grouped into topical chapters. The book makes no central thesis or theme, but presents several categories of thought, each further divided into three principles for better living. Each principle includes a few short stories followed by some reflective questions, and a set of inspirational quotations from such various sources as celebrities, journalists, politicians, and ancient proverbs.The content is nothing special really. It is full of happy endings and anecdotes with no real morals or lessons beyond the individual stories. Many of the quotations are so vague or lacking in context that it would be hard to analyze them, much less disagree with them. I found it most disappointing that this book on living a \\"meaningful life\\" would carry no explicitly Christian meaning-rather, it is the sort of bland, feel-good philosophy that you would expect from a generic, secular self-help book. There are references to God and quotes from spiritual leaders, but the book as a whole seems to be devoid of any ultimate meaning. Everyday greatness, it seems, is just an everyday sort of thing.The book is perfectly adequate for what it is- a coffee table artifact for those days when you may need an uplifting word and don't really care where it comes from as long as it is positive. But it is really nothing more than that. I can't say I would recommend this book for anyone seriously hoping to improving their life in any tangible way.

For me this book is a masterpiece! If you are a person who can use quick and easily discovered quotes, inspirational statements or the like there of this book should be a must have on your list!Everyday Greatness is topically organized making it very easy to discover what you are looking for. Everyday Greatness is broad in its content. The quotes and concepts range from politicians to preachers, from sportscasters to the athletes themselves. This book brings to your finger tips powerful nuggets for living.Do not be confused, this is NOT a book of just quotes. This is a topical book that brings in your life not just the quote but the application. Personally I find this refreshing! I am always glad to hear not just the truth but how to apply it! This book places a huge emphasis on character! The emphasis on character makes this book for me a breath of fresh air for our culture today. As you read these lines you will quickly see that greatness is not a matter of luck or circumstance, its a matter of character bottled into significance and blended with blessing other people and their life! Get it right away, you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"The guru of principle centered living, Stephen Covey, has designed a great resource! Its called Everyday Greatness, and it is a wonderful description of all of the principles that Covey has shared with us over the years through a lot of short stories. Stories from great writers like: Maya Angelou, Jack Benny, and Henry David Thorough are coupled with excellent commentary by Covey. The book inspires us to live by three simple choices each day: 1. The Choice to Act 2. The Choice of Purpose 3. The Choice for Principles. The idea of living by positive choices is nothing new here, but the stories are simply amazing and inspirational. This would be a great addition to any classroom teacher's collections, minister's library, or employee's human resource library!"},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Book Review: Everyday Greatness by Stephen R. Covey, compiled by David K. HatchHave you ever read a great story and thought, \\"wow\\"? Where you were transported into that story and everything around you faded away as if you lived the story? Well imagine a book that has hundreds of great stories in it, a book that not only has hundreds of stories but are all categorized and after each story several pages of quotes follow enforcing the story's and chapter's theme.I was a little apprehensive about the book because of the reader's digest logo on the front. I thought I did not want to have some book I have to plow through about grandma's curlers or great grandpa's trips to the woodshed or some rural dad walking a million miles to school in the snow and then 10 pages on the moral of the story. To be honest with you the only reason I gave this book a second look on the blogging review program was the author Stephen Covey. I have always enjoyed anything and everything by him so I put my trust in his reputation and felt he would not let me down and boy was I impressed! If you need inspiration and want to find meaning in life then read this book.

Covey. It was a very encouraging, thought provoking and challenging read.The book is broken up into seven categories, and within those there are three principles that pertain to the category. Within these principles are stories. These stories are from people from all walks of life, who share their take on life.I have to say that this book is one that I will continue to come back to. I have been able to share a story from this book with my children. It's a story on unity, and how important it is to stick together as a family, and the huge obstacles you can overcome if you do. I plan on sharing many more with them."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Everyday Greatness by Stephen R. Covey is an interesting read. The book is really a compilation of 63 Reader's Digest stories by David K. Hatch that is supplemented by Covey's introduction, topical arrangement and brief commentary. With the premise that most truly heroic deeds are those small actions performed in the context of everyday living, Covey describes three purposes for the book:1) to provide an enjoyable read experience,2) to inspire the read to get more out of life by giving, and3) to \\"arouse within you a greater passion for being a transition person.\\" (ix)The selection of stories is solid and thus Covey accomplishes his purposes, at least for this reader. Under seven category headings, three stories each describe 21 different character qualities and provide inspirational examples of everyday heroes. A few are well-known individuals (eg. Walt Disney, Leonardo DaVinci, Johnny Carson), though most are names you would only know if you read the story previously in Reader's Digest.This reader found that one of the stories in each of the 21 sections was excellent, a compelling story that illustrated well the trait being described. The other two stories were also enjoyable and easy-to-read, though sometimes less directly related to the specific value. Also, 63 stories was a lot to churn through... a total of 434 pages after Covey's afterword. While the book began as enjoyable, it did eventually turn into a chore to get through all the stories. Nonetheless, the stories were inspiring and valuable reminders about what is truly important in life - and how these values are built in daily decisions.Additionally, the book provides great illustrations for teachers or preachers.[...]"},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"\\"Everyday Greatness\\" by Stephen Covey is an intense, yet light read. It is chock full of life principles however portrayed through stories of \`everyday' people. Stephen's goals for this book were 1) for the reader to relax and enjoy 2) be an inspiration to \\"get more out of life\\" and 3) encourage passion to be a \\"transition person\\" - one who \\"breaks the flow of bad - negative traditions...\\" Covey breaks things down to: The Choice 1) to Act, 2) of Purpose and 3) for Principles.Stories about Lincoln, Disney, Dickens, and even Dolly Parton are among some shared throughout this book, as well as \`everyday' people, and left me feeling moved, inspired and even challenged at times. From intensity and integrity shown in \\"Girl Against a Blizzard,\\" to the simplicity and applicability of \\"Two Words to Avoid - Two Words to Remember\\", as well as the practicality and refreshing reminder of one's need for renewal in \\"Lessons of a Quiet Cove,\\" this book provided inspiration and motivation. \\"Everyday Greatness\\" opened my eyes to principles to further develop in my own life including (but not limited to): Charity (\\"love in work clothes\\"), Integrity, Empathy (\\"listening with the intent to understand\\"), Perseverance, Simplicity and Renewal.This book would be a great resource for pastors/speakers researching a certain character trait or principle as each chapter can stand alone as a resource. In addition to the stories, each chapter ends with quotes and further thoughts on the principle. Everyone is on a quest of answering the question, \\"Who am I?\\" and, \\"Who do I want to be?\\" This book provides insight to character one can develop in response to those questions.I review for Thomas Nelson: http://brb.thomasnelson.com/"},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Insights and Commentary by Stephen R. CoveyCompiled by David K. HatchPublisher: Thomas NelsonEveryday Greatness is a collection of stories from Readers Digest as well as an abundance of quotes taken from a variety of people with diverse backgrounds. This 400 plus page book is creatively written and easy to read. Each of the seven categories, with three principals discussed in each category, has been compiled in a clear and concise matter. The message that I gleaned from Everyday Greatness was that ordinary people can live extraordinary lives. Dr. Covey says, \\"Everyday Greatness is a way of living, not a one-time event\\" Each story, quote and antidote encourage the reader to make choices based off of principals, discipline themselves in character, and dedicate themselves to better the life of someone else. However, I was disappointed that the author did not give more attention to the foundation of \\"everyday greatness.\\" It is a disservice to the reader to leave out the most important Truth of \\"everyday greatness\\" and that is the, Power of God! It is impossible to achieve \\"everyday greatness\\" without first surrendering to God, submitting to His purpose and plan for your life. In my opinion, this is where the book, Everyday Greatness, should have begun."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"I was excited to get my copy of \\"Everyday Greatness\\" by Stephen Covey. At least, I thought it was by Stephen Covey. That's really the negative part of this review.The book isn't really by Stephen Covey. It's a collection of stories from Reader's Digest with \\"insights and commentary by\\" Stephen Covey. I was expecting a sort of followup to \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\". This may simply be a complete oversight on my part when I saw the book, but somehow the cover itself seems a little misleading.The book take takes seven principles of what Covey considers everyday greatness and then breaks each principle down into three characteristics that help to achieve that principle. The seven principles and twenty-one characteristics are great to outline and can be used very well to evaluate yourself and your own \\"everyday greatness.\\"Each of the twenty-one characteristics is a chapter in the book and has several stories from issues of Reader's Digest. The stories range from the incredible to the light-hearted.Personally, I enjoy books that build on a particular theme from chapter to chapter. In that sense, this book is a little scattered. Most of the stories are interesting, although a few I found to be...well...dumb. The overall idea of the book is a good one and the traits it brings out are great (I found myself needing to improve in some of the areas), but I did not like this particular format and would have preferred a book about these traits written entirely by Stephen Covey. I would give it two out of five stars."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"I enjoyed the book, Everyday Greatness by Steven Covey. It was actually a compilation of short, encouraging stories about some famous people, and some people who were not famous but made a difference in the lives of others. I especially liked the quotes at the end of each chapter, but was a bit perplexed as to why a Christian publishing house would publish this considering Covey is Mormon and many of the quotes are from non-Christians, even atheists. This is a rather large book, at 434 pages, so its not one to read in one sitting. Its the type of book you'd leave out on the coffee table and pick up and read when you need a bit of encouragement."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Everyday Greatness is a wonderful book when you need to have a little inspiration in your daily life.

I am a big fan of Covey's Seven Habits and principle based living. This being said, I was disappointed with this book.Perhaps I didn't read the fine print, but what I was expecting was a book by Steven Covey. Everyday Greatness is instead a compilation of stories taken from Reader's Digest with commentary by Covey. The book is arranged into seven sections, each with three subcategories that are meant to inspire one to a life built around positive choices. Covey is the man responsible for presenting this structure and I would imagine had a great deal of influence in choosing the particular stories in this anthology. He makes the case that each of us have the choice to act, the choice of purpose and the choice of principles and uses various anecdotes from the pages of Reader's Digest to illustrate how making good choices can result in any person achieving great things, even if limited to the ordinary.Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for this book is my general dislike for the style of writing found in the magazine from which the stories are taken, but my recommendation on this book is to take a pass. There are better books on similar subjects to be read.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"David K. Hatch has compiled a collection of stories and quotes that truly provide the reader \\"inspiration for a meaningful life.\\" Everyday Greatness is divided into seven examples of living a meaningful life, each example is then examined through three principles. The commentary from Stephen R. Covey introduces the three principles which illustrate an aspect of living a meaningful life. Each of the twenty-one chapters concludes with a wrap-up and questions for reflection.Everyday Greatness is more than a compilation of short stories first published in Reader's Digest. This publication is an accumulation of motivating words compelling the reader to choose to act, to live with purpose and with principles. After reading over four hundred pages of thought provoking anecdotes, Covey provides an afterword with six suggestions on how to put the principles of Everyday Greatness into practice.The most distinguishable characteristic of Everyday Greatness is that it reads as though it was custom written for me. In each story, I could relate to either the person I am, or the person I aspire to be. In chapter ten, Covey begins with,\\"All things are created twice. All things. Vision is the first creation.\\"Without vision, there can be no action. In the ensuing pages, I realized that I had lost my vision a long time ago. Everyday Greatness replaced my blindness with a desire to envision the life I want, so that I can act upon that vision. I highly recommend Everyday Greatness to any reader wanting to find more greatness in their life."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Somewhere between a book I intended to read and a book I happened to read, fell the book Everyday Greatness by Stephen R. Covey. Yes, the same Covey...the one who shares his ideas of what elements are common among \`highly effective people'. And, from the onset, this is important to recall in reading anything from Covey - he is a marketing guru. He's good at selling ideas. Very good, in fact. He is sort of the motivational speaker's motivational speaker. In fact, the term \\"power broker\\" has been utilized as a descriptor. I guess that's a good thing, right?This one from Covey is a Readers Digest edition and comes filled with various anecdotes and stories gleaned from other famous and, sometimes, influential personalities. Wit, wisdom....very similar to the inspirational quotes found in your Grandma's Readers Digest but with a bit more meat, a bit more length, and sometimes a bit extra oomph.Perhaps the most important thing to note for anyone who has read something from Covey in the past, is the very fact that this is a patchwork quilt of sorts, not filled with material entirely unique to the assembler of the material, but certainly all along the vein of his usual positive thinking sermons. His emphasis on personal choice is still present in the organization and the vague usefulness in some business or team-building capacity can be found in certain areas. However, is it worth your time? You know, as \`filler' it's not entirely bad. As a good starting point for someone needing some marketing help, needing some work on their life skills, working on a team (and perhaps struggling a bit)? Not so much. Ho-Hum."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"This book is an excellent motivational tool. It is well put together and laid out.

It is a great tool for me to use with my children, too!! I highly recommend this book. You must know that it is a compilation of Reader's Digest stories and not a new book written by Covey.

I say surprisingly enjoyable because it is not the kind of book I would usually read, and when it arrived in the mail I wasn't too thrilled to start it. But once I dove in, I had a hard time putting it down.Everyday Greatness is a compilation of interesting stories gathered from various issues of Reader's Digest which are organized around key character traits that Covey feels make up everyday greatness: Contribution, Charity, Attention, Responsibility, Courage, Discipline, Intergrity, Humility, Gratitude, Vision, Innovation, Quality, Respect, Empathy, Unity, Adaptability, Magnanimity, Perseverance, Balance, Simplicity, and Renewal. This of course is not \\"greatness\\" in the way so much of the world pursues it, but the kind of \\"greatness\\" that comes through selflessness. It is a greatness not wrapped up in status, power, and wealth, but in love, selflessness and humility.The book is well organized. The traits are gathered in triplets under broader headings. Each section begins with some words from the author defining the importance of each trait, and then very poignant and inspiring stories from the issues of Reader's Digest serve as illustrations of these traits in the lives of ordinary everyday people. At the end of each chapter are some closing remarks, questions to ponder, and a few pages of quotes to reflect on and apply.The book challenges the reader not to simply go through live, but to be a catalyst of transition, living with purpose and inspiring others to live purposefully too. It encourages us to be people who take the negative and neutral aspects of life, have a positive attitude towards them, and learn for the future."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"I love story collections and compilations. I enjoy picking up a book, reading a short story or two and coming away inspired to do better or be better.Stephen R. Covey, along with Reader's Digest, has compiled a wonderful book full of moving stories. Everyday Greatness is a way of living, not something you do one time for fame and glory. We all have people we look up to because these individuals are simply good people with qualities we admire: hard work, respectful, dependable, kind, etc.Stephen Covey says that there are 3 choices we make every day: The Choice to Act; The Choice of Purpose; and the The Choice for Principles. The stories in this collection are from people who have made these choices. With 7 sections that highlight a total of 21 values, there is something to inspire each and every one of us. Each value ends with a wrap-up summary and reflection and additional short quotes.A wonderful addition to any library, this is an enjoyable book to have nearby so you can read a story or section and come away inspired and ready to try harder.

This because I am the type of person that believes that greatness in life doesn't come from our occasional mountaintop experiences but from living our lives on a day-to-day basis in the valleys and meadows that come in-between. The \\"things that come in the \\"in-between\\" time\\" would be a good way to describe this book.While Stephen Covey gets the author credit for this work, the bulk of the provided information isn't his work at all, but rather a well conceived compilation of other writers with him providing his own insight. This compilation of stories and quotes was well laid out, which makes for easy reading. Each of the books seven chapters is refined down to three primary principles. Here's a snapshot of what the reader can expect;1. Searching for Meaning: Contribution; Charity; Attention2. Taking Charge: Responsibility; Courage; Discipline3. Starting Within: Integrity; Humility; Gratitude4. Creating the Dream: Vision; Innovation; Quality5. Teaming with Others: Respect; Empathy; Unity6. Overcoming Adversity: Adaptability; Magnanimity; Perseverance7. Blending the Pieces: Balance; Simplicity; RenewalThough complied by David K. Hatch, its Covey who contributes the insights, commentary and provides guided reflections throughout each chapter, these reflections are given to the reader to help the individual consider how they may embody that given principle in their own life.Though I toughly enjoyed the book, I must say that it isn't a book that one just sits down to read. It took me nearly a month to get through it all. Coming from the pens of man, the information and encouragement presented is of the highest quality. One of the reasons that I took me so long to get through it was the time I took to try to find the essence of what each individual quoted was trying to present to the original audience. It was a pleasurable experience indeed.This book would serve as a great reference for any library, because of the index of story titles and quotation authors. The \\"afterword\\" section at the end of the book was another aspect I found to be especially helpful, as it gives ways the reader can put the presented principles into practice. This book is one that I would highly recommend to others. If you're from our church family, you are free to borrow this book from me.

If there is a principle that you are interested in or has significant meaning to you at that point in your life you could just read that section. I really enjoyed this book and found myself tearing up at many of the stories. This book really helps to put things in the proper perspective when you see what others have endured, accomplished and learned. Of course most of the work was already done by Readers Digest which I have never read but am now intrigued by.

The short stories and quotations included in this anthology address the positive character traits and concepts that are central to a life well lived. Dr. Covey's commentary serves to tie everything together and provide additional context.There was a time that Reader's Digest was one of my favorite magazines. You may remember that time; back when it focused on inspirational stories, historical features, health news, profiles of newsmakers and influencers, and a variety of humor and informational features. Back when they lived by the slogan \\"An article a day of enduring value.\\" Sadly, those days are long gone and Reader's Digest has become largely irrelevant; so much so that it was recently announced that Reader's Digest Association, Inc. would file Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Everyday Greatness proves that Reader's Digest has not completely lost sight of what made them an important touchstone in American culture.

Only moments later after getting the book of my shelf to realize the authors had the same last name. Intersting huh? Later realizing after i googled them both Stephen is Sean Coveys father.But, while Stephen Covey gets author credit its actually a compilation of 63 different stories over time from Readers Digest and hundreds of quotes divided up in Seven Chapters in each chapter they are futher divided up into three principles:*Searching for Meaning: Contribution; Charity; Attention*Taking Charge: Responsibility; Courage; Discipline*Starting Within: Integrity; Humility; Gratitude*Creating the Dream: Vision; Innovation; Quality*Teaming with Others: Respect; Empathy; Unity*Overcoming Adversity: Adaptability; Magnanimity; Perseverance*Blending the Pieces: Balance; Simplicity; RenewalIn the Introduction Stephen Covey introduces the three choices: the choice to act, the choice of purpose, and the choice for principle, this part alone grabbed me right away to keep reading.I especially like that at the begining of each chapter their is a short but inspiring quote to start you off with. Stephen also at the end of every chapter gives a Wrap Up paragraph, (which help you think of how you can start gaining more Everyday Greatness) a reflections box, and a page of further inspirational quotes.I really liked this book, it is a coffee table book.

CoveyMany of us grew up with Reader's Digest. I remember growing up as a book loving child and one of my favorite things to do was to look at the books in my Mother's bookcase. There was Pearl Buck, Frank Yerby, and then there were those hardback thick Reader's Digest compilations that she got I think four times a year. In this recent book by Stephen R. Covey he uses stories from past Reader's Digests about people who lived in everyday greatness conquering the adversities of life. The book is broken down into seven categories with each category containing three principles with stories from Reader's Digest that support the principles with commentary by Covey woven between the stories. After the stories there is a small section of quotes and anecdotes and then at the end of the categories there are questions for the reader to reflect upon. As an example, the first category is Searching for Meaning and the three principles that go with this category is contribution, charity, and attention.I enjoyed reading about Betty Ford, Maya Angelou, and a coach named John Baker and how they each dealt with addiction, discrimination, and cancer respectively. There were many other stories such as one about Alex Haley's father and how someone who helped his father financially to finish college thus enabling Alex to grow up in a home full of books instead of a share cropper's home and how instrumental one person's interest in another resulted in someone down the line becoming a well known author such as Alex Haley. This really touched my heart.Mr. Covey challenges us to make three important choices everyday and they are 1) the choice to act, 2) the choice of purpose, and 3) the choice for principles. He feels that making these three choices in the right manner will enable us to live up to our highest potential. Although I did enjoy all these examples in the book I was disappointed in that the book comes across as more of a secular reading. Although these stories were chosen from Reader's Digest they appeared to be written in a way that gave no acknowledgment to a relationship with God and that these people only accomplished these things within themselves. While Mr. Covey recommends these principles be used in our lives he makes no mention of God or a higher power and the importance of such in our lives. Perhaps he wants to appeal to a more broad reading public but to me destiny and God go hand in hand. This is not a book like \\"Purpose Driven Life\\" but could be a nice addition to your library for perhaps quote reference (there are some from Mother Teresa), sharing with your children especially if you home school and it's something you can pick up and read without having to read the prior chapter. Based on a five star rating this one gets three."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"When I first glanced at this book, I thought \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\\" I was apprehensive about the quality of a book compiled from Reader's Digest stories. I'm not much of a Reader's Digest fan. I prefer more in depth reading. But I'm enjoying this book mainly because of its organization. There are 7 main topics (Searching for Meaning, Taking Charge, Starting Within, Creating the Dream, Teaming with Others, Overcoming Adversity, and Blending the Pieces).

As I read through this book I found story after story of \\"everyday\\" people who have overcome odds, and shown incredible fortitude throughout all of life's difficulties. Each chapter deals with different qualities that the author feels makes us better people. Each of the stories was taken from the archives of the Reader's Digest and as an avid reader of RD I was thrilled to see this collection of stories. As a pastor I found this book a wonderful resource for sermon illustrations and teaching points. As I read I was inspired and moved by the strength each person had shown and the love that flowed from their hearts. The stories challenged me to be a better person, to make the most out of the \\"everyday\\" moments. The quotes and short stories were also very insightful and helped to drive home the point.

There are also quotations from various famous people that have to do with whatever topic you are reading about. Honestly, I wasn't inspired by most of the stories I read. The only story that was really worth reading was The Cellist of Sarajevo, but overall the stories were just very dull. Also, some of the stories really didn't go with the topic that Stephen Covey was presenting like the one about Pope John Paul II.

Taken from Readers Digest, each story is meant to move and encourage us to live life differently. Stephen Covey ends each story with a summary and a comment on what you have read, often drawing out a principle which we, the reader, can apply to our own life. At the end of each section, there are some Reflections - questions to challenge us to take what we have read further in a practical way.One of the really useful aspects of the book is at the end of each section /chapter there are a number of pages (sometimes up to seven) filled with quotes from other people relating the the section you have read. As a preacher this resource of quotations is remarkable and I would venture, worth the cost of the book itself.My only caveat is that this is not a Christian based book - the content is not related back to the Gospel or to Jesus Christ. What I mean by this is that the chapter on Humility, for example, encourages US to be humble. I would argue, as a Christian Minister that we can only truly attempt to walk in humility in the power of the Holy Spirit.

His books, speeches, and presentations have dominated the world of self-help resources. So what about Everyday Greatness? Covey remains in his traditional stream of thought, but presenting stories and pithy proverbs to demonstrate attributes that he believes are characteristic of great people (charity, integrity, patience, etc.). Yet, his approach is informed by a faulty understanding of people (that we are basically good) with a faulty ambition for life (be the greatest you can be) and will ultimately lead to a faulty end (failure and emptiness).While aiming to help people, what Covey has written essentially provides a Book of Virtues for \\"happy-addicts.\\" In other words, he is telling the reader \\"You're a good person who wants to be happy. These are some inspirations to take that goodness and make you great, so that you'll be really happy!\\" That may be the logic of the world, but in the life of the Christian disciple, this sort of thinking lacks grace, Biblical standing, and will ultimately only produce bad fruit.

Have you ever thought about its intrinsic meaning and defining attributes? Could you recognize greatness in any person, deedor event in the public arena or in your own personal experiential domain?The author tries to provide readers with important defining attributes forrecognizing greatness. To a considerable extent, he succeeds.For instance, character and personal contribution are important ingredients for everyday success. We search for meaning in the performance of unique acts of kindness. Unselfish sacrifice is contrasted to self-interest. Conquering fear of the unknown is another important condition precedent to personal and group greatness, by the authors. A beauty of this work is that the author utilizes simple languageto describe concepts familiar to everyone but elusive by simple definitions.According to Epictetus, \\"No man is free who is not a master of himself\\".Freedom lies in conquering our own predispositions, prejudices and demons.Integrity is a value or belief system. Humility requires that we subordinate \\"the self\\" in order to share credit. Finally, a vision is necessary to articulate \\"what must be done\\".

As a pupil we would read, \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" & \\"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living\\". Both books taught valuable lessons which we would study and give a two minute talk in front of the class. After each speech the instructor would provide feedback on what the student said and how they applied the principles. It was a great forum for personal development and this book follows that format. It seemed that these two great teachers have developed a similar comprehension and approach to their discipline of human achievement.The book is comprised of similar stories like the talks we gave, but to tell the truth at first I found some of them silly and poorly written. Many of the lessons I didn't understand and even some I disagreed with however most I found deeply thoughtful. I would pause over the \\"Reflections\\" portions after each chapter and considered the comments; this was very enlightening experience for me. There is also a \\"Further Insights\\" section which provides quotes on the topics which were also very elucidating. All of this returned me to the sagacious enrichment of that Dale Carnegie class.

Upon picking out the book I wasn't aware of the format. The title grabbed me because I like Covey's stuff and I wanted his take on a \\"meaningful life\\".The words \`Reader's Digest' should have given it away. Everyday Greatness is a compilation of a many authors on a wide variety of topics all dealing with personal character. Though it wasn't what I expected, I grew to appreciate the inspiring short stories in true RD form.As an avid Twitter-user, I especially enjoyed the \\"Further Insights\\" at the end of each section. After reading two or three short stories on a topic, like Integrity, there follows two to four pages of very short, almost one-liners (they could be tweets!) that come from a wide variety of mostly well known authors, actors, proverbs and presidents and your general \`larger than life' kind of people.Covey's part was clearly the weakest. Oftentimes he gives a paragraph or two after the stories and before the Insights. The compilation of stories and Insights was enough.Now it becomes a reference in my library.

Afterwards you find quotes, questions to ponder, and thoughts from Covey. This is why this book has been something to pour over - not just plow through. It's taken me on a personal journey of discovering a deeper desire to live my life with purpose to make the most of every moment - to honor the calling and opportunities that come my way - to take a look at what really is important to me, and to challenge me to not take for granted the chances that come my way to make a difference. In the big - the small - in my attitude, my actions, my heart, my challenge to others - by my example, my speech and my beliefs.Personally this book has been an encouragement and a challenge. As a youth pastor, I've honestly thought about having this book be the framework for our curriculum for the year - it's literally spelled out - and an important challenge to our students today. I'd say it's much more like a daily read/study/devotion type book than a sit down and read straight through book. Not to say you couldn't do that. You totally can - but for where I've been, where my heart is, the journey I'm on - it's worked better for me to go steady and slow. And that's why it's taken me a while to blog about it. Get it.

From team-building businesses to personal improvement, this book has plenty for everyone.I read the stories, lingered over the quotations, and wanted to discuss the questions with others.

Some are from years ago and some are more recent. Each story is relevant for us today. It tells of people making a difference.The book has 445 pages in it. It is divided into seven sections. The first one is about Searching For Meaning. Mr. Covey asks the question, \\"How would you choose to spend the next year if you knew it was your last?Each section talks about a quality that is needed in our life. There are stories of real people in each section. There is a story by Chuck Norris, there is one about Pope John Paul II, and many others.One of my favorite quotes in the book is, \\"Courage is being scared to death--and saddling up anyway.\\" By John Wayne.In the section on respect there is this quote: \\"Oh, Great Spirit, help me never to judge another until I have walked two weeks in his moccasins.\\" Sioux Indian PrayerI have thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The stories in it are great. Some make you laugh and some make you cry. There were many moments in this book in which I was reduced to a blathering mess. However, that is what you expect from reader's digest. Short easy to digest stories that really hit the spot. If this book was nothing more than that I could give it a resounding recommendation and be on my way.However, when Covey got involved..that is when I got confused. Usually I love covey's stuff, but I have to wonder if he even really cared about this book. I mean at the end of 3 stories (with similar topics) he simply writes a 1-2 paragraph summary and includes some quotes about the topic ie humility.To me this book is $5.99 and free with a reader's digest subscription, but because Covey is involved the price automatically goes up.I respect him but for me this book is not worth that extra cost. Am I going to recommend you get it? Yes. I think reading a story a day, or maybe a chapter a day for a month or two will really do you good.Bonus, if you are pastor this is perfect sermon fodder.

Oh well."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Most can recall the collection of anecdotal stories that have made Reader's Digest famous over the years. The food-for-thought magazine had provided decades of just the right story for just the right moment. Now, noted author and speaker Stephen R. Covey has taken those anecdotal remembrances and skillfully woven them into a book around a central theme which bears the title,Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful LifeWhat makes this book work is that it follows a structure that encourages action in an individual's life everyday. The Choice to Act- your energy; the Choice of Purpose-your destination; and the Choice for Principles-the means for attaining your goals form the \\"backbone of this work, and then organized into topical chapters, the book flows with the famous anecdotal stories as well as many brilliant quotations to illustrate these three concepts.Covey's mastery with the philosophical understanding of the human condition offers much rewarding thought as one reads through the text. It was good to read from cover to cover, but I think its real value comes from the topical application throughout the table of contents. This is a book that would do well to be cross indexed and computerized, so that with a few key strokes, quotes and anecdotes could be at one's fingertips.Yet out of respect of my grandmother's fondness for sitting down and reading these heartwarming stories in magazine form, this volume is essential. Again, the indexing makes it extremely useful when facing specific issues in one's life. As an example, the subtopic \\"Handling Adversity\\" is further broken down into subsections, Adaptability, Magnanimity, and Perseverance. These are broken down yet even further, so that from an easily accessible indexing process, this book becomes one of the best motivational tools one can have, connecting current challenges to the wealth of human experience.There is great passion for living and Covey's gift of inspirational commentary along with the compilation of wit, wisdom and wonder provided by David Hatch makes this a truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life by Stephen R.

We are challenged to make the choice to act, the choice of purpose, and the choice for principles. At the end of each chapter there is a set of reflection questions to get the reader thinking about what has just been read. I am a teacher and I am reading this book with my 6th grade students. The reflections are a great tool to inspire discussion with the class. One major theme of the book that I really love is that it is not the major events of our life that make our life great, but the day to day events and choices we make which gives us a life of greatness.

It certainly isnt bad, it starts out with a few strong stories then I began to lose interest.

The book is dedicated to celebrating the important elements of human character such as responsibility, courage, integrity, humility, vision, ethics, respect, empathy, charity, perseverance and simplicity, which are often overlooked in this material world.The book contains sixty-three motivational and inspirational stories, hundreds of quotations, a few jokes and other short stories. Though the cover displays \\"Stephen R. Covey\\" in big letters, the stories aren't written by Covey. He provides commentary at the beginning and end of each chapter that compel the readers to introspect and reflect over the morals presented in the chapter.The good part about this book is that you don't need to read it cover to cover. I don't think it's meant to be taken in large dozes. You can pick up the book, read a story in 5-10 minutes, and put it back. Idea is to do self-reflection after reading each story and try to implement the values in one's life in order to lead a life of meaning and satisfaction.Being a member of Toastmasters International, I found this book particularly useful. It gave me lot of fresh ideas for my future speeches and table topics. It would be very useful resource for anyone involved with any sort of public speaking activity.My biggest complaint about this book is that all the stories have an \\"American\\" theme. Though many stories have a universal appeal, there are some which I didn't find as appealing as an American would probably find. The book would have been more balanced had the stories been selected from different cultures and regions around the world. I'm sure everyone would agree that there's lot of \\"Everyday Greatness\\" in other parts of the world.Some of the stories in the book are very insightful and really touched my heart. The book claims to expand your thinking and open your mind and I agree that it succeeded in doing so in my case.

The sections of the book are Searching for meaning, Taking charge, Starting Within, Creating the Dream, Teaming with Others, Overcoming Adversity, and Blending the Pieces. These are further subdivided into three chapters named for characteristics, such as integrity, simplicity, and perseverance. Each chapter ends with some inspiring quotations about that subject by people such as Will Rogers, Abraham Lincoln, and others.One good example of a story from this book is found in the section Searching for Meaning, in the chapter Attention.\\"How Love Came Back by Tom AndersonI made a vow to myself on the drive down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands, or buts.The idea had come to me as I listened to a commentator on my car's tape player. He was quoting a Biblical passage about husbands being thoughtful of their wives. Then he went on to say, \\"Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love.\\" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband--that our love had been dulled by my own insensitivity. In petty ways, really: chiding Evelyn for her tardiness; insisting on the TV channel I wanted to watch; throwing out day-old newspapers that I knew Evelyn still wanted to read. Well, for two weeks that would all change.And it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, \\"That new yellow sweater looks great on you.\\"\\"Oh, Tom, you noticed,\\" she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little perplexed.After a long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, Evelyn's been alone here with the kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me. We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites.So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street investment firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum, though I usually hate museums (and I enjoyed it); holding my tongue while Evelyn's getting ready made us late for a dinner date. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new vow to keep on remembering to choose love.There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression.\\"What's the matter?\\" I asked her.\\"Tom,\\" she said, in a voice filled with distress, \\"do you know something I don't?\\"\\"What do you mean?\\"\\"Well...that checkup I had several weeks ago...our doctor...did he tell you something about me? Tom, you've been so good to me...am I dying?\\"It took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing.\\"No, honey,\\" I said, wrapping her in my arms, \\"you're not dying; I'm just starting to live!\\"To this, Covey adds, Tom \\"chose to love\\" by setting aside his Wall Street worries and personal interests to focus undivided attention on his family, chiefly Evelyn. What resulted provides further evidence that in focusing on individuals--particularly those we love the most--we often make the most meaningful and lasting impact. In Evelyn's case, she was so surprised by the attention that she was receiving that she thought something must be wrong--even had thoughts that she might be dying. She turned out to be just fine, but there are many people in the world who are dying for a little attention. See if you can find them and cure them of what ails them.\\"Everyday Greatness is a wonderful and inspiring book. It would be a great gift for anyone, but especially anyone going through a trial such as illness or a recent loss. It would also be a great gift for someone graduating or starting a new venture in life."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"It was wonderful to be bathed in uplifting stories. The scope of the collection is bound to reach you at some point. Stephen Covey does an excellent job of combining the stories into different disciplines that are essential to what he deems \\"everyday greatness.\\"The quotes at the end of each chapter are full of memorable tidbits to be taken away and chewed on through out the day. The questions that Covey puts forward in each section are well thought out and to the point.By far, my favorite section of the book was \\"Blending of Pieces.\\" The stories express balance, simplicity and renewal in very insightful ways. The story that has been most beneficial to my current situation is \\"Two Words to Avoid, Two to Remember.\\"This collection has allowed me to pause in my day and to determine if I desire to pursue personal greatness or to just let each day pass. It is an excellent resource for individuals or groups. The questions at the end of the chapters can really help stimulate discussion. It can be taken by chapter or read as a whole. The stories fit their chapter titles and are easily found again by using the index."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life by Stephen R. Covey compiled by David K. Hatch promises (from Covey's introduction) to be personal and to help inspire and teach \\"timeless principals promising more joy, more peace of mind and an enhanced feeling of worth.\\" I think Covey's expectations are a little presumptuous for this collection of success literature from the Readers Digest. I can think of only one Good Book that can make so lofty a promise.Everyday Greatness is a blend of Chicken Soup for the Soul with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. But the result is not all that tasty. Everyday Greatness is not as good as 7 Habits and nobody's soul needs more Chicken Soup. Covey's name is prominent on the cover but this is not really his book. The introduction and commentary for each chapter belong to him. But the book itself is a collection of stories previously published in Reader's Digest. And while some are nice many are a little stale.The philosophy of this self-help book is to live everyday making 3 choices: the choice to act, the choice of purpose, and the choice of principals. Each chapter is concerned with a different character principal. The only real highlight for me comes in the quotes at the end of every chapter.

The introduction and commentary by Stephen Covey is nothing less that brilliant and incredibly inspiring. The book is so well organized and written in such a way that the stories of perseverance against impossibilities will cause you to do some serious soul searching. Your perspective on life is sure to change and you will find yourself digging your heals in deeper and opening your heart and mind to your purpose in life.I would highly recommend this book to readers of all walks of life and of all ages. (Great graduation gift!) It is easy to read and hard to put down. The stories within each page are at times gut wrenching, yet inspirational and uplifting. The purpose of this book is clear: to bring you to a place of searching for your purpose and potential and inspiring you to persevere. As a Christian, the only thing I would point out in this book is that it does not bridge a connection between the Christian faith and examining one's purpose. I would caution that although these are truly inspirational stories, the Christian life should also entail the greater purpose of leading people to Christ and should include less of an emphasis on \\"success\\" in this life. \\"Everyday Greatness\\" is important when it is furthering the Kingdom of God and bringing glory to God; in the end, all else will be forgotten.

This is a book that you can read straight through or over multiple readings. It is a book that you will want to keep handy to refer back to in those times in which you need motivation or inspiration in your life. One of the things that stood out to me as a teacher, was that is was revolved so much around good character attributes. We have a lesson we ready each morning to the students called *Character Counts* and I feel this is such an important lesson to be taught and emphasized frequently.

Covey and David K. HatchLike many of you, I have read Stephen Covey's wildly popular book, Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. That book launched Covey to the top of the self help charts, and this book attempts to help readers once again, by inspring us to live with greatness. I received this book from Thomas Nelson Publishers (http://brb.thomasnelson.com/,) as a book reviewing blogger.Though Thomas Nelson is the book's publisher, the book itself is not a \\"Christian\\" book that aims to center one around the source of greatness, Christ. This book takes the route of every secular self-help book, and centers the reader around self. The format of the book is innovative because it uses Readers Digest stories from famous and non-famous people alike to illustrate everyday greatness. It also attempts to help the reader identify the various ways greatness is demonstrated.The tales shared come from a wide range of people throughout history and with various racial, religious, and ethnic backgrounds. These personal tales of triumph were quite enjoyable for me to read since I enjoy biographies. However, I did not necessarily enjoy how Covey and Hatch categorized the stories into universal truths such as Courage. I do not recommend readers sit down with this book and read straight through it, but I do recommend keeping this book on the night stand along for the occasional read."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"In his introduction, Stephen Covey states the outcomes he hoped to achieve with this book. First, he wanted the reader to relax and enjoy reading the book, that the information would be reassuring, comforting and uplifting. Second, he hoped the book would be inspiring to those who read it. Third, he hoped the collection of stories would arouse passion for being a transition person, someone who breaks the flow of negative traditions or practices from one generation to another.To achieve these goals, this book offers stories, reflections, and quotations about everyday greatness. Everyday greatness is defined as being a person, who chooses to act rather than be acted upon, and chooses to act for meaningful and honorable purposes and acts in accordance with proven principles.Does the book achieve these goals? The first goal of being an enjoyable read is easily achieved. The book is like a comfortable blanket to wrap up in when you have a moment, but it will wait for you when you have other things to do. Like the stories in Reader's Digest, the entries complied are short, make a point, and don't raise your blood pressure. It could be a reference book, one you read when you have a few moments and want to be inspired. The stories and quotations encourage you to be your best. Is the book inspirational? Absolutely. Not all the stories will be effective with all readers, but the variety of offerings means there should be a piece that speaks to each person. Finally, does the book arouse passion to break a negative cycle? Clearly, it does. The stories are of famous people, such as Walt Disney, Charles Dickens and Norman Rockwell to name just three, but also about everyday people like your neighbor, or like you, who make a difference by living the three characteristics of everyday greatness. As you read, you'll realize you have what it takes to exhibit everyday greatness and what a powerful impact that can make.Member of Thomas Nelson Book Review Blogger Program: [...]"},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"Everyday Greatness is a book that demands to be read over multiple sittings. Compiled of stories from Reader's Digest, you will discover the inspirational lessons from celebrities, writers, politicians, actors and more.Each chapter gives you three stories from three different people followed by quotes that fit within the theme.The themes range from finding meaning in your life, taking charge, dreaming (life not the sleep kind), overcoming hardship and much much more.I keep saying more because this book clocks in at 434 pages.The first story had me dreading reading the rest. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because it was almost a tear jerker. I wasn't ready to read sad story after sad story. Luckily most of the stories are positive and not ending with a death.The things you learn about people like Chuck Norris as a bagger and Mrs. Ford as a drug addict are just a few of the tid-bits you'll uncover as you learn a little bit about yourself on the way."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"I am so thrilled to be reviewing this awesome new book! \\"Everyday Greatness\\" by Stephen R.

Since the book consists of a series of short stories it is a great book to read whenevery you have a few minutes to spare.

Honestly, I was expecting something different with Steven Covey's name on it, but if understood as it is, a compilation, it is indeed an enjoyable read.I appreciated the organization of the book into virtues that, if truly lived out, lead to everyday greatness. It makes it easy when wrestling with a particular subject to go back and receive inspiration. The wrap-up and reflections at the end of each chapter make for a nice way to re-articulate the principles in the story. These lend themselves to further contemplation and practical application in one's own life. However, I personally didn't find Covey's intermittent commentary particularly edifying to the book or the points made by the stories.While I wouldn't choose to read the entire book cover-to-cover again, it would be a great night-stand or coffee table book to read on occasion. Filled with quotes and palatable examples of putting the illustrated principles into practice, it would also serve well as a sermon or teaching supplement.

The one thing about Reader's Digest is that the stories that are all true because for me it gives me a sight into what that one person or family went through. The book was written by Stephen Covey who did an amazing job writing and putting this book together. I have to say that the book was amazing because not only do the stories make you feel like you are apart of them but they also bring a sense of reality to them as well. Who knew that real life stories could make you cry, laugh and just plain think about. Some of the stories are about Maya Angelou, Jack Benny and even some insights from the author Stephen Covey.I absolutely loved the book and have several stories bookmarked to re-read for later on.

To curl up on the sofa and just read all day long. Or as long as you can if you have kids. This book would also make a perfect book to have around all the time.

The editor, Stephen R. Covey, wants to show that every individual has the potential to live a full and admirable life. The stories come from a variety of sources - writers, cultural icons, athletes, common folk, and more - but they all highlight the fact that our choices make us who we are.Covey believes that a core set of character traits allow people to achieve everyday greatness. He groups the stories according to these traits and concludes that it all comes down to a set of three choices:1) The Choice to Act2) The Choice of Purpose3) The Choice for PrinciplesWhile this book is filled with great anecdotes and inspirational bits of wisdom, it's hard for me to imagine someone sitting down and reading it cover-to-cover. Though Covey tries to interject with transitions and use overarching themes to link the stories together, the book is much too disjointed to be a compelling read. As a result, it's unlikely that this work will ever reach the true heart of any reader.That being said, this collection isn't a complete bust. I could see it serving as a useful resource for speech illustrations or personal counseling.

In lieu of being able to afford a new sports car, I guess my crisis and the unanswered questions are all I've got.We tend to over-label greatness in our world. We throw the word out on so many cheap things that the truly great things of life get ignored. Those things are, after all, the little things, the EVERYDAY things that ordinary people do when they make choices to be and do something extraordinary. These moments may or may not be immediately recognized or honored as great, because the world is often looking for other kinds of stuff on which to place the label. In the end, however, when the smoke clears and the label-maker is broken, it is these stories that will stick with us.That is exactly what Stephen Covey is doing in his book, Everyday Greatness. He is compiling a collection of stories that reveal hidden greatness and ask us to make choices in our own lives that will push us toward the same. The stories are all compiled from that trusted pile-o'-goodness The Reader's Digest, and each chapter has several stories that relate to one attribute/characteristic/action that Covey reminds us is a facet of true greatness in our lives. Chapter subjects include responsibility, courage, integrity, gratitude, vision, respect, empathy, perseverance, balance, and simplicity, among others. Each chapter also comes with great quotes (and I love quotes) as well as insights and commentary from Covey to draw the point for us in a practical way.The book is not a \\"read-through\\" kind of book so much as it is a \\"I-have-a-quiet-moment-to-read\\" kind of book. The stories are short but poignant and provide us with big things to consider in a brief moment of respite. The book as a whole is humorous, sad, moving, and inspirational - a Reader's Digest on steroids.

It is more like a coffee table book, large and full of titles like Respect, Gratitude, Integrity, Discipline, and more.The book is enjoyable and has great quotes for those who enjoy meaningful quotes as well. The authors are well chosen and Covey gives a great commentary that is motivational and inspirational."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"A few months ago I received my copy of Everyday Greatness. I began reading it right away, immediately drawn to its format which allowed me to pick a subject to learn about. The book is not a continuous read; it's a Readers Digest format which is to say it's a collection of short (sometimes very short) stories. Broad subjects titled; Searching for Meaning, Taking Charge, Starting Within, Creating the Dream, Teaming with Others, Overcoming Adversity, and Blending the Pieces are dissected further into traditional leadership topics like courage, disciple, humility, vision, innovation, respect, empathy, etc...Each of the chapters are comprised of an introduction to the topic written by Covey, three demonstrative real-life stories (written by Readers Digest authors) that are often quite inspiring, a wrap-up & insights by Covey, and lastly quotes by other notable figures.I found the book enjoyable. As a teenager I frequently read articles in Readers Digest that my parents subscribed to so the format felt familiar to me. This book will be a good choice to leave out in the house for our kids to read or guests to pick-up during idle times. One can quickly get into and out of a topic or story. There's not much commitment required with this book, which may be why I took so long to finish it and do this review. However, there is quality writing, strong stories, and powerful insights from a modern expert in leadership."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"This is a very strong compilation of essays and quotations from a variety of people such as Maya Angelou, Thoreau, da Vinci, and Chuck Norris. The material is organized under categories such as respect, responsibility, perseverance, and gratitude. Amidst these mostly character development sections, I especially liked the final selection called \\"Blending the Pieces\\" which included essays and quotes on balance, simplicity and renewal.The book is interesting enough to read straight through (in small doses), but would also make a great reference book for speakers or writers needing topical quotes. Though published by Thomas Nelson, Everyday Greatness does not exert an overtly Christian emphasis. The material does, however, strongly represent Christian values.Thanks to Thomas Nelson Publishers for allowing me to review this book.

Hatch as a Book Review Blogger for Thomas Nelson ([...]).Summary - A compilation of some of the best human interest and inspirational stories from Reader's Digest.Reaction - I've had this book for a while but hadn't started it. I assumed that since it was from Stephen Covey it would be full of self-help and self-improvement tips and just hadn't been in the right mind-set. But once I read the book, it turns out that's not the case. While there is information about improving yourself and becoming a better person - and even some study questions - the majority of the book is a compilation of some of the best human interest and inspirational stories from Reader's Digest magazine. I love these stories. They are the ones that make you feel good about human nature. They leave me warm inside. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel good about human nature and the state of the world."},{"Title":"Everyday Greatness: Inspiration for a Meaningful Life","review":"I received this book through the Thomas Nelson Book Review Blogger program. It attracted my attention as I usually like Stephen Covey's material, finding his writing uplifting and informative.Everyday Greatness is living each day with character and contribution. It is a way of life not a one time five minutes of glory that the media loves to exploit. He writes, \\"It speaks more about people's motives than about their talents; more about small simple deeds than about grandiose accomplishments. It is humble.\\"What I like about his book is I can read it in tiny pieces - small stories that inspired you to think beyond yourself.My disappointment is that the book isn't written by Covey though his name is splashed all over the front cover. Looking close it reads: Insights and commentary by Stephen Covey, compiled by David K. Hatch. The book is still packed with wisdom but I feel the reader - me for example - was mislead.He invites the readers to ask ourselves: To what ends or purpose are your daily choices leading? Is your life in harmony with timeless universal principles? What are you contributing on daily basis? Each section contains thought provoking questions and great collection of quotes.How does this book feed my spirit? Reading how others rise above their day to day struggles inspires me to try once again to be who God calls me to be. The world can really beat us up sometimes and this book gives the encouragement and hope to keep on."},{"Title":"Brother Brother, Sister Sister","review":"A little bit of sunshine didn't hurt anyone. I have come back to the bright days of primary school, with all those important affairs, and that indescribable feeling of being able to live forever just as I was. I preferred to read Jules Verne, \\"Three Musketeers\\", \\"Winnetou\\" or Moomins, but then I never shied away from so-called girls' books. Now I can boast myself that I read all books of the \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series when I was small. Now, having fallen in love with Helen Dunmore's prose (I have recently read a good old fashioned novel, \\"A Spell of Winter\\", by this author), I decided to look what else she might have written. I didn't hesitate much to buy \\"Brother Brother, Sister Sister\\", since I had a hunch that it was going to be a light, bright and shiny humorous book that would take about 20 years' burden off my back. And so it did!\\"(...)And I didn't really want to go out in the playground anyway, because I'm still not talking to Rachel and it's so boring, not talking to people when you have to keep remembering about it, and everybody else keeps remembering about it and giving you little looks when you go near the other person you're not talking to.(...) Then I saw a flicker of Rachel's red skirt. She'd just come in with Clare to get something out of her drawer. She was not looking at me in the careful way you have to not look at people if you want it to look as if you're not looking at them.\\"Wouldn't you be?

Very funny events, lots of lovable mess, and of course playground friendship tangles to untangle. Lovely book, I tell you."},{"Title":"Brother Brother, Sister Sister","review":"I bought this book for an 8-year-old child whose parents recently had quadruplets, but decided not to give it to her, partly because I think it is intended for the 12-and up age group. I thought that the combination of disasters that hit this family overshadowed the theme of the quadruplets (for example, the father loses his job and they are pushed to poverty, which gives a whole new dimension to the issue of multiples). It just didn't ring true. And if they were as hard up as the book sounds, the solutions that appeared for the father could never have pulled them out.I would find this book more appropriate and helpful for a child dealing with a loss of family income and status than a child dealing with a change in family size. I guess what I am trying to say is that this book took on too much. And if you gave it to a new big sister or big brother, it might bring up fears they didn't have before they read the book.Also, the protagonist was not terribly likeable or sympathetic; instead of seeing the struggle a parent made to be there for her, she balked at the embarrassment of the multiple babies. I just didn't buy the general negative attitude of the girl toward her siblings (although of course by the end she has &quot;grown&quot; and come to terms with it) or the negative attitude of others in the community. In my experience, communities are very positive, supportive, and excited at least when a multiple birth first happens. That said, there is a very sweet situation where a neighbor helps out without being obvious about her charity.If you had a child who was already feeling sorry for herself and neglected due to a multiple sibling situation, this could help, because the child would not feel alone with these feelings. But if you had a child who was basically feeling positive about the situation but needed some support, I think it would be better to get some sitters and take the child out one on one than provide them with this book."},{"Title":"Brother Brother, Sister Sister","review":"This book is about a girl named Tyana that has 2 brothers and 2 sisters.

Unknown to many in the West, the Mughal Emperors of India ruled a vast kingdom and enjoyed unlimited power within their lands. To make their reign the setting for a book is a challenge; the reader must be transported into a very different time and place, and yet made to identify with the characters. The book succeeds on both counts. The characters are well developed and unique, while the details of their lives unfold in all of their exotic difference. Throughout, the question is asked 'what is the limit of power?' The answer resounds darkly: death. The terse Mughal proverb Taktya Takhta 'Throne or Coffin' is repeated along the bloody journey of Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor who commissioned the Taj Mahal, to the throne and beyond. Along with the historically accurate account of the political struggles of the time, a fictionalized yet plausible love story unfolds between Shah Jahan and his wife Arjumand Banu, a love that culminates in one of the most iconic monuments in the world, the Taj Mahal. The story is fictional because so little is known of the woman for whom the Taj Mahal was built. A few passages from old manuscripts and a giant mausoleum are all that remain of her, yet Timeri Murari does a beautiful job reading the architecture itself and the few written clues available in order to construct a moving tale of love and power."},{"Title":"Taj","review":"What a wonderful piece of work by Timeri Murari...this beautifully written story is about love and loss. Shah Jahan and his beloved wife Arjumand shared a deep bond of love and after her death, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal.

If you have passion for history or cultural studies go for it. The writer introduces us to Taj Mahal glimpses of Mughal traditions and grandeur.The two parallel narratives cover both sides of the Taj, an epic of love on one end, while the agony of a lifelong dread for the craftsmen on the other end. Taj Mahal is much more than a love story. Uptill now it has only represented the love and Shah Jahan. It is highly indebted to thousands of marginalised workers.There is an unseen shadow of tragedy bandy in the corridors of the Red fort of Agra continuously echoing \\"Takht ya takhta\\". The glory and splendour of the throne justifies the successor killing his male siblings. The treasures are a powerful incentive for the rebellions. There is the unfolded story of Khusrau, Jehangir's son who was blinded by his father.Nur Jahan is worsgipped by many as a forceful, persuasive, powerful and the legendary beautify.

It sets the ravishing love story of the Emperor Shahjahan and his adored wife Arjumand (who accompanied her husband on campaigns even when pregnant) firmly in the contexts of time and events. An absorbing read by any standards, it is the most painless and enjoyable way to grasp the pivotal importance to this day of the reigns of Shahjahan, his father Jehangir, and his son Aurangzeb 'the Tyrant' (Dryden actually wrote a play about him during his lifetime). The novel encompasses extremes of bloody violence and lyrical beauty, and is written with care and a commitment that communicates itself to the reader. Images stay in the mind - hundreds of labourers clinging motionless in the shadows like bats to the half-built walls when the Emperor comes to inspect progress, war elephants trumpeting to each other down the battle lines, the Taj deserted and dilapidated in the rain, home only to monkeys and a blind fakir (until Lord Curzon had it restored - the Raj wasn't all bad).This is a novel that repays not only reading, but re-reading."},{"Title":"Taj","review":"One of the best books I have ever read about Mughal India. Engaging and full of detail. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Taj","review":"but don't just listen to me, read the reviews:Taj: A Story of Mughal India By Timeri N. Murari, Penguin, Rs 275It is ironical that the Taj Mahal, the marble mausoleum hailed as the most splendid emblem of love came to be erected in the Mughal period - tarred by hatred, cruelty, torture, and fratricide. Timeri N. Murari's novel, Taj, plays out this irony, highlighting the paranoia which gripped the minds of Mughal princes and emperors confronted with the bewildering choice of \\"takt ya takhta\\" (throne or coffin). The novel cuts a swathe of 59 years (1607-1666 AD) from Mughal history. It is conspicuously marked by a warped time sequence as Murari does not stick to the linear pattern of historical time. This time-tampering in the narrative is coupled with the epilogue predating the prologue. The monkey and the blind, old man episode of the prologue projects the entire novel as a flashback, underscoring the futility of power-struggles and individual glories represented in history.The two parallel narratives contrived by Murari progress with varied pace in alternating chapters. The odd-numbered chapters are titled \\"the love story\\" and touch on events like Shah Jahan's courtship, his marriage with Arjumand Banu (later named Mumtaz-i-mahal), Mehrunissa's conspiracy, Shah Jahan's flight from the Mahabat Khan-led Mughal force and his eventual accession to throne, culminating in Arjumand's death - all happening in the years between 1607 and 1630 AD. The even-numbered chapters, titled \\"the Taj Mahal\\", are devoted to chronicling the story of Murthi, a Hindu idol-carver who is somewhat mysteriously employed to fashion the famous marble jali around Arjumand's sarcophagus. The mystery is later resolved as the full identity of Isa, Arjumand's favourite eunuch and Shah Jahan's trusted attendant, is revealed. This second narrative covers the time period 1632-66 AD.Another feature that distinguishes the two sections is the difference in the narrative voices. While the first proceeds through monologues of Shah Jahan, Arjumand and Isa, the second is basically a narrative. As a result, the immediacy of intimate personal details contrasts with the suspenseful narrative which brings alive the tricky twists and turns of politics. Each narrative has its own climactic points which are discreetly played against each other. Often the content of one narrative seeps into the other and the overlap turns up interesting perspectives.In the final analysis, Taj remains an expertly crafted novel with richly textured details, especially of violence and erotocism. It takes the reader through the corridors of history, pointing out lanes and by-lanes hitherto uncharted. Here the refrain of Mughal history \\"The Kingship has no Kinship\\" rings loud, reminding one of the life of those 22,000 architects \\"who lived and died building\\" the proud monument of love. The filmic quality of the novel may tempt a filmmaker to put it on the celluloid in near future. THE TELEGRAPH, ARNAB BHATTACHARYA-Only a masterly historical novelist like Timeri Murari could skate so teasingly near the lip of a volcano. In choosing the love story of Shah Jahan and Arjumand (Mumtaz) and tracing the subtle decline of the Great Mughals after Akbar, the author is able to build a remarkable framework which echoes the triumphant emergence of the Taj Mahal. The structure of this novel is as fascinating as the building it describes. Bill Aitken, SUNDAY OBSERVER. (THIS WAS A FULL PAGE REVIEW)This powerful novel tells the story at two different levels. The first one talks about the love affair of Shah Jahan and Arjumand till her death. The latter narrates the story of the later years of Shah Jahan till his death. It is an old fashioned and stylish novel, told to perfection. More than a historical romance it brings out the political and social life of the Mughals. A historical novel written with amazing simplicity, the book also gives a fascinating description of how the immortal monument of love was built. THE STATESMAN.It is not surprising that nearly two decades after the book first came out, Penguin India has chosen to bring out its edition of Timeri N. Murari's TAJ. Both are clearly backing a proven winner. Murari fashions it well, skillfully weaving fact and fiction, steering the narrative back and forth in time...the reader is swept along easily by the inevitability of the historical denouement that must come, and by the classic love story that never ends. -OUTLOOK.People come from all over the world to visit the Taj Mahal and this book proves that India is all that its been made out to be, a land of fable, culture and a rich glorious past. This is a book portraying India in all her cultural finery, replete with fact and folklore. In this fascinating book Murari has written much more than a historical romance, he has skillfully recreated the period against which the story is set. Though erotic in parts the book has factually kept to the happenings of that era. As a historian I would definitely recommend this book, especially for someone who is planning to visit the Taj Mahal. DECCAN CHRONICLE.Timeri N Murari has recreated this evergreen love story of the 17th century India with the lucidity of a poet. It's more than a period love story. Murari deftly weaves this magical tale with the story of Murthi and his wife Sita, both fictional characters who, in the novel, are invited by Shah Jahan to assist in the building of the mausoleum. The grandeur that marked the lives of royalty is juxtaposed against the stark poverty just outside the palace gates. The parallel story Shah Jahan and Arjumand, Murthi and Sita's struggle to survive at the mercy of the nobles touches one's heart. The book reverberates with the message that love is all powerful. THE TRIBUNE.What Timeri N. Murari has attempted is to give life a life to Arjumand beyond the tomb by which alone she's remembered. His most thrilling chapters deal with the Mughal army's chase of Shah Jahan and his family over four years for trying to usurp the throne. His sketch of Mehrunissa's characters outshines all others. Along with the palace intrigues Murari also tells the story of Murthi, a Hindu carver of god's statues, who is sent to Agra by his ruler to help build the Taj Mahal. The author's strength lies in the way he has tackled several stories in one. HINDUSTAN TIMES.'An exotic, passionate novel, sensual and violent by turn, always compelling' - The GUARDIAN-Only a masterly historical novelist like Timeri Murari could skate so teasingly near the lip of a volcano. In choosing the love story of Shah Jahan and Arjumand (Mumtaz) and tracing the subtle decline of the Great Mughals after Akbar, the author is able to build a remarkable framework which echoes the triumphant emergence of the Taj Mahal. The structure of this novel is as fascinating as the building it describes. Bill Aitken, SUNDAY OBSERVER-A sense of impending tragedy prevails throughout the novel, foreshadowing the destruction of brothers pitted against brothers in bloody pursuit of the Peacock Throne. One can read into the symbolic undertones, and find this a complex and disturbing novel. Asia Magazine.-Much that is banal has been written about a passion that became woven into history, but in TAJ, Murari avoids the temptation for tears; instead he has written a book of powerful simplicity, and at the same time evokes those far off days when a great man buried his heart in a mausoleum. Gloucestershire ECHO.-The writer does convey successfully au aura of 17th century India by having an eye and ear for detail. We learn of the incredible wealth and sumptuousness of the Mughal court we learn of the intrigues within families where Tamerlane's law forbidding the killing of next of kin breaks down as brother plots against brother. BBC RADIO.-Putting historical source to good use, Murari has fashioned a stylish novel that brings to life the politics and intrigues of Mughal court life.

It happens so that Allan Quatermain stops by his Zulu friend's kraal (to those of you who never read Haggard, Kraal=household) to find that yet another friend is madly in love with the well known beauty: Mameena, or, in other words, Child of the Storm. Allan is curious to see this well known Mameena, but his friend who is in love with Mameena (his name is Saduko) goes on a crazy battle to win 100 cattle for Mameena's dowry. After going with Saduko on his quest and helping him win 600 cattle, Allan meets Mameena, and determines she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and, though at that time Africans were thought of as savages (most unjustly, I have to add), Allan, after observing some treachery done by Mameena while pretending to be unconscious, after knowing she was false, cannot find any reason to resist her love to him, for indeed Mameena tries to engage him in a marriage, but Allan remembers her treachery and tells her no. Many adventures follow after that, until the Zulu King declares Mameena a witch, and Mameena pleads guilty. It is not the kind of Salem witchcraft that is talked about here. It is more like herb-knowledge and doctoring that the Zulus call witchcraft. After recieving her death sentence for many more offenses, including causing a civil war and it's outcome, Mameena makes a last wish. The last wish is... You'll have to figure out this as you read along with the mystery of Mameena's character. Suggested background books: Any Allan Quatermain book.

It is a book that is a must read for anyone interested in the rethorics of multiculturalism, in the problematics concerning immigration, women and minority rights in Australia but also everywhere.

In Carne de Perro we see the same Pedro Juan G that we have seen in Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El insaciable hombre arana and Animal Tropical, one who is starving for a promising future, food, and women on a regular basis. His life in Cuba is a destitute one and the readers learn a little bit about life in a socially and economically repressed country whose revolution has failed miserably. Who are the victims?- the Cubans. Pedro G in Carne de Perro tells it just like it is but with much less anger and resentment. I enjoyed the book. It was short but the message was sent.

It details the rise and fall of Patrice Lumumba, portrayed as a genuine liberationist, whose doom was perhaps inevitable in such a divided country. Many of the problems that beset Africa are recognised. The machinations of the Americans, represented by Mark Stipe, a CIA operative, segue into the other story in the novel. This is the fading love affair between the narrator, James, a middle-aged English novelist with a tendency to distance himself from ideals and political passions, and Ines, a journalist for L'Unita who embraces Lumumba's cause wholeheartedly. The author explores well the issues of love and personal feelings in a time that demands political commitment. The title is Ines' description of James as someone who always expects the worst.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Irishman, James Gillespie, travels from his home in London to the Congo to follow his lover, Ines Sabiani, an Italian political journalist.He is chasing her; she is chasing political news.The story is about the way they see the world; their passions and their loves. James views his life as a story of failure.It is 1959 in Leopoldville, Belgium Congo, west Africa. It is the time of the rising independence of the Congolese from the Belgiums; a time of violence and dissent. James finds the politics uninteresting; he is only there to save his relationship with Ines. He comes to realize that Ines is more passionate about her work and the freedom of the people of Congo than about him. They have been together for two years in London, where everything was perfect. It was far from perfect in Leopoldville for James.James wants commitment, longevity and marriage. Ines wants none of this and leaves James for Auguste, a younger Congolese man. James defies death to rescue Ines and her new lover from the bloody conflict of angry dissidents, but does it rekindle their love?Historically factual, it is a compelling, interesting, and emotional read as James lays bare his feelings of love and hate.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Not everyone who reads this book will be stranded in a war-torn ex-colony, whilst trying to save a doomed relationship - but nevertheless !.....This novel isn't just about politics; it's about the struggle to reconcile the different selves that inhabit your professional life, your love-life and your own moral landscape. Not many affairs can absorb this kind of plurality - the author suggests that love demands a narrower field of vision. Acutely observed and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"It's been a long time since I picked up a book to flip through a few pages before going to sleep and found myself forcing myself to put it down on p. 175 at 2 a.m. Fast-moving, erotically charged, compassionately insightful about people, vividly descriptive of a faraway place and time -- what more could you want from a novel?"},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Bennet has written an excellent novel about love, self examination and revolution. The story, a writer's attempt to win back a lover with the pre-Mobuto Congo as a backdrop, is rich with characters and plot. His narrative is simple and evocative and carries the reader along so easily. One of the best I have read this year!"},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"This is a book about art-for-art's-sake vs. political commitment. The art-for-art's sake camp, as personified by the narrator, turns out to be pretty pathetic, but what's brilliant about this book is that it's a fine piece of pure art even as it shows how pathetic art can be in the face of political realities."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Bennett's novel was a fascinating read immediately following Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible--the same setting, a completely different perspective, two excellent novels (read both). Bennett's casting of the end of a relationship, amid the destruction of a nation is a compelling story. The story of the protagonist's sorrow over the loss of his lover, and the story of the equally short and catastrophic independence of the Congo are superbly blended. The prose sings in this novel and although Bennett contends that, ...there is no such thing as a change in people... this is exactly contradicted by the story here. One wants to read this book and then talk about it--it is emotionally charged and goes to the heart of the issue of whether we ever really do connect with other people as the author portends his main character never had until middle aged and under extreme duress. One who found Cold Mountain intriguing, will also be captivated by The Catastrophist."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Ronan Bennett's &quot;Catastrophist&quot; grips you from the outset. Who are these characters stranded on the banks of the Sankuru river in December 1960 and what is their involvement in the life and arrest of Patrice Lamumba? Why is this &quot;a story of failure&quot;? Bennett sucks you into the lives of the main protagonists in a style that is crisp and direct. Gillespie's cynicism and and resignation is set in contrast to the idealism and dynamism of Inez. Both are flawed. And the Belgian Congo is flawed. I never felt I was being given a treatise on the political history of the Congo but ended up being as intrigued by the story of its conflict as by the the fate of Bennett's characters. He has managed a considerable achievement in marrying a story of deep personal sensitivity and searching with one of the Congo's despairing lurch for normal life. And maybe it's about all our lives. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"On June 30, 1960, the Congo was emancipated from Belgium. African nationalist leader Patrice Emery Lumumba became the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo when it declared its independence - the long awaited \\"Depanda\\" had arrived! In October 1958 Lumumba had founded the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. Forced out of office during a period of violent political upheaval in September 1960, he was assassinated in January 1961.During the Congo's turbulent beginning many countries intervened in its political affairs. \\"They used: fear of communism, economic collapse, civil war, and protection of European citizens living in the Congo to back themselves for intervening.\\" And the expatriate community, living in luxury, sipping sundowners at poolside, did not appreciate their world, their comfortable lives slipping out of their control.At the time, the Congo was the biggest and richest country in central Africa, one with huge strategic importance - not only to the Belgians, but to the US. Katanga Province, the size of Britain, remains one of the richest areas in all Africa if not the richest. \\"The mines of the Union Miniere and Forminiere provided the world with eight per cent of its copper, sixty per cent of its uranium, seventy-three per cent of its cobalt, eighty per cent of its industrial diamonds. Katanga has gold, silver, tin, zinc, manganese, columbium, cadmium, tungsten, tantalum: its supplies will never be exhausted.\\" This was the land of Unilever, Brufina, Union Miniere and the Banque Empain, companies which were not about to let their holdings slip away easily.Into this tumultuous, politically charged setting wanders James Gillespie, a disaffected Irish/English writer, author of a few well received novels and a contributor to various periodicals. He arrives in Leopoldsville with the intent of pursuing a waning relationship with Ines Sabiani, his fiery, radical Italian girlfriend with whom he is deeply in love. Gillespie's arrival in the Congo represents a major emotional commitment for him. Ines is a journalist with her country's communist newspaper L'Unita. She is as passionate about the cause of Independence and about the charismatic leader, Lumumba, as James is indifferent, or as he would say, \\"objective.\\" And he is a skeptic, a pessimist. Part of the problem between the two lovers is that James is never on anyone's side. He insists, \\"I see all sides. My craft demands it.\\" He is against intolerance, dogma, illiberalism. But he is for nothing. In?s invests herself emotionally as well as professionally in that which she believes. Her affair with James is doomed before Gillespie sets foot on African soil - just as Patrice Lumumba's government is doomed before he takes office. At one point In?s tells Gillespie that, \\"Dante wrote that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crises maintain their neutrality.\\" She accuses him of being a \\"catastrofista,\\" a \\"catastrophist,\\" one who believes \\"that no problem is small. Nothing can be fixed; it is always the end.\\"As James becomes caught up in the historical movement, colonial injustice and the chaotic brutality that accompanies it, he is finally forced to take sides...and action.Although well written, I did have some difficulty with author Ronan Bennett's style. It made for ponderous reading at times. I am fascinated by this period in Africa, especially the politics, and by the character of Patrice Lumumba in particular, so I had personal incentive to persevere. \\"The Catastrophist\\" reminds me of Graham Greene's \\"The Quiet American.\\" Both novels deal with the chaotic end of colonialism, have journalists as protagonists and idealistic, if Machiavellian, CIA operatives fomenting intrigue and even more violence. The colonialists in both novels, the Belgians here, the French in Vietnam in Greene's work, act paternalistically and condescendingly towards the \\"natives\\" and don't really take the independence movements seriously.\\"The Catastrophist was short-listed for the 1998 Whitbread Novel Award.JANA"},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"The Catastrophist makes an interesting counterpoint to Giles Foden's The Last King of Scotland. Both books examine the deterioration of colonial rule and the ensuing chaos in central Africa from an outsider's perspective and with some studied distance in voice and tone. Bennett, however, mixes in an uncrossable gulf between love and ideology that makes The Catastrophist a more challenging, and more rewarding read. The main character's reaction to the situation in Africa is frequently compared to his dismissive tone about the turmoil in Ulster, and this connection led me to often stop reading and spend a few minutes pondering just what brought the character to such a flip attitude about his homeland and how that would alter his perception of Africa. The only criticism that I can level at this book is the reliance on a European voice-it seems that the African voice is almost entirely lost, and that is certainly a failing in a book at least half about the political turmoil in Belgian Congo."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Bennett's American debut is fascinating for its historical context (that being what drew me to the novel in the first place), and also for the richness of its characters and plot. The Belgian Congo is vividly portrayed, and stocked with a wide range of characters -- from Gillespie and Ines to Stipe, de Scheut and Auguste -- who &quot;stay with you&quot; long after you've finished the book. Bennett's concern with the role of writers in political causes is very interesting, particularly within the context of his own experiences as a Belfast youth and, subsequently, a London journalist. Plot-wise, he succeeds in cranking up the suspense so that, by the final chapters, you'll find it hard to put the book down. Overall, &quot;The Catastrophist&quot; is an ambitious novel which will leave the reader satisfied."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"I read this novel when it was released. It stayed with me like almost no other novel ever has, hence my decision to review it. Simply put, it was excellent. Ronan Bennett told his story with sensitivity for the political climate, and a keen insight into human relationships. I echo the sentiments of another reviewer in that this is a thinking person's novel. Bennett's writing style is awesome. Those not interested in the content but partial to spectacular penmanship should still read this novel. They will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Ronan Bennett has written a landmark novel. On the surface, &quot;The Catastrophist&quot; appears to be treading well worn grounds occupied by illustrious writers like V S Naipaul and Chinua Achebe, but this Whitbread Prize shortlisted novel is no second rate hack job. Its premise may seem all too familiar - a white journalist exorcising her colonialist guilt on foreign soil - but what differentiates this wonderfully compelling novel from others I've read is the fresh perspective it lends to the subject. For once, it's the man (James) who suffers...and for the love of a woman (Ines), who has more serious matters on her mind than thoughts of domestic bliss and love. The male/female role reversal is strangely effective and though it took some getting used to initially, there was nothing that seemed false or didn't ring true. Told exclusively from James' perspective, you ride on his emotional waves and judge his relationship with the other characters accordingly. I found myself disliking Ines for her selfishness, then admiring her courage and vascillating in my opinion of her. The flashback to James' childhood in Ireland is also deeply poignant and explanatory. Ronan Bennett's writing is truly awesome, beautifully judged and always compelling. &quot;The Catastrophist&quot; is both a thriller and a love story. Read either way, it's a towering achievement and an unconditional success. The struggle and emotional tug-of-war between James and Ines parallel that between the freedom fighters and the Belgian colonialists in Congo. A great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"I'm surprised to see it hasn't been released in the US yet, but this is a very well written novel. Not light - the prose is quite intense, and one is often forced to read very slowly. Characterisation is good, and the story is sound. The only problem is that it is not by an African and as such it misses out on the nuances which would be available to one born on the continent. There is only so much that can be gleaned in a trip from the UK. Still, this is the time for more novels of Africa, even if we Africans can't be bothered to write them."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"Ronan Bennet has written an Irish classic. It is not Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; nor does it even remotely resemble &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;. There is no famine or sectarian violence but rather the heart and soul of the Irish diaspora. The famine and troubles of Ireland are evident in the narrator's soul as his internecine relationship with his Communist lover spins wildly out of control. The historical background of the Congolese civil war provides a palpable feel to the book. His search and pursuit of his lover into Patrice Lumamba's Congo is not contrived. I would recommend this book to anyone and I hope that Ronan Bennet writes another soon."},{"Title":"The Catastrophist","review":"An Irish author, his Italian lover, an American spy, and a host of African revolutionaries compromise an unlikely cast of characters that Bennet amazingly manages to make believable, even compelling.This is a story of love lost, art vs. politics, trust and betrayal, all superimposed on the backdrop of Patrice Lumumba's struggle in the Belgian Congo. The reader can't help but be drawn in by the hopelessness of the protagonist's pursuit of his lost lover. The characters are complex, flawed, and realistic.This is a bleak novel of self destruction and situations out of control. The protagonist is intentionally apolitical (which causes the rift with his former lover) but his story mirrors the political conflict that surrounds him.A masterful, well researched, thoughtful novel. A love story and a political novel all at once, which manages never to be pretentious or preachy.

My 7 year old daughter hated reading. It was a battle. We tried Harry Potter but the book was way too long for a young reader to read by herself plus some of the words were too difficult and it became frustrating for her. Then I found Pixie Tricks. After starting the first book in the series (Sprite's Secret) my daughter began to realize how wonderful reading can really be. These easy to read books are divided into manageable chapters so that confidence is built as each chapter is read. You won't find your child getting discouraged when the end of the chapter seems too far to get to. So if you have a reluctant reader, take them on a magical journey to Violet's world where fairies really do exist and reading is fun."},{"Title":"Sprite's Secret","review":"In researching children's books for my own writing projects, I came across this book in my church library.

I would recommend Forrester to all readers."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"As the preceding volume, Beat to Quarters, shows the end of a long voyage, so here we get to see the curious activities attending on the the start of another--the captain personally responsible for acquiring his crew and his victuals (and to be repaid from prizes possibly awarded from the sale of hoped-for captured enemy ships). Second in the original series (#6 in the whole), Ship of the Line soon sees Hornblower in the Mediterranean serving in a squadron of four under his near-lover's stodgy Admiral-husband. (We remain as achingly puzzled as Hornblower how the smart Lady Barbara could ever condescend to marry this wart.) Whenever Hornblower manages detached duty he is at his best, terrorizing the French, and their army(!), on the Catalan coast, where the sea crashes into the Pyrenees.The action in this type of novel is not much fiction, but artful transformations of actual events from the long-running Napoleonic Wars, down to actual ship manoeuvres. As you read other naval novels, you will recognize certain episodes repeating, like the &quot;cutting out&quot; expedition here. Always they are put in different contexts, however, featuring a different cast of idiosyncratic characters. It is hard to devine why Hornblower has such fear and doubts about his own abilities, when he is worshipped by his men (more perspicacious than he!), and becomes absolutely possessed in hot battle, a human computer! He is a great contrast in this regard to O'Brian's stolid Capt. Aubrey, but that is one way in which each series is uniquely worth reading (similarly with Lambden's racy, or Woodman's severe, traversals of much of the same naval territory, up the same ladder of command).Maybe I read too many modern novels, with their grimey action and prose to match, but C.S. Forester stands out as an impressively good writer because he lacks the crutches of gore and sex. I could not put this down; even though the author gives you chapter breaks, his measured cadence and rolling words just kept me going into the wee 'ours. There's a palpable joy to reading Forester. You become aware what an artful choice of words can do. I think if I read the whole Hornblower series one right after another, I would begin to sound like him! If the language of sailing ships is a mystery to you, the new DVD of A&amp;E's TV mini-series on Horatio Hornblower includes a glossary. But Forester does not delight in obscure, archaic expressions as does O'Brian. Having a nautical reference handy makes the confusing swirl of the climatic battle a little less of a muddle, although its horrifying devastation is quite clear enough already."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"The books about Horatio Hornblower include some of the most interesting and exciting novels ever written about warfare at sea during the days of sailing ships. Hornblower himself is a charming hero who doubts himself, has many weaknesses, and uses his sense of the odds to calculate the best course to take. He is more like Clark Kent than Superman in that way, but can turn into Superman briefly when the occasion calls for it.Throughout the prior volumes of this wonderful series, there has been lots of \\"ship of the line\\" envy on Hornblower's part as he made do with commanding lesser vessels. In Ship of the Line, Captain Hornblower finds himself getting his heart's desire, a two-decker called the Sutherland.Complications soon arise when Hornblower discovers that his new admiral has just married Lady Barbara Wellesley, with whom Hornblower is in love. Hornblower and his wife (Maria) meet the admiral and Lady Barbara in a social scene that you will not soon forget.With too little time to prepare, the Sutherland is soon at sea with an under sized and inexperienced crew. What follows is as action-packed a book as you can imagine. Ship of the Line has a greater variety of difficult and unusual challenges thrown Hornblower's way than any reader could possibly hope for. The details of the conflicts are stunning in their scope and scale. If you are like me, you'll find yourself racing through the pages to see what happens next . . . knowing that there are surely big surprises ahead. As usual, Hornblower's imagination and quick thinking make for enormous differences in the outcomes from what would be expected.You will enjoy the complications brought about by Lady Barbara's new husband. And Hornblower's thoughts of Lady Barbara intrude throughout the book, like the musings of a love-sick schoolboy.The book is also interesting because Hornblower is faced with many decisions that could wreck his career, leaving him unemployed at half pay for the rest of his life. While many today would enjoy an early retirement, Hornblower is only happy at sea . . . and in battle. With his strong sense of duty, he makes decisions that may surprise you from time to time, which makes the story all the richer.If you have never read any of the Hornblower books, I suggest that you start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and proceed through in the chronological order of Hornblower's career through the series (not the order in which they were written).If you do decide to read this book first to see if you like the books, let me caution you that the book ends in such a way that you will probably immediately decide to read the next one. For that reason, try to resist reading Ship of the Line until you have read its six predecessor volumes.Do you always take time to locate new solutions that others have not tried before? Once you see a possible solution, do you stick with that idea to work through the problems . . . or are you soon discouraged by the first foul wind?Assume there is a solution vastly better than any you have tried before . . . or have thought of yet. And keep thinking until you find it!"},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"In 'Ship of the Line' daring British sea capatin Horatio Hornblower fights not only the French under the tyrant Napoleon, but his own heart as well. After falling in love with Lady Pamela Wellesley his hopes are shattered when she marries an admiral whose ego considerably outweighs his talents. What is worse Hornblower's conscience is racked with guilt over his disloyalty to his own wife, Maria. But before this becomes too much of a soap opera Forester plunges Hornblower into the dangerous swashbuckling sea where he uses every trick in the book to ensnare his French opponents. The ending is perhaps the greatest cliff hanger in all the series which leads into the next novel, 'Flying Colours.' Only a writer of Forester's genius can create so well both the moving human story and great adventure that is 'Ship of the Line.'"},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"\\"Ship of the Line\\" was the second story written in C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series. As the name implies, Captain Hornblower has command of the ship of the line in this book set during the Napoleonic Wars. Although his ship of the line is an old, unweatherly 74, Hornblower successfully takes her on a cruise off the French and Spanish Mediterranean coast. This book features great naval action, including cutting-out expeditions and a livelyThis was the second Horatio Hornblower book that I read, although I had seen the A&E; TV series. As a devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I was pleasantly surprised with this Hornblower book and I found Hornblower a much more authentic character than the superman of the TV series. Still, it is hard for me not to compare Hornblower with Captain Aubrey: although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I find Aubrey a much more fun and likable character than Hornblower. Hornblower is a much more serious and deep character who is driven by self-doubt.This is a very good book, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in naval warfare or historical fiction. It is an action-filledt account of naval life and warfare during the Napoleonic era. C.S. Forester started a genre with Horatio Hornblower, and this book is packed with action and adventure."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"After seeing a spate of Hornblower TV features, I finally picked up one to read. I expected a sort of gung-ho boys' book. Instead, Ship of the Line draws a complex, interesting character who lacks either the saccharine of many &quot;boys' books&quot; of the late 19th or early 20th centuries or the &quot;grit over good&quot; tone of the rather ridiculous &quot;tough mercenary kills all&quot; modern cheap war paperback. I will immediately proceed to read the other ten, and I advise the reader to do so as well. Forester is trying to give us a naval social history lesson, wrapped in a complex heroic figure, and he by and large succeeds."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"After returning home from a very successful voyage to the Americas Captain Hornblower is assigned to a larger ship of the line with two gun decks, the Sutherland. He is assigned to the fleet blockading the Mediterranean coast of Spain where Napoleon's French fleet and the Spanish navy are prevented from supplying Napoleon's armies. In classic Hornblower style Hornblower isn't content to sail idly back and forth, so he finds ways to attack harbors, canals, and a French army near the shore. After several courageous engagements Hornblower becomes the only English ship between 4 enemy vessels and their safe harbor. The remainder of the English fleet is over the horizon, several hours away under sail in light winds. Following orders from the fleet Admiral Hornblower attacks all four, severely damaging three of them before the superior weight of the more numerous enemy fleet renders his ship useless. The wreckage drifts down current into the lee shore and a Spanish harbor where Hornblower is captured. As usual, Hornblower is filled with self doubts. If he ever escapes will he be stripped of his rank or even hanged for losing his ship? Will he ever see his beloved Barbara, wife of the Admiral, again? The detail of ships and sailing in the early 19th century make the Hornblower series must reading for any man who loves the sea."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Ship of the Line (1938), also known as A Ship of the Line, is C. S. Forester's seventh Hornblower novel by chronology, second by publication. Hornblower, who seemingly encounters ridiculous drama every time he gets a new command, takes charge of Sutherland, a ship of the line, then sails off to conduct various raids on the French.Horatio Hornblower has never been as unsympathetic or unlikable as he is in Ship of the Line. Throughout the series, Forester has made Hornblower a particularly flawed character - that's part of Hornblower's charm. But here, Forester has gone too far - he's made Hornblower a loathsome, pathetic individual. Hornblower is obtuse; he's prone to paranoid inner monologues; he wallows in self-pity; he has no real moral values beyond his duty; he moons about, pining for Lady Barbara; he's racist, law-breaking, self-serving and dishonorable. Forester got a better handle on the character in later novels, but for the modern chronological reader it certainly appears that Hornblower is evolving into a despicable man of low character in his old age.Most of Ship of the Line is action, but none of Hornblower's adventures in this novel are particularly remarkable. Capture a ship, sink a ship, attack a fort, weather a storm - been there, done that. There's no real plot here; it's just attack, attack, attack. And is Hornblower the only man in the Royal Navy who speaks Spanish? Really? This isn't the first time Forester's given the reader that impression, either. And again, a careful reader who has gone through the series chronologically will notice more events that Forester later retconned.Ship of the Line is a tremendous disappointment, especially given the superior Hornblower novels Forester wrote after it. It ends with a cliffhanger, so you really can't skip it, but it's easily the worst book in the series to this point in the chronology."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"This is a rip-roaring naval adventure from start to finish, no mistake. But I also find it one of the most problematic in the Hornblower series. For one thing, the action seems much more episodic (and, as a result, much more easily resolved) than in previous installments. But the big concern is that Hornblower is perhaps at his most unlikable in this book. His deeply flawed character has always been one of his most intriguing aspects. But here, he crosses the line into self-absorbed whining, IMO. He doesn't feel as developed as he does in the earlier books, no doubt because this one was written second. Forester seems to have gotten to know his character better as he went, which lends an interesting, but still unfortunate, sense of unevenness to this otherwise enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Excellent book. But just remember...BUY FLYING COLOURS AS WELL. This book ends on a cliffhangar that you cannot concentrate on DeCartes' theorems in class because you are aching to know what will happen next.This books completely set the stage for the internally-evntful FLYING COLOURS, especially with the frequent haunting memories of young Horatio. Full of foreshadowing, we cannot help but pity our Captain as he hits rock bottom after so much good luck.Makes ya wonder why everything HAD to happen to him. *sad*"},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"I have finally acquired all the books in the series and have been reading them in chronological order of Hornblower's career.This is a great book. A little slow in the beginning. Hornblower has to get an aging Danish two decker (74) outfitted and manned. The book goes over all the difficulties of manning a ship after nearly 15 years of war. All the best seamen and topmen are exempt due to working in the Honorable East India Company. As is to be expected, most of his new men come from the press gangs and the jails. Landlubbers all....But once at sea, he shapes them up and molds a crew that will fight. He is part of a small squadron of ships that is sent to harass Napolean's flank. They are sent to interdict the supplies coming from Barcelona.As can be expected, Hornblower does a comendable job. He has several immediate astonishing successes. When his new admiral comes on the scene, the failures begin to happen. The admiral appears to not be quite the seaman or tactician that is required for this venture. He apparently received his command through the influence of his new wife's (Lady Barbara Wellesley) family.During these failures, Hornblower saves the day by rescuing the admirals flagship, accomplishing a strategic withdrawal from a land attack after the Spanish abandoned him and finally...The end of the book is quite surprising. Hornblower discovers a French squadron of ships of the line, four in all, including one three decker of over 80 guns. He knows the strategic value of slowing or stopping this squadron. After 24 hours of shadowing this squadron, he makes the decision to fight it out. Knowing that his ship will become a wreck and that most of his crew will be killed or maimed, he goes at them.....This is a good book and a fast read."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"\\"Ship of the line\\" is a sequel to \\"Beat to quarters\\" and shows the adventures of Hornblower after his coming back to England. He receives the ship of the line \\"Sutherland\\" and becomes part of the Mediterranean Squadron under Lady Barbara's husband command.

The 39 year old Horatio Hornblower is given command of the 74 gun HMS Sutherland, 'the ugliest and least desirable two-decker in the Navy list.' Also, being 250 men short of a crew, he must enlist and train new members. Will this ship and crew be able to handle BOTH the French navy and army? Is this the end of Hornblower? Of course not, otherwise there wouldn't be more books after this, but don't you want to know how he handles a blockaded Spanish coast AND four French warships?"},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"I find it deplorable that this well-recieved series still has no digital KINDLE copy for selected titles (Happy Return,Ship of the Line). Other titles in long-running series suffer the same fate.Amazon has made it difficult to like them, and it is getting more and more unlikely they will ever change their ways. BTW, how many requests does it take to have Amazon find it profitable enough to make a KINDLE copy of a publication available?Sounded like a good book, as I have read the synopsis elsewhere. Unfortuantely I just now bought the printed version at a used book store in the city."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"This is the next Hornblower chronologically, it was not the next one written.

And that is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Ship of the line was the second volume of the origonal three books of the Horatio Hornblower saga. Nearly 70 years of being in print has done nothing to make it stale.We see again all of the warts of a navy trying frantically to prepare itself to face Napoleon. All the desprate measures taken just to equip a SOL for a voyage become clear to the reader. Many would say that the difference in quality made it an easy task, but the reason this difference existed was a constant blockade with men and ships paying the price in broken bones and weary bodies. Hornblower's own worries not only inform us but they make everyday duties interesting.Of course we see action action action as he reaches his station in the Med wreaking havoc on the coast. Once again Forester takes the time to inform us. In a time when people can travel the Atlantic in hours and make it from Boston to Worcester in minutes the struggle it was simply to travel is lost on us. It is not lost on Forester who drills it home indirectly by Hornblowers acts.Without revealing the ending (which most Hornblower fans will know anyway.) The climatic battle has all of the traits of an epic. Hornblower is the kings man and shows it to the full in that last fight, and it is done without being overdone.Another jewel in the crown for us readers."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Lots of great sea battles, it is one of the best books in the Hornblower saga."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"You are right there with Horatio in all his battles and adventures.

Make sure you start with Midshipman as there are many allusions to it in later books."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"This is such a great series (Patrick O'Brian is good, but a distant second) and this book is one of the best in it. Very exciting battles with Hornblower displaying his superior wits again and again, as well as his always present self-doubt. His character is so believable and so compelling, and the sea adventures so believable and vivid, that this is a joy to read. Be sure, at the least to read Beat to Quarters first. Better yet, read them all in order."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Ship of the Line is one of the highpoints of the Horatio Hornblower series -- a dazzling adventure built around three-dimensional characters that will have you running to the store to buy the sequel. Do yourself a favor and buy Flying Colours when you buy this one. Otherwise, you'll go crazy waiting to see what happens next.Hornblower, flesh off his triumph in the Pacific, is now assigned to the least desireable two-deck ship of the line, the Sutherland, with only half the crew he needs. Worse yet, he's assigned to duty under Admiral Leighton -- an inexperienced, over-cautious and frankly incompetent commander who also happens to have married the love of Hornblower's life -- Barbara Wellsley.Will Hornblower overcome these obstacles? You haven't been paying attention if you don't the answer to that already. He quickly becomes the \\"Terror of the Mediterranean\\", leading brilliant daring raids against the French on the coast of Spain and finally ending in a stunning battle against four French ships that is possibly the exciting, most heart-rending and most terrifying battle sequence Forester ever wrote. It perfectly capture both the excitement and the horror of warfare.As usual, it the character of Horatio that elevates this novel from historical drama to classic adventure. He in introspective and moody, intelligent enough to be scared of battle but brave enough to face his fears. He also represents the spirit of the Enlightenment in his disdain for the aristocracy and his belief that his men will fight better if they love him than fear him.This ranks with Hotspur as the pinnacle of the series. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the occasional confusion over events and (wait for it) lack of maps. Otherwise, this is a great story."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"It seems that by the time Forester wrote the predecessor to this novel, \\"Beat to Quarters\\" he had gained maturity and considerable ability as a writer. By this point in the series he is writing a whole lot more about what Hornblower is feeling and thinking and that makes this a much better novel than some of its predecessors. I think the battle scenes too have gained quality and are even more exciting now. I very much look forward to starting the next novel in the series."},{"Title":"Ship of the Line","review":"Volumes I through XII get the same top notch review.

All you have to do is savor the crisp, descriptive narration of a master author as he takes us along on a British ship of the line, under the command of a legendary captain. Hornblower has got to be one of the most likeable, yet most personally complex characters one will come across in popular fiction. Although the world of 17th century naval warfare is often alien to us, the reader doesn't get lost. The author has an uncanny ability to keep it understandable.

Her wastrel father has her selling off all kinds of treasures from her beloved estate to pay his gambling debts, so when the Duke of Gillingham, Lord Morgan shows up at her country estate, of course, she believes he is there to settle an IOU.She is surprised to discover that her father has sold her home out from under her to Morgan. Not too worry, she has money set aside to live in a small cottage but even that is taken from her to pay her father's debts. When Morgan hears of Alyssa's dilemma he is appalled and decides to employ her as the steward of the house until his brother and his wife take residence. Alyssa gladly accepts this job.There is a powerful attraction between self-reliant Alyssa and Morgan. She erroneously believes though that he loves her and wants to marry her but Morgan is of the ilk that marriage is not for him and proposes to set her up as a mistress. Alyssa flatly refuses this offer, she is honorable.Interwoven into this story is Morgan's search for British traitors. He does not reveal this to Alyssa and she is actually unaware of his clandestine dealings until almost the end of the book.Both the leads acted reasonably and more importantly they never let a lot of misunderstandings get in the way of their romance. How refreshing for people to forgive each other quickly and for them to say those important words, \\"I am sorry.\\" Even though Alyssa is very independently minded she is not immovably stubborn. She thinks through her situations logically and has the sensibilities of a woman living in the 19th century This is one of Ms. Basso's best."},{"Title":"Intimate Betrayal","review":"...with this well written novel.Independent Alyssa Carrington had run her father's english estate for years.

She was never introduced into society, never been to a ball and the gentry around Westgate Manor shunned her because she was too good - being a woman - in managing the estate. She always dreamed of having a husband and children of her own, so naturally after one light of illicit passion, when Duke of Gillingham offered for her, she gladly accepted thinking it was a marriage proposal.But for Lord Morgan Ashton, Duke of Gillingham, now the owner of Westgate Manor, it wasn't a marriage proposal, but a proposal to be his mistress. Morgan previously had a disastrous marriage and after the death of his wife, he vowed never to marry and put himself through the pain and humiliation again. He was attracted to Alyssa and after that one night he believes Alyssa is attracted to him too. But later, his marriage proposal made to correct her misunderstanding was soundly rejected and he was requested to stay away for her forever.But don't worry dear readers, they do get back together. How and why? You have to read the book to find out for yourself.I convey my kudos to Adrienne Basso who does a wonderful job for brining the characters to life. Morgan plays the role of the arrogant duke to perfection, effectively hiding his wounded and tender heart; with Alyssa in the role of the a strong headed female with a stubbornness and giving heart needed to show Morgan that love heals all wound. Besides the passion and romance, Ms. Basso also introduces a subplot which is a delight and sometimes causes friction between the two characters which is enjoyment for the readers. She does a wonderful job of showing us how women were treated in Regency high society and that if love is involved - albeit unknown to the characters at first - it brings them together and they finally find the true contentment that they really deserve."},{"Title":"Listen Up: How to Improve Relationships, Reduce Stress, and Be More Productive by Using the Power of Listening","review":"This book gets 5 stars in terms of content organization.

One comes awawy with an enormous respect for Dr. Bush. He must have been one tough character and difficult to deal with but he got the jobs done. It is a pity that his battles with Admiral Ernest King have, to my knowledge, never been documented. The issues they disagreed about were not trivial and their interactions must have been awesome. I read this book shortly after completing Tycho's Island and the similarity between the two men and the administrative issues they dealt with is both striking and illuminating.Good men are hard to find and good books about them deserve our attention."},{"Title":"Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century","review":"Zachary deserves great credit for writing a book that offers many virtues and lessons of lasting relevance. Because the author's commitment is worthy of his subject, this book should have timeless value. The roles for science and technology and how best to harness them for prosperity and for security to enable the preservation of peace are questions which transcend any particular time.The subtitle, Engineer of the American Century, is justified. Bush contributed to American society in many ways. He was a fecund, tireless inventor, helping launch Raytheon Corporation. He was dedicated to boosting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and thereby strengthening society through teaching and seeking practical knowledge. He was a pioneer and convenor of advances in computing.Clear-mindedly appreciating the gathering evil of Nazi Germany, Bush decided to do something, as typical. He left MIT and got to Washington as head of the Carnegie Institution. Though a Republican, he persuaded President Franklin Roosevelt that those who were technically educated needed to be harnessed within a National Defense Research Committee, in service to their nation's needs. By helping harness the extraordinary abilities of civilian and academic technologists to serve their nation in meeting the challenges of World War II, Bush helped unleash a cornucopia of inventions and advances in thinking, with extraordinary economic legacies (computing, electronics, medicine, radar).A few words from Zachary:--Bush's \\"was a life not of looking back, but of charging ahead.\\"--He had a \\"commitment to excellence and integrity that reinforced his belief in the power of one person to make a difference.\\"--\\"Bush shared Eisenhower's unease about the alliance between academia, the military, and industry\\"--\\"The proliferation of nuclear weapons, the rise of environmental hazards, and the evident political partisanship of many scientists - all combined to engender a cynicism in the public about the aims and evidence of science.\\"Several other books of possible interest in relation to the contributions of technologists:Philip Taubman, Secret Empire (2003)James Phinney Baxter, Scientists Against Time (1946)Biographies of Edwin LandJames Killian, Sputniks, Scientists, and Eisenhower (1977). Killian was a 1950s Bush, down to earth and his book is movingly endowed with wisdom."},{"Title":"Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century","review":"A very interesting and thorough biography of Vannevar Bush, who more than any other individual is responsible (for good or for ill) for the shape of today's scientific establishment. Well-written and engaging, with lots of interesting historical tidbits and good insight on the personalities involved. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century","review":"ENDLESS FRONTIER VANNEVAR BUSH, by G.P. Zachary, is a 518 page book, which includes a list of abbreviations (pages 409-410), footnotes (pages 411-484), and a generous number of glossy black and white photographs (16 pages of photos). The photos include a group pose of electrical engineering faculty at MIT (including Dr.Bush), separate photos of Dr. Bush with various inventions ((1) Profile tracer; (2) Product intergraph; (3) Differential analyzer; and (4) Hydrofoil), and photos of Dr. Bush with various luminaries, such as Karl Compton, Orville Wright, James Conant, General Leslie Groves, Robert Oppenheimer, and President Truman.WRITING STYLE. The writing style is excellent, in that it rarely digresses into narratives of a personal nature, or to provide disclosures of popular culture of the day. However, on page 24 we do find information of a personal nature: \\"In the spring of 1911, he [Vannevar Bush] suffered an appendicitis. He needed an operation and missed a semester. Bedridden for weeks during one stretch, he found consolation in his imagination.\\" Pages 47-48 provide details of the funeral of Dr. Bush's father. Page 59 details Dr. Bush's love for smoking pipes. Pages 139-141 concern Dr. Bush's wife, Phoebe. We read that, \\"Among strangers, Phoebe could be moody, at times, dour and aloof, but Bush excused her faults.\\" These little tidbits are quite welcome. After all, this is a biography, isn't it?HEART OF THIS BOOK. In my opinion, the heart of the book resides at pages 123-139 and 159-183. In my opinion, this part of the book should be reproduced verbatum (with permission of course) in standard high school history books. These pages concern the radio proximity fuze, radar, homing torpedoes, and magnetic airborn detection of submarines. Proximity fuzes are radio-controlled detonators, which initiate explosion when the bomb is close to an airplane, and not merely at a pre-determined time or when the bomb actually contacts the airplane. Bush's work on radar involved converting England's magnetron to a production model called, SCR-584. In short, U.S. electrical equipment needed to be changed from long wavelength to short wavelength, in order to be compatible with England's magnetron. Bush's most important contributions took the form of changing the relationships between: (1) Private research laboratories; (2) Military research laboratories; (3) Civilian input into military strategy; and (4) Federal funding for research. The next five paragraphs (see below) describe what is found at pages 123-139 and 159-183. The most dramatic aspect of these pages, and perhaps in the entire book, is how Dr. Bush overcame the resistance of Admiral Ernest King to using radar and to using the proximity fuze. In noting the fact that Dr. Bush has only two patents to his name, I am left with the impression that Dr. Bush's greatest contribution to humanity was ensuring that radar and the proximity fuze were developed in a timely manner, where a major detail of this contribution was overcoming a certain roadblock known as, \\"Ernest King.\\" Without Vannevar Bush, it is quite possible that everybody in France, England, and other European countries would currently be subjected to a dictatorship headquartered in Germany (this is not a joke).NDRC. In June 15, 1940, Bush created the NDRC. The NDRC's goal was to cause cooperation with the army and navy with civilians involved in weapons research. The NDRC reduced the influence of technically incompetant military leaders. Another problem that needed to be overcome by the NDRC, under Dr. Bush's leadership, was the historic distrust between the army and the navy, e.g., refusing to share information with each other. Another hurdle was Harold Brown (director of Naval Research Lab) who was jealous of the power that Roosevelt gave to Dr. Bush. Bush's tactic was to get friendly with Harold Brown's rival. Harold Brown's rival was the Bureau of Ships. Also, Bush persuaded Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, to select Prof. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT to oversee the Navy's research program. Frank Knox's earlier career was with the navy. Dr. Bush's connection with MIT was that one of Bush's main efforts in his career was to set up the radar laboratory (\\"Rad Lab\\") at MIT, and to attract countless millions of dollars in federal funding to MIT. The end-result was Harold Brown's loss of power.OSRD. In May 1941, Roosevelt created OSRD. OSRD had more reliable funding than NDRC. NDRC was the main operating unit of OSRD. Bush served as director and grants manager of OSRD. OSRD had a much better patent attorney than NDRC. Bush set standards for deciding on direct costs versus overhead costs, for contracts with non-profits and with industry. Bush caused U.S. military to switch from long wavelength radar to be compatible with England's newly invented magnetron, which used short wavelength radar.RAD LAB. Dr. Bush created the Rad Lab at MIT, and made certain that the Rad Lab was located at MIT, rather than at Carnegie Instition, as was preferred by Alfred Loomis, or at Bell Labs, as was preferred by Frank Jewett. My initial reason for reading ENDLESS FRONTIER by G.P. Zachary, was by way of Robert Buderi's book on the history of radar. Robert Buderi's book discloses Vannevar Bush's role in setting up the Rad Lab, though Buderi's book focuses more on the inventive aspects of radar, for example, the inventions of Watson-Watt, and on the nuts and bolts of anti-submarine warfare, for example, by a description of Leigh Lights used by the Allies for hunting U-boats.BUSH CALLS FOR TECHNOCRATS TO BE EQUALS WITH MILITARY BRASS IN SETTING MILITARY STRATEGY. Roosevelt agreed with Dr. Bush's call for input by radar scientists into military strategy. Roosevelt agreed with Bush, and Roosevelt created the JOINT COMMITTEE ON NEW WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT, with Bush in charge. The Committee's mission was to educate the military's top brass. Dr. Bush's greatest challenge took the form of Admiral Ernest King, who was traditionally skeptical of new gadgets, adn who dismissed radar as being useless. (From this book, it is apparent that Ernest King could reasonably be characterized as one of Adolf Hitler's greatest assets.) According to this book, \\"Bush spent hours in closed-door sessions dutifully tutoring a Navy admiral and Army general, but his efforts . . . had scant practical effect.\\" We read that, \\"King's rigidness appalled Bush.\\" Eventually, Bush persuaded Julius Furer (research coordinator of the navy) that Ernest King was mistaken in dismissing the proxmity fuze and in dismissing radar. Als, eventually Bush persuaded Henry Stimson (an attorney and Secretary of War) to put microwave radar on many U.S. Air Force planes. Bush and Stimson each spoke to Roosevelt, complaining about Ernest King. Eventually, in May 1943, Dr. Bush prevailed, and the Tenth Fleet was created. The Tenth Fleet consolidated all anti-submarine warfare in the Atlantic under one authority. Thus, it was the case that the navy was convereted to radar. The result was a turning point in the war. Previously, hundreds of allied ships were sunk by German U-boats. But within months of adopting radar, the U-boats were in retreat.PROXIMITY FUZE. We read that the proximity fuze screwed on the front of artillery shells, and caused an explosion when near the target. Most of the work was done by Merle Tuve of Carnegie Institution, using ideas from British physicists. Merle Tuve perfected the fuze so that it was the size of a fingertip, so that it could survive rotation at hundreds of times a second, and so that the battery of the fuze was kept off until the shell was airborne. The navy held off production until the device worked at a success rate of at least 50%. In January 1943, the fuze saw its first combat action. Bush faced another hurdle. The US military, especially Ernest King, agreed to use the proximity fuze only at sea, and never over land (for fear of reverse engineering by the enemy). Eventually, in October 1944, the US military agreed to use the proximity fuze over land and, in December 1944, it was used in Howitzers against German airplanes. At this point in the book, we read that, \\"Bush's reputation was growing . . . the press presented Bush in more pragmatic and appealing terms: He was a military asset and a darn important one.\\" We read that in the April 3, 1944 issue of TIME MAGAZINE, Bush was \\"unashamedly lionized.\\" To repeat, in my opinion pages 123-139 and 159-183 of this book should be required reading for every high school student, in part because of its disclosure of engineering advances that enabled the Allies to win the war, but more importantly because of its disclosure of how Dr. Bush overcame \\"human problems\\" such as the stubborn piggishness of Ernest King.OUT OF TOUCH. The final chapters of this book disclose how Dr. Bush became out of touch, as the 1950s progressed. He was out of touch on school integration (page 369), out of touch regarding the US space program (page 390), out of touch regarding the war in Vietnam (page 402), out of touch regarding civilian use of nuclear power (pages 295-309), out of touch in his relations with Truman (page 363), and most unfortunately, out of touch regarding analogue computers versus digital computers (page 400). In the author's words, Bush became, \\"A hero without a cause, he seemed to be against everything\\" (page 380).CRITIQUE. I would have liked a more explicit account of Dr. Bush's role in creating the internet. The book describes Douglas Engelbart (pages 267, 398), and Engelbart's relation with Dr. Bush. But the book does not mention the connections that Bush and Engelbart had with the invention and perfection of the internet. WEAVING THE WEB, by Tim Berners-Lee, as well as other books on the internet, mention the roles of Dr. Bush and of Douglas Engelbart in the creation of the internet. Also, I would have liked the book to include a list of Dr. Bush's patents. I just checked Dr. Bush's patents at www.uspto.gov. To my dismay, Dr. Bush only has two patents. Both of these patents are assigned to MIT. I was expecting him to have at least 50 patents to his name. Oh well! FIVE STARS to this fine book."},{"Title":"Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century","review":"More than one person has written on this page that Vannevar Bush is \\"little known\\", \\"forgotten\\", etc. I am only 54 years old, but I remember seeing Bush's name in print many, many times while growing up.

Of the 3,I found the book by Dan Seemiller the most comprhensive and informative.Before, I had a lot of problems initiating an attack against opponents who utilise heavy underspin pushes and chops. Dan's book helped me master the skill of looping against underspin and thereby allowing me to initiate the attack. I found that a lot of players are not able to counter the spinny arch loop. As a result, I am more confident of my strokes and have moved a couple of rungs above my opponents.I would like to recommend this book to all who wish to improve and perfect their game of Table Tennis."},{"Title":"Winning Table Tennis: Skills, Drills, and Strategies","review":"This book is for players who already know how to play TT.

But this isn't saying much considering this is just the second book I've read and the first was completely useless.I can't remember the title of the first book but it used drawings to demonstrate strokes. The good thing about Winning Table Tennis is that it uses sequences of photographs which is much clearer in demonstrating how to hit a shot.My biggest disappointment was that only about the first third of the book is about teaching table tennis techniques (strokes, footwork etc...). The rest of the book includes segments on warmups, losing weight, carbohydrates, proteins and workouts, which was not entirely relevant for most readers I would have thought...and certainly not the reason I bought the book.Also, in illustrating strokes, any book has to realise that verbal descriptions are not that helpful. Instead, the heart and soul needs to be clear, comprehensive and sequential photographs. You can have a few words but these should not try to be comprehensive but rather just cover a few key points. This book only had photographs for some of the strokes, and the rest were completely written accounts - which wasn't good enough for me.Last gripe. I know that the author Danny Seemiller is a very accomplished table tennis player, and I like his spunk in championing his own grip etc... but I thought the following sentence\\"some elite playes, like J.O.Waldner and the author (Danny Seemiller), use sidespin bocks\\" was too self-serving and arrogant.

However, the author kept emphasizing the effectiviness of enhancing the match results by practicing serves and improving footwork. He did a good job on the chapter about the serves. He explained all the key important placements of the serves for various siturations and effects. For the footwork techniques, the lateral two-step, the up-and-back two-step, the backhand-corner two-step, and the lateral crossover are all covered in pictorial step-by-step details. Readers can easily follow and practice. The author also gave out some tips on tournament tactics, like ball placement, the short game, and varying the spin.

He did this on his own with limited education and equipment. His glass plates remind us of the awe, beauty and wonder of frozen water. The book reveals Bentley's efforts on his Vermont farm over his lifetime. His dedication and creativity help us grasp the complexity, simplicity and three-dimensional images of snow. Snow is the most unstable substance on earth - always changing, even while it is forming in the atmosphere, falling through the atmosphere, depositing on a ground surface (water, soil, fence, glass, trees), sublimating (going directly from a solid to a vapor), hoar frost depositing out of a saturated clear atmosphere at night to produce a fairly land in at sunrise, going through continuous metamorphism (melt-freeze, temperature gradient, equitemperature gradient) and finally melting to return to the liquid form of the hydrologic cycle.Bentley's photographs enable us all to grasp snow from nursery to graduate school - the images all make sense - physically and mentally. Many images have been transformed into ornaments, framed photographs and other high end works of art."},{"Title":"Snowflakes in Photographs (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"The wonderful thing about this book is that Snowflake Bentley actually took these photos.

What sets apart Shanower's graphic novel is the attention to historical detail, a superb talent as an artist, and a powerful flair for storytelling. A Thousand Ships is a gripping presentation perfectly suited to a modern readership and brings this age-old tale to a whole new generation of readers. All the fabled Greek characters are here, from Paris (a Trojan Prince), Helen (whose beauty precipitated the most famous war in Hellenic history); Achilles, Odysseus, Hector, Ajax, and the rest. Focusing on the events that led up to the war, A Thousand Ships is the debut volume in a planned series. If you only have time for a single graphic novel this month, make it Eric Shanower's A Thousand Ships!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Ships : Age of Bronze, Volume One","review":"Even though the Trojan War is one of our oldest stories, almost every generation since Homer has felt the need to retell it in its own way. This new version by Shanower is one of the best in a long, long time. Visually it is spectacular -- he spent a great deal of time studying the ruins of Mycenean Greece, Troy, the Hittites, and so forth to give as accurate a portrayal of the people and places as possible. Gone are the classical fashions, weapons, and architecture... what we have is the real, much earlier bronze age. And the storytelling is fantastic. It's clearly a modern take on the story, but this does not mean the characters speak with hip come-backs or slang. Instead, we see political intrigue, rounded characters, strong women, and a serious attempt to rationalize some of the more outlandish aspects of the story. He draws from Greek, Roman, and medieval sources and manages to weave together a highly informed, vivid reading experience. I started reading this on the suggestion of several accomplished archaeologists, but keep reading because it is so enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Thousand Ships : Age of Bronze, Volume One","review":"Being a Latin scholar, I find myself drawn to all things Classical. Being a teenager, I find myself drawn to the more &quot;slacker&quot;-y things in life. This book combines the two elements perfectly! The book was reccomended to me by my latin teacher, and I read it swiftly in less than one day. My only warning would be the slightly explicit scenes in the book which elicited giggles from my (oh-so-very-mature) AP Latin class."},{"Title":"A Thousand Ships : Age of Bronze, Volume One","review":"I never thought I'd be pleased with a comic book of any kind. I'm just not the type. But after reading great reviews of this project in an archeology magazine, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Yes, it's simple; it's written for young folks. But it's strength lies in its ability to help the reader track the many players in this epic. A straight reading in a standard text can become confusing due to the many characters with unusual names who flit in and out. Here, by adding the concrete pictures, it becomes easier to stay focused on the main themes without getting bogged down by \\"now, who was that again?\\"."},{"Title":"A Thousand Ships : Age of Bronze, Volume One","review":"I have loved ancient history and mythology since I was a wee pup. Unfortunately I found \\"Age of Bronze - A thousand ships\\" somewhat disappointing. The Bronze Age feel to the drawings was interesting but they were not terribly artistic. The quality of the dialogue is fair but way below any classical Greek literature, which helps to make the story drag (quite unlike the original Iliad). The lack of Gods or spirits (as such) also helps to squeeze out the magic. The [explicits] and violence is PG-13. The glossary of names, genealogical chart, and bibliography are very good."},{"Title":"(350) Early Families of Herkimer County, New York : Descendants of the Burnetsfield Patentees","review":"This is a great book! It's jam-packed with solid facts.

I also bought a 2 volume &quot;compendium&quot; which had less than one page on the same family. This book is more focused on fewer families."},{"Title":"(350) Early Families of Herkimer County, New York : Descendants of the Burnetsfield Patentees","review":"This book is excellent for anyone researching family members who lived in Stone Arabia, Fort Plain, German Flats, Schoharie, St. Johnsville and Herkimer, New York, from 1720-1799. The majority of these German speaking families (known as Mohawk Valley Palatines) came to America, in a fleet of 10 ships that left England in 1709 and arrived in New York in 1710. A researcher will not find everything they want/need [example, spouse may be listed but without birth date, birth location or, in the case of a wife, her father's name]; however, the information included in the book far outweighs this disappointment. I highly recommend this book as a great source of historical information of early Palatine families who settled in the Mohawk Valley of New York."},{"Title":"Handbook of Constraint Programming (Foundations of Artificial Intelligence)","review":"This is a survey of the literature that doesn't usually go into enough detail to fully understand a topic, but for high-level overviews and exhaustive references to the literature it's superb.

It's a major update of a book that we had already designed to bring basic photographic instruction into the modern era without leaving the fundamentals behind. It is, unlike most of its competition, a book you can grow with as your photographic skills improve.PHOTOGRAPHY is really a cross between a how-to book and a coffee-table book. That's one reason it costs more than a regular photo handbook: In addition to hundreds of technical illustrations there are dozens of beautifully reproduced, full-page photographs by some of the leading photographers of our time. You'll find photographs by Annie Leibovitz, Joel Meyerowitz, Sebastiao Salgado, Mary Ellen Mark, Joyce Tenneson, James Nachtwey, David LaChapelle, Matthew Rolston, Mark Seliger, and many others representing every kind of photographic discipline you can imagine. These images, which have been substantially updated in this revision, are interspersed throughout the text. PHOTOGRAPHY also features a series of individual profiles of well-known working photographers, heavily illustrated with examples of their work, and a compact, illustrated history of photography by New York Times critic Vicki Goldberg.Why the emphasis on big, high-quality pictures? Because PHOTOGRAPHY is meant to inspire as it teaches.--HENRY HORENSTEIN AND RUSSELL HART"},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"This book by Horenstein and Hart was bought as an introduction to photography. Before I bought it, I looked at numerous other books on photography, but none of them seemed to tell me a lot more than what I already knew. In addition they did not inspire me. I only tell this because my opinion is that this book is what I searched for. It is well written and gives a decent treatment of the different topics. The illustrations are clear, and there are several photos showing the concepts involved, the photos being so good that they also show more subtle effects. And then there are works by various professional photographers all along. These are not just dumped there, but actually fit the topic being treated. The chapter on digital photography is perhaps a little short. However, I would rather by an additional in-depth book on digital photography anyway. This book gives the basis knowledge on how photography evolved and on different techniques. I only wished it had been available in hardback, because the relatively large format makes it somewhat unhandy in paperback."},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"I've been a photo student for nearly two years and this is the textbook I started with. I didn't realize at first how amazing and inspiring it was until I couldn't find it. Horenstein's book is organized and it is easy to read. It covers a great deal and has wonderful images as examples. I enrolled in a photojournalism class last semester and had to purchase Photography (8th ed) by Barbara London & John Upton. I was very dissatisfied with the textbook when remembering how great Horenstein's is. I urge every hopeful photographer to make an investment in this book."},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"I enrolled in a photo one course, having always enjoyed the art form. Not only was this book immensely helpful throughout the course, but I refused to return it at the end of the semester. It doubles as a superb textbook and a lovely coffee table look through. I find myself flipping through it just for entertainment and also to find solutions to camera or developing problems I might be having. I also agree that the only negative aspect of this text is the fact that it doesn't come in hard back. The paper back version becomes awkward, it's best if you read it whilst your sitting up or at a desk. If you're one for pleasure reading in bed, like myself, this book might prove to be a challenge. Other than it's awkward dimensions in paper back, this is a must-have-book for those vaguely interested in the hobby all the way to those who are professional photographers. Hooray for well written books and well constructed page layouts with tremendous photos around every turn!!"},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"I am a photography instructor, and over some twenty five years, have used numerous books as course texts. This one is the most comprehensive and up-to-date text I have ever worked with. I do not teach to a text, and prefer students to use a book as a reference and in tandem with course material. 'Photography' works well in that format, but I also imagine it will work for educators or self-learners as a page-by-page teaching and learning tool. This is, in other words, a great book. However, I think it is absolutely criminal that the same edition has gone from being a little over $50 to over $100 in less than ten years. This is especially troubling as I am sure 'Photography' is now one of the most widely used text books in the country. I understand that production costs and the advent of e-books could be stressing the publishers, but surely, there is little to justify such a high price other than greed. Students, already struggling in a tight economy, are being ripped off. I appeal to this particular publisher to reset their pricing policies and criteria. Do what my institution did: Sewanee (a.k.a. The University of the South) actually reduced its fees by 10% this year as a protest against spiraling trends in college tuition, and ultimately with the hope that this would redraw the tuition-policy landscape nationally.I will not be assigning 'Photography' as a course text this year."},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"I got this book as a present off my wishlist, thankfully getting a used copy instead of at that ripoff price.At this point, the price is a $135!

For anyone with medium to advanced photographic experience, this book will have a lot of pages to skip. However, even for those expert photographers, this book contains a lot of odd technical details that are required for testing for certification (such as for PPA) that you may have forgotten since high school, or that you just may have never learned on your own through self-study and/or trial and error. In short, this book is a valuable reference to have handy for any serious photographer."},{"Title":"Photography: Revised Edition","review":"I didn't really use it much, unfortunately.

I have to say though, that the customer service was good, and they tried to find the solution to my problem."},{"Title":"Lost for the Cause: The Confederate Army in 1864","review":"Civil War writers, researchers, and buffs will find a valuable source about actual Confederate troop strength in Steven Newton's book. Newton's theme is that the claim that the Confederate Army lost in the battles of 1864 due to serious manpower attrition is false. He proceeds to show, army-by-army, department-by-department that the Confederates largely made good their losses in the great battles of 1863 and started the 1864 Campaigns with roughly the same manpower levels that they enjoyed at their high water mark the previous year.Here we get a detailed look at the Confederate Army's manpower in all its component armies, departments and commands. A descriptive narrative and new order of battle, based on the latest information and research, is provided for each organization. Newton's review of troop recruiting and movements within and between commands provides valuable background for perspective writers on Confederate grand strategy.Newton contends that the South lost, at least in large part, due to the poor use and allocation of its troops rather than a lack of men. His case is, in considerable measure, persuasive. His orders of battle, narratives and statistics show where the troops could be found which, when added together, gave Southern commanders approximately the same number of men that they had in 1863. William Marvel, in his recent \\"Lee's Last Retreat\\" takes a similar position by showing that the Confederate troop shortage during the Appomattox Campaign was less than has been believed before.However, it seems that Newton sometimes reached his totals by including assorted collections of backwater troops that would have been of doubtful value in major operations. He fails to sufficiently acknowledge that his 1864 troop counts for the first line armies were often achieved only through the replacement of the high quality veterans lost in 1863 with green recruits and home guard type troops from the Confederacy's interior. I believe that in this sense, the Confederacy did suffer from attrition. Notwithstanding these criticisms, reluctantly made, Newton has provided Confederate military scholars with a wonderful resource. Don't expect dramatic accounts of battles here. But within its specialty it is packed with valuable and interesting information about troop strengths in the various areas and commands of the South. The highly detailed order of battle section, about 175 pages long, alone justifies the price of this book. Readers wanting to learn more about the state of Confederate manpower in the latter part of the war should not miss this book."},{"Title":"Lost for the Cause: The Confederate Army in 1864","review":"I recently read \\"Lost for the Cause: the Confederate Army in 1864\\" by Steven H Newton. This is a very interesting book concerning Confederate manpower. Newton does a superb job of deconstructing the theories of Confederate exhaustion and the Confederate high tide at Gettysburg. It is a widely accepted fact (or opinion) that the Army of Northern Virginia reached its manpower high tide in June 1863. Newton examined the various reports made by commanders in the spring of 1864 and found that the Army of Northern Virginia actually had more men than at Gettysburg. He also found that the Confederate armies as a whole had more men under arms in the spring of 1864 than after the campaigns of 1863. Newton found that many Confederate reports were inaccurate, the commanders themselves admitted so. He did find that the December 31, 1863 report was the most comprehensive. That report lists 233,586 men in the Confederate armies. By June 30, 1864 the numbers have dropped to 161,528. By these numbers it would appear that the Confederacy is indeed falling apart but Newton points out that on that day most of the Confederacy was locked in battle and reports were incomplete. The trans-Mississippi department reports just two sub-districts in Texas, totaling 3,122 men. Two months later a much more complete figure from that department lists 54,790 men, most of which were in the department two months earlier. For the Army of Northern Virginia theJune 1864 count did not include Early's troops in the Valley. By the time complete reports from Early came in he had fought at Monocacy, Kernstown and Moorefield so it is reasonable to assume the 15,363 men he reports in September is a fair estimate (likely low) for June. This is one of the better books I have read in recent years. Part of this book was in a previous issue of North &amp; South magazine. That was an article on Johnston &amp; Hood and how they lost men. That was a good article that talked alot about not only the losses suffered but that Hood benefited from a good hospital service that got men back into ranks (now maybe that was more a result of Johnston's administration and the recovery time, the author never discussed that aspect). Part of the book is also a comprehensive order of battle for the Confederacy which is nice for researchers but is not something you'd normally sit down to read for fun."},{"Title":"Frommer's Thailand","review":"When I went to Thailand last year, I ended up planning most of my trip according to this book.

Edgar Hoover,Broken: The Troubled Past and Uncertain Future of the FBI, andG-Men: Hoover's FBI in American Popular Culture. He begins the Prologue to this 1995 book by citing President Reagan's famous June 12, 1987 speech in Berlin, where he proclaimed, \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\" Powers observed, \\"Reagan was reaffirming his solidarity with a long line of anticommunists... By the late 1980s the convictions that had brought Reagan to the Berlin Wall were known to few except the anticommunists themselves, their original force tarnished and obscured by bitter memories of Joe McCarthy, the John Birch Society, and now Oliver North. To recover this anticommunist tradition we must peel away the accretions of time to encounter the first Americans drawn into that century-long struggle.\\"He states that the \\"smokescreen of lies\\" that was created by anticommunists about communism \\"made it hard for anyone to believe that the danger of communism was anything except a figment of the paranoid imagination.\\" (Pg. 91) When Sidney Hook and John Dewey protested against the \\"show trials\\" of the Stalin era, liberals and \\"fellow travelers\\" such as Corliss Lamont signed an \\"Open Letter to American Liberals\\" defending the trials as valid, and attacking Hook and Dewey (Pg. 143).After Alger Hiss was convicted of perjury, countersubversives \\"had their proof, and they could use Hiss's conviction to lend credibitility to their most outlandish red web fantasies.\\" (Pg. 225) Concerning McCarthy's infamous list of 205 names \\"that were made known to the Secretary of State and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department,\\" Powers observes that \\"There was no list of 205 names, nor of 57, nor of any number. The figure 205 was the result of slightly faulty arithmetic. Secretary of State James Byrnes had written ... that 285 security risks had been located... and 79 had been fired. After subtraction, the remainder, 206, mistakenly became McCarthy's 205 in the speech.\\" (Pg. 239)He later notes that \\"The extreme radical right was melting down in the heat of insane power struggles... The John Birch Society membership now consumed their energies attacking each other over real or fancied insults... During the 1980 presidential campaign some Birch Society members attacked the Society for not seeing that Reagan was 'an absolute fraud, created and promoted by the Conspiracy... as a prelude to the final takeover.'\\" (Pg. 356)He concludes on the note, \\"The heroes of the defeat of communism, Solzhenitsyn, Havel, Russians, Czechs, Poles---all have honored American anticommunists' stand against communism. Honored abroad, however, in their own country they are still without honor.\\" (Pg. 429)This book is a wonderful, and well-balanced history of this now-almost forgotten era."},{"Title":"Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism","review":"This book is a history of American anti-communism from 1917 to 1991.

Mr. Powers conclusion is the bad does not stain the good and that American anti-communism was a positive force in the world, helping to free millions from the communist nightmare."},{"Title":"Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism","review":"Richard Gid Powers' book on the history of anticommunism offers valuable insights about the problems that plagued the movement. Because of the misdeeds of Herbert Hoover, anticommunism came across as a movement indifferent to civil liberties. Because of the misdeeds of the counter subversive wing of the movement, anticommunism came across as a bunch of crazy kooks who saw a spy wherever they looked, something out of the X-Files. Because the smear tactics of the Dies Committee and Joe McCarthy, anticommunism was viewed in negative terms. But the story doesn't end here. It includes the principled leadership of Scoop Jackson, the intellectual legwork offered by the folks at Commentary Magazine and yes, the anticommunists in the American labor movement. His treatment of Whittaker Chambers does not demonize FDR, but shows the pragmatic choices Roosevelt had to make during World War II.Powers unearths a lot of material and tells the story in a straightforward manner. Really impressive.Many of the insights he provides in this book are readily applicable to the movement opposed to Islamism in the United States and the West. Very valuable."},{"Title":"Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism","review":"I read this book several years ago, and it has stuck with me ever since. The struggle against communism was waged by good Americans from all walks of life and all political persuasions...including the vastly unappreciated and much maligned Joe McCarthy (Yes, Joe McCarthy!), and even some devoted socialists, too! For anyone who denies that communism posed a dire threat to our nation, read this book - it's excellent. If I had to offer one criticism, I'd say that it's a bit dense, and at times difficult to read, but ultimately worth it."},{"Title":"Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism","review":"I bought this book in the mistaken belief that the author might have something to add to the debate. Boy, was I wrong. I gave him one star for excellence in pagination.Powers attempts to sort out the good anti-communists from the lunatic fringe (Hoover, McCarthy, Martin Dies, the Hearst Press etc.) and thus demonstrate that the anti-communist effort of the 40s and 50s was actually a positive good discredited only by the excesses of the fringe. The problem is that he himself can't sort them out, or even maintain his own premise. By the end of the book he's lamenting the demise of the very extremists he attacked in the beginning of the book as giving anti-communism a bad name!He then goes on to claim, most strangely, that the fall of McCarthy (which effectively happened in 1954) silenced anti-communism in America, and that Eisenhower discouraged such for fear of reawakening McCarthyism -- as if it ever had been asleep, as if Eisenhower himself was not responsible for some of the worst excesses, including the tightening of Truman's infamous Loyalty and Security program, and the mass arrests of party leaders on grounds that were tossed out by the supreme court(but no doubt the court was a bunch of commies anyway).What becomes evident (certainly in the last of the book) is that Powers himself suffers from the very malaise he is attempting to save anticommunism from. He condemns Kennedy for abandoning the struggle as a &quot;holy war&quot; and rationally viewing it as power struggle; Carter and Nixon become &quot;appeasers&quot;; and anti-anti-communists are responsible for the debacle of Vietnam. He then extolls Norman Podhoretz, a rabid extremist if there ever was one, in terms befitting a demi-god:&quot;the one man with the will, the strength, the imagination to commence the giant task of rebuilding the anticommunist coalition,&quot; (for a moment I thought I was reading a love scene by Ayn Rand). He even, most bizarrely, gives partial credit to Podhoretz for winning the Cold War, and condemns George F. Kennan, the author of our containment policy and a most honorable anti-communist, as an appeaser and villain.I'd return this book if I could, but in my disgust I've thrown it against the wall too many times. There were honorable opponents of Communism in those days -- those who believed in the marketplace of ideas and not repression -- but it remains unclear if this author could recognize one."},{"Title":"Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism","review":"Many myths about communism died when the USSR fell into the ash heap of history. The opening of Soviet archives revealed the extent of many of the myths. We know now that Moscow financed and controlled the Communist Party USA. The idea that Americans who joined that party could be independent is a lie. They did what Stalin wanted done. Most of the American communists who betrayed the US were members of the CPUSA and revered Stalin. The Rosenbergs, who stole US atom bomb secrets for delivery to Moscow, were members of the CPUSA. The A bomb that Stalin tested was an exact copy of the one the US developed- no accident. The possession of the bomb gave Stalin the confidence to approve the invasion of South Korea by the communist North, a war that cost the US 50,000 lives. Many Americans fought communism but too often US liberals characterized them as the real enemy instead of the Communists. Not Without Honor is highly recommended reading for anyone who can accept the truth. I also recommended Venona, messages Moscow sent its US agents in the late 1940's and The Black Book of Communism, a detailed history of what Communism gave the world- 100 million murders of innocent people. Today many liberals act the way they did with respect to communism. They downplay the threat of terrorism and play up the \\"threat\\" to our civil liberties by those who fight terror. Some people never learn. One man who did learn was Ronald Reagan, who started out as a liberal Democrat and then learned to think accurately. To my regret I never voted for him- I was then a liberal Democrat and half-blind."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"Purchased the book and within three days received it.

I was fortunate that my father allowed me to read anything I desired. As a child in the early 1940's I didn't know what a lesbian was and had to ask my father. He explained that they were women who prefered the compamy of other women. I could understand that and it was enough of an explanation for a 12 year old. Over the last 50+ years I have often returned to the book. I am, in fact, on my third copy. I am heterosexual, a widow, mother of four, grandmother of nine. It took me many readings to realize why I identified with the character in the book. It is the relationship between the girl and her parents and not the sexual aspect, that drew me. I reccommend this book to anyone interested in family dynamics. Many of us have experienced loneliness, the feeling of not &quot;fitting in&quot;, of not conforming, not measuring up to someone else's ideals and this is why I consider this book timeless. Sure, it is dated both in dialogue and in the experience of homosexuals today but that doesn't negate to feelings expressed in the book."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I read this book 50 years ago and was enraptured with it. I am a male, and at the time of reading, a U.S. Marine who should have been decidely against any form of deviation. But when I read the book, I was so greatly impressed with the pathos of the writer and the beauty of the writing, that I wanted no else in my immediate acquaintence to see this book and possibly ridicule it. You see, I was aboard ship with a battalion of fellow Marines and I knew that such a book would find nothing but patent denigration by &quot;all hands.&quot; So,I read the book to last page of this beautiful book, closed it, and with tears in my eyes, dropped it into the Mediterranean Sea. I've never forgotten this book in all these years."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"This book is to be recommended not only to the lesbian or &quot;invert,&quot; but to all sensitive souls who have felt themselves &quot;outcast from life's feast,&quot; to borrow from Joyce. The prose itself is rich and beautiful as few books are today, and if this style is long winded as one reviwer has dubbed it, then modern literary culture needs to open its doors to let in some fresh air, regardless of the season. This style of this book, oddly, resembles more than anything that of the contemporary &quot;straight&quot; Bildungsroman by Thomas Wolfe-Look Homeward, Angel. But Hall is more effective at bringing home &quot;the pain of all beauty&quot; and I found myself laying the book down several times to wipe the salty blur from my eyes, such is its poignancy. The storyline and character, oddly again, of Hall's book and of her protagonist Stephen Gordon remind me of nothing so much as Rousseau in his Confessions. Yet, these similarities should not be surprising after all. All three were sensitive geniuses who suffered much through their own spiritual tenderness.-This book is for all who have felt, like Hall and Stephen, &quot;...like a soul that wakes up to find itself wandering, unwanted, between the spheres.&quot;-Or as Shelley would have it in his fragment &quot;To The Moon,&quot; &quot;Art thou pale for weariness of climbing heaven and gazing on Earth, wandering companionless?&quot;-It will ease your struggle and perhaps bring you rest."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"The first thing I noticed about Radclyffe Hall's \\"The Well of Loneliness,\\" was the beautiful descriptive exposition. Before the novel delves too far into modernism, it is apparent that it is hedging out the Victorian. Descriptions of the English countryside, of London and of Paris are some of the finest written in English. Not only this but the painstaking care the Hall takes to describe her characters, though even Stephen remains a bit fuzzy to me, are lovely and purposeful. Her sense of loss, loneliness and love are extremely powerful and extremely well conveyed.That being said, the bravery it took to write the first English- language novel that addressed \\"invertedness,\\" in Stephen's case butch-lesbian identity and, overall, homosexuality, is incredible. It is hard to be absolutely disappointed with the author for the ending of the novel, particularly since it seems to be semi-authobiographic. Given the time period, the ending was likely collateral in exchange for being published. Without giving it away, I'll simply add that I felt sad for the world and defiant, and these not unexpected emotions after a 500 page journey that included happiness and hope, depseration and anxiety. To be cliche, it reminds one of how far we've come with civil rights and yet how very far we still must go.Like some of fellow modernist writer Fitzgerald's characters, Hall's character is wealthy and priveledged and yet likeable. One is inclined to empathize with her situation at most points, and when not, it is easy to become enraged at the world and not Stephen. It's amazing that book was published in the late 20's, and yet problems like those the characters encountered in \\"The Well of Loneliness\\" still exist -- we are still fighting to be able to \\"protect\\" and \\"provide security\\" to those we love.This book is an amazing journey. If it is slow moving, it is only because it encompasses over 30 years, years which are necessary to fully understanding the social world that \\"freaks\\" like us are still only allowed limited access to. This is worth reading no matter what type of outcast you consider yoursel to be. There is much comfort even in feeling one is not alone. So, thanks, Radclyffe."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"The Well of Loneliness is called the first undisguised lesbian novel in the English language, which makes it required reading for a women's studies class or scholarly lesbians. Yet, though written in 1928, it is still relevant to all people interested in issues of inclusiveness and diversity. Also, with its arguments based on Christian morality, it should get serious consideration by the religious right before they condemn homosexuality.The novel is a fictionalized biography of a lesbian born in the 1890s to a well-to-do couple on a country estate in England. They were desiring a son and name their only daughter Stephen, the name they had selected for their heir. Her mother finds it difficult to get close to this girl whose favorite game is dressing up as Admiral Nelson, but her father treats her like the son he was denied. He teaches her horseback riding, and takes her on the local fox hunts where she excels.Yet as she reaches puberty and young adulthood, her mannish behavior and dress starts to cause her problems. But this is Victorian England and certain things are just not spoken about, so Stephan grows up ignorant of what she is and how society feels about people like her. When her father dies her protection from the prejudices of society also disappear. She is ostracised and eventually forced out of her home by her mother.This isn't an easy book to read. With such a title, you know that it isn't going to be a lot of fun. Yet Hall wonderfully represents Stephen's life and the adversity she faces because of a situation beyond her control. She argues that \\"Inversion\\" is natural because lesbians exist in nature. Since nature is God's creation, so are lesbians and all other inverts of society. She is morally strong and wants to take her inherited place in society, but is blocked by mean-spirited and close-minded people. The book would be like Pride and Prejudice if there was only one daughter and she was gay.The social turmoil and change in society that takes place because of World War I is well portrayed by the author. Stephen becomes an ambulance driver in France, and stays on in Paris seeking a community of like-minded people. Yet even there she cannot find peace and acceptance.This is an important book because it takes a serious look at the role of gay people in society. All the issues that face this community today are raised by Radclyffe Hall. Social and religious condemnation, internalized oppression, and even the question of gay marriage are all addressed in clear and persuasive prose. The style is a bit formal and introspective, yet this glimpse into the individual is superbly portrayed and excellently developed. I found it slow moving, but with great emotional and intellectual impact."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"Regardless of one's orientation, this work should be read - if for no other reason, to ensure oneself that we all are, most beautifully, outside the mold, whether it's in our sexuality or in our particular preferences for coffee or tea. An extremely insightful view of class division, of the courage (and grief)in living one's beliefs, and for those who have been there, a description of the Midlands that one can reach out and touch."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"If there were a dictionary of queer literature Radclyffe Hall would certainly have a place, somewhere between \\"Hall, Maurice\\" and \\"Hallward, Basil\\". She deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel. She does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one.When I started reading this book I thought I was going to like it a lot more than I did in the end; I thought Stephen as a child was an adorable little gentleman and I liked the relationship between her parents and how it influenced her life. When I reached her first girlfriend, however, a married woman named Angela Crossby, I was at the edge of the abyss without knowing it.I realize this book is a product of its time, but never in my life have I heard so many cliches and stereotypes about lesbians - sorry, inverts - from a woman who was a lesbian herself. Inverts have terrible nerves. Inverts wrongly cling to religion. A \\"real\\" female invert is masculine and a \\"real\\" male invert is feminine, whereas their \\"normal\\" lovers are truly heterosexual.More drama and angst are crammed into the last few chapters of the book than I would have thought possible, and the ending - which I will not reveal - comes out of nowhere and contradicts the personalities of Stephen and her lover Mary as they have been previously established. Anyone with an interest in queer literature should read this to satisfy their curiousity, and to deepen their appreciation for better-written and more realistic fiction. Someone who wants a good novel with an intense romance should not."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"~I'm not quite sure whether to love of despise this book. It's so wrong in it's truthfulness and yet seems so dellusional. I mean being a lesbian I know how it feels and I can understand the fact that this story takes place it the very beginning of 20th century when the society was a lot less tolerate of homosexuals than now, but still it seems to me that Radclyffe Hall sometimes exaggerated the feelings of loneliness and despair felt by Stephen. Still in other moments during the book one is~~ made to wonder how some things still haven't changed while so many others have during the course of all these years. Some of the emotions the author describes are infinitly truthful. The one thing I would definitely change though is the ending because it just serves to add to the despair and show that so called &quot;normalicy&quot; (and many people still think of it this way) should always prevail in this world. I knew what was coming for many chapters ahead of the actual ending and yet couldn't~~ help but cry when I finally finished reading the last words.~"},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"If you're studying lesbian literature, obscenity trials or queer history in general, this book has unfortunately become foundation stuff and might be worth trawling through. If you're a young dyke just starting to read queer writing, it'll just make you feel hopeless and there are far better writers around. Radclyffe Hall may have been a pioneer and a martyr, and she does at least get marks for courage considering the atmosphere of the time, but as a writer she was mediocre (and apparently as a person she was a nasty piece of work).Admittedly, the book is very much a product of its time. Sexual orientation was little understood, gender dysphoria even less so, and Hall appears to have got muddled up between the two. There is a mild stab at scientific explanation (Stephen's parents long for a boy, give her a boy's name, treat her as a boy to a certain extent - and surprise surprise, she grows up to like girls and dress as a man), and a very clear line drawn between \\"inverts\\" and \\"normals\\" that will make anyone grit their teeth long before they come to the depressing way in which Stephen \\"heroically\\" solves her final dilemma. The depiction of the relatively \\"normal\\" women Stephen loves as properly girly creatures, who are swayed by the perils of Sapphic passion but are still Real Women underneath, contains some pretty unpleasant stereotypes about bisexuals and \\"femme\\" women, and the characterisation throughout neither arouses sympathy in the reader nor particularly convinces.Despite the obscenity trial, there is nothing scandalous in this book beyond the idea that a woman could love women: the dirtiest it gets is the all-concealing line, \\"...And that night they were not divided.\\" (Sorry if that's a spoiler, but as a friend of mine said, \\"You mean I've read hundreds of pages about her miserable childhood for *that*?\\")If you want lesbian sex, there are plenty of writers offering that sort of thing these days, and some of them even write about it well (Emma Donoghue, for instance, who is, incidentally, a vivid, moving and very funny writer). If you're after lesbian literature of that period, go to Virginia Woolf and co. (there are also some excellent anthologies, such as the \\"Penguin Book of Lesbian Short Stories\\" and \\"Chloe Plus Olivia\\", that take a literary-historical perspective). If you simply want a well-written book about love between women, again there is far better on offer: the previous two writers and also the likes of Jane Rule and Alice Walker. And if you're interested in transsexuality and the boundaries between genders (not to mention the people who fall in the middle), I can recommend Anna Livia's \\"Bruised Fruit\\" and Rose Tremain's \\"Sacred Country\\". Spare yourself this."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"i just translated the book into chinese so i guess i did some pretty close reading :). while the novel is undoubtedly a milestone in the history of english literature, lesbian culture, and the battle against censorship, its literary merits leave something to be desired. radclyffe hall's prose is ornate and even over-dramatizing at times, and i find the frequent insertion of french phrases and sentences redundant and affected. the situations and emotions are relevant, poignant, and often depicted with insight, but because the mood and the tone of the narrative is so persistently intensive it does tend to get tedious after a while--which can be well before one finishes the book.it seems quite obvious that stephen gordon, the heroine (or should i say hero?) of the book, would never have questioned the moral conventions and gender roles of her times, had she not been born to be what she was--in short, a male soul trapped inside a female body (though hall, true to her style, never just says so). for she totally identified herself with a (upper-class) society of so-called respectability, honor, refinement, etc., which constitutes a mentality not really, uh, let's say &quot;progressive&quot;. while crying out against the outrage against and persecution of lesbians and gays, stephen remained disconcertingly vague in her attitude toward effeminate males (such as the character jonathan brockett), feeling much more at ease with and indeed seeking the acceptance of straight (and presumably manly) men. i'm not exactly saying that it's &quot;reactionary&quot; to long for the very &quot;secure and happy&quot; life of &quot;the normal&quot;, but how she--and i wonder if also the author--repeatedly projected heterosexual marriage to be is way too idealized and dangerously so, not pausing for even one moment to reflect on what outrage and persecution that sort of marriage could also and did often turn out to be for perfectly &quot;normal&quot; women. one can't help feeling that she thought everything would've been just so fine, if only and only if she had been a man!so, while trying not to be anachronistic in my judgment of the novel and the characters in it, i suggest that it be carefully read *in context*, historically and ideologically."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"Ok this book isn't for everyone, but then what book is?

Its a hard read but if you keep an open mind, it is worth it."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I found &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; to be a very interesting &amp; affecting tale. I stumbled across the book in a used bookshop. My hardback copy was a 17th printing from 1933. So since the book was written in 1928, it had to have created quite a sensation to go through 17 printings in its first 5-years. When I bought this, I thought it was about paramedics in the early part of the last century. Of course, with Stephen Gordon's experiences during World War I, it was about paramedics, but not primarily as I soon realized.I found the writing to hold up remarkably well. The characters are fleshed enough to resonate. Sir Philip's love for his daughter and mother Anna's reserve and lack of attachment set the stage for a somewhat confusing childhood for Stephen Gordon. Bring to the picture her tutor Puddle who identifies with Stephen's struggle and understands her even before Stephen does, and add the flighty Angela Crossby as her first love interest against a backdrop of unfriendly townspeople; and Hall creates a quite interesting dynamic of unrequited love and betrayal. With Rafferty, she even writes a wonderful horse character! After Stephen's removal from Morton, the family estate, she begins a period of increasing self-sufficiency, assisted by the luxury of relative financial security from her father, and becomes a writer. The years in Paris after the war are an interesting period, peopled with more interesting characters from the parties and circles of outcasts. I found the subplot of the love relationship between Jamie and Barbara to be intensely dramatic, climaxed by Jamie's last act of despair. As for Stephen's letting go of her true love for that love's happiness, it was a rather sad ending. All in all, this is a novel that stands up as important for its sociological implications. It makes one long for a culture in which the pursuit of happiness is respected to be as individual as it is essential for all women and men."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I loved the way this book was written. It is haunting, bittersweet, sad and beautiful. The only thing I did not agree with was Stephen's forced choice at the end of the book. I did not feel it was her choice to make but I understand why she made it- out of deep love."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"While I find Hall's prose less than perfect, her take on lesbian life from childhood to adolescence to adulthood is realistic emotionally.

When the child arrives, Anna is dispirited when she gives birth to a girl. Sir Phillip makes the most of it, but still decides to give her the name they'd already chosen: Stephen. And so enters into the world one of the most astonishing creatures of literary fiction.Young Stephen knows that she's different from the other children, but her father, noticing her difference also, allows her to grow up her own way: riding horses like a young man, sometimes dressing like a young boy. From a young age to her lae thirties, we watch as Stephen discovers herself, longing to love and to fit into a society that will not accept her or others like her. She puts her feelings into words, becoming a successful author and does find love, but that love is put to the test when someone who can offer her beloved acceptance steps into the picture.An astonishing book for its time that was banned upon initial publication, openly discussing what was considered taboo with much candor and respect. The characters of Radclyffe Hall's novel deal with the same societal pressures and beliefs which are still prevalent today: same-sex marriage, societal roles of male and female, wanting to fight for one's country during a time of war even when that country doesn't want you because of who you are.

She had to make a constant effort to endure misunderstanding, intolerance and ostracism -- all because of her sexuality. &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; is a classic tale of lesbian love, but 1928 was to prove an unfortunate year for Hall to issue this powerful &quot;crie de coeur.&quot; Like D. H. Lawrence's &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot; a few years later, Hall's novel was banned as obscene after a lengthy and infamous trial. Despite this, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; commands our attention as we watch the lesbian protagonist Stephen Gordon -- a nonconformist, deviant, or to use Hall's own phrase, an &quot;invert&quot; -- stagger so beautifully and chaotically close to the edge of life. In Hall's story, Sir Philip and Lady Gordon crave a son and heir to Morton Hall. Strangely, when their only child is a girl, they name her Stephen. But Stephen's upbringing is a little unorthodox -- she learns to ride, fence and hunt, all so-called masculine pursuits, and before long she recognizes that she is being treated as an outsider by the people of Great Malvern. She stays away from society parties, resists all attempts at heterosexual courtship and, gradually, begins to fell the pain of isolation, venturing to understand herself in quasi-biblical terms as &quot;one of those whom God marked on the forehead...like Cain.&quot; Like a raven circling the heart, the social pressures become too much for Stephen. She sets sail for Paris. Without divulging the rest of this tender plot, I will close by saying that I read the last page of this novel and found myself recalling Oscar Wilde, another British homosexual who died of a broken heart, and the pertinent inscription on his tomb in Paris: &quot;And alien tears will fill for him/Pity's long-broken urn/For his mourners will be outcast men/And outcasts always mourn.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I am usually a fast reader, however, it has taken me about a week to finish this book, simply because after reading a few pages, I begin to think about some of the deeper questions asked in the novel. It almost makes me sick to have graduated college, I think this book would be a great discussion piece in some of the literature/ sexual identity classes I took. I think this novel is important for everyone to read."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"When I was first coming out, I happened to stumble across this book. It was wonderful to identify with the main character and feel not so alone, like someone else had felt the same way I did. I also became more grateful for the differences in society today."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"When I picked up this book, it was simply because it was from 1928 (yes, I got a 1st edition!) and was sitting the in gay/lesbian literature section of the local used book store. I've been looking into late 1800 and early 1900 lesbain literature for a while because it seems to be generally more well-written then the more recent novels.Earlier in the month I had read \\"Wild Heart: A Life\\" by Suzanne Rodriguez which is about Natalie Barney and her adventures in the early 1900s. Imagine my surprise when the main character, Stephen Gordon, began resembling Natalie! I was entralled in this novel. You can put it down or pick it up, but no matter what it has withstood the test of time, and it depicted a very real life for lesbians in the early 1900s.I would reccommed this book along with \\"Wild Heart: A Life\\" to anyone interested in the experiences of homosexuals in the past."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"What a sad book. Unlike the other reviewers on this site I think it's very well written. After reading this book I couldn't help but think what it would have been like to live in a world as conservative as it was then - actually the world even 50 years ago. It really makes you think that life is pretty short and there's not enough time to waste on hate - especially for something that's such a non-issue as sexual preference."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I was a late-bloomer to Ms.Hall\`s novel. I was given the paperback by an &quot;ex&quot; 12 years ago. She said to me as our relationship ended, &quot;Read this Sean! It sounds like your life!&quot; And so I read about the tormented Stephen coming to turns with his/her gender and sexuality. Brought into the world with a silver spoon and cared for by a &quot;favorite&quot; nanny. Never quite fitting in with ones peers and yet having numerous friends of both sexes. A mother who resented her husband\`s devotion to you and a sister who fit in perfectly. It could be anyone\`s story or no one\`s. But it does reflect the times, then and now. If you have ever felt &quot;different&quot; in your life, a round peg trying to fit in a square peg world or are &quot;accepted&quot; as is. This is your novel."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I found this book difficult to get through at times, but when ever I thought about when it was published I just kept going. I'm glad that I finished it. It is an important milestone in the publication of literature focusing on a realistic lesbian relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially lesbians. It gives one an idea of how far we have come in achieving equal rights for everyone regardless of sexual orientation. We still have a long way to go, but we need to keep in mind where we have been."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I read this book decades ago, I think I was in my teens, and was immediately caught up in it. I never once thought, either before or after I read it, that is was in any way \\"dated\\" (never did understand that complaint; a book written in the past is a product of the time it was written, obviously) the term \\"queer literature\\" I also found somewhat offensive and demeaning; to label any book with this reference is misleading and does not do the book justice in any way. Why relegate any book to a category of \\"queer literature?\\" Makes no sense. It is, simply, a book about a young woman who falls in love with another young woman and according to the social mores of the time, finds herself totally ostracized by her own family and so creates a new world of friends, a surrogate family circle comprised of people less censorious of her natural feelings. Also, criticising Hall's style as \\"unrefined\\" and \\"cheesy,\\" reflects more on the reading level/comprehension of the reviewer than it does on the abilities of Ms. Hall.Any work that comes from the heart, as this one so plainly does, should be read and appreciated in that context.As to comparison to other authors who write in similar veins, well, every writer is different, and this brings in the 3 blind men and the elephant parable.In my opinion, Ms. Hall is a fine writer, and her book very moving, even today, and if it weren't so, then no one would either be aware of or dicuss her book written so many years ago. It would be interesting to see which of today's writers will still be talked about some 70 plus years hence.The characters, the settings and the situations were all unique and I have seldom come across any book that compares to the heart and genuine pathos of \\"The Well of Loneliness.\\" So all you armchair critics take note: Write a book yourself and see how you fare; it is not as easy as you might suppose, but is really a labor of love and takes a lot of hard work, thought and emotion, and when real emotion and heartfelt pain are dismissed as \\"cheesy,\\" then we are all in trouble."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"It was excatly what a friend told me about this book (read title) that made me wonder and hunt for the book. I read each page with great zest and was engrossed by it until I finshed the last line. I must say it is truely a classic. It is timeless.Through the words of Halls, it is like a journey with her back in time. From a lesbian point of view, on how she (Stephen Gordon) faced the society and like-wise, how the society sees her. The battle of acceptance and other issues along the way. Radclyffe Hall wrote it as fictional tale, not a autobiography even though many would still view so."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"This book should be a must read for everyone. It is the story of a lesbian coming of age in the early 20th century who realizes early on that the love she feels for others is a love that will forever set her apart from the world in which she lives. Even within her own family, her father accepts her but cannot vocalize his acceptance of her sexual orientation, while her mother, feeling estranged from her daughter since birth for reasons she cannot pinpoint, eventually outright rejects the daughter when she learns the truth.As devastating as the facts of the story are, the awareness of the girl at an early age- and the undeniable reality that this character speaks for thousands upon thousands of girls worldwide, since of all eternity- makes the emotions and struggles described vividly real and painful. She cannot love because to do so is to risk ridicule and contempt from society, directed at both herself and whomever she loves.As Stephen (the purposefully \\"masculine\\" named female character) matures and enters the real world apart from her isolated English manor, she meets other lesbians and eventually finds a small community of like minded souls that helps her come to terms with her own identity. Unfortunately, this insular society is not strong enough to change the world nor successfully repel the hate that it directs towards those who are 'different', and thus even when Stephen does find real love with someone willing to shoulder the burden that such a love entails, she is unable to protect that special relationship from those who want to destroy it.This is a powerful book. Depressing, yes, but in a way that no matter how enlightened you may think you are, opens your eyes and hearts to the silent struggles of countless thousands, if not millions. Lesbian fiction, yes, but more importantly, it is human fiction, about the search for love that we all undertake."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"With only heterosexuality as a guide, and lacking the modest freedom that male homosexuals were able to enjoy (usually as long as they did their duty by marrying), what is a woman to do when she longs to be with other women, in love and life? How can she not imagine herself at times to be male, queer, and alienated?I know many woman who won't read this book in spite of its historic importance, and it's always becaues they can't sympathize with the world view that Hall herself endured. When we can actually marry one another in some countries it is hard to understand why Hall only appeals for pity, for understanding and approval from the mainstream, mostly male society. But where else could she look? There was no &quot;community&quot; she could count on, no open lesbians in government to trust.I think if this book is read with the historical context firmly in mind, it is possible then to see the brilliance of the writing and the passion of the story."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"About the Book:Stephen Gordon was never what you would consider a normal girl. Even at a young age, she dressed up as a man and took up hobbies such as fencing s tale, we follow her on an emotional journey as Stephen takes on the hardships of being an outcast.ReviewI was originally recommended this novel by my room mate, and I have to say I am glad she did. I, honestly, would have not picked this up by blurb alone, allowing myself to miss out on a wonderful read. Accredited as being a lesbian novel, part of me would have to disagree for it read more like a transgender novel to me. However, there are still plenty of relations between women, and it sure didn't make the book any less moving. Hall pens a brilliant tale that leaves your heart aching.This novel also seems to be known as a romance. Yes, there are romantic affairs, but the main lover isn't even introduced until about three fifths of the way in. If anything, I would say that this book journeys through the soul, not just the heart. I believe it is also important to note that even if you are not gay or trans, this book still speaks to the soul, especially to anyone who has felt like an outsider.Not only does the author do a phenomenal job of conveying emotions (which personally had me on the verge of tears), but Hall also lays out beautiful prose. Plus, her characters, even the minor ones, easily have a life of their own so that I wasn't only feeling for Stephen but others as well.Now although I gave this five stars, I would say it ought to be a 4.5. This is because Hall ended up writing a fair amount of French into her novel, causing me to either miss sentences (or at one point an entire conversation) or having to constantly translate the language. If it was just a few times, that would be different, but it happened more often than I cared for. However, even with this drawback, the emotion and message came through quite clearly. Another thing I disliked was Hall had a habit of changing focus from one character to another, which left often times confused and having to reread. I would also like to point out that since this was written in the 1920's, the writing may seem stilted and slow to some. However, I found this a brilliant and riveting reading experience that captured me both emotionally and mentally."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"I came across this book last year looking for banned books to read and have on hand for my family. Two copies are in my home and both have been opened and read. From the beginning I felt a deep understanding of how the main character, Stephen, was feeling as a \\"sexual invert\\" or lesbian. There are many circumstances in the book that made me wish I could reach into the pages and intervene. Because, of the connection I had with the character, I put the book down often. The author captured the pain and wonderment of her situation well."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"This is such a fantastic book. I bought it and read it for a literature class for school; otherwise, I probably would never have come across it. It's not a perfect book - it can get a little long-winded, but it's such a wonderful examination of gender and social status in the 20's.Don't get into it expecting to fall in love with the main character, though. Stephen is not a character, but a real, flawed person who deals with sexual confusion and gender dysphoria like most of us - that is, badly. Couple that with the time period, the early twentieth century, and you have a very realistic portrayal of a person born a girl, given a boys name, and essentially raised with male-driven hobbies by her father, but socially expected to conform to the feminine standards of the time. Stephen is not a saint, and she/he doesn't always treat people very well, but his/her struggles with gender and sexuality gives you, the reader, a sense of the difficulty that people had when psychologists labeled homosexuality a mental illness."},{"Title":"The Well of Loneliness","review":"What a great piece of literature - she was a tortured woman who conveyed that on paper.

In fact I had to force myself to finish the book. I only gave it 2 stars based on the historic information and the fact that I have in the past enjoyed her books. And there is the fact that I have visited several locations mentioned in the book.I have read the other book in this series and loved them, in fact kept them on my shelf. The characters in this book were so hard to like. Especially Jasmine. What a little brat. Here she had a man that cared for her despite all of her faults. Her headstrong ways kept getting her into trouble and she kept hoping for Falcon to come to her rescue. Of course each time he came to her rescue what thanks did he get? More spoiled, selfish, and nasty attitude. In fact he probably should of just let her get a taste of what she deserved!Don't let this one book put you off Virginia Henley. If you want to read a good book by her check out &quot;A Year and A Day&quot; or &quot;A Woman of Passion&quot;, and &quot;The Marriage Prize&quot;.

As a matter of fact, the one time she did get hit I found myself nodding in agreement. Sad."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"The first in Henley's Plantagenet trilogy (The Falcon and the Flower, The Dragon and the Jewel and The Marriage Prize), this story is set in the late 12th century, beginning in 1199 just as King Richard I (\\"the Lion Heart\\") is slain in France and his youngest brother, John (the runt of the Plantagenet litter), takes the throne of England.Jasmine, the sheltered love child of King Richard's half brother, the Earl of Salisbury, has been raised by her maternal grandmother who is a \\"white witch\\" and hates men. A delicate flower physically, Jasmine has vowed that no man will ever rule her heart. One day she sees the face of a dark knight in her crystal ball, and later, encountering him at Stonehenge, thinks he's the Devil. When her father betroths her to the same knight, Falcon de Burgh, she hopes to resist the marriage. In a bargain with Falcon, she is allowed to be lady in waiting to the young Queen Isabella. It is there that King John takes a fancy to Jasmine, coveting her virginity for himself. His plan is to wed her to one of his noblemen and then take his pleasure as he does with the other ladies at court. But Falcon will come to her rescue and force her to wed for her protection.This story kept me reading late into the night. There are many twists and turns and both Jasmine and Falcon treat each other badly as they resist the call of true love. As always, Henley masterfully weaves in history as she serves up a lusty tale with wonderful characters. I recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was by comparison to others of hers I rate higher.If you like to read books in date order, here is the Plantagenet trilogy with the other books Henley wrote about the same time in chronological order:* The Falcon and the Flower (1989) - late 12th century/early 13th* The Dragon and the Jewel (1991) - 13th century* The Marriage Prize (2000) - 13th century* The Raven and the Rose (1987) - 15th century* The Hawk and the Dove (1988) - 16th century* The Pirate and the Pagan (1990) - 17th centuryAnd, if you want Scotland's side of the story, you can read her wonderful Kennedy Clan books, both set in the 16th century after the events of The Raven and The Rose:* Tempted (1992)* The Border Hostage (2001)"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"having read most of your books ms henley i have come to this conclusion especially after this one your talent in writing male leads is excellent even secondary males but for the life of me your females lack in all sense of the word come across as very immature in this book right to the end she was cold in soul and body you almost feel for the other women in the story who though mean show more fire than she ever will though your books are very well written i am tired of seeing you always put your lead female in many mens arms not a great picture for me she too is to blame for so many deaths in this book including the kings not very endearing now is it?!but for males and dialogues for them ace"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I agree with many other readers, the heroine Jasmine is very annoying.

I did like how her gave her a run for her money by actually bedding someone else. You almost wish he ended up with her instead of Jasmine.I was very disappointed because I loved \\"The Dragon and the Jewel\\" and \\"The Marriage Prize.\\" I only read this book because I had read the other two and thought I was missing something.

The beginning was good, I enjoyed the meeting between Jasmine and Falcon. The adventure sequence was fine, but the characters ruined it for me. The guy is walking, talking tube of testosterone and the girl is obviously going through an identity crisis . She thinks she's a porcupine. The love-hate thing was good for a while, but come on. But the miiddle of the book, it really got boring. Falcon does nothing but lust after Jasmine and she does nothing but say &quot;No&quot; throughout the whole book.

The girl simply didn't deserve her man or the print it took up to write about her. She is a spoiled child who never really grows up. Although I abhor abuse in novels, I was rooting for someone to knock her senseless by the middle of the book.

I'm not sure I even want to give it a try."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"My Review:A great old school\\"bodice ripper\\" 80's historical romance. The hero, Falcon, is way alpha male and the heroine, Jasmine, is pretty much a stubborn twit who continually gets into scrapes that the hero must rescue her from. All that being said-the back story of King John and the machinations of his court were such that the book was still quite enjoyable.This book would have been 5 stars if not for the stupidity, stubbornness, and just plain bit@hiness of the heroine. The book constantly goes on about her \\"exquisite, flaxen beauty\\" and the heroine uses that to manipulate most around her. The most unusual, and implausible thing, is that, even though Jasmine is supposedly a skilled white witch, she has virtually no knowledge of the marriage act and is literally terrified of bedroom relations for over two thirds of the book? She actually cringes when the hero touches her! The hero is crazy about her but at several points he wonders why he puts up with her abuse. And yes-he does strike her a couple of times in the book-after her selfish antics put many others in jeopardy and in one instance almost get a man killed. I give props to Virginia Henley's writing that she can make two leads who are VERY unlikable but still weave an interesting story in spite of them. This is my first Virginia Henley and I hope that most of her heroines are not dingbats like Jasmine, if so I'll skip those books as she is cringe worthy.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"i read the book before and spilled fruit punch all over my original copy, so i wanted another. the cover on the first publication was more interesting then this one. the story is typical of the genera and era of bodice rippers, so if you don't like them, this book is not for you. Also, the book villianizes prince john of England/ and even invokes robin hood, so if you're not interested in either of these characters fictionalized, once again this book is not for you. I enjoy the charachters strong sense of self and firm directions they choose for themselves. the story is a setting in which two people who are complete individuals form a very strong bond despite the chaos around them. In this generation the story is a bit out of touch and far fetched, but true medieval life was gritty and violent, and if you keep that in mind you'll fit right in."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"Let me first start off by saying that I've read a few of Virginia Henley's books and I have grown to like her writing style and how she plays around with historical event and real people in history, now on to the book review.I have to be honest and say that Falcon and Jasmine are my least favorite couple of all her books. I find them to have a dysfunctional and at times violent relationship. I felt like through most of the book there was a lot of antagonism between the two, and Falcon used a lot of he-man tactics to get what he wanted i.e. Jasmine at the expense of everything. I also felt like Jasmine was an airhead more times than not and that she really believed that she was some kind of white witch. I could not stand that she kept being portrayed as some fragile flower who was so \\"weak\\" that she hadn't been taught to run a household and was never expected to marry because she had been a bit of a runt at birth and her mother had died in chid birth so it would stand to reason that she would befall the same fate. I just could not stand that she was treated like some hothouse flower and through most of the book she kept being referred to as this \\"ethereal beauty\\".I also didn't like that Falcon hit her a couple of times but then was so apologetic after he did it, it didn't wash with me. I mean this man was described as being over 6ft tall and muscle bound giant. Just the though of him shacking or slapping someone who was described over and over again as fragile, made my teeth raddle. I didn't by that they fell in love with one another after being lot in a room for four days about 3/4ths ways into the book, even though up until that point they were at each others throats like to rabid dogs. I do however believe the found lust and a lot of it. I also think that Falcon had a unhealthy obsession with Jasmine, and she in turn was a very young girl being overtaken by a much older man.The only reason I gave this book the 3 stars is because of the way the author played around with history and the death of King John, using her characters as possible murderess, because in reality historians are not sure how he died, also I liked that she made Falcon de Burgh a nephew to the actual Hubert de Burgh, so it made it rather interesting being that he (Falcon) was a fictional character."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"One of the most unlikeable female characters I've come across. The story is like a mind game, on and on with no depth or gravity, or perhaps better said, no soul. Not for my tastes."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"OK, I usually enjoy reading Henley's books because of the strong-willed heroines. But, the heroine in this book is simply childish! Plus for 75% of the book it appears that she just REALLY DOESN'T LIKE HIM, for no reason too. For most of the book she never expresses any attraction to him, not even secretly in her own mind. Reading the book was really stressful because it was entirely evident that the heroine harbored no feelings for the hero until 3/4 of the way into the book she gets pregnant then all of a sudden she loves him. It really comes out of nowhere. Then on top of this, the King is a pervert and so is his 14 year-old Queen. The shenanigans that go on at Court are ridiculous and take up too much of the book along with shallow battles, which last only for a paragraph or 2, that are fought over land/castles. The other characteres have no depth. The hero is good enough, I suppose. But the heroine is just completely absurd. I could not beleive how childish she was. She even really thought he was the Devil for a while and then her silly magic...PLEASE! Not to mention, when she finally did make love with the hero, she would \\"withdraw her spirit and mind\\" from the act and actually not enjoy it! If you are looking for her to come around, you'll have to read at least 75% of the book."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I read enslaved & tempted which were incredible stories so I bought a few other books of Virginia Henley's. I really did not like the heroine in this story. She was shallow, self absorbed, stupid, vain and a self righteous shrew. The only redeeming character in this story was Falcon the hero, but I have to wonder at any man who can fall in love and remain in love with such a one dimensional useless woman. What I missed most was that this didn't come across as a love story because of these mismatched characters. The story was interesting if you were interested in the fictional version Ms. Henley created about the rule of king John.Truly I found it difficult to stomach Jasmine. She came across as a small poisonous snake rather than a flower. The idea of this woman as a mother appalled me. This lady killed the whole book for me. I am assuming Ms. Henley was aiming for a poignant and tumultuous love affair between the characters, but the story came across as a good man stuck in a bad relationship (I almost hoped he would meet someone nicer and escape his fate with this awful woman).I read the other reviews and as far as the hitting goes honestly the way this girl carried on I wanted to hit her a few times myself. I think that was blown out of proportion. He slapped her twice (which she deserved). I am not one for hitting but the foul mouth on this girl was almost too much to bear. The power of hurtful words is far greater than a little slap. Not that any of these things helped make this lady into a lady. She was illogical and massively superstitious as well as all the other short comings I discussed. In fact she sounded mentally unsound not my favorite depiction of a love story heroine. I love flawed characters and have enjoyed many books where the main characters are flawed with trauma in their pasts but this was not just a spoiled flawed character she had no depth or humanity or honor at all. I think Ms. Henley has many successful stories even spoiled characters in those stories whom later show more depth. I really can't say I recommend this as a good read unless you read it and imagine Falcon with another more worthy woman. I will leave the decision of reading this book to you. For me this was 21/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"Oh wow! This is my first time reading Virginia Henley's book and I am not disappointed! I couldn't put this it down! I love Falcon! He's so brute, powerful but sweet at the same time. Lol. I have to agree to some reviews though, Jasmine was annoying through out the story. Buy you get to like her as the story goes on. :-) Over all I love their love story!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I'm undecided.I don't like it and I don't hate it.Falcon was a pretty good hero up to the point where he hit Jasmine.Jasmine was totally unsuitable to be the wife of a great lord she had no knowledge of the duties of a chatelaine.Falcon had other suitable women to choose but he wanted no one else but Jasmine because he was strongly attracted to her.To give Jasmine some sympathy she did not want to marry him she was practically forced.She didn't like him and that transferred to when he tried to make love to her she froze him out.Normally hero and heroine can't keep their hands off each other once they make love for the first time.This a first for her where the heroine does not melt at the hero's touch.Falcon even got to the point where he was so desperate for a spark of desire or affection from that he went from wishing that she could love him to wishing that she desired then finally thinking that he would be happy if he could make her climax when he made love to her.I felt somewhat sympathetic towards him then.But my feelings for Jasmine remained ambivalent throughout the novel"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"i was expecting something more from the book. i knew that it was lacking something when i got half way done. so i was rather dissapointed"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"Illegitimate Jasmine is THE FLOWER. Falcon de Burgh is THE FALCON. As the heroine, Jasmine spends most of the book changing her mind. She is childish, she hisses, she snaps, she hates Falcon, she marries Falcon, she vows distance, she fantasizes, she wants, she changes her mind, she hates! What can I say? \\"Jasmine is a difficult heroine to like!\\" What an understatement!While the hero isn't much better - as heros go - at least Falcon de Burgh deserves some credit in dealing with the very annoying Jasmine! That is . . . until . . . he strikes her!Unfortunately, this is my first Virginia Henley book. I only hope THE FALCON AND THE FLOWER is not the normal Henley standard!MaryGrace Meloche."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"An excellent book, one of Henley's best. Too many people say Jasmine doesn't respect Falcon (yes, that's right, his name's actually Falcon) and won't appreciate what she has and how much he gave her, however, try putting yourself in that situation...Action, drama, romance, crude foreplay and intercourse, and kidnappings of sorts all wrapped up in 470 pages...what could be better?"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This was an excellent book. I read books like these for two reasons: The romance, and to see a section of history brought to life. I admire the way Ms. Henley adheres to the way things really were back then, right down to the male chauvenism. Falcon, the hero, is all man, but a respectable one, given the time. Jasmine started out a little flighty, but she ended up a strong woman who knew her own mind.Romance, magic and history combine to create a memorable book that is difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I love Virginia Henley's love for history, as I do. Her research for her novels in itself is enough to keep me reading to find out more about the outcome of the particular historical event she's penning. Her heroes are extraordinary. Especially the 'Falcon'. He was man enough to put up with Jasmine's undecidedness, and sometimes just downright childish behavior. He was patient, which in itself made him an extraordinary man. But once Jasmine fell in love, she was his most loyal supporter. She sacrificed herself for her family. Again, 'she did what a woman had to do'. One reader commenting the novels said the history was 'mumbo jumbo', but it is a fact that Virignia Henley is a REAL historical writer, in the true essence!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"The book was entertaining throughout but I had a problem with the fact that Falcon hit Jasmine. From the descriptions, Falcon was a large man while Jasmine was small. I realized she could be infuriating but that wasn't a reason for him to hit her. Otherwise, I enjoyed the mysticism and the political intrigue of King John's court. Henley's research of Matilda DeBraose (sp ?) is supported by books written by Barbara Erskine. This book could have been better. I enjoyed Henley's recent releases (Dream Lover, A Year and A Day, and A Woman of Passion) much more."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I usually like Henley, but I could barely finish this book. Not only does the hero rape the heroine repeatedly, but he is also physically abusive. He seems to be interested only in her body, and feels little or no guilt about his behavior. I will now think twice before buying any of Henley's older stuff and so should you!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This is one of my favorite romance novels EVER!!! I love the characters and the story. Henley writes so vividly it is easy to visual the world in the story and truly get lost in there world."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This was the very first book I read by Ms. Henley and I have to say that it totally enthralled me! I was completely captivated from beginning to end! I am now a loyal reader and I have sampled almost all of her work but I find this, my first one, to be one of my favorites still. If you are looking to be swept away on the wings of your imagination into a land of romance and steamy sex with some twists and turns along the way, I difinitely reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This was one of her best! Ms.Henley knows how to snare and keep her readers with great characters and accurate historical facts, and her sex scenes? Let's just say when I finish a book by Virginia Henley I turn over and wake up my husband!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This book is my personal favorite from Virginia Henley. The mysticism of white witchcraft and the courageous plights of Falcon de Burgh and Jasmine of Salisbury are enthralling. Henley manages to even add the legendary Robin Hood to the story for quite a fighting scene. She shows in her story how King's of the time, particularly King John, misused their powers for their own pleasure, making the people suffer. &quot;The Falcon and the Flower&quot; also reminds readers of the importance of honesty and communication in one's relationships, which was the conflict between Falcon and Jasmine"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"books don't get any better. if you love romance and advencher then you will love this one. it has a little of every thing. a must read!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"She never seems to lose her touch. This was my favorite novel from Virginia. It kept me up all night turning page after page anxious to find out what happened next! I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This book was good. I bought two of her books to see how good she was and I would read more. She may be a little too graphic but not enough to be offensive. Theres a lot of attempted incest stuff that I could do without but other then that it was well written and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I feel that this book has talent and emotion all in one. I have read it at least 15 times, and every time it is like I have never read it before. I loved how Virginia has captured truth, and other fantisy in this book. Everthing from Robin Hood, to King John, and Young Arthur. The wemon in the book are wemon who could survive in todays world, with their firery tempers, and their sence of independence. I think any woman can agree that Falcon de Burgh could make any woman act the way Jasmine, Morganna, and the Countess of Warwick did. I recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I thought this book was quite good. Although it contained a lot of mumbo jumbo about the wars and all, I still enjoyed the love-hate thing between Falcon and Jasmine."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I loved the characters and who could deny that Falcon is a great hero. I loved the plot and the characters are exquisite!!"},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This is my second book of Virgnia Henley and once again, I was entertained and is impressed by her style. I am almost finished with The Dragon and The Jewel, the 2nd book of this PLANTAGENET TRILOGY. The last book is THE MARRIAGE PRIZE. Basing it on her books that I've read, Virginia Henley really knows her plot. She corporates history with romance in the most factual way. She is straight forward and doesn't use a lot flowery words even in the hero/heroine's story. I do enjoy flowery words from time to time but on this occasion, Her style was a welcome change to me that I didn't mind it at all.The Falcon and the Flower affected me in the most bizarre ways. No doubt, I enjoyed this book. I find the PLANTAGENET interesting so the added history in this book thoroughly pulled me in. I love Falcon and Jasmine love story as well... but then I also felt guilty enjoying their story to the fullest because I don't like men hitting their wives. I feel if they did it once, they will do it again... and indeed, even towards the end of this book, Falcon did hit her again. ugh. Perhaps that is why I rated this book a four stars (4 1/2 if I could). That could have been omitted to proved he changed... I wanted to not like this book mainly for that reason but shamefully, i find my heart in spastic mode cuz I can see how much Falcon was drawn to Jasmine. He was VERY MUCH in love with her. It was a love at first sight. Jasmine didn't have a Title nor lands to offer, she wasn't trained to be a chatelain or a wife nor can she supposedly bore him sons or children... meanwhile, Falcon De Burgh could choose any bride he wants. There were many beautiful heiress who were fully trained to be chatelain and a submissive wife. There were many who could bring advantage to him but he chose Jasmine. Without Falcon realizing it, that alone says it all. Most of the books I've read have marriages cuz of convenience or with an advantage. However, Falcon's offer of marriage to Jasmine have no advantage to either of them. Love wasn't confessed in the beginning either so naturally it was confusing for both party, most especially for Jasmine who have ambition of her own to achieve. She feels that Falcon is ruining her life by marriage. I know a lot of reviewers here don't like Jasmine and I admit, I didn't particularly liked her in the beginning but this is also where I saw Ms. Henley's impressive talent. She wasn't afraid to put a flaw on her hero and heroine. Both Falcon and Jasmine have flaws of their own, which eventually made me liked them and admire them. Jasmine is also very young, only 18. She acted her age which is more realistic. I've read books where the heroine is only 18 or younger yet acted so maturely that it becomes too good to be true. Not Jasmine...Besides her beauty and her white magics, she WAS totally spoiled and useless as a wife! She likes nice clothes, to look her best and wants to be a Lady-in-Waiting for the Queen. She has her own plans and she's also living in a fantasy world, but mainly because of her grandmother ways of bringing her up. In the end, you will see her trying to be USEFUL, so to speak. That's when she becomes more lovable in my eyes.Another part which actually amuses me more than anything is Falcon's lusty appetite towards Jasmine. Testosterone Machine, Indeed! I know others are annoyed by this but not me. I enjoyed the idea of Falcon's strong desire for his wife, and I mean strong! To top it all, Jasmine is PRUDE and won't have anything of that! Perhaps it's the challenge and the anticipation that makes Falcon even more lustful for his wife. I tell you, I've never read such a book. Most of my books have mutual desire and enjoyment when it comes to their lovemaking. Once again, Ms. Henley proves her unique ideas and implemented it well. I don't know if I should envy Jasmine or feel sore for her... oh I mean, SORRY for her. lol.My sister suggested this trilogy to me. I didn't check the rating before reading it which I am glad I didn't, I might have been discourage and would have missed a good novel. I was surprise the overall rating of this book is only 3 1/2. In my opinion, THE FALCON AND THE FLOWER is full of NEW concepts and representation for me. It is a unique read and I totally enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"As is usually the case with Henley, I found this book to be compelling and intriguing. This author has a real talent for reeling me in and keeping my attention. However, as is the case with &quot;Enticed&quot;, I don't think her publishers did her any favors by reprinting this 1989 novel. The heroines in her earlier books are typically willfull, spoiled little brats you can't stand reading about.The heroine of &quot;The Falcon and the Flower&quot; downright got on my nerves for over 2/3 of this book...no, more like 4/5 of this book. I think Ms. Virginia was trying to make her seem feisty, but she came off vastly different. She was an icy, mean, spoiled little girl I couldn't stand.The heroine got on my nerves so bad that at one point I was actually routing for the hero's ex-mistress to win him back. I have never wished that on any other heroine I've read to date...that's tantamount to watching &quot;Jaws&quot; and routing for the shark.Another thing that disturbed me about this book was that there were a couple of scenes in which the hero slapped the heroine. Unfortunately, I disliked her so much that I didn't care...then I felt guilty about that since I consider myself a feminist and abhor violence against women!If you are a major Henley fan, you will probably enjoy this book at least somewhat. The book, with all its faults, was still quite engaging. As long as you go into this knowing what to expect, it probably won't be so bad. And as your reading, don't be surprised if you hear the theme song to &quot;Jaws&quot; playing in the background of your mind..."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"After reading this book, I sat back and wondered &quot;Now what was that about?&quot; Frankly, I got tired of all the sex, not that I'm a prude by any stretch of the imagination. What bugged me throughout this book was the constant &quot;ache&quot; Falcon had for Jasmine and how she continued to turn him down. And then, suddenly, when she gets pregnant she loves him. Please. It was so unbelievable. I'm all for a fiesty heroine and a dark, brooding hero, but for God's sake this was ridiculous. And the shenanigan's at King John's court were just plain silly. I only read this for the historical content and I was sadly let down with that too. This won't be one I repeat."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I have read several Henley books. I loved The Marriage Prize. As with that book, this one contained wonderful, fascinating historical facts and a story that I couldn't put down. My only complaint was that Jasmine was so unlikeable. As another reviewer said, she was a spoiled brat and I had very little sympathy for her. If you can put up with a herione like that, the book was well-written and the story comes to a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I loved this book! Granted, Falcon is full of testosterone and he is domineering, and even a creep, but I like them that way. I don't want a sappy, wimpy hero. I like them to take charge and be demanding. It makes for such a worthwhile romance. What fun is it for them to say &quot;I love you and fall onto the bed in the first chapter. I like fierce resistance on the woman's part and &quot;I'm going to take you anyway types on the man's part. That kind of book makes me squirm and I like it!!! Virginia Henley does not dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"This was the first *romance* book I ever read and I have to say that I was hooked. I read this several years ago and have read many more since than, but the details of many of the others seem lost to me while this one, I do remember. Perhaps becuase it was the first of the kind i read, or maybe just because of how powerful a book it was.I like this book ( and all of Ms. Henley's book) for a variety of reasons. First, they arent shy on length. Nothing is more aggrevating than getting into the story, falling in love with the characters and era and than having the story end. Ms. Henley write books on the longer side and also series *sagas*. I also like her discriptive language and her ability to make you feel for and like the main characters despite (or maybe because of) their sometimes obvious cahracter faults. Sometimes romance novels feel a bit *xeroxed*... like the writer is just changing the names, haircolor, and era and slapping a new cover on it. While I would have to say that this book fulfills a certain predictable romance *formula* (beautiful, willfull long haired heroine...brooding dark and head over heels in love on the inside, hero.... it really doesnt feel like a photocopy of every other book written in that form. It feels more like the original, that was emulated. The details are richer, the writing is better, the readers involvement is more than with many other books (even some of Ms henleys other books)The love scenes that Ms Henly writes seem different to me than other writers too... while less timid than some other writers (maybe julie garwood?) they arent quite brazen either (maybe like some of joanna lindseys?)... And I am not finding fault with julie garwood or joanna lindsy...Im really just trying to place virginia henley in the love-scene-scale... I would say that they are more on the more brazen side with the rough edges smoothed a bit by some tactful beautiful writing.The book isnt without faults but perhaps maybe the faults are more built in due to the genre. The exasperating heroine... okay, aggrevating sometimes... The roughness of the hero.. okay, brutality maybe. Maybe the issues are more due to the features of this *type* of book than the book itself.I would certainly say that if you like romance novels, to not read virginia henley is a mistake. I think she could write any type of fiction she chose, I love her writing style."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"The Flower: ok so I can understand how she became a spoiled little annoying girl but after a while you just got to ask: is she ever going to learn and try something else? She's a stupid, spoiled, and stubborn girl. That's all. Over and over it's the same thing, she doesn't try anything new, even for better or worse when he does something so horrible to her (read further).The Falcon: Hate him. As other reviewers have put: he hits her, and once at the very end when you're just, \\"oh come on! haven't you changed YET?!\\" He's also a pig, who thinks one thing so sadly and understandably that you think that he's finally caught on and might change, but nope! HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!!!: he rapes her. And the FIRST time \\"I guess\\" I can understand his reasoning but then he does it again... and again, and again. And this isn't like other books (which are still sick) where the woman says no and tries to resist, but his skills and fire sooo ignite her to hott hott sex. NOPE!! She pleads and cries for him to stop, when she realizes he won't she freezes and makes her mind go away, somewhere far away, other than there. It's nothing more than rape! Several rapes! Each time after he's either angry (at her!) or feels bad, and when he feels bad that quickly turns to lust 10 pages later when he continues his raping or fondling of her as she pleads for him to stop.Over all, this is a looong book where we get a lot of pages where they fight, yell, and say mean things, plus him and his lust, but then BAM!! LUST!!! and after one night over sex (of 3) she's telling him she loves him. Nowhere before that is there any hidden message that she's holding back and does like him. I mean, she stares at his chest a few times, but ladies... that's the only connection I can find before she's sprouting I love you to him... and after he hits and rapes her!! Classic Stockholm syndrome!!!I wish I can get my $8 back and have the publishers pay me for my wasted time.Both characters disgust me. THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE!! I wish other reviews had warned me of the rapes and not just the hitting (which I can explain away by the time period) so I hope others find this review helpful."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I can't believe I wasted hours of my life reading this book!! The main characters were absolutely AWFUL to each other. Like many male protagonists of the romance genre, he was very arrogant. Arrogance/confidence is okay to some degree, but Falcon was mean...downright mean and hateful to Jasmine. Jasmine was a complete and spoiled rotten brat, as well as a first degree witch. I know a good story needs some conflict, but GOOD GRIEF! I found myself hating both characters because of their deplorable behavior towards each other!! I honestly don't even know why I bothered to finish the book. I guess I kept hoping it would get better, but it truly never did.Don't waste your money on this one! If you want a well-written love story, try Julie Garwood, Hannah Howell, Monica McCarty, Kinley McGregor, or Galen Foley."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"I bought this book after reading some of the ratings on Amazon.com, and I have to agree with most of them that this book was lame. I read and read until I got to page 300 until they finally had sex, and i would have to disagree that if she was a white witch, she would have had more passion that what they showed in the book. I was very disappointed. I did already buy the other books in the series, so i better get it over with and see if they fare any better. The heroine seemed very self absorbed and selfish and could not admit she was wrong and judged everone to harshly. I would think that Falcon would have given up on her long ago."},{"Title":"The Falcon and the Flower","review":"Setting -- England/Wales/Ireland 1199 to 1202The most interesting aspect of this book is the history element. It's set in the early days of the realm of King John - the king who was so bad that the barons forced the Magna Carta on him.As for the romance, virtually every romance novel involves overcoming obstacles to finding true love. Usually the pair are from warring countries or he's killed a family member or something serious is in the way. In this book, there is no good reason for our heroine not to be willing, if not thrilled, to be betrothed to Falcon. He's young, handsome and even on the same side. Why he puts up with her running off to court and total self-centeredness is hard to understand.Still, the pace is enough that I never doubted that I'd finish the book. It's the first of a trilogy (with The Marriage Prize and The Dragon and the Jewel). I doubt I'll go out of my way to read the other two volumes."},{"Title":"MEDICINE AT THE CROSSROADS: The Crisis in Health Care","review":"There are basically two parts of Medicine at the Crossroads, both of which are invaluable reads. The first is a critique of our health care system with an urgent brief for a Canadian/French type of single-payer system. The second part of the book is a review of medical procedures and ethical dilemmas occurring all over the world. Konner analyzes the morality of numerous medical procedures and theories. For example, he discusses whether parents should be allowed to abort fetuses that show genetic predispositions toward certain physical or mental diseases. As a mental health patient myself, I appreciated his analysis of the treatment of the mentally ill. I salute him for his thoughtful discussion.He is brilliant in the epilogue, where he makes a powerful case for a single-payer, i.e. publicly paid, health care system in the U.S. He shows that our current system is expensive and produces very poor results. If you only have time for a quick read, check out the epilogue first. It was written while the Clintons were formulating their own health care solution, which Konner shows would not have worked if passed.I cannot recommend this book too highly. The next time a conservative babbles about the evils of \\"socialized medicine,\\" give him a copy of this book. If there arguments don't convince him, nothing will."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Temple: Unravel the Mysteries of the Ancient World","review":"Fascinating. David Furlong makes a very strong case for the Bronze Age inhabitants of Britain not only knowing that the Earth was round, but also having calculated accurately the Earth's diameter and circumference, as well as having a sound knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, geometry and surveying. He also puts a good case for the design of the Great Pyramid of Egypt being laid out within two interlocking twelve mile diameter circles in England, and raises the possibility of a link with survivors from Atlantis. The book is written simply and logically so that the reader can follow his steps of discovery and understand his theories and assess the evidence. Some sections were too detailed for casual readers but would make a useful reference for other investigators inspecting these megalithic sites themselves. Questions such as what was Stonehenge for, what was the real purpose for the Pyramids, and did Atlantis exist, are all covered in an easy to read manner suitable for the average reader."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Temple: Unravel the Mysteries of the Ancient World","review":"Having read many books and theories on the pyramids, it was refreshing to read for once a book filled with actual FACTS, rather than an author's conjecture. I like to read this book as it contains many mathematical and geometrical FACTS and in such quantity that a reader is able to piece together their own theory. As it seems obvious that the pyramids contain much mathematics and geometry in their design it is good to read a book by an author very well versed in these subjects."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Temple: Unravel the Mysteries of the Ancient World","review":"Amazing how he matches ancient sites with geometric patterns. This book is fascinating.How did the ancients know this advanced method of building monuments and placing these monuments in thier precise spots."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Temple: Unravel the Mysteries of the Ancient World","review":"This book starts out with nothing and ends with nothing. The author decided what he thought was true and then set about 'proving' it by joining up dots on a map. Having invented an imaginery circle he then goes on to weave a web of self-delusion.

All three of my girls absolutely adore this book! Each devotion consists of a story about the kids on Apple Tree Lane, a \\"Thinking Time\\" for questions about the story, a \\"Praying Time\\" for talking to God about the lesson the story teaches, and a \\"Sleeping Time\\" that is a fun activity to go along with the story. My one-year-old loves finding Night Light, the cute little critter that leads you through the devotions.

They memorized many of the scriptures because some of them were also in other stories within the same book. They noticed that and were able to memorize them.

Much more than a compendium of topics and definitions or examples, articles provide detailed discussions linking ethical and social issues to advancements in technology, challenges of working with it, and more.

I found a copy in a local used book store and was instantly hooked. I can't believe I never heard of this book. Terrific writing. The author apparently based his fiction on myths and legends surrounding Pengersick Castle, which still exists in Cornwall, England. Like Lloyd Alexander, Carlyon takes an old story and creates his own enchanting tale that is a sure-fire pleaser, full of action, adventure, magic, and memorable characters. Another fantasy classic that puts such popular stuff like Harry Potter to shame. Only wish the author had written more."},{"Title":"Dark Lord of Pengersick","review":"You know those books you read and loved when you were a child, pined after and searched for as an adult, but you could never quite remember the name of the author or the spelling of the title? You know the feeling of disappointment you get when you finally do find them, and discover that they don't stand up to adult scrutiny?Finding this book was like that, except for the disappointment. It was every bit as magical as I remembered.The Dark Lord of Pengersick is a rousing and fascinating tale that escorts the reader on a tour of the Brittish Isles before they were Brittish. It kindled in me a lifelong passion for the rich and underexplored world of pre-Roman european history, and also sent me on a thirteen-year quest to locate a misremembered title (I had remembered it as \\"Pengarsick\\").If you know any young minds (be they in young or not-so-young bodies) looking for a new world of myth and magic to explore, this is the perfect jumping-off-point into one of the world's richest wells of story.Read it!"},{"Title":"Dark Lord of Pengersick","review":"I read this book as a child and just rediscovered it.Its a rare gem of phantasy - powerful, dark and full of suspense.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !"},{"Title":"Dark Lord of Pengersick","review":"This was a great book, I wish there were more books that compared to this one, if only there were a sequal."},{"Title":"Parenting with Dignity: The Early Years","review":"This is a great down to earth parenting book with tons and tons of examples.

This one is different... Bledsoe offers common-sense guidelines for living with kids. There are no hard-and-fast rules, just intelligent discussion of methods that have proven successful. I found myself underlining passages, marking pages, and frequently thinking, \\"That's a really good point\\", \\"That makes so much sense\\", etc. Best of all, there's no fear-mongering involved. Bledsoe doesn't claim that your child will end up maladjusted if you don't follow some specific program."},{"Title":"Parenting with Dignity: The Early Years","review":"Excellent parenting book.

Philadelphia, Mississippi! The names strike fear into those who remember the brutal slaying of three civil rights workers on June 21, 1964. Author Howard Ball follows up his previous book entitled Murder in Mississippi with a retrial of \\"Preacher\\" Edgar Ray Killen who was one vote from conviction by a jury in 1967. A woman, who has since regretted her vote, said she couldn't bring herself to convict a preacher. The author provides us with the virulent atmosphere that prevailed in the deep south in the 1960's and the attitudes of those who resented anyone poking their collective noses into their way of life. Many of those who were convicted in the 1967 trial received light sentences and resumed their way of life upon release from prison. For 41 years Mr. Killen was able to enjoy the life of a quasi-celebrity in his home town while others feared to even mention the terrible deed that hung over the town of Philadelphia's reputation. Upon Killen's conviction in 2005 racist Richard Barrett requested a \\"Killen Appreciation Day\\" on the lawn of the Neshoba County Courthouse so people could come around and shake this terrorist's hand. Such actions make one wonder just how far we still have to go to bring individuals kicking and screaming out of their sordid past.

Cave-in (Pennsylvania, 1859)","review":"I recommend this book to any one who likes to read and have a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter or two. Also, anyone who likes historical fiction would like this book. One example is when the Coal mine collapsed in Pennsylvania in 1859. Also, I recommend this book to any one who used to work in the mines because it is very realistic. The main character, Liam, said, \\"You should never light a match in a mine because the coal dust is very flammable.\\" Also, I recommend it for anyone who thinks that girls can't work in the mine, because they can do the same amount of work that the men do only they do it more efficiently. Liam said \\"he saw a little bit of mischief in Rory's eyes.\\" Rory is a girl who subbed for Paddy, Liam's brother. I learned that the mine could be a dangerous place to work, not because it could cave in, but rather that your boss might abuse you, such as hitting you with a broomstick."},{"Title":"Survival!

Edward Newton is a classic in its genre as well as a book that will be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in the collecting of books, and some of the most noted collectors. Some may question the wisdom of reading about this man?s experiences, as they were collected in this book in 1918. A variety of books have been published in recent years that claim to offer a guide to the collecting of books or the experiences of novice collectors. Building a library of books is not something that is easily done or learned. And a person with a fortune at their disposal acting without guidance will only amass a collection that had it been guided by a trusted advisor would be exponentially more valuable and complete.The curator of the rare book department of a noted college who also was a participant in the latest book by Nicholas Basbanes, ?Patience And Fortitude?, introduced me to this book and two others. Mr. Basbanes is the author of, ?A Gentle Madness?, and will be publishing a third volume to his work that is already considered a modern classic by collectors and book lovers.While the prices and auction results that are listed in this book are very out of date, they still make for great reading, and in some cases may bring to memory a book on a grandparents shelf that today would buy a car or home. If nothing else these old prices show just how much value continues to be placed on collectable books. Mr. Newton lived during the same time that some of those authors whose work he collected were alive and writing. He was a collector of manuscripts, which meant that the author?s original drafts of their work were often available. At one point in the book he laments the appearance of the typewriter and the effect it will have on replacing the hand written original. Had he foreseen the computer it probably would have caused him physical distress.Another area he was an avid collector of is so-called association copies. Like manuscripts these have the rarity that comes with being a one of a kind item. Throughout the book he shares many of the treasures he acquired like a book inscribed from Charles Dickens the father to his son. For people who love late 19th Century Authors, this man not only collected their work, but often knew the writers and their friends. In other instances his collection of Boswell and Johnson?s work may not have come directly from the author to him, but he still was able to collect correspondence and other written material that is now difficult to find outside of museums.This particular book is also wonderful for it has photographic illustrations as well as black and white and color plates as well. If you love books, find as old a copy of this work as you can, and you will have added a treasure to your shelves."},{"Title":"The Amenities of Book-Collecting and Kindred Affections","review":"A delightful read from one of the pre-eminent collectors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the \\"Mark Twain\\" of books-on-books. An entertaining book, easily the equal of any of the books on collecting that have proliferated in this century. Newton's recollections of trips abroad to collect, and his stories of acquisition in this country, make warm and comfortable reading for any collector, especially his stories of conversations and exchanges with the major collectors of his day that other such books only report about. This one heads my want list."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"Just finished after a quick 3 hours and I have to say it should be required reading for anyone struggling with their sexuality. We must never forget the hundreds of thousands of men who were systematically exterminated in concentration camps for simply being born gay. We are and will always be indebted to them for the lives we are able to live today."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"A most thorough book on gays in German prison camps; however, you'll find yourself jumping back and forth to pages of footnotes from articles and books studied by author. Well written, but difficult to plow through."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"This was a long-awaited read for me. It was a read I had to prepare myself for, before I could actually read it. I'm a scholar of WW2 and Holocaust literature and have a large collection of material, but for a topic dealing even more closely with myself and being, I had to take time to ground myself.Whether you are just a passing person who might wish to learn about what homosexuals suffered in concentration camps (and there were fewer comparatively and earlier in the Nazi regime directly), or someone who is looking for a wider view of all inmates who were interred or murdered, this memoir can provide views into life in the camps, especially for certain populations. What is does beyond that is provide a glimpse into the ugly aspects of \\"male\\" life, and the unique, sexual brutality so-called \\"straight\\" men have perpetrated against homosexuals who've expressed or more openly or innocently (depending on your perspective) their attraction and love of those of their own gender.I don't even know quite how to express it, but I literally was brought to the floor, unable to move, weeping, remembering how one can be forced to do things just to survive, and knowing the ones who forced you to debase yourself so horribly were so-called \\"straight\\" men who went/go home to their wives or girlfriends, who don't think twice about using someone. That is the perspective Heinz Heger lived and endured on top of the diabolical, sickly human mechanisms of the Nazis and those who benefited from their regime.I wanted to know more of his personal feelings when he described seeing thousands of prisoners of all kinds not just be \\"liquidated\\", but when he directly saw the evidence: the coursing of blood from trenches full of recently shot bodies instead of his only stating how the villagers near the camp complained of the local streams being tainted with blood, but I understand why his account involved only that. Sometimes you can only recount abstracts like that, because looking too directly into the memory will take you back, and you know, in your present life that you couldn't endure that.Not a \\"speciality\\" book. Not just for gays or other LTIIQ people. If you are going to read Holocaust books, include this one as well. Be aware and outraged that homosexuals were targeted and murdered just like other groups, just because they believed and lived a certain way....BUT the vast majority were NEVER compensated as were other survivors. They were pushed aside and discriminated against, and even had officials discount their memories, an even more debilitating experience than survivors whose stories were commiserated with. So in effect, these men were violated over and over, not just by perpetrators, but by those who supposedly were there to liberate and help them as they did other concentration camp inmates. They were discriminated against JUST like what continues against gays today in a variety of countries across the world."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"Such a good book. It gives a different perspective on the Holocaust. It's a page turner...I couldn't put it down once I got past the first few pages. Everyone one should read!"},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"While I applaud Heinz Heger's efforts in writing this book, it wasn't well written. Nor was it essentially about the men with the pink triangle. It was more of a personal memoir. The other characters in it were peripheral to his horrific story.Yet Heger does bring to light one of the worst injustices inflicted against gay survivors, namely that they alone out of all the survivors of concentration camps who never committed a crime against anyone, were denied compensation from the German government because prior to the nazi regime, according to 175 homosexuality was illegal in Germany, and remained so after the war.My heart goes out to all the victims of the holocaust. How gay people were treated is a subject that needs to be addressed more thoroughly so that we all may grieve for those who suffered."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"This memoir of a man who was imprisoned in concentration camps simply because of his sexual orientation may be slim - only about 120 pages - but it packs a punch. The man's tale, first told in 1971 to Heinz Heger, is straightforward and to the point, addressing a forgotten group of people who were persecuted by the Nazis - and later, by those who rose to power after the Nazis were defeated.This is a fascinating look into a group that has so often been ignored by Holocaust historians. There are so few books that address the experiences of the homosexual concentration camp victims, and yet there were thousands of these \\"pink triangle\\" men in the camps. This is the only memoir I've ever read dealing with that group, and I found it mesmerizing.The \\"pink triangle\\" men were despised by their fellow prisoners; even the murderers and thieves viewed themselves as \\"morally superior\\" to the \\"degenerates\\" who had violated Paragraph 175 (the law against homosexuality). The man was repeatedly insulted and abused for his orientation (at one point being sexually assaulted by fellow prisoners on the way to a concentration camp). And this memoir adds a new dimension to concentration camp life, addressing sexuality and its fluidity in trying circumstances (many of the capos and other prisoners in positions in authority had male lovers, although they'd vehemently deny that they were gay).Of course, the man's struggle for equality didn't end once liberation came. He was still haunted by what he had witnessed and endured. His father had committed suicide in despair after his arrest. His promising career in academia had been permanently stalled by the six years he spent imprisoned. And, of course, gays were still acceptable targets to hate after the war; homosexuality wasn't even legal until 1971 in the man's native Austria.At the time this book was published, the man (who chose to remain anonymous here) still had received no remuneration from the German government by being imprisoned during the Holocaust. And why? Because he was homosexual, a \\"criminal\\" prisoner, and therefore entitled to nothing. Wow. I wonder if any gay prisoners received monetary payments for the suffering that they endured.I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Holocaust and/or gay history. It's a really remarkable slice of history, and it's a shame that there are so few memoirs available from \\"non-traditional\\" Holocaust victims."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"I have to admit that though I have been well-acquianted with the Holocaust, I have not really delved into the persecution of gays by the Nazis. When I came across this book in my local library, I knew it was time to educate myself about the plight of this minority group that also suffered greatly under Hitler's Third Reich. \\"The Men with the Pink Triangle\\" is the true life account of a gay inmate of a German concentration camp who survived six years in Sachsenhausen and Flossenburg, from 1939-1945. However, he chose to remain anonymous due to the ongoing persecution of gays in his native Austria at the time the story was told, circa 1971-72.Though this is a thin volume, the horrors inflicted upon this victim and his fellow concentration camp inmates is truly horrific - the Nazis were intent on dehumanising these people - inflicting all sorts of torture, from heavy manual labor that was meaningless [shovelling snow with bare hands and moving it from one pile to the other with no purpose], the sadistic beatings inflicted on inmates [even a priest was not immune from this], and other atrocities.The book is also immensely valuable as it portrays the inner workings of the political hierarchy in these camps and how inmates stood a better chance of surviving if they played the 'game' correctly. For example, the narrator tells the story of the Polish 'dolly-boys' who allowed themselves to be used by high-ranking camp dignitaries in order to get more rations and better work conditions. The narrator himself admits to forming such 'attachments' in order to survive. The narrator plays the game so well, he even gets the promoted to the coveted position of Capo [sort of like a supervisor/foreman].There is even an account of the SS trying to 'cure' homosexuals by forcing them to go on mandatory brothel visits, an experience that so put off the narrator that he desisted from ever having intercourse with a female.The memoir ends with liberation and the reunion between the narrator and his beloved mother. But he finds that prejudice against homosexuals is still prevalent in his native Austria and at the time the book was written, we are told that homosexuality was legalised in Austria in 1971.A well-written account of life as experienced by homosexuals in Nazi concentration camps."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"Written in the first person, this book describes in vivid detail the horror of day to day life in a Nazi concentration camp. It's one man's eyewitness account of the camps, the death and degradation he faced on a daily basis, and how he clung to his humanity ~ and his life ~ against such unbearable odds.Most telling ~ though not really very surprising, given the vast power differences between prisoners and their guards ~ was his recollection of camp politics. He managed to survive by taking advantage of a guard whose friendliness toward him turned into sexual interest.This book is not for the faint of heart. The scenes of horror that play out ~ the executions, the torture ~ are not graphic in their description, but the stark, terse language in which they're conveyed, married with the sense of hopelessness you read between the lines, speak more to the brutality of the Nazis than a thousand descriptive paragraphs ever could.But this was probably one of the best books I've read on the Holocaust. I wish it were required reading for every person, everywhere, as a testament of the human spirit in adversity and a warning to us all. Perhaps then we could begin to move past our differences to a more peaceful co-existance."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"This is a must read for everyone who wants to discover the whole truth abut the concentration camps that the devilish Nazis set up during WW2. It's also a must read for every gay man in the world because it documents an important chapter about how gay men were so ill-treated (starved, beaten, horribly tortured, dishonorably killed) during ww2 and afterwards. I'm just sorry that the author didin't identify himself, because if he was living today I would try to find him and thank him for telling his story. It also documents the horrible descrimination that the gays suffered after 1945 until the 70s and how differently they were treated than the jews. These had the holocaust horror recognised immediately after the war was over, but no such luck for the few gay men who survived the camps (mostly Sachsenhausen and Flossenburg). Don't miss this book if you're setting up any kind of document, museum, documentary about gay people in the 20th century. I'm so touched by the men who died in those camps, I just can't believe how much they suffered....I've been at Sachsenhausen 2 months ago, and they had a sign in memory of the gay people that have died there, but I didn't realize the horror in it's full scope. All this just makes hate more and more anyone who defends the nazis and that deny the holocaust. I hope the nazis who did these crimes burn and suffer in hell for all eternity for everything they did. But I think it won't be enough punishment....."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"This book was excellant. It was very easy reading and told of the horrid life in the concentration camps under Nazi Germany. Grips the heartstrings while being educational and informative. Not many books are written on this subject and this one is definately a gem"},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"For many years I assumed the only victims of the Nazi instituted Holocaust were Jewish people. The horrors Jews endured in concentration camps is a dark stain in human history. But, silence about the \\"legal\\" suffering of other marginalized groups in concentration camps should not be overlooked. Paragraph 175 in German law demonstrates many of the same fears and prejudices behind the Nazi regime's choice of targets was not limited to Auschwitz. Those placed in concentration camps were forced into another world, another set of hierarchies indicated by colored triangles. Those men who wore pink triangles lived at the bottom of this hierarchy and this book is one man's story of survival in the face of overwhelming hatred. Pink triangle prisoners in the Holocaust deserve a historical voice and should be included in Holocaust research.The heart-wrenching portion of this unnamed survivor's life was his continued oppression after the concentration camp because of paragraph 175 (instituted before the Nazi regime). He and other pink triangle prisoners were not considered victims because unlike a Jewish heritage, homosexual persons were \\"legal\\" prisoners of concentration camps.Take care when reading this deceptively short and powerful narrative."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"A very gripping account of how gays were discriminated in nazi germany. The path of a homosexual as he tries to survive in a concentration camp. I read it as a required reading for a college class but it was a very interesting read. Most eye opening was how gays were treated after the war, almost the same as during the war!"},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. The fact that it was written in the first-person and not glossed over by a biographer makes it feel more real - more raw. It manages to be touching and chilling at the same time."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},D={key:1};function j(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const B=d(E,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-d22eb264"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/33.md","filePath":"quotes/33.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/33.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
