It was originally a Chivers production, then Chivers was bought by BBC and now does not show as available on the BBC America audiobook site.Honestly, if an audiobook has already been produced putting it out on CD or as an audible release seems like an excellent idea. I know lots of women who who enjoy listening to a Heyer novel over the lastest slasher fiction on their way to work. I found the miles passed very quickly while I listened to this 8+ hour reading of one of Heyer's more charming novels, originally published in 1941.Eve Matheson, the reader, has a pleasant voice with no annoying habits. My only objection is that she sounds a bit middle aged for the majority of the characters. Her interpretations of characters such of Lady Bellington, the heroine's flighty aunt, and Adrian's mother are both letter perfect though. And surprisingly she does well with the ex-pugilist doorman, Wantage, and the slimy Lord Omskirk.If you get a chance, definitely listen to this one."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This one of the best novels by this superb writer; the characters are both fascinating and delightfully amusing. If you have never read one of these classic romances, prepare to be hooked. Heyer fans are legion and read and reread her works...none of the the so called \\"romance novels\\" written today can come near to rivaling her books. After all, she founded the genre."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The only downside to it is the slightly odd note the heroine strikes-- she is honorable and intelligent, yet does something very silly!Overall, a fun romp with a heroine who has a sense of honor, and a hero who makes a great mistake in his evaluation of her. Interesting because the setting and situations are very different than other Heyer books. A satisfying ending."},{"Title":"God's Abundance","review":"I went through this book after purchasing it a year ago. At the end of each day, I would read &amp; reflect upon the corresponding scripture, story and inspiration for that particular day. I found this to be a relaxing, prayerful way to wind down for an evening of peaceful slumber. On January 1st, I began the book again. Now, my husband joins me. We alternate evenings, reading the day's passage to each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to re-focus and simplify...it will help you recognize and appreciate God's abundance in your own life!"},{"Title":"God's Abundance","review":"This book is great because each devotion is very short.

It is the story of Gillian's twin, Gilbert. When I wrote my review of that book, saying that I wanted to see his story, I didn't know it had already been written! Now I want to see the story of Venetia and Vivian's brother, Nicholas(hint to the author!) Venetia, the heroine of this book, is much like Gillian, and that is probably why the hero feels so comfortable with her. She is the more out-going of the two girls, and is focused on protecting her twin Vivian and finding a husband for her. Vivian suffers from seizures following a head injury in an accident, and someone tries to blackmail the family because in the regency period, such a disability would be considered stigmatic. The plot revolves around solving this problem, finding a good husband for Vivian, and ultimately in the coming together of Gilbey and Venetia. The twin girls are daughters of a duke, and really expected to marry higher than a &quot;mere viscount,&quot; which Gilbey is. The issues of epilepsy and the unfairness of the disparities in social class are handled sensitively and intelligently. This book was a worthy follow-up to it's successor, which also ranked 5 stars from me, and both are on my &quot;keeper shelf.&quot; I hope to see more from Gail Eastwood. She has the ability to make me become a part of the story and cheer for the characters(I generally REALLY like her heros--they are definitely my type, being sensitive, strong, caring, and funny)"},{"Title":"AN Unlikely Hero (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Gilbey Kentwell, Viscount Cranford, doesn't feel comfortable at the estate of the Duke of Roxley, but his friend Nicholas, the Duke's son, persuades him to come, saying that he needs Gilbey's assistance as a chaperon for the house party. Gilbey knows that a viscount without great wealth cannot be considered a proper suitor to the Duke's daughters, so he agrees to go, knowing there will be no pressure to woo.Twins Venetia and Vivian are none too happy with their father's latest scheme to force them both to wed. However, perhaps this two week house party will turn up someone--two someones--they can content themselves with. The biggest problem is Vivian's secret illness: the girls feel they must find husbands before anyone finds out about her misunderstood condition, and Venetia has long since vowed to not marry until Vivian does as well.Gilbey discovers that his friend's sisters are not only beautiful, but charming and intelligent as well. He is one of the few guests who can tell them apart; to him, it is easy to note their differences. Gilbey is reminded, however, not once but twice by the Duke that he is not there to court his daughters, only to round out the male/female ratio.Gail Eastwood has written a compelling Regency with an important but not overpowering social message. It is also a fun twist on the twins theme, as the reader does not know for many pages which twin will end up with Nicholas. The girls are portrayed masterfully--the reader sees the differences in their personalities as easily as Nicholas does. Sympathetic characters and a story that keeps the reader wondering make AN UNLIKELY HERO a charming, enjoyable read.Kimberly Borrowdale - Under the Covers Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Curious George Visits the Library","review":"Curious George is on another adventure. This time he's in my favorite place, the library. The man with the yellow hat has brought George to the library for story time. He likes the books but sees one on dinosaurs that he hopes the librarian reads next. He gets impatient, takes the book and runs off. This is the beginning of his adventure. He goes through the library finding neat books and making a big mess in the process. The boys and girls at the library, along with a volunteer help clean up the mess. In the end the man with the yellow hat helps George get a library card and they both check out lots of great books.I liked the story and the pictures in the book. It's another great adventure with Curious George.I would recommed this book to others. It can be used with young children who are just learning about the library. It would make a great read for storytimes."},{"Title":"Curious George Visits the Library","review":"&quot;Curious George Visits the Library&quot; is, as the title page notes, &quot;Illustrated in the Style of H.A.

Chaos ensues as George frolics through the library, but it all ends happily.Curious George is an enduring cultural icon, and this book is an enjoyable addition to his adventures. He's a cute and likeable character, and despite his disruptive antics, his love of books makes him admirable. Although mischievous, he is never malicious, and his attitude throughout is positive. Weston creates a nice portrait of a multiethnic community at the public library. Her illustrations are full of clever visual touches and entertaining details.

The seller had the book more than fairly priced, the book arrived just days later, and the book was in great condition."},{"Title":"Curious George Visits the Library","review":"It could be that I think this is educational because it introduced the concept of the library and borrowing books to my 2.5 yo. He sits through very long stories so thats not a concern for us, but I'll warn you that this is quite long.

This one is a good pick."},{"Title":"Curious George Visits the Library","review":"This book itself is lovely. Unfortunately it has been formatted for kindle in a cheap and careless way. Both on my iPad and kindle, the words on the page are blurry, and then there are typed words written below the page.

Thucydides is not only a good author, but an admirably resourceful and analytical philosopher. For instance, when tidal waves were destroying towns, he was keen enough to realize that they were the result of earthquakes, instead of mindlessly writng it off to the wrath of the gods. But this history is by know means dry. His account of the plague in Athens, and the speeches and battles he recorded were all very interesting and at times extroardinarily dramatic. I think this book is the lost treasure of the library, exiled to some remote shelf, not having been checked out since 1985, binding shredded and falling off, but as they say, never judge a book by it's cover.P.S. I'm not flaming any one, but when I read the top review on this page, I was offended. The fact that they (he, she, it)condemned this book without basis, and most likely, without reading it, probably made someone decide not to read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Other reviewers have commented extensively on the significance of Thucydides' History and its place in the pantheon of historical literature. Given a choice of translators and publishers, my focus is on some of the characteristics of this particular edition to aid in making a purchasing decision.This version of the History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides appears to be a reprint excerpted from an older work -- \\"Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides\\", by Benjamin Jowett. Second edition. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1900. Jowett was a prolific translator of Greek texts. A search on his name on the Amazon site will yield a huge number of hits. The 1960 Bantam Classics edition of the History claimed Jowett's translation as definitive.The key point I want to make is that there are neither translator notes nor historical commentary in this reprint. There is also no publisher information anywhere in this book, making it difficult to track down the sources for this edition. Furthermore, all of the editorial comments on the Amazon page for this book refer to **other** editions, not the one you are purchasing from this page, and which might erroneously lead one to believe that there is historical background included in this particular book.Finally, this book is available as an e-book for free under Creative Commons License, according to the terms of which, I believe, this reprint should have included the original attribution that I've given here.In summary, this book is a complete translation of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War by a well-regarded translator. It is however, a bare-bones edition without additional historical background on either the author or the content of this work."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"This is the most objective and readable contemporary history ever written. Only in classical Greece could a work at once so sympathetic and objective be created. Thucydides was an Athenian and served as a general in their army, but first and foremost he was a Greek. Because of this he did not slander Athens' enemies or feel the need cast the Athenians' actions in a glorious, righteous light. Every chapter shines with brilliance and humanity, particularly the section on the plague which hit Athens when it was already in a crisis. I'm actually tempted to call this 2,000 year old history a page-turner."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Thucydides earned an honored spot among ancient writers by being one of the first to break with the old ways. Up to his time natural disasters, national defeat and personal tragedies were blamed on the &quot;gods&quot;. This remained true even when the writers themselves doubted the existence of those beings.Thucydides took part in the famous war between Athens and Sparta and somehow made the decision to - for the first time - write a factual historical record of the events instead of using legends and tales. He conducted interviews, traveled for first-hand investigation and laid out not only the war but the political and social conditions that surrounded the event.If one were to judge the work based on the literary quality of the content it would be difficult to award the five stars. But the translator has made the best of an old style of writing that is detailed, pedantic and remorseless with the facts and consequences of mistakes. It is a miracle - and a blessing - that some anonymous scribe in a small room with candle and quill undertook the task of replicating his words for us almost 2,500 years later."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"The reason books become classics is they convey wisdom pertanent to all ages. This history is one such classic example of Rhetoric, RealPolitik, Politics of Personality, as well as the higher themes of Honor, Loyalty, Duty, Courage. etc.I'd give the book five stars but this translation is only adequate. I loved having the greek on the page opposite the english translation, as well as the convenient, carry-anywhere size of the text.A must read if you wish to be considered truely educated."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Thucydides (about 460-395 BCE) was a Greek historian who is considered the first \\"scientific\\" historian, because of his lack of reference to the gods, as well as his strict standards for gathering evidence. This book tells the story of the war between Sparta and Athens, up to the year 411.He admits in his Introduction, \\"In this history I have made use of set speeches some of which were delivered just before and others during the war. I have found it difficult to remember the precise words used in the speeches which I listened to myself and my various informants have experienced the same difficulty; so my method has been, while keeping as closely as possible to the general sense of the words that were actually used, to make the speakers say what, in my opinion, was called for by each situation.\\" (Pg. 47) He adds, \\"My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever.\\" (Pg. 48)Pericles laments, \\"There is often no more logic in the course of events than there is in the plans of men, and this is why we usually blame our luck when things happen in ways that we did not expect.\\" (Pg. 119) Cleon suggests, \\"a city is better off with bad laws, so long as they remain fixed, than with good laws that are constantly being altered.\\" (Pg. 213)Brasidas (who \\"was not at all a bad speaker, for a Spartan\\"; pg. 315) said, \\"For it is more disgraceful, at least for those who have a name to lose, to gain one's ends by deceit which pretends to be morality than by open violence.\\" (Pg. 317) Some Athenians asserted that \\"One is not so much frightened of being conquered by a power which rules over others... as of what would happen if a ruling power is attacked and defeated by its own subjects.\\" (Pg. 402)Any library of ancient history would benefit from this excellent edition of Thucydides' epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The History of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Athens has Sparta by the throat, suing for peace. As protector of democracy Athens can expand her empire ad infinitum. Athens blows it. Driven by demagoguery, the Athenians reject Sparta's offer and lose it all in war against Syracuse. Thucydides weaves a very modern tale of democratic hubris and overreach. I read it two times."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters","review":"I have read most of Seymour's works and found them all to be enthralling page turners. I strongly recommend them. However, the plot description here is identical to An Eye for an Eye which I have already read. I am sure they are the same work published under different titles. I also noticed that another reader found the same situation with Dead Ground and The Waiting Time. Seymour is outstanding, but be careful of buying the same work twice under different titles."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters","review":"Jane Canning has a minor spat with her lover Holt. A few minutes later, a lone gunman kills Jane, the personal secretary to the British military attach&eacute; in Moscow, along with the British Ambassador to the USSR outside their hotel in Yalta. Holt, the latter's private secretary, sees it all, including a close-up view of the assassin's distinctively scarred face.Comparing Holt's description of the murderer to a database of surveillance photos, MI6 in London identifies the killer as Palestinian fighter Abu Hamid. Since Jane was also the Secret Intelligence Service's agent in Moscow, the MI6 Director General recruits Holt to accompany Noah Crane, an Anglo-Jewish veteran sniper on loan from the Israeli Army, into Lebanon's dangerous Beqa'a Valley to exact vengeance. The plan is for Crane to shoot Hamid after Holt positively identifies him. Haunted by Jane's last words, \\"Don't be childish, Holt\\", the young and inexperienced Third Secretary in Her Majesty's Diplomatic Corps agrees.AT CLOSE QUARTERS is another in a series of excellent covert action novels by Gerald Seymour whose writing embodies the best of John le Carr&eacute; and Adam Hall. Le Carr&eacute;'s spy stories emphasize the subtleties of character and plot development, while Hall's focus on the plot twists and close run things that bedevil his hero Quiller through many sagas. In this case, the character evolution is all Holt's as he's chaperoned by the crusty and non-communicative Crane into harm's way. Crane calls Holt \\"youngster\\", and instructs him, for survival's sake, to watch everything he does - and learn. It's OJT out on the sharp edge. In the meantime, the intelligence operatives of Syria, Israel and Great Britain are all conniving for better or worse in the background.In most of the espionage or conspiracy thrillers I've read, the end is nice and tidy, and the hero walks away with the girl. There are no shades of gray in a world once again kept safe for democracy from the diabolical scheming of the Great Unwashed. What I like about Seymour's novels, AT CLOSE QUARTERS included, is that the winners are left almost as damaged as the losers, and the victories won have a certain hollowness. This, I think, is more like real life."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"This lavishly printed coffee table picture book was put together with great care by Tim Malachosky, Mae West's personal assistant of 10 years. Tim draws upon his conversations with Miss West and keeps his comments on the upbeat and positive side. There are no startling or profound observations to be found here, however Tim has reproduced several photographs that have never been published before. The photographs alone are worth the purchase price of the book. While Miss West had several other \\"personal\\" secretaries over the years - all male, there are many other stories that can be told and ultimately will. However, until they are, this pictorial tribute to the memory of Miss West will keep fans and West fanatacs happy.In the ensuing ten years since I originally published this review several revelations have come to light which I feel must be shared. Tim Malachosky was approached by James Greene who convinced him that he should utilize the vast photographs in his private archive. Greene was not a film historian, as originally stated, but an ardent Mae West fan. Malachosky had originally envisioned text to accompany many of the never before published photographs written in the voice of West herself. Greene bristled at this suggestion and the end result fell far short of Malachosky's vision for the project.During a recent interview, Malachosky stated that he felt pushed into publishing such a project on a grand scale. Several publishers were approached, but all declined due to the potentially great cost of the undertaking. Eventually, Malachosky decided to take the risk and self publish the book under his own imprint, Empire Publishing. The finished project was beautifully printed at a cost of $55 per book with an initial press run of 1,000 books.Unfortunately for Malachosky, the timing for this venture was off, as he was not fully versed in using the internet to properly promote his book which could have possibly sold out its initial press run to die hard Mae West fans. Compounding this problem. James Greene suffered a concussion and died very suddenly, leaving Tim with a very serious cash flow problem. He was only able to pay off the printer when he made a sale, and at a selling price of $85 dollars a copy, quite expensive at the time, but well worth the cost, sales were hard come by. The printer threatened to destroy the remaining 900 or so unsold copies, but they eventually were placed in storage and were eventually sold at great loss and are currently popping up on eBay from a vendor who purchased the entire set of unsold copies.Although this experience did not have the happy ending Tim Malachosky had envisioned, he still takes pride in the fact that he was able honor Mae West on the 100th anniversary of her birth. Some reviewers of Malachosky's tribute have focused on the shortcomings of his prose, but in the very near future he will be given the forum to expand upon his recollections being in close contact with Miss West."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"Whilst the text is slight this is easily forgiven for the amazing impact of the presentation and scale of this must-have book for every Mae West fan. I love this book and return to it often. It is huge, beautifully produced and full of the most marvellous photographs of Miss West, many in full colour. Tim clearly adored her and this shines through in the text. Having met him I know his love was and still is very real and his efforts on Miss West's behalf have continued long after her passing. I have also met a number of those who knew Tim in his days when he served Miss West and they have all paid tribute to his unstinting love and devotion. Well done, Tim, and thanks for everything, including this lovely tribute book. Thanks too for your kindness and generosity to me on my various trips to LA."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"This book is simply a wonderful and personal tribute to the fabulous Miss Mae West - it is packed with the most sin-sational photographs you are ever likely to see, and is a glorious over-sized coffee table extravaganza... it is simply a delight to own and leaf through. Tim should not only be praised for his book, but for his commitment to Miss West and her memory. His exhibits at the Hollywood History Musuem need to be seen to be believed, and having met Tim and others who knew him during his work with Miss West I would recommend this book to ANYONE with an interest in this special star. As she herself said 'It is better to be looked over than overlooked' and I for one am so glad Tim has taken the time to look over his own photographs and memories to share them with us all. Well done Tim - hope to see you again sometime soon!"},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"Do not be swayed by reviewers with personal agendas or call yourself a true Mae West fan if you don't own this book! A treat for both the eye and heart, it's generously crammed with high-quality pictures of the late, great West throughout her career and in all her glamorous glory. Look closely: many of the photos were personally inscribed to the author. It's not intended as a research project or biography but as an oversized coffee-table homage to one of the most \\"fascinatin'\\" women who ever lived. If you love West, then do yourself a favor, get up off your nickels, and snag yourself a copy. As West herself once said, \\"He who hesitates is last\\"."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"This book is huge in size, with page after page of amazing photographs. Get it while it's still available! It is no longer in print and the copies are signed and limited to 2000 total. Anyone who is interested in fashion or photography will discover a trove of inspiration in it's pages. For the collector, the images truly take you back in time. It's a fun study to see Mae's progressive changes from the early 20's into the 60's, the very thing that made her an icon. It gives you a glimpse of a woman who understood the appreciation of art-forms outside of performance. The photos are also a play on the many nuances of being feminine. Hard to imagine, since there is no nudity! Only beautiful clothes, hats, make-up, hairstyles, poses and great lighting; many pics are good black and white copies, with color photos as well."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"The voluptuous Mae West - so famed for her ultra-hourglass figure that a World War II life jacket was nicknamed after her - was, IMHO, the first great sex symbol of cinema after sound came in and closed the curtain on the era of the silent movie. She built an image through her career on stage and screen - the lusty woman who unapologetically loves sex - that got her in trouble with bluenoses all her life and keeps her a truly iconic figure to this day.People looking for \\"dirt\\" on West will have to look somewhere else, as Tim Malachosky, West's private secretary for some ten years, wrote this book as a tribute to his employer and friend. The text is affectionate and entertaining, though, as other reviewers have also noted, no startling revelations are contained herein. The heart and soul of the book, however, is the photograph collection - which is truly dazzling, from the stunning front cover (depicting West in a reprise of her famous \\"Diamond Lil\\" role in 1946) to the back cover. Many of these pictures have never before been published, and they display Ms. West, in color and black-and-white, from beginning to end of her life and career. The limited-edition format (only 2,000 copies, with each copy numbered and signed by the author and his collaborator) presents the imagery in a hugely oversize format (something like 12\\" x 15\\"), printed on high-quality paper, and truly does justice to the photographs, many of which are reproduced in full-page format.There will probably never be another printing of this book, so if you can afford the price, buy it today."},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"This book is spectacular. Tim did a great job and I treasure it. I think the one bad review of this that I read was by some \\"damon\\" guy, who must have multiple personalities or be off medication. Everybody knows who Tim is! :) Just ignore the fool, and consider yourself lucky if you have this great book!"},{"Title":"Mae West","review":"This book will embarrass the reader, as it is written in such a juvenile manner. All info in it is erroneously written as if it were told directly to the author by Mae West, when in reality it is a simple combination of research taken from several other Mae West bios. The author claims to have been a close personal friend and secretary of Mae Wests, which has since been wildly refuted by readers and many of Wests real secretaries of the time. Some very rare photos, but most can be found in any store on Hollywood Blvd. The book is incredibly over priced as well."},{"Title":"Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Gridiron Grudge Since 1893","review":"&quot;It's been said that football is the secular religion of the south. If so, then the gridiron grudge between the University of Georgia and The Georgia Institue of Technology is nothing less than a genesis myth, the creation of good and evil.&quot; (Georgia VS. Georgia Tech) Whom you believe to be good or evil depends on the sideyou're on. The Georgia VS Georgia Tech rivalry is alive and well in our state, enduring over one hundred years. Equipment and rules have been subject to change. The emotional intensity has not. In Georgia VS. Georgia Tech, John Cnadler Griffin describes the growth of this college-based conflict from just a game to its modern-day frenzy. Beginning with their first contest in 1893, he presents the players and the plays that fostered this fierce tradition. Georgia VS. Georgia is more than a historical chronology. It is an entertaining analysis of an ongoing football phenomenon. Richly illustrated with over a thousand rare photographs, the book is painstakingly researched and superbly written."},{"Title":"Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Gridiron Grudge Since 1893","review":"Answer: you reduce the game descriptions to the following formula: Date of game, attendance, weather, records of the two teams, list of opponents beaten, list of opponents lost to or tied, a brief synopsis of scoring drives with a few players' names mentioned, cite the turnovers, and give the final score. Repeat a hundred and six times and then publish. Illustrate these chapters with small black and white photographs of the two teams playing (for the most part) other games on their schedule: here's a picture from '76 Tech-USC; here's one from the '76 Georgia-Vanderbilt game (WHY?). Offer no insights, don't quote players or coaches or fans, just the facts. Griffin barely even mentions the wildly controversial call that decided the 1999 game, a call that got national media attention and resulted in the crew being disciplined! And the huge brawl during the 1993 game, which was front-page news the next day, gets no mention at all. What a disappointment: the author, whose lack of ties to (or interest in) either school is pretty apparent, simply read library microfilm and phoned in this lifeless attempt at a Father's Day gift. And may I add in closing that Tech lies and cheats?"},{"Title":"Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Gridiron Grudge Since 1893","review":"This book rocks! The old photos are cool, the organization is clear and easy to follow. My dad and I read it together--he started in the 70 and told me about games he went to when he was at school, then whe talked about games we'd been together when when I was a kid, and games I went to when I was a college--the five-year plan. This is a great book, lots of good pics, and easy to follow. Get it for you dad or yourself and you'll have something to read during the commercials during the season."},{"Title":"Nutrition for the Golden Years: How to Add More Life to Your Life","review":"Since, I have battle with my weight for most of my life, I have read many books on nutrition. And, since, I am almost in the &quot;senior&quot; category, I now also battle a body that no longer does what I want it to, or either doesn't do it as efficently as I want it to. This booklet seems to address both those issues, even though, I an not quite yet a senior.I found this booklet to be a step-above the others I have read because it is succient, direct and gets right to the point. You must eat correctly to maintain your health.By giving case examples of seniors who have fallen into less than healthy eating habits, Ms. Mehl, quickly points out the negative effects of eating poorly. But, she just as quickly points how to correct the situation.I found her example of potassium deficiet particularly pertinient. I have been suffering from leg cramps for some time now. I was told by a friend it was probably caused by a lack of potassium in my diet. One of the first examples in Ms. Mehl's booklet was that of potassium defiency and its relation to muscle pain. She only confirmed what I had previously been told. This, in my mind, lends credibility to the booklet.I do not hesitate to recommend this booklet for those caring for seniors, for seniors themselves, or, for anyone who wishes to improve their eating habits and ultimately the quality of their lives."},{"Title":"Nutrition for the Golden Years: How to Add More Life to Your Life","review":"I have worked extensively with elderly patients and I love this book!

Nancy Mehl, in reading through her resume, is certainly a good author. However, I see no credentials which would make her certifiably knowledgeable in the field of nutrition, or the field of senior health matters.There are some good things in here which are certainly worth reading. But I would beware of taking suggestions from a non-clinical individual, and would recommend requesting information on this subject from a certified health and medical professional before taking too much of the contents to heart."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"i ordered Little TOWN on the prairie for a good friend. i got little HOUSE on the prairie, because they are a sweet and wonderful person, my firend didnt mind, turns out they needed that one too. but it wouldve been nice to get the product i ACTUALLY ordered!!!!!! i was extremely disappointed with this order and the product i got!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I really wanted \\"The Little House on the Prarie\\" and carelessly ordered this instead.

Very Pleased!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I'm now starting to get into my favorite books of the Little House on the Prairie series. For those of you not familiar with the series, they were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder about her life growing up with her Ma, Pa, and sisters while traveling to different home sites. They traveled from the Big Woods of Wisconsin, to Indian Territory, to Minnesota and then finally to the town of De Smet further west. They encountered many hardships but stuck together as a family.This book they are still in DeSmet and it is the summer after the hard winter in which there were blizzards for seven months. They have returned to their land and the claim shanty to begin farming their piece of land when Pa decides that they will go back to town for the winter. While the winter is much milder there is a new sadness for them. Mary will be moving away to go to a College for the blind and Laura must begin studying hard in order to go be a schoolteacher so she can help provide money to keep Mary in school. There are so many things to distract her though, parties, socials, literaries, and the handsome Almanzo Wilder has started taking an interest in her. On the flip side though, her old nemesis from Plum Creek, Nellie Oleson, has moved to the same town and continued to be her rotten self. With all this going on, its hard to say if Laura will be prepared to teach school when she turns sixteen.The characters (I call them such since they are somewhat embellished) are well described. Laura really grows in this book and its nice to see her make the transition from child to young woman. Although I do have to say the descriptions of corsets and hoop skirts make me cringe. Mary is largely absent from the book since she's in college but they do give her mention and Carrie plays a small part. Poor Grace though is hardly mentioned. What I especially liked was that this was the book Almanzo started taking an interested in Laura and it was fun to see the courtship as it was in those times.The writing is perfect for children but not too juvenile for adults to read. Wilder really makes you feel as if you are living in those times. However, I do have to note that there is potentially some offensive things in this book. Ma still doesn't like Indians, but what really stood out is a scene in which Laura describes a play put on at a literary function when they played \\"darkies\\" and danced around. I could be construing it the wrong way, but it definitely could offend. If this scene were removed though, the book would be near perfect.I've always enjoyed reading these books as a child and adult and as I said before this book starts the favorite of my series because of the addition of Almanzo. I'm always a sucker for a romance, even in a kid's novel I guess.Little Town on the PrairieCopyright 1941307 pagesReview by M.

Laura, though she would rather do anything but become a school teacher and though she hates the idea of Mary leaving to go to school far away, begins to study earnestly to earn her certificate so that she can help send Mary to the school for the blind. Her life isn't all study, though. She still enjoys playing outdoors near their claim, going to social gatherings with her family and new school friends and even attending the exciting horse races with Pa. Best of all, perhaps, she catches the eye of a young man in town! To Laura's delight and confusion, Almanzo Wilder, the owner of two beautiful brown horses, chooses to escort her home! Life in the Ingalls family certainly undergoes many changes in this book but its underlying message of the importance of family ties and moral living remain the same. Though I don't think it's the best book in the series, it is charming and often funny and I enjoyed listening to it very much!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I received the little House collection and I have started reading the first of the collection.

After a difficult winter full of one blizzard after another, Laura is happy to be back on the claim shanty with her family, away from the hustle and bustle of town. But she knows that her family will most certainly head back to De Smet to live in the shop before winter comes again, to protect them from the harsh weather that may lie ahead. Weather aside, however, Laura can't believe how many new things are arising. Especially the most important one of all - changes for Mary.Laura couldn't be happier to be back in school again. After so many months of studying on her own, she is thrilled to be back in the classroom with her old friends Mary and Minnie, and Ida. But there's someone new in the classroom. A person from Laura's past who makes Laura shake with anger - Nellie Oleson. Laura, however, is determined to ignore the nasty Nellie and study as hard as she possibly can in order to gain her teaching certificate, and help to send Mary to college. But even without her being a part of the workforce, Mary is able to go off to college, and Laura couldn't be happier - or more devastated. But seeing how much Mary loves college, Laura resolves to study even harder, and begin earning the money to assist in keeping her there. Of course, Laura never imagined that things could possibly stand in her way. Such as the selfish new schoolteacher who thrives on taunting and humiliating both Laura and Carrie in front of the other students; and working as a seamstress in town. But the most shocking of all, is Almanzo Wilder's sudden interest in young Laura. Almanzo is a handsome fellow, whose Morgan horses are the talk of the town, and now Almanzo seems to have taken a fancy to Laura - something that leaves her confused and excited at the same time. But no matter what, she must remember to continue her studies, or else Mary may have to return home before her education is complete.It seems strange to bear witness as someone ages, but that is exactly what readers have had the opportunity to do as Laura Ingalls grows in age, height, and maturity. The love she holds for her family is so refreshing and charming, and truly keeps the reader's interest peaked; while the constant maturity Laura displays in each and every one of her decisions is just unbelievable. Laura has completely grown up before our eyes, and each year she just becomes more and more lovable. The inclusion of facts regarding the changes taking place during this era are interesting, and present a fun learning experience for readers; while the sudden budding romances springing up around the young people of De Smet indicates just how much older these characters have become. Almanzo Wilder has grown on me over the past few books, and I love reading the scenes where he is present; and Nellie Oleson, as nasty as she is, will always remain a fun character whom you absolutely love to hate, but hate to love. This series just gets better and better!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"It's wonderful to see how my children love listening to these books over and over, now that we've been collecting the CDs. The little details really stick in their heads, and have been surprisingly useful tidbits of information on several occasions, as they hear or read other things that relate!When I first bought the CDs, I was unsure about Cherry Jones' accent, but it just brings a nice, down-home aspect to the reading. Of course, the readings are unabridged - the only way to go, I think!My favorite part of the CDs, though, is hearing the songs, often accompanied by a fiddle. As a child, I remember skipping over the songs as I encountered them in the text, especially those I didn't know, and it has really added to the experience of the books to hear an actual tune for them. Often, the songs reflect the mood of the moment exceptionally well. Cherry Jones sings them out (usually as Pa!) in her low alto voice, and you do really have to hear a few of them to get used to it, but we love them."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"What shocks me in retrospect is how young Laura Ingalls was when she was given so much responsibility. As this novel of life in growing DeSmet the spring and summer after the long winter shows, Laura at age fifteen was already in possession of a license to teach school, and she was being courted by a man well into his twenties. I think just how young fifteen is escaped me back during my first reading when I was nine. This book tells about Mary's preparations for enrollment at a college for the blind, about Laura's becoming a teacher, about the boon to the family well-being the acquisition of a kitten is, and as always is the case in the Little House books, it charms us with its positive reflection of life in frontier America."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I have to admit that I never really cared to much about this series.

Also, these books have fiddle music to accompany them just as Pa might have played for the Ingalls' family. If you're reading these books out loud to your kids, do yourself, your voice, and your children a favor and listen to the audio books featuring Cherry Jones. Outstanding!

We've borrowed most of them but I'm buying this one)."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Little Town on the Prairie, by Laura Ingalls WilderAfter the long, long winter the shining sun warmed the Dakota prairie. The Ingalls moved back to their shanty on their claim, and life continued. Work took up all their time in the spring. Pa had a new plow for breaking the prairie sod; it spared the horses, and Pa too. After the planting was done Pa and Laura built the missing part of the claim shanty; now there was two bedrooms. There is a new problem in the cornfield; gophers ate half of the kernels. A good cat would help here. Pa loses some of his hair to a mouse. The many new settlers resulted in the need to organize a county. When Pa returned he brought a kitten for them to raise. Pa worked as a carpenter in town building the new church. Laura hoped she could get a job teaching school when she turned sixteen. Pa could not hunt game, but could only buy meat. Mrs. Brant would give a setting of eggs, so they would have chickens (if hawks or weasels or foxes didn't get them). Better times were coming! Their little kitty killed its first mouse. Pa tells Laura she could work in town sewing shirts for bachelors. Laura had never seen a store that sold only dry goods. She also saw another type of family life. Laura also saw two drunken men.After six weeks of work, Laura experienced a lay-off. The Ingalls got 14 chicks, a gift from Mrs. Boast. The Fourth of July starts with a \\"BOOM\\", and Laura walks to town with Pa and Carrie (Chapter 8). They hear firecrackers and a speech. There is a threat from \\"Spanish needle grass\\", and blackbirds are eating the shocked oats. \\"Earthly life is a battle\\" said Ma (p.89). Chapter 9 tells of the complications in women's dresses. The blackbirds were devouring their corn and oats. Pa shot as many as he could, and they found they were good to eat. The new school year sees Mary going away to a college in Iowa. Laura and Carrie return to the town school, and note how it has grown in the last year. Laura is surprised to find Nellie Oleson at school! Nellie puts on airs, but Pa tells Laura that Mr. Oleson lost his business and is just like the other homesteaders (p.135). In the fall they picked and packed vegetables for winter in town. The town was prepared for a harsh winter. But little Carrie was thin and pale. The new teacher Miss Wilder seemed to favor Nellie Oleson. There is trouble, and Laura and Carrie are sent home from school by the teacher. The children resent this teacher, and were disorderly. Nellie was two-faced (p.172).One morning Almanzo offers Laura a ride to school, and they exchange name cards. The people in town start a literary society for their entertainment and education. Pa Ingalls suggests a formal organization could get in the way of the functions (Chapter 18). They chose sides for a spelling match. On Thanksgiving they attend a church supper. In late March they are entertained by a minstrel show. The new grass shows in April, and so does a surprise blizzard. Two newcomers from the East were lost (they did not dig into a haystack). Kitty caught more gophers, and some blackbirds. Mr. Owen, the new teacher, taught Willie Oleson to do better in school. The Ingalls family goes to the revival meeting. Almanzo walks Laura home from the revival meeting every night. Laura was invited to a sleigh ride. They celebrate their first Christmas without Mary, and feel sad. Laura meets Mr. Brewster, who is looking for a new teacher in their district, and wants Laura! Laura accepts this job offer, contingent upon getting a teaching certificate. The Superintendent of School tests and passes Laura to teach. Laura will start next week. Pa is on the school board, and knows Mr. Brewster."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"In this exciting tale of Ingalls, Laura and Mary grow up. Everyone is looking forward to Mary getting to attend the college for the blind in Iowa with a little help from her family. Now the Ingallses are moving from the Dakota prairie to the growing town while Laura gathers her courage to study. One night she meets and falls in love with a beloved horserider, Almanzo Wilder. But she keeps her feelings secret. In the meantime, Laura is relieved when she was one of the few people who would get a teacher's certificate.I believe that the characters of this story had so much detail I couldn't put the book down. Yes, it was more exciting than going to Great America. The charcters talk so you feel like their conversation happened yesterday. Yes, the cover is excellent. The pictures helped me to imagine what the story looked like. They make the story much clearer.I would rate the book five stars. I think six year olds or seven year olds would enjoy it. I think girls and boys both would like it."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Laura's teenage years, her feelings and thoughts and actions, are memorably recorded in this book. Laura's feud with her unfair teacher (and future sister-in-law!) is hilarious! And her equally strong feud with an old childhood rival, who somehow managed to end up traveling from Minnesota to South Dakota at roughly the same time as Laura, is also amusing. Nellie wants to ride behind Almanzo Wilder's beautiful horses, but Laura ends up *marrying* the guy! (Not in this book, but you can pretty much see where it's going.) And the baby kitten, and Mary's desire to go to college and Laura's desire to sacrifice for that goal....Well, this is just a good, good book."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"When Eliza Jane was the teacher, in the beginning the kids were nice. Every day at recess Nellie stayed inside. Laura had a feeling that Nellie was telling bad things about Laura. The boys started being mean and Laura made up a rhyme about Eliza Jane and it got around when the boys grabbed the slate. I think people should read this book to find out what happend when Eliza Jane was the teacher, and about how Mary went to college. Mom likes how they cleaned the house when the parents went away. Even Grace &quot;helped.&quot; And she likes the parts where Laura and Almanzo got to know each other."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"More adventures of the Ingalls family, full of the loving details that make these stories come alive.

It is about the beloved Laura Ingalls, while she is growing up."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I am rating thisbook in reference to the abridged edtion this is. The Laura Ingalls books are classics, and its sad how they are cutting them short in these cheap imitations."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I read this book to my two sons, 7, 9 and my husband, during long drives. We all loved it. Even though the main character is a girl, my boys were interested the entire time and identified with Laura. The descriptions are great and the characters are well-drawn. We're now reading These Happy Golden Years and my family is loving that, too. I recommend this book for a family to read together."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"This is a charming, entertaining, and educational story about what life was like among homesteaders in the Dakota territories in the 1880s. I mostly agree with the other positive reviews here. But there is a teaching moment in this book that should not be overlooked. The parents in this book are paragons of virtue, and their behavior matches the highest standards - standards of 1880, not 2006. There is a short scene during one of the \\"literaries\\" where several men perform in blackface. Although it occurs with innocent intent, modern readers might find it in questionable taste if they don't allow for the historical context.If they're smart, parents and teachers will embrace this as an opportunity to open a discussion with children about changing standards, and the work it took to improve those standards."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"The town of De Smet is filled with relief! The long horrible winter is finally over. Everyone is so happy to be able to have fun outside and to eat real meals again!The Ingalls family is back out on the claim and Laura is thrilled! She loves to run through the grass and help Pa with the chores.The book starts with Laura accepting a job in town. She is uncertain about how she will handle being cooped up inside all day, but she is eager to earn money for Mary's schooling.Fourth of July comes and Pa takes Laura and Carrie into town for the celebration. The town is bursting with activity. The girls are nervous about being in such a crowd, but they are excited to drink fresh cool lemonade and to watch the horse races.All too soon it is time for Mary to attend college. They all know how wonderful it will be for her and how happy she will be to be learning and growing in a world that teaches her how to live blind. All of these good things do not diminish the aches in their hearts as they bid sweet, gentle, thoughtful Mary good-bye.When Laura and Carrie start school again, they are dismayed to see Nellie Olson appear! They do not want to have to deal with her again. True to form, Nellie causes trouble, which makes this section of the book very entertaining. Laura is such a spitfire that it is fun to read of her adventures.This winter in town is a far cry from their last winter. This winter brings laughter and gaiety in the form of name cards, literaries, a birthday party and rides with Almonzo with his beautiful Morgan horses.'Little Town on the Prairie' is a delightful book. It is interesting, entertaining and often funny. You will enjoy it! I enthusiastically recommend you add it to your collection!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"This (and Happy Golden Years) is my favorite book of the Little House series. The Ingalls family is doing well; the town has recovered from the Hard Winter; and Laura is changing from a girl into a woman. The descriptions of the characters and the surroundings are vivid and real. I don't care if Rose Wilder Lane wrote most of the books or not - the Little House series is a gift to all readers, not just young readers! I'm in my 30's and I still love to read them periodically, but this is one of my very favorites."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Twenty four years ago, I was a ten year old girl who saved every last penny to save $35.00 to buy the Little House on The Prairie boxed set by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was my love of the TV show that started the savings venture...I heard it was based on a true story and I needed to know all the details. What happened when I received those books, and read them one after another that year changed me into a fan of the show, into a full fledge Laura Ingalls Wilder enthusiast. Why? Because of the simple beauty of the pioneer tales within. Stories that show that even when things are worse than you or I can imagine, family and faith still bring hope and contentment. Little Town on the Prairie is one of my two favorite stories. Even as a ten year old I loved watching Laura turn into a lady in this story. Its been several years since I read this one, and taking a break from my regular readings seemed a good idea. I noticed that I picked up new little things this time around. I can read different things into that meeting with Almonzo where he and Laura change cards, I can feel the shame and tension in the school house scene where Laura defends Carrie to Ms. Wilder (I think I felt this horror anew from a parents perspective) and I also noticed Ma's prejudices against the Indians more keenly as well. There was a scene I even felt uncomfortable with. In a social gathering at the school, some of the town's men dressed in black paint and acted like \\"darkies\\" to the amusement of the audience. I think Laura herself, would flinch from that in this day and age. But again, it only emphasizes the times the Ingalls family were living in, and how far this country has come. The country has made mistakes along the way (slavery and the Trail of Tears, for example). But where we are now is in no little part, due to the efforts of the brave pioneers like the Ingalls family. This is a historical, christian, pre-romance, and tale of growing from child to woman all in one and there is no doubt in my mind, why this remains a beloved story to children and adults everywhere today."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"First let me say that I read this in the full-color collector's edition, and it was lovely. Thick, glossy pages that could withstand much \\"love\\" and Garth Williams' lovely drawings enhanced with color. Very nice.In Little Town on the Prairie, Laura is about 15 and the Ingalls family spends most of the narrative in the town of DeSmet, South Dakota. Laura has adapted to town life (compare her discomfort at being surrounded by strangers in By the Shores of Silver Lake) and is experiencing life as a young lady in frontier society in the 1880's. The period detail is rich and rewarding in this book, and in its own way, Little Town shows Laura struggling with the need to \\"fit in\\" with her peers, just as every teenager experiences today. For Laura, it's having a chance to select her own printed \\"name cards\\" and exchange them with her friends. ($0.25 for a dozen cards, a princely sum by Ingalls' standards). She also experiences a bit of evil glee at seeing the tables turned on Nellie Oleson, who is now the poor country girl. On the other hand, we see Laura work steadfastly at a hated job of sewing sleeves on men's shirts, because of her dedication to giving Mary a chance to attend college for the blind. She also dedicates herself to studying for a teacher's license so she can further supplement the family's income, and at the end of the book achieves her goal, via a lie of omission (something that Ma surely would have disapproved!).In a remarkable section, Laura describes sewing an elegant winter dress for Mary to wear at college, and then casually tosses in that they made a hat to go with it! How on earth does one make a hat, and isn't it remarkable that Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't think hat-making merited any special mention?We also see the intellectual side of Ma and Pa, as they go head-to-head in a fierce spelling bee competition. Pa is primarly a businessman in Little Town, which is a delightful contrast to his handyman skills that were so prominently on display in the earlier Little House volumes. Pa also delights in creating Literary Society productions for Friday nights in town. There is a queasy-making (by modern standards) chapter describing a blackface show, which may provoke some important discussions between parents and children. Ma is ever the conscientious molder of young women's behavior; it's a thankless job but someone has to do it.Finally, Little Town is where Laura begins to be courted by Almanzo Wilder. He walks her home from the Literary Society several times, and gives her a sleighride behind his glorious team of horses. Tame stuff by modern standards, but Ma and Pa's tightlipped and cautious acceptance of this much-older man in Laura's life tells us everything we need to know."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Little Town on the Prairie is my favourite book out of all the \\"Little House\\" series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I enjoyed this book more than the other books because it was happier, for there were not so many depressing times the Ingalls family had to endure.The title is self-explanatory, a little town on the prairie, which is in Dakota, USA. The story is set during the 1880's. The Ingalls family, consisting of six people, was always moving from place to place. When they came to Dakota, they were very happy with it. Their little \\"shanty\\" that they stayed in during the summer was built into a new, improved house. Mary, the oldest sister, is accepted into the college of the blind, and Laura continues school and has a summer job. Things are going very well at the Ingalls household. There is enough food for everyone, and there wasn't another hard winter, like everyone expected. Most problems have solutions like when there were gophers eating their corn, they got a cat to kill them. The only problem is school, because of the new teacher, Eliza Jane Wilder. She is Almanzo Wilder's sister. She turns out to be horribly mean to Laura and her younger sister, Carrie, because Nellie Oleson (Laura's enemy mentioned before in \\"The Banks of Plum Creek\\") told the teacher negative remarks about Laura. Soon, a new teacher replaces her. All of the problems work themselves out somehow, which is what I like about this book.In my opinion, Laura Ingalls Wilder does an exquisite job captivating all her readers with her refined choice of words, meticulous detail, and up-beat plot. This is absolutely the best piece she's written. She does an admirable job of describing the setting so it makes you feel like you're right there, witnessing the whole scene. The book also has a good balance of good times and bad times, because if it was all bad times the book would seem depressing, and if it was all good times, the book would seem hard to believe. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy realistic fiction or historical fiction. I think a possible theme for this story would be hold on, things will get better. This theme is displayed throughout all the \\"Little House\\" series. This is my all time favourite book, and I hope you enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Since I've first read this book when I was a little younger than Laura, so I was really excited to read what life was like 'back then' for kids my age.The hard winter is finally over, and the Ingalls family finally moves out to their claim, where Laura enjoys the outside work and the sunshine. But then she is offered a job as a seamstress in town, and takes it even though she misses the outdoors. The work is hard, and the environment is unpleasant, but Laura sticks it out.Ma=ry finally has a chance to go to the blind college in Iowa, and while Ma and Pa take her there, Laura, Carrie and Grace clean the house.School finally begins again, and an unpleasant surprise comes along on the first day - Nellie Oleson from Plum Creek, who schemes and causes trouble. The high point of this situation is the troble between Laura and Ms. Wilder, the teacher, who only hears unpleasant things about Laura from Nellie, and Laura's short temper, especially where Carrie is concerned, does not help the situation... But Ida, the new girl, is nice enough to make up for Nellie's unpleasantness.Laura is grown up enough to want fashionable cloths and all other fashionable things other girls her age in school have, such as name cards. She is invited to parties and attends her first evening sociable.We start seeing the relationship between Laura and Almanzo Wilder start developing (even though I think her relationship with his sister, her unpleasant ex - school teacher, might give things an interesting twist)."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I have recently started listening/collecting the Little House series on CD. This one, so far, has been my favorite. After finishing it the first time, I had no qualms about immediately plugging in CD 1 again!The book begins with Pa asking Laura, \\"How would ya like to work in town?\\" and thus begins Laura's career as an assistant shirt-maker. It is hard work for one who hates to sit still, but the money she is making for Mary's college education keeps her going. Eventually, the work ends and life goes on in a leisurely way that summer. They celebrate the Fourth of July, and Laura vows to one day ride behind Almanzo Wilder's Morgan horses. I especially loved how Cherry Jones read the Declaration of Independence.Mary does get to go to college in this book, and Miss Wilder comes to teach school. On the first day of school, who should show up but Nellie Olsen! Of course, that always makes the story interesting. It doesn't take long for the reader to find out that Miss Wilder is totally ineffectual at keeping order in the schoolroom. However, she seems to find pleasure at punishing Laura and Carrie (the ONLY students she EVER reprimands in any way) for things totally inconsequential. The children soon find great pleasure in irritating and mocking \\"Lazy, Lousy Lizzy Jane\\". One thing that Nellie Olsen brings \\"from the east\\" (or so she says) is the exchanging of name cards. Pa realizes how much Laura would like to have these, and so gives her the money to buy them. On the day that she picks them up, who should offer her a ride back to school but Almanzo Wilder and his team of Morgan horses! She tells him of her reason for going to the newspaper office, and he, in turn, shows her his name card. Not knowing what to do with it exactly, Laura asks him if he wants his card back. He says no, so she feels obligated to give him one of hers (after all, Nellie said that you must EXCHANGE them). I thought that part was very sweet.Eventually, Laura feels life settling into a rut. As the rest of the townspeople were feeling the same way, they set out to form a \\"literary society\\". Basically, everyone gets together every Friday night for some form of entertainment or another. The first night is a spelling bee, with everyone in town participating. Each literary just got better and better, and soon everyone was buzzing with excitement over them. This starts other exciting things happening, such as a New England Supper given on Thanksgiving night and a birthday party for one of the boys at school. Life continues on in a merry way, and the revival meetings came. Laura and her family attended faithfully every night, for \\"those who don't go to revival are ATHEISTS\\" (or so declars Nellie Olsen). It is at this time that Laura has the unexpected pleasure of Almanzo Wilder asking her every night \\"May I see ya home?\\"At the end of the school year, Laura gives a fine recitation of the history of the US. It happens that a man looking for a schoolteacher for his town is there. The next day, he arrives unexpectedly to ask Laura to be their teacher! She takes the examination and receives her teaching certificate. This is what she has been waiting and working for so long in order to help pay for Mary's college education.It is here that the book ends. I can't wait for the next one to come out. How will she do teaching at her first school? Will Almanzo Wilder continue to pursue her, or will the distance be too much?"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I am a 54 year old man and just started reading these books to my grand children and I was really interested in the differences between the series and the books.It does not matter as to how old or young you are, get the whole series as I did and you will imagine you are living with the Ingalls on the prarie. I could not put them down. BUY THEM ALL"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"(...) But this next book, Little Town on the Prairie, is outstanding. The Ingalls have a short winter this year and everything seems to go right. But like we all know, even though we are warm and fed, problems just seem to come along. Now that Laura is 14 and 15 years old, she learns to care about and appreciate other people besides just her immediate family. She likes Ida, Cap, Mary Power and Minnie. She goes to a fancy birthday party for a boy named Frank. We see that she is becoming a beautiful young lady and she starts describing clothes and hairstyles in detail.She even buys the latest thing - name cards. And when she sees Almonzo,she says \\"I was just picking up my name cards\\". MY name cards. Like she was so totally in fashion forever. She is very smart and can do long division in her head. There are many fun social occasions in this book and some exciting power struggles with the teacher, Eliza Jane(Almonzo's sister), Nellie Oleson, etc. This is absolutely the most enjoyable book in the series. But I said that last time. Next will be \\"These Happy Golden Years\\". It can't be better than this one, but I've just got to see what happens! I can't close without again mentioning how much you learn in this book. This book teaches social history. You learn how to operate a corsett, hoop skirt, and what a lunatic fringe is, and how to curl your hair without a curling iron. You find out what to do when plagued by blackbirds and gophers, what to do when you're \\"home alone\\", and how to behave at your first paying job. This book is the beginning of the end of the little Ingalls family. Mary goes away to college, and soon Laura will become a teacher. We all have to face it sooner or later, our children will grow up. See how an ideal family handles it, with grace and love."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"As a teacher, I utilize the Little House audiobooks on a regular basis. So far, all of the other audiobooks have been tracked logically, based on chapter. However, the tracks on this CD set were organized rather haphazardly: chapters end and new chapters begin within a single track, without rhyme or reason. This may seem a minor detail, but to a teacher who assigns daily chapter readings, it's a real annoyance!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"To those who watched the TV show and then read the books will probably be disappointed by how different the books and tv series are. But the books are the real story and they are wonderful"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Little Town On The Prairie is book 7 in the series. This story begins in De Smet again. The townsfolks are relieved the long winter has finally ened and now they can finally move on and enjoy spring. With Mary's future still uncertain, Laura gets a job working as a seamstress in order to help earn enough money to send Mary to college. Laura is still too young to teach, but now she still has to prepare herself for the future. Unfortunately for her, an old nemesis causes trouble for both her and her sister Carrie, jeopardizing her chances for getting into a good school. Laura's teacher happens to be the sister of Almanzo Wilder, the young man who, along with his brother Royal, saved her family from starvation. Miss Wilder sets out to jeopardize Laura's chances at becoming a teacher. Pa, upon hearing of what happened, defends Laura, saying she would be a fine teacher one day. Just when it seems Laura's chances for teaching are dashed, she receives the best news of all: she has now been certified and can teach when she is sixteen. She is both happy but terrified. What if she can't meet everyone's expectations? Pa reassures her she will do just fine."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"My daughter is writing this review: Before I went to the library, I was thinking about this book. Then I borrowed it. Then when my dad was looking at his books, I started reading the book. You couldn't imagine how I loved it. It was AWESOME.I didn't want to stop. When my dad came and said it's time to go home, I kept having to ask for extensions, as I said before I just couldn't stop. Even when I came home, I didn't want to stop. I later purchased this book!

What were the book makers thinking...!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"In the other books, Laura and her family were more isolated. Part of this was of course due to her youth, but as Laura moves into womanhood, she is able to enjoy and do more things, and be treated more as an adult, including getting jobs to help raise funds for her sister to go to a college for the blind. Town life is also emphasized here, as opposed to living in the big woods and the prairie. And lo and behold, here's Nellie Oleson again! Yes, really! And she has the same bratty attitude as well, which makes for some rather entertaining parts in this book. Overall a great book in the Little House series, if you've enjoyed the other books you will enjoy this one too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"Like many readers, I enjoyed watching Laura grow up: putting her hair up and letting her dresses down, attending her first boy-girl party, and house-sitting for a week while Ma and Pa saw Mary safely off to college. Laura had good work ethic, and academic diligence beyond most girls her age. She sacrificed much of her spare time to study hard enough to get teaching certification. Though she did not especially want to become a teacher, she was determined to earn money for Mary's college tuition. I liked Laura best when her fun or fiesty side showed itself. She couldn't help laughing her head off when two town drunks made a fairly innocuous scene in public, and she was playful at recess when the boys wanted to take the girls for sled rides. She fiercely stood up to her teacher (and sister-in-law in the future!) when that woman was mean to little sister Carrie. In Little Town, Laura also learned about the repercussions of gossip, and how to remain neutral but respectful when caught in the middle of others' conflicts. She experienced the excitement of literaries, potluck dinner fundraisers, and the attentions of the older handsome Almanzo. One of my favorite things about this book was the way in which Laura and Mary bonded during long walks. They talked about their sibling rivalry as kids. They were able to talk about Laura's resentment toward such a 'good' older sister, and Mary's secret enjoyment of her role and others' praise. For years, Mary did chide Laura for not being absolutely literal when she described things, but Laura's knack for metaphor and simile led HER to lay the foundations for these wonderful books. I think both girls did much growing during the final books of the series, Mary in capability and Laura in self-confidence. It was a joy to read about the entire family's changes, and about the excitement of living in a fast-growing town."},{"Title":"Little Town on the Prairie","review":"This is a great story in this series. I love reading about the little kitten that they got. I also like reading about Lauras new job."},{"Title":"Love and Time","review":"Professor Seaton is a remarkable translator. The essence and simplicity of Chinese poetry are so easily lost by casual or inept translation. Overembelishment, attempts to rhyme, and verbosity are the natural enemies of clear, poignant Chinese verse. But you won't find any of that here.Ou-Yang Hsiu is a wonder and a delight. His poetry is fresh, simple, charming; yet richly imbued with perception, emotion, and understanding. In this thin, wonderful volume, master poet--by way of the efforts of master translator--arrives as fresh and vital as he must have appeared in original form, 900 years back.I had the great good fortune of taking several courses with Professor Seaton some twenty five years ago. His knowledge of his subject and his exuberance are clearly unflagging. I've already ordered five volumes of this book, and will likely exhaust its availability before running out of interested friends who want copies of their own."},{"Title":"Love and Time","review":"This thin book of poetry is quite nice, though I'd have preferred a bigger selection of this master poet's work. I find some of the translations to be strangely minimalistic, as if the translator is attempting to reproduce the style of the original monosyllabic Chinese. It is successful, to a degree, though some of the translations leave me wondering, \\"what is the poet saying?\\" Seaton is a long-time highly respected translator of Chinese poetry. This is a good addition to anyone's collection of Chinese poems in English translation, given the caveat above.One comment about the cover - the ink used for the front and back covers fades easily. I cannot read the blurb on the back cover because the color has faded so much. This may be because my used copy sat in the sunlight for a long time. I don't judge a book by its blurb (though I'm always interested in what blurbs have to say), but this is a problem with my own copy and may or may not apply to new copies."},{"Title":"The Gospels","review":"This remarkable translation from the koine Greek of the Gospel accounts is made with the practiced skill of the scholar.

Some of the content was OK, but the grammatical errors and different writing styles made it a very disappointing read. There were four different authors which contributed to the flow problems, and it was obvious that some of the chapters were more poorly written than others. In addition, it didn't seem like anyone even proofed the book. I can understand a few errors, but I found myself re-reading sentence after sentence trying to understand what words were missing, misspelled or out-of-place.The chapter on transactions was pretty decent. I liked the information on compensating transactions, which I had heard called three phase commit previously. The chapter on UDDI was pretty decent as well.

The first chapter is not only an excellent introduction to SOA; it also addressed the change of mindset you have to implement to succeed. The requirement discussion is chapter two is also excellent. It challenges the use-case driven development from RUP (and other story-based development methods) and shows how a successful SOA implementation within IT and business makes it possible to make a simple and direct mapping from business requirements to services. I also find the emphasis on information services important!

No, they didn't ask permission for use, and there are so many spelling and grammatical errors that it is obvious they cut corners in other places, too.

Raised during the depression area, Ms Berry relates the hardships her family endured, but also shows the spirit of unity of family to survive through hard times. In this work, she communicates to the reader the commitment of friends, the importance of love, and the appreciation of the smallest blessings.I found this book to be truly heart-felt in it's meaning.

Covering almost every aspect of life, its pages are filled with not only with very practical advice for day to day living, but also with so many spiritual insights. Using her own first-hand experiences as both a model in Paris, and a Personal Image Consultant in Beverly Hills, the author gently guides the reader through simple steps to enhance appearance, style and health, through make up, clothing and diet. The suggestions are so straightforward and easy to follow, that each page boosts the confidence and leaves the reader with the impression of having his/her own personal consultant at hand. But 'Getting Real' doesn't stop there! The author leads the reader from the outward appearance to the underlying source of beauty within. With chapters on creating a more orderly environment, clearer ways of thinking, sex and music, Cheryl Hilliard unobtrusively reaches to the soul in a manner rarely experienced.

The fonts and paragraph style are dense and hard to access. I'm a senior with a 4.0 GPA: I know textbooks.2.

Buy it - you will LOVE it!"},{"Title":"Humor After the Tumor: One Woman's Look at Her Year With Breast Cancer","review":"In this most impressive little book, the author Patty Gelman chronicles in a series of emails her breast cancer diagnosis and a subsequent year of treatment that she underwent for the disease. As she explains, this method of keeping in touch with concerned family and friends seemed the easiest and most logical one for her, when talking on the phone or in person was often more than she could handle. Writing the emails also proved therapeutic, Gelman writes. They became a way to acknowledge and express the wide range of emotions she felt while encountering the many challenges that presented themselves throughout that eventful year.It is not at all surprising that recipients of Gelman's emails encouraged her to put them together in book form, thus making them available to the many women and their families who travel a similar road. It is also not at all surprising that Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, where Gelman's doctors are, decided to publish the book -- and to accept all proceeds from it, which Gelman so generously has offered to them. The fact is that Gelman is inspirational. While certainly confronting the broad philosophic dimensions of her disease and the painful side effects of chemotherapy, she is ultimately down-to-earth, practical, and humane -- and so witty and funny! Readers will find themselves laughing out loud, as I so often did, and will quickly understand why Gelman's title -- Humor after the Tumor -- is the obvious right choice. Incidentally, the cover photo of Gelman (and of her golden retriever Kambel, a major player in the drama) is worth the price of the book. Gelman exudes warmth and optimism and will undoubtedly encourage anyone who is in the midst of her own breast cancer journey."},{"Title":"Humor After the Tumor: One Woman's Look at Her Year With Breast Cancer","review":"Patty Gelman's experience with breast cancer is an inspiratinal story. Her candid, funny, and honest veiwpoint is something that anyone who knows someone with breast cancer or has been directly affected can read and relate to on several levels. It is refreshing to read something about such a significant experience without complex medical terms and a positive outlook. Patty takes you through her year long experience with stories in which all of us can relate."},{"Title":"Humor After the Tumor: One Woman's Look at Her Year With Breast Cancer","review":"Patty Gelman's book is one of those gems that is informative, funny, sensitive,and above all, sympathetic to the concerns of cancer patients. I highly recommend it. As a physician in the Boston area, this is a book I'd recommend for patients about to undergo the often stressful and worrisome journey toward curing his/her cancer. Humor After the Tumor would certainly get them smiling and help ease their tension."},{"Title":"Humor After the Tumor: One Woman's Look at Her Year With Breast Cancer","review":"This is a great gift to anyone who is facing the fierce fight of cancer.

They have a lot of pictures of fish disections to show the effects of disease. I would rather just have a book with pictures of sick fish that are still alive. I need that sort of info to figure out what my fish may have."},{"Title":"BREATHLESS CL","review":"I loved Desalvo's Crazy in the Kitchen and was very eager to read this book, as both my sons have asthma. However, I found this read extremely irritating. Of course, one can only write from one's own perspective, but Desalvo's perspective on asthma is so very different than that of so many asthma sufferers, young children. She seems overly involved in her own illness, and fascinated by her own symptoms, which do not seem terribly severe to me. Mainly, however, I was annoyed by her view of asthma as a illness caused by emotional trauma---a view that has long been discredited. Certainly it's a more interesting topic to write about than it would be to attribute asthma to traditional medical causes, and it allows her to explore asthma in literature, but it also reminds me of those bashing \\"refrigerator mothers\\" for autism. I think her asthma could be quite easily explained in part by living near NYC and driving through polluted air each day, and working in a closed building near smokers.I think this book should be seen as a survey of asthmatics in literature, and not in any way as a depiction and explanation of asthma as a disease."},{"Title":"Ripples on a Pond","review":"Ripples On A Pond is the story of Temple Minnis, a placid, privileged, picturesque, affluent village that behind a smooth facade there lurks an old and ugly secret. Thirty years earlier the villagers had conspired to plan and conceal a murder. But now Melissa, a local novelist who discovers that she is dying, is having pangs of conscience and writes the story of what happened so long ago. The result is that lives are turned upside down as members of the village must now face up to their past. Author Madge Swindells is clearly a writer of great storytelling skill and an original imagination as she brings a tale of memorable characters and unexpected plot twists to life in the mind's eye of the reader. Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"The Arabs as master slavers","review":"This important book discusses the oft overlooked subject of Africans depopulated and shipped to Arab countries as slaves. This work docuents not just the history of the massive slave trade to Arab lands, that numbered in the millions stretching back to the 7t century but more importantly this book documents modern day slavery in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the middle east and north africa. Here we are given an insight into many parts of the Islamic slave trade, a fascinating topic. The final chapter is an interesting discussion of the role of women in Islamic societies and documents many sad and cruel rituals that women undergoe in rural soceity throughout the middle east. These rituals involve such barbaric practices as bleeding the women to make sure she is a virgin during the marriage ceremony. An important quick read.Seth J.

Perhaps the individuals writing them consider themselves \\"gods\\" in cyberspace, which causes me to wonder, if they know so much, why did they buy the book in the first place?Published in 1998, the book is certainly outdated by the phenomenal advances in interactive multi-media technology, but I never-the-less consider it a superb introduction to new possibilities.For me, although I have some exposure to technology, this book was an eye-opener. Initially I wondered why people would spend so much time in cyberspace \\"avatar-acting\\" but then I had two \\"aha\\" experiences from the book that easily earn it five stars:1) In a similar vein to the early work in \\"cyber-cafe's\\" where interactive audio-visual was put into gathering places for Hispanics and for Negros (and perhaps whites and Asians also, but these are the two I remember), avatars break down barriers to sincere interaction. Of course they open paths for deception as well, but the key point here is that if in cyberspace no one knows you are ugly, you can focus on substance.2) The second \\"aha\\" experience occured when I turned this book upside down and asked myself, if we can create avatars that are imaginary, can we go the other way? Can we feed real-time real-world information into a \\"serious\\" game and go to the next level, where the public can literally \\"be\\" the President, \\"see\\" all intelligence about anything that is available to Google, and experiment with alternative behaviors, policies and investment options?I spend a lot of time reading (#66 over-all, #1 for non-fiction about global issues) and this book was a real pleasure to read, and an extremely valuable catalyst to my thinking.

It provided an basic overview of the worlds, a brief history, and how to manuever around in them, however this failed to give any substance to the writting.As the author notes in the forward, this was his first attempt at writting, and it clearly shows as entire text was written at an elementary school level. This made the reading uninteresting as well as uninformative.For those uninitiated with the Internet, virtual worlds, or any other form technology, this might serve as a good spring board.

I would only reccomend this book to people who hate animals."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"Though most famous for novels and non-fiction, Mark Twain is one of the all-time great short story writers. His shorts are indeed as essential as his other work. This magnificent collection is currently the most popular - not to mention the most comprehensive that can be easily found -, making it one of the few works that truly belongs on everyone's bookshelf.It has sixty stories over nearly 700 pages, arranged chronologically and covering Twain's whole writing career. Included are some of the most famous and best short stories ever, such as \\"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\\" \\"The Stolen White Elephant,\\" \\"Luck,\\" \\"The One Million Pound Bank-Note,\\" \\"The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,\\" \\"A Dog's Tale,\\" \\"Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,\\" and \\"The Mysterious Stranger.\\" It also has some of my personal favorites like \\"A Double-Barreled Detective Story\\" and \\"Was It Heaven? Or Hell?\\" The quality and variety is simply astonishing; it is hard to believe a single person could produce such greatness, and to have it all in one book is simply incredible. One of the most fascinating things is to see how Twain's stories grew darker. Though often sharply satirical, early pieces are nearly all light-hearted and often comical - some of the more memorably pleasant light reading in existence. However, Twain became ever more embittered, and his stories - some of which he dared not have published while alive - clearly reflect this. Dark masterpieces like \\"Hadleyburg\\" and \\"The Mysterious\\" seethe with misanthropy and deep pessimism. The contrast is nothing less than stunning and sometimes makes transitions awkward, but the chronological approach is still the best way to appreciate the breadth of Twain's accomplishment. Some stories are less good, but there is more to make us laugh, cry, and think here than in most writers' whole careers; Twain is one of the few truly immortal artists, and this is an essential part of his legacy.There is no arguing with what is here; editor Charles Neider even includes excellent works like \\"The Diary of Adam and Eve\\" that are not often given in such collections as well as thirteen selections culled from non-fiction books. However, the title is misleading, and hard-cores will notice many omissions. All significant works qualifying as short stories by the strictest definition are here, but Twain wrote many short pieces that straddled the border between fiction and various genres. This included numerous pieces before \\"The Notorious,\\" universally considered his first real literary effort, but they are very minor and of interest only to true diehards and scholars. More significant, though, are multiple omissions of works - many from late in his career - that dramatized various sociopolitical, philosophical, and theological concerns in quasi-fictional form. These include some very substantial works such as \\"The Private History of a Campaign That Failed,\\" \\"The War Prayer,\\" \\"King Leopold's Soliloquy\\" and its associated Czar piece, and \\"1601,\\" as well as some of my favorites like \\"The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut.\\" Neider is upfront about not including anything but pure short stories, but some will disagree with his calls. Also questionable is his decision to include the first published version of \\"The Mysterious,\\" which was not authorized by Twain or printed as he wished, though the text's history is admittedly very complicated and this is the best version for most. True fans will want to seek out these and other pieces, as hopefully will anyone who likes this book, but these complaints are essentially nitpicking, because what is here is truly great and will be more than enough for general readers.All told, this should be among the first handful of Twain books anyone buys, which is all that need be said."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"The funniest, sweetest, truest book ever written. \\"Political Economy\\" and \\"Science vs. Luck\\" are very short and howling funny. \\"The Diaries of Adam and Eve\\" will make you laugh and cry. \\"The Mysterious Stranger,\\" \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,\\" and \\"Was it Heaven, or Hell\\" are masterpieces of religion, ethics, and humor. \\"What Stumped the Bluejays\\" is a believable account of a sense of humor in birds."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"It is hard to believe that one writer could create such a diverse group of stories on all kinds of subject matter; each one written with Mark Twain's unique sense of humor and extraordinary gift of imagination.These stories also stand the test of time as they are every bit as entertaining now as they were over 100 years ago.Some of the ones that I enjoyed the most;The Canvasser' Tale; the story of a man's collection of echoesThe Diary of Adam and Eve; a humorous look at what Adam and Eve's first thoughts of each other and the world around them.The McWilliamses and the Burglar Alarm.The Californian's Tale with a twist at the end.This collection is writing at its very best; a treasure of American story telling."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"None have mastered the pithy wisdom of Mark Twain and it is nowhere more powerful than his short stories.

A great way to while away a hot summer afternoon"},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"This is an important book in American literature. This collection truly shows off the massive range that Mark Twain had. From the author of books as divergant as Huck Finn and Joan of Arc, to the humorous travel writings and all the way past the bitter, hateful scribblings of his later life.These are some of the highlights, as I see it:&quot;The Story of the Bad Little Boy&quot;, an early version of Twain's comprehenisive pessism and it proves that there is really no such thing. There's optimism and there's realism. &quot;A Day at Niagra&quot;, an obvious parody of his own early newpaper feature writing. Perhaps it was an abandoned assignment on a trip to the falls and Twain had such a bad time he wrote this vicious, sarcastic piece. There are numerous other wonderful stories along the way, hilarious, mean-spirited, touching, beautiful, gently humorous and smile factoring. After the dreadful 1890s of Twain's life (lost a wife, a daughter, a fortune and another kid got sick), sometimes a few of the stories are near-misses. Still always amusing, but something is missing. Then, at recurring times over the last decade of his life, Mark Twain got angry. He popped the blister that became &quot;The Man That Corrupted Hadleyberg&quot;, a brutal profile of mankind's inate greed and selfishness and how there will always be someone out there to laugh and enjoy your misery. &quot;The $30,000 Bequest&quot; is a heart-breaking tale about delusion and wasted lives, and how even the thought of money corrupts absolutely. &quot;Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven&quot; is a mercilessly blasphemous account of Heaven being no different, really, from the earth, the same classist behavior, the same tragic dreams of a better life never to be had. It shoots a hole the size of, well, Heaven in this shaky mythology.Finally, we visit with &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;, a categorically violent attack on the idea of God. It demystifies so many absurdities organized religion tells you to take for granted, don't be surprised if you lose your faith after reading this short novel. It is one of the ultimate masterworks of satirical tragedy ever produced by a writer and is desperately in need of some ingenious filmmaker to produce an R-rated animated movie. Hell, anyone out there who may chance across this add, I'm willing to write the screenplay or assist in production in some way.

It makes you want to hug every dog you see on the street and tell them its going to be ok."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"Part of a good author's job is to make the reader think. Having read the other reviews of \\"A Dog's Tale\\" (and of \\"A Horse's Tale\\" as well) I think some of the reviews may be missing the point.I agree wholeheartedly that in all, it is an upsetting story. I also agree that it is probably not suitable for young children. Speaking as someone who shares his life with three dogs, one reading was certainly enough for me. However, there are deeper things at work here, and they should be looked into.Consider that \\"A Dog's Tale\\" was written very early in the twentieth century.. This was a time when treatment of animals did not measure up to the same standards we as a society hold today. In fact, animal cruelty was societally acceptable. Levels of animal abuse that will have you in court in today's world were utterly unremarkable then. The dog was yours; you could do anything you wanted to do to it, good or bad.What \\"A Dog's Tale\\" does very well is put the reader in the dog's life to experience firsthand the astounding cruelty being dished out by the dog's \\"scientifically detached\\" owner. The man demonstrates no sympathy or caring at all for his own dog, but through the story, Twain certainly elicits it from the reader! And I propose that this was the point; to make the reader think about the way they treated animals then. Twain was someone who saw much pain in his own life, and it's my personal belief that he probably disliked people that casually inflicted pain. Such people would be a ripe target for an iconoclast such as him.All in all, a superbly crafted story, even if it is disturbing. Being disturbing, I think, was very likely the whole point. Don't get completely wrapped up in the emotion, look deeper. Five stars for making us think.Added on 1 /30 /2012I found this in a book of Twain's quotes the other day; I think it leaves little doubt as to where he stood in regards to cruelty to animals:\\"I believe I am not interested to know whether Vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn't. To know that the results are profitable to the race would not remove my hostility to it. The pain which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity towards it, and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity without looking further.\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"I began this story right after finishingThe Adventures of Tom Sawyerand was expecting a lighthearted tale featuring a dog.

Mark Twain does a great job of presenting this anti-vivisection tale and even more depressing when you realize that it has been 102 years since his death and we are still using dogs for research.Don't not read it, but do be aware of what you are in for when you begin this story story."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"This volume claims to present the complete short stories of Mark Twain.

Don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"\\"The Story of the Bad Little Boy\\" is a satire on the stories we all heard in Sunday school with an interesting twist. While Twain seems to b satirizing the stories of old because his protagonist does not seem to encounter punishment for his sin, Twain still ends the story with something of a moral for us to think about. While Jim may have been able to get away with his bad behavior, he was still sinful. In other words, a person cannot base his or her behavior on the fact if he or she is punished or not. The truth is that many bad people get away with doing bad things all the time and we must be better and rise above such behavior. Goodness must come from one's own desire to be good.Twain purposefully begins with Jim's bad behavior as what appears to be harmless. For example, his first bad at is replacing the jam with tar. This seems harmless enough. That act is followed by stealing apples from Farmer Acorn's apple tree. We are told that Jim \\"and the limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and break his arm, and get torn by the farmer's great dog\\" and he \\"stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right.\\"Another interesting aspect of this story is how Twain is how Jim continues to live a bad life even as an adult. The sequence is essential to Twain's notion that evil, if allowed to grow, will take over a person's life. Jim's evil actions were innocent enough when he was a boy. However, they progressively become worse. For example, he moves from stealing apples to stealing a knife and then planting the knife in George Wilson's cap and allowing George to be punished. In fact, the incident with George reveals much about Jim's personality. We are told:\\"No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he was \`down on them milk-sops.' Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy.\\"These statements reflect how Jim is growing more evil. He not only finds joy in doing evil things, but he also delights in the fact that good and innocent people suffer for crimes they did not commit. Jim moves from becoming a mischevious boy to an evil boy that hates good boys. This is a subtle action but it reflects how evil can subtly take over an individuals' life. In this sense we can see how people are not born completely evil. Instead, they wander through gray areas of life committing one evil act after another until they are transformed. The message here is that people rarely set out to be evil; rather they become evil after repeating one offense after the other.Twain moves through the events of Jim's life to illustrate that although bad people do not always get caught, they end up with a life that is not pleasing or desirable. In the beginning of the story, the events Twain describes are what we would consider normal for an average boy. Stealing is something to which we can all relate. By introducing us to such events, Twain is engaging us as readers. When we read about Jim, we think that there is nothing wrong with him. However, as the story progresses, we realize that Jim's behavior begins to have negative effects on other people. Not only that, but Jim has little regard for these people. First, it is George then it become Jim's innocent family. By moving swiftly through these events, Twain is demonstrating how quickly a person can become evil.I found this story to be fascinating in that its message is not terribly overt. I also enjoyed it because it is realistic. Many people do not get caught or punished for their crimes. But the most fascinating aspect is how Jim's character develops into a truly evil person. He goes from stealing jam to braining his entire family. At the end of the story, we are told that he \\"got wealthy by all manner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalist wickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universally respected, and belongs to the Legislature.\\" Clearly, while this message seems to support the message that crime pays, it also indicates that Jim became an evil person one step at a time. In fact, Jim is probably not even aware of his own evilness.It is also interesting that the narrator refers to Jim as lucky more than once. I also believe this is part of Twain's technique because at first glance, it would appear that Jim is lucky. he is never caught and is never punished for his crimes. In fact, he is well respected in his community. It would seem that he does have the best of luck. However, the underlying message is that we cannot rest on what society perceives as lucky when it comes to finding meaning in life. Jim's so-called luck is simply another one of society's misguided messages. In reality, Jim is not lucky at all.In the end, Jim might have been considered lucky to some but more importantly, he was sinful. The story teaches us that goodness must come from within--it cannot come from Sunday school books nor can it come from how society perceives and treats us. While Twain mocks the typical Sunday school method of teaching, he is presenting the same message in that we must desire to be good and that desire must be our compelling force in life."},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain","review":"DO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!!

Crocker's similarly respectful Chuch history, \\"Triumph\\", gives hope that some publisher will reissue Hughes' essential book."},{"Title":"A popular history of the Catholic Church (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Father Hughes wrote a surprisingly good book of the history of the Catholic Church. A POPULAR HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH is not just a condensed version of his three volume work titled A HISTORY OF THE CHURCH. A POPULAR HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH is a detailed account that is well organized and clearly written. Father Hughes' honesty and attempt to write a critical account of the Catholic Church's history may surprise readers especially when readers realize that Father Hughes is obviously a Catholic partisan and a Catholic priest.Father Hughes began this history with early dissensions and debates among the early Church Fathers. The challenges of interpretation of Christianity are presented in a coherent text which explains each challenge. Some examples are the Donatists, the Monophyites, etc. One major challenge that re-emerged during the 11th. and 12th centuries was that of Manichism named after its Persian leader, Mani (215-275 AD). Another serious challnege was that of Arianism named after Arius (273-336) which was a serious threat to the both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Father Hughes gave readers a good account of this heresy and how the heresy was resolived at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The explanation of St. Athanasius'(293-373)position and the resulting Nicean Creed and Apostles' Creed informed readers of the actual meaning of these statements of the Catholic Faith. Readers may be interested that St. Augustine (354-430 AD)was a Manichian until St.Ambrose (347-397 AD) convinced St. Augustine otherwise.Those who may think that the Catholic Church authorities did not face serious opposition until the Reformation will be surprised by this book. Father Hughes explained that Catholic Popes and bishops had continued confrontations with Byzantine emperors and their sometimes allies who accepted Arius's views that God and Christ were separate. This conflict continued long after the Council of Nicea, and the Catholic authorities had to work carefully to curry the favor of the political authorities while at the same time prevent these authorities from domination of Catholic doctrine and belief. Father Hughes gave several detailed accounts of Catholic Popes and bishops standing firm regarding interpretations of the Faith from imperial interference. Many of the Byzantine rulers thought that their status included Caesaropapism or the position of the Byzantine rulers holding ultimate political and religious authority.Father Hughes' presentation of the Catholic Church's precarious position during the \\"Dark Ages\\" (c. 500-750 AD)is comprehensive. Catholic Europe faced outside threats from the Moslems until Charles Martel's (710-741)forces defeated the Moslems at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. Father Hughes also mentioned that the Popes faced considerable military pressure from the Lombards until Pepin's (741-768)defeated the Lombards c. 751 and saved the Papal States.As mentioned above, Catholic Church leaders repeatedly faced problems with secular rulers. When Charlemagne (768-814)was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day in 800, the event was later disputed as to whether Pope Leo (795-816) crowned Charlemagne or whether the Pope acknowledged him as the ultimate leader of the Latin West's Catholicism. This political tension worked against both the Medieval and Renaissance secular rulers and Popes which will be discussed below.This tension was not the only faced in the Catholic Latin West. There were bitter disputes with Byzantine rulers over the status of icons (The Iconoclastic Controversy). Father Hughes explained that the Byzantine ruler Leo III (717-741), not to be confused with Pope Leo III, and Constantine V (741-775)and the Byzantines persecuted Catholics over the use of icons in Catholic churches. Catholics believed that the saints of the Catholic Church should be venerated or honored by art and sculpture much like contemporary men and woman sharing pictures of family and loved ones. The Byzantines argued that this was idolotry resulting in bitter conflict. Later the Byzantine rulers and bishops relented on this issue until 1054 when the issue resurfaced.The political tensions between the Catholic Church authorities and secular rulers again exploded in the 11th,. century when the German secular rulers simply named and placed Popes in power. The Catholic authorities tried to stop this abuse by issuing what is known as The Papal Election Decree between 1057-1059. While this decree did not immediately stop the abuse, the Decree set a precedent that was finally honored. Another serious confrontation was the Investature Controvesy between Henry IV (1056-1106) and Pope Gregory VII (1073-1185). The controversy dealt with who had the authority to invest German bishops. Were the German secular rulers or the Catholic authorities to name these bishops. The issue was finally settled by the Concordot of Worms in 1106 only after war, excommuncation, the untimely end of Henry IV's rule, etc. While European secular rulers continued to name their bishops even after 1106, the Catholic Church authorities set another precedent that eventually enabled Catholic authorities to name Catholic bishops.Father Hughes presented the conflict between King Phillip IV (1285-1314) of France and Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303)re the rights of the Catholic Church in France. Pope Boniface VIII aroused the wrath of the French king when the latter sent military forces to Rome, and these men physically beat the Pope so badly that some historians state the he died. The Papacy was moved to Avignon,France and much of the 14th. (1300s) and early 15th. century (1400s)was dominated over whether the Papacy should be in France or Rome. Then the Spanish offered a third Pope which made a difficult situation more difficult. Father Hughes clearly explains how the dispute was settled at the Council of Constance (1414-1417), and the Papacy was restored to Rome. As Father Hughes so accurately explained, this schism was a major embarrassment to the Catholic Church.Father Hughes also had some interesting material on Catholic teaching and leaning, the monastic orders, and the Catholic religious life. He gave a good account of the Cistercians who started in 1098 and expanded to over 500 monastaries by 1200. As readers may know, the best known of the Cistericans was St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153). Father Hughes reported on the emergence of the orders of the Friars such as the Friars Minor (the Litte Brothers or Franciscans) and the Order of Preachers or the Domincans. His account of St. Francis of Assisi (1170-1220) and St. Dominic (1171-1223) infomed reades how important these Catholic ordes were. Father Hughes also wrote a good account of the rise of the Medieval Catholic universities and brief descriptions of Catholic Scholasticism and especially the work of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Father Hughes is also clear how the Nominalists wrecked Scholasticism with what he termed \\"mental gynnastics\\" rather than logic and reason to arrive what could be called \\"Ultmate Truth.\\"The explanation that Father Hughes gave of the Reformation is well done and fair to both sides. Father Hughes was clear of the problems within the Catholic Church and the \\"Protestant\\" challenge. His description of Luther (1483-1546)was well done. Father Hughes made a solid claim that Reformation was more of a political event than a religious revolution given the facts how secular rulers used Reformation complaints to loot the Catholic Church both on the European continent and in England during the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547). Yet, Catholic renewal was vibrant and effective. The Catholic Church's Council of Trent (1545-1563)restored the Catholic Faith in many Protestant areas, and the work of Popes Pius IV (1559-1565) and Pope St. Pius V (1566-1572). Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556) started the Jesuits who are often called the Shock Troops of the Counter Reformation. Other orders were started who did effective work as explained by Father Hughes.If the Reformation did not present enough problems for the Catholic Church, the Catholic rulers themselves caused more problems. The comcept of Jansinism and Gallicanism presented serious problems. The concept of the former argued a sort of Calvinistic predestination which the Catholic Church refused to accept. The Gallican concept meant that the French king and not the Catholic authorities were supreme in Franch which obviously attracted other secular rulers. The Popes' reaction, especially that of Pope Clement XIII (1758-1769) and Pope Clement XIV (1769-1774)blundered by banning the Jesuits who were the most loyal and ardent defenders of the Catholic Church and the Pope. Historians have argued that at the price of getting elected Pope, these men may have made promises to proscribe the Jesuits. The Jesuits did not make their return until 1814 after the French Revolution and the final defeat of the French in 1814 and 1815.To say the that the Catholic Church lost political power and influence during the 19th. century is an understatement. By 1870, the Papal States were nonexistent. The Pope and the Curia were confined to what is today the Vatican. However, this did not end Catholicism. In spite of anti-Catholic hostility and actual political persecution in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc., the Catholic Church actually became stronger. Pope Pius IX(1846-1878) and Pope Leo XIII(1878-1903) recognized that political entanglement involving the Catholic authorities ruined the Papal States. Yet, these Popes encourged a renweal of Catholic learning and missionary work. Pope Leo XIII led the Neo-Thomist and Neo-Scholatic revival that lasted well into the 20th. century. The Popes and Catholic authorities made the Catholic mission one of learning, missionary work, etc. avoiding as much as possible the previous political conflicts. Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922)set a good example when he spent much of his personal fortune (5 million lira) and raised another 30 million lira to help the unfortunate victims on both sides during and after W.W. I. He even sent help to \\"godless, atheistic\\" Russia to assist these poor souls in spite of an openly anti-Catholic regime run by the Bolsheviks until in the early 1920s, the Bolshevik leaders refused such help.Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) was able to get the Italian government to grant the Vatican official political status as the smallest country in the world. His concordots with the Italian Fascists(1929) and German National Socialists (1933) were tenuous at best and both Pope Pius XI and the future Pope Pius XII (1939-1958)knew this.Father Hughes basically concluded that after the Catholic Church's political disasters that Catholcism was revived because of its teaching/learning, missionary work, charity/compassion, etc. Events after the book's publication can be found in more recent histories.Father Hughes did not avoid reporting stupidity, evil, wrong doing, etc. re the history of the Catholic Church. As this reviewer mentioned elsewhere, historians know so much about problems of the historic Catholic Church because other honest Catholic historians reported these failures of nerve and character. Yet, Father Hughes also applauds the vast achievements of the Catholic Church. The undersigned's only criticism of this book is that Father Hughes should have given more attention the Medieval universities and Scholastic Philosophy. Father Hughes should have included a section on Catholic Sacred Classical Music and Gregorian Chant. In spite of these criticisms, the merits of the book make it a good source of studying Catholic History.James E.

As I began reading this book, my prejudice was that it would probably be [bad]---more or less. In seeking better understanding, I am willing to look down different dead end streets. After reading the book, I cannot reasonably say it is a dead end.One strong departure of the author's understanding from Orthodox teachings (here, I don't mean the Eastern Orthodox religions, but more populous, American versions of Christianity) is \\"physicality.\\" Both the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection are ordinarily understood as physical events. This author understands neither as a physical event. However, in his approach or understanding, the non-physicality of these events does not actually make them \\"less real.\\" Certainly, the numerous theologians from my church will object to that.According to the author, most of us receive only the \\"outer\\" teachings of Christianity. These are not substantially complete. The more fully developed understanding was made available only to an Inner Circle of believers, originally consisting mainly of The Twelve (apostles). The inner circle experienced greater teaching, both in a theoretical sense and in an experiential or transformational sense. From ancient times to the present, these inner teachings have been brought forward continuously, but only to a restricted audience of Occultists of the tradition. That is the view propounded here. While outlines of the deeper teaching are stated or at least hinted in the text, it does not really give them in a very direct or explicit way (not as in a textbook). Many convincing scriptural citations and citations from the Fathers of the Church are provided to support the thesis that the message itself is carried mainly in elite secret societies. In a sense, the author sounds almost like a Mason in his writing.For more details or \\"how to\\" the reader is refered to the author's book on Gnani yoga and others of the author's writings. On the one hand, the author writes in a credible and mostly self-consistent way and supports a creditable, if quite alternative, view of Christian history. On the other hand, I'm not sure that it is very useful. For the practical-minded reader, it does relatively little good to have the \\"real\\" teaching locked away in some secret society somewhere (of course, somewhere secret). If we can't learn it, too, isn't something unsatisfactory or something missing? For me, it is. To be entirely satisfactory, the reader should have a good way to get in on the good stuff, too. Christianity is not a spectator sport."},{"Title":"Mystic Christianity,: Or, The inner teachings of the Master","review":"This book fundamentally changed my viewpoint on Christianity.

Knowing he is the prime suspect, the Gourmet Detective conducts his own investigation to uncover the identity of the killer. However, he finds this much more difficult than tracking down a rare exotic herb because the extended Harlington brood seems loaded with motives.The latest Gourmet Detective, EAT, DRINK, AND BE BURIED, provides n intriguing look at Medieval recipes, but is no Medieval Times. The hero remains fresh and fun to observe whether he is in the kitchen or searching for evidence. However, the problem with the plot lies with the myriad of suspects that the Gourmet Detective investigates. They seem more like Borgs sharing the same personality, which leaves the reader struggling to discern who is who even with a scorecard.

Every story is included, and themes long ignored by later redactors can now be re-examined.The translation is immensely readable, and although the price tag is prohibitive, it is certainly more feasible than purchasing the H.O. Sommer edition (which is predominantly in Old French and costs over $1200.00.)The books themselves are beautiful and for the truly hardcore fan of the original Arthurian romances, they are a welcome addition to any library.

The part dealing with the USSR was somewhat one dimensional but made some good points.

Knocking down straw men is an easy pastime. The author's obvious point of view, with which I have a little sympathy, is totally negated by the charicatures he has created.

I enjoyed the honesty with which Bennett pointed out both the successes and failures of himself and the US Army during the time he was in the service. He also explains how the US Army had many lessons to learn during the course of the war. His discriptions of the carnage following the Kasserine Pass battle and the US Soldiers routed during the initial phase of the Battle of the Bulge are noteworthy. He also describes how the United States Army and the individual US soldier meet the challenge of the German Armed Forces and ultimately prevailed. The book describes the torment that two families felt when the wrong family is notified of the death of a service member. I liked the book coming from someone who was there from the early days of North Africa until the end of the war and how he expains the use or missuse of the mobile self-propelled M7 Priest artillery units he was assigned to. The battles are seen from the view point of this young artillery commander and should be taken in context with more detailed books that cover each individual battle. An example of this is the loss of personnel and vehicles during the Sicily campaign. When reading the book you get the impression that all the casualties were caused by the Germans & Italians. If you read other accounts of the action in books such as The Battle for Sicily by Mitcham he details how some of these casualties were caused by the enemy and some by a mistaken attack by US A-36 aircraft.Finally I have two minor complaints against the publisher:1: Maps of North Africa, Sicily, Omaha Beach and the push into Europe would have helped in following the story. No Maps are included in the book.2: Why do you have a picture of US Marines assaulting a beach on the cover? Would it be that hard to find a picture of a US Army M7 Priest self-propelled gun in action.A great read written by someone who was there."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"I enjoyed this book and want to point out some historically important points.First off, I will say this is a thinking man's book, and less of a &quot;thrilling combat/adventure story.&quot; Its a good description of a (West Point) Jr. officer in the artillery moving to the Armored Artillery (M7's) and becoming XO and CO of the 58th and 62nd AFA (both D-day units).While it is important in that there is little published on the AFA, the three points of most importance are:1. The author was in from the start so it deals with the development of the AFA doctrine.2. It covers the AFA work at the Assualt training center in the UK, and the Normandy Invasion work of the 62nd AFA.3. It has a very interesting take on the Patton 'slapping' incident that I think deserves attention. The author was in the next tent when one of the incidents happened. If you are a Patton enthusiast, find this book and read the Sicily section.So, if you are a serious student of the war this is a great book."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"I really enjoyed this first hand account of General Bennett's experiences. I have read this type of book extensively, and I put this very close to the top of my list.I especially enjoyed his comments about how people behaved and thought during this climatic time in our history. His feelings about missing his wife, and how he felt when his first troopers died, and what that must have meant to the families added a real human touch. I enjoyed his description of train rides, gas rationing, and many other small points that really gave me a feel for what it was like for not just soldiers, but also civilians, both American and Foreign.I agree, it would have been really nice to have some pictures of what his vehicles looked like and some maps. But, I would also have enjoyed a picture of his wife whom he obviously loved deeply. A picture of Fort Knox, or Fort Sill during training.Those would really have added value to this book, but it certainly stands out without them too. My thanks to General Bennett for sharing his story, and not just the combat.Well done!!"},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"Donald Bennett served for several decades with the US army, retiring as a Four Star General. This book briefly covers his youth during The Depression, his entry and various trials at West Point but the bulk is on his service as a battery and then battalion commander of M-7 Priests in WW2. Bennett sees combat in Tunisia, Sicily and North East Europe, including a second wave arrival on Omaha Beach.Bennett had a better run than many during the 1930s culminating in acceptance to West Point. There is lots of interest here. There is remarkable insight into the sort of men the era and the Point produced. Bennett for instance took it very seriously and virtually adopted the Cadet Creed as his instructions for life. He was also increasingly aware of the changing world situation and his likely future in it.After graduation Bennett is assigned to artillery and has the bizarre experience, in the age of Blitzkrieg, to command a horse drawn unit. It is fascinating to read his thoughts on this and his concerns for how the US could possibly defeat mechanized enemies. Fortunately he is posted to the 58th Mobile Armored Artillery, the first unit to receive the M-7 and is thrilled with the possibilities this weapon offered. His thoughts on how mobile artillery should operate are fascinating, showing his keen insight. He is able to put his theories to the test when he receives command of the 62nd Armored Artillery for Normandy.Bennett is in combat a lot. In Tunisia he is shelled and attacked often by the Luftwaffe. He sees how professional the Germans are and sets out to improve his units accordingly. There follows the Sicilian campaign where he finds himself in the neighbouring tent when Patton slaps that soldier. Bennett writes Patton was cheered as he left! This occurred also when Patton fronted units to issue his apology. He is quite a fan of the Patton way of war. Indeed it is one of his themes that when at war, nations need to be ready to fight with determination. He laments the state of the US national spirit today but this is no long whine about \`it was better in my day', just an old soldier's considered observations.The combat highlight is Bennett's participation on D-day. He goes in with the second wave, in order to better control his vehicles but is confronted by absolute chaos. He finds himself directing infantry and it is a dramatic chapter indeed. He also has a pivotal role in holding a shoulder of the Bulge. While his role saw him directing fire rather than firing a gun himself, he does encounter German ground troops and is in some very dangerous situations. He touches on some of the awful aspects of battle but his role means his experiences are generally different to those of the infantry.Bennett is a good writer. He does his best to convey in modern terms how the events of the 40s hit home and he has some pertinent things to say about his countries ignorance, then and now. (Indeed, in some ways the events of Sept 11 may have prompted him to write.) I found this book to be absorbing. Bennett's fresh, clear thinking on how to use the weapons at his disposal is also evident in how he has conveyed his thoughts to the reader. He has some stirring things to say about America and Democracy and what is needed when confronted by evil. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"The book is well written and was hard to put down. It tells Gen. Donald V. Bennett's story of the struggle to get in and through West Point. It next moves to initial artillery training. Here he learns how to ride a horse while pulling his artillery piece. In addition, he learned how to place his foot where it would not be crushed while riding the horse. His stories of North Africa included the sights, smells, running a bordello (to get the disease rate down), and fighting Rommell. His insights and experiences in Sicily were preparations for his Normandy experience. His spell binding account of Normandy is the best chapter in the book and as good as any ever written. He gives a fresh point of view on the Battle of the Bulge pointing out the signs and intelligence higher up overlooked. His conclusion with experiences and insights about the Russians are eye opening."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on World War Two, and I have read many. Bennett takes us back in time, as if we are sitting in his living room listening to him over coffee. He tells us what it was like to be an American officer during World War Two. He reveals the worry of 1942 - 1943 that we could lose the war. At that point, we were military amateurs compared to the Germans and Japanese. Our military had been dismantled after World War One.Bennett shows an interesting side to Patton. Bennett had malaria and was in the hospital where Patton slapped a soldier for cowardice. Bennett, who was in the next tent over, cheered Patton on, as did the other patients. Patton was confronting the growing problem of desertion among American soldiers in Sicily, which was another worry we don't often hear about.Bennett comments on the realism of the first 20 minutes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; which is the D Day landing at Omaha Beach. Then he adds that the real thing was four terrifying hours of that 20 minute sequence.He sprinkles leadership advice throughout his narrative: Remain humble as an officer. Eat the same food the men eat; live in the same conditions. The worst officers, in Bennett's view, were the ones who considered soldiers their personal servants.The book is written as a living room chat. It is not written with the polish of a John Toland or Cornelius Ryan or Stephen Ambrose. But it is movingly written."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"The first hand telling of WWII by a retired 4 star general.

Subtitled: \\"A West Point Graduate's Memoir Of World War II\\"By General Donald V. Bennett with William R. Forstchen, Ph.D.This book was called to my attention by other Amazon reviewers. Because the main author is a general, I had avoided this book, since my experience is that generals typically write, for example, about the 123 Battalion attacking the 456 Hill, and all the numbers are numbing.The book, \\"Honor Untarnished\\", is a very personal memoir. It is the personal story of a young man, Donald Bennett, who was raised on the image of General Joshua Chamberlain (Civil War General from Maine) and other Civil War heroes. He literally worked on the railroad, and watched the rich dudes, (\\"high rollers\\"), as their train sped past his work crew, going to New York. He attended Michigan State. He had a few opportunities to be appointed to the Military Academy at West Point, New York, and after flunking out one time, (failed mathematics), he finally graduated in 1940, just in time for America's entry into the Second World War.The author begins the book with \\"Cadet's Prayer\\" and ends the book with the \\"Cadet's Prayer\\". The book's title is extracted from that prayer: \\"Help us to maintain the honor of the Corps untarnished\\".He ends the book by referring to the Cadet's Prayer.The book covers his service from North Africa to Sicily, and then to England where they waited for the D-Day invasion of France. As an advocate of mobile artillery, then Major Bennett urges the placement of M-7 artillery forces up close to the firing line where they can have the greatest impact on the battle. He believes that this will save lives.Very personally, he remembers the men who were lost. He describes the ache caused by the drowning of man who fell off the climbing nets and went straight to the bottom. The man was carrying too much weight. He describes, with a tone of regret, the destruction of a German artillery group, which was caught in the open by his M-7s. This description of the Germans wheeling their horse-drawn caissons around was an echo of his experiences in training back in the States, where his artillery was being serviced in the same way as they had done in the Civil War. He always feared being caught that way.The future general does get into less personal observations, as when, on page 299, he states that war with Russia was \\"...close, damn close\\" in Czechoslovakia. Scattered throughout the book, there are strategic and politic observations such as that on page 299.All in all, this book was well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Honor Untarnished: A West Point Graduate's Memoir of World War II (Tom Doherty Associates Book)","review":"I found this to be a very interesting book written about the first M7 armored artillery battalions in the US Army. The fact the author was involved in the development of these battalions from the begining makes it interesting in and of its self. The description of the author landing on his section of Omaha beach on D-Day and finding he was the senior officer still able to function and the actions that he took speaks well of him, enough to earn him the DSC. His later description of the front line knowledge of the German buildup prior to the Battle of the Bulge and the failure of Eisenhower, Bradley etc. to pay any attention to the intelligence they were getting from the front does not speak well of them, they were seeing just what they wanted to see and no one could change that with facts. His comments about rarely seeing general officers at the front is refreshing and honest particularly from a West Point oficer. He appears to have no use for Montgomery, while he thinks a great deal of General Patton. In all General Bennett has written a fine over due book on a subject that has seen little or no attention, i.e. the armored artillery in combat."},{"Title":"Disney's Out and About with Pooh; Good As Gold","review":"The picture and Book Description list all 19 Out and About with Pooh books, but when we received our order only the first book \\"Good as Gold\\" came.

Dr. Hewitt has made a valuable contribution and her work has a research base for keeping children safe and convincing the court regarding child vulnerability."},{"Title":"Assessing Allegations of Sexual Abuse in Preschool Children: Understanding Small Voices (Interpersonal Violence: The Practice Series)","review":"I am a certified family law specialist who practices primarily in the areas of child custody and child welfare law. I wrote the book Child Sexual Abuse in Civil Cases for the American Bar Association and have handled child sexual abuse cases for 35 years. Family courts have a difficult time knowing what to do when there are credible allegations that preschoolers have been molested by their fathers, but there is not enough evidence to meet the evidentiary standard to stop visitation. In such cases judges often just treated the case as if there were no allegations at all, a reckless approach that provided no safety for the child. In 1991 Dr. Hewitt published an article, Therapeutic Management of Preschool Cases of Alleged but Unsubstantiated Sexual Abuse, 70/1 CHILD WELFARE 59, at 61-64 (January-February 1991), which revolutionized the way these cases could be dealt with in a way that protected and empowered the child, reassured the mother, and allowed safe contact between the father and child. I was so impressed by her protocol that with the publisher's permission, I included a portion of that article in a legal treatise I wrote, Handling Child Custody, Abuse and Adoption Cases, at Appendix 16-5. I was thrilled when Dr. Hewitt expanded that article into this book, which has allowed mental health professionals to become trained in how to implement Dr. Hewitt's protocol in their own cases. I have been successful in getting courts to order the use of the protocol in appropriate cases, which has worked very much to the benefit of children who would otherwise have been left unprotected. This book is a unique game-changer that should be on the shelf of every mental health professional, lawyer, and judge who handles child sexual abuse cases and every parent who is concerned that good-faith allegations are not being taken seriously. The protocol is useful even if it turns out that the child was not, in fact, molested, because parents and child will have clear boundaries, which can only help both the child and the parents. I give this book my highest recommendation possible."},{"Title":"I am Fifteen - and I don't Want to Die . . .","review":"Christine Arnothy was fifteen when her family hid in the basement of their apartment building with the other tenants during the bombings. Mainly Christian, there was only one Jewish man hiding amongst them; this makes \\"I Am Fifteen--And I Don't Want to Die\\" different from a lot of the books that take place in World War II -ravaged Europe.There is the numbness after seeing so many dead bodies; there is the horror when they finally receive flour; there is the lack of water and the trek to get it.The book jumps around a bit; after they escape the city, there is a three year gap which is immediately followed by an escape to the frontier. The ending is very inconclusive, leaving the reader hanging.This is a good book, because it gives a glimpse of a Christian teenager during the Second World War. Perhaps the most moving part of the book is Christine's time in the confessional, and the priest's touching response to her words.However, the book lacks a lot of detail.

Her family needs to get out of the middle of this war, but when will they go, and how will they get out? Most of all where will they go?I liked this particular autobiography because it is about Christine's hard times in life. Some books I've read about difficulties in life didn't seem real to me, but because this is a true story I could really get into it. I felt sorry for her because compared to her life, my life is perfect. The way Christine wrote this book was very interesting, she wrote this book from old diaries she kept when she went through all of these struggles. I likes the description, it is another reason why I liked this book so much. she describes the scenes she sees with great enthusiam. Like the day when she finds a wounded enemy soilder, I felt as if I was sanding right next to her looking over him.Christine is a quiet girl, who tends to keep to herself.

I studied English in college, and had to read a lot, so I didn't find this to be that confusing, but I understand how it would confuse a younger reader. The book was painfully vivid and blunt. It helped me understand what war is like for civilians. Arnothy was forced to live with people she barely knew, like if you suddenly had to live with your neighbours that you greet when you see one another, but that is the extent of the relationship. But Arnothy was in a cellar during a relentless bombing. I imagine one would keep at an emotional distance because the possibility of sudden mortality. She mercifully keeps the reader somewhat distanced from people who met tragic fates. I found the post-bombing part to be very interesting. The novel ended a bit abruptly, but I interpreted that as thematic. Three years after the worst of the war and the battles continued, long after the bombing ceased, and Arnothy probably never fully escaped the War.

With noone to trust and everyone sharing a tight space, a man named Istvan Nagy who they called Pista came. He helps them get food and supplies from their apartments. Everyone starts to get along and getting more accustomed to him being there.One day when Pista goes to the building that is in ruins to look for food and supplies, instead he comes back with news that there is a building in which people are stuck. With this news the men go to help and end up bringing back a couple in which were survivors from when a munitions train blew up. Soon everyone starts sharing things with the couple. After a week or two the Kacsa-utca, which is where they get there water from, so everyone becomes thirsty.Then the janitor and his wife leave because there is no water left. Much later in the day they hear the Germans leave there posts above the cellar so they come out and start to look around. Pista comes up with an idea that if they can get to the Turkish Baths they can get water. so they set off on their journey. Soon they come back and then the young couple Eve and Gabriel want to get married, so they send Pista out to find a priest.

It has been translated to English from French. I was sent a new copy.The frist half of the book is well written and very good. Christine describes where whe was living during the seige of Budapest. She is living in the cellar of their apartment house with several other tenants. They are starving and scared of the Russians who threaten to invade at any moment. She is desdcrives her plight in great detail with wonderful imaging.Her family escapes to the country and lives in their country home for 3 years. At this time she is 18. For some unknown reason they must leave in a hurry taking practically nothing with them.As the book goes on, the story becomes bland. She constantly complains about her employment and her first husband. The story ends with her giving birth to their daughter. In the afterword, she only talks about her second husband and son. Also, in the afterword, it becomes very confusing as she describes more about the things she wrote about in the main part of the book, but they are completely different. I am not sure if something was lost in translation or if it is purposely written this way. This is more of a refugee story than a story of wartime survival. The story starts at the end of the war and 60% of the book is about after the war and how irritated she is with her husband and employment and how she longs to be a writer.I would have rather had a bit more pre-war background on the family, why they had to leave Budapest, and what her parents ended up doing. She goes into no detail about how she and her first husband part ways or how she meets her 2nd husband.

In many ways, Christine was sort of a teenage 'everywoman' thrust into a horrifying and non-sensical world during the siege of Budapest in WWII. I can't imagine going out onto the street because someone has found a dead horse on the road, and needing to act quickly in order to carve up the meat to bring home. I remember her aching crush on the young soldier, Pista. I remember how things suddenly seemed to look better and then one of their neighbors was almost casually gunned down, after having survived so long in their brutal world. Perhaps it was simply that I was the same age as Christine when I read her book, but I have never forgotten this story."},{"Title":"I am Fifteen - and I don't Want to Die . . .","review":"Well I thought the book was hard to get right away.

The author's in-depth interviews with Chicago police officers and detectives cover everything from the beat cops' encounters on the street, to the sex crime officers' investigations into rape and crimes against children, to the undercover narcotics investigations, and more. There's a great wealth of stories here from cops who have seen it all. Perhaps it was even more interesting to me because I lived for 12 years in the Chicago area profiled in the book--the city's Area Six. The voices of the police officers come through clearly in this book, much as the workers' accounts in Studs Terkel's classic \\"Working\\" did. A must read for any true crime fan! Written in 1992--and if Ms. Fletcher hasn't written an updated \\"What Cops Know--Part II\\", she should!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"Years ago, I had the opportunity to tag along with some police officers during their patrols. While nothing much occurred, I learned some fascinating facts and heard some amusing stories. On one occasion, while in City Hall, a former politician from an inner city neighborhood warmly greeted the policeman that I was with like a long lost friend or family member. Afterwards, the copper explained that he routinely arrested the politico when he was a street punk. Years later, the man sued the police department for brutality and was elected to serve a term on the City Council. He ended his career in elected office by being sent to prison for corruption. The truth is stranger than fiction. One of his successors required a gubernatorial pardon to serve as a councilman!The cops see and hear things that many of us unobservant taxpayers never see or constantly overlook. With that statement as a preface, I have to give high marks to this anecdotal account of \\"What Cops Know.\\"This is a highly readable and entertaining book that you will find difficult to put down. The police are sometimes cynical, humorous and jaded by turns, but their stories are never without interest. You will find tales of criminal stupidity and heartwrenching tragedies described in these pages. It is a wild ride.The truth is out there. St. Jude is not the patron and benefactor of police officers for nothing!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This is a readable and interesting narrative about police work and much that goes with it. Author Connie Chandler interviewed 125 Chicago police officers in the late 1980's to put this book together. The officers speak plainly and openly about their jobs, and let us see what it's like to wear a badge. Readers learn about working the streets, and crimes that range from property crimes to violent offense and the mob. Some of the stories are interesting, some humorous, and some downright depressing. But nearly all are interesting in the capable hands of the author. Good writing is engaging and informative, and this book easily passes the test."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This wonderful book does not try to dramatize anything. It's a simple, straightforward set of interviews with police officers.There is no \\"case\\" to make, or any ax to grind.Fifty years ago, Jack Webb tried for the same objective in creating \\"Dragnet.\\" However, as it translated to the TV screen, it instantly became a cliche and the butt of jokes.It's much harder to joke about what's in this book, though. The main consequence is that the reader is simply grateful for the presence of our police, and finds a new appreciation for their daily contributions. Its sheer simplicity is what lends this a lot of narrative power.It was given to me by by nephew Tim, a tactical officer with the Chicago Police Department, and I thank him for the book and for everything he does. I admire his attitude; instead of becoming jaded and cynical, he takes his street experiences and translates them into gratitude for his wife and his two children."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"Using their own words, Connie Fletcher lets a group of Chicago police officers tell anecdotes and stories about the things they face every day when they go to work. Some are hilarious, as you'd expect. But most are tales of frustration, anger, and sorrow, with the occasional triumph when the good guy wins and the bad guy gets put away 'til he's gray. To hear them tell it that doesn't happen enough, but they keep going until they burn out, transfer off the street, or quit altogether. Too often they die in the line of duty, and when that happens, their fellow officers sincerely mourn the loss.It surprised me to discover how compassionate these men and women are...not only toward the victims they comfort, but criminals they arrest and help convict. What Cops Know will give you a true picture of what cops think, too."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"No one knows the mean streets as well as the cops who patrol them every day. They are the ones who must face the dragon so that others can go about their lives with some sense of peace.In this wonderful book, the author has allowed the cops to tell it like it is. If you are offended, outraged and disgusted by what you read, it might be because the reality that cop's work in is far removed from your safe world.Cops face humanity beneath the veneer of societal graces, a place that is often horrific. This book tells it like it is."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"In my opinion, everyone should read this book. You will learn more about how to keep yourself safe and how to avoid danger from reading this book than from taking martial arts classes for 20 years. Want to know why you should always fight back against a rapist? The cops Mrs. Fletcher interviewed will tell you. They'll tell you how to significantly lower the odds of having your house broken into (good lighting and make them think you have a large dog even if you don't). They'll also explain why you should never joke around and flash gang signs and if you ever see someone flash a gang sign at you, why you should NEVER return it. A lot of people already know you should never get involved in a domestic dispute but the police officers in this book have to get involved with those types of situations and you learn about how volatile the people involved can be.But I'll warn you: This book will also ruin most cop shows and movies for you (especially if you read her other books). Once you know how cops really operate you start to see how unrealistic and inaccurate most shows and movies are. I was watching the Spike Lee movie \\"Inside Man\\" at a friends house and by halfway through the movie I was actually pacing back and forth and shouting things like 'Are you freaking kidding me?' at the television because it was so completely opposite from how cops actually handle police negotiations. On the other hand you'll appreciate how a movie like 'The Negotiator' gets a lot of it right. The book also made me protective of my children to the point of being paranoid. I will never let a guy babysit my kids, not even my brother-in-laws, and I'm careful about the girls I let do it too, especially if they've got a boyfriend. After you read this book and read about how many kids get molested by their uncle or the babysitter's boyfriend, you'll probably be a little paranoid too. But you'll also be aware of some of the dangers in the world and in my opinion that is definately worth it.Because, while it might have made me a little paranoid, I'm glad to know what I do and I learned a lot of it from reading this book. I've probably read it 7 or 8 times and whenever I go to a used bookstore I look for any copies of it so I can loan them to friends. I also really like the episodic nature of the book. It's a great one to read while you're 'occupied' in the bathroom because the stories are broken up into moderate chunks. I also salute Mrs. Fletcher for her choice in how the stories are arranged. You'll read a funny story about them fooling a drug dealer and busting him, and then the next story is about a druggie who put his baby in the microwave and turned it on because it wouldn't stop crying. That's how life is for police officers. And once you read this book, you'll have a small idea of what cops know."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This book is quite entertaining, instructive and gripping for all of the first chapter, and then the information and excitement declines ever increasingly for five more chapters. The last chapter on \\"Organized Crime\\" could have been written by anyone who's watched television for the last 15 years when the programs aired are about the Mob and Mob bosses. \\"Those guys have big trunks on their Buicks, ain't that a kick?\\"The first chapter \\"The Street\\" pretty much tells the reader everything she or he wants to know or needs to know about crime and criminals. It is definitely the most useful and the most fascinating chapter in the whole book -- and required reading for those who don't know. I felt a more alert and better prepared citizen as a result of reading this chapter.But still, the information even here is limited by its time and the Chicago culture. The book was published in 1990 and a hell of a lot of new techniques in crime have been developed since then, so this book can't discuss them. Because all the cops' tales about crime are set in Chicago, it's not going to address street crimes by Mexicans, by the Chinese Mafia; there's going to be very little information about other races, except black or white street crimes -- or any other kind of crimes in the other chapters. In the chapter on \\"Sex Crimes,\\" for example, there is no information about Chinese prostitution nor any details about the sex slave trade internationally. All the information is strictly limited to Chicago and the late 1980s.When the cops start talking about stolen VCRs making a lot of money for the criminal in the second chapter, \\"Violent Crimes,\\" and then continue referring to how much money can be made through stolen VCRs throughout the remaining chapters, the reader quickly gets the feeling she or he is holding a cloth book reminiscent of grandma's not-so-fresh hand-me-downs. You just know you've got to drop it and find fresher and more useful, more current, information.Connie Fletcher's method of putting the Chicago cops' knowledge into parable-like vignettes or stories made the book easily accessible. It just needs a severe update now."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This book is a real tour de force.

I like this book because it gives a large cross section of a large and rough city's Police department. While there a million yarns about the NYPD, I do believe that for a long period of time Chicago was A LOT rougher than NYC. I believe it has something to do with grinding urban poverty coupled with the influx of all the rural, tiny and poort elements of the American heartland (Tennessee and Kentucky, etc.) coming together. This has always been true of Chicago's history, even from its gangland days, I believe. The stories in the book run the gamut, from dead children, wild shootouts, and bizzare and sadistic murders. This book would send any surbanite fleeing back out of a City. Now in this supposedly 'reduced urban crime epoch' the young should read this book when they head to a hip urban campus and always keep in mind what most U.S. metro areas degenerate to, RATHER QUICKLY."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"A little behind times.

That is the best book I have ever read about cops."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"In my opinion, this book is next to useless. The book is suppodded to tell \\"what's it really like to be a cop\\", but it doesn't deliver. There are lots of stories told by Chicago cops, but these stories are really just anecdotes; the shortest are just one or two sentences long. You just can't tell much in two sentences.Another problem is, the book is arranged in topics. In practice this means that a cop after cop is telling you that \\"you don't forget your first corpse\\", and this goes on page after page, until the author moves on to another topic. It would be much more interesting, if there were about two or thee dozen stories in the book, each 5-10 pages long that you could read like a short story. But the way this book is written, it simply is not interesting to read, and you don't get much from reading it."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"It's wonderful that this broad decided to work as a cop to lend her books authenticity, but I don't buy it."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"Connie Fletcher picked the right approach in tackling this subject; like Nicholas Pileggi's Wise Guy: Life in a Mafia Family, What Cops Know is told almost entirely in the subjects' own words, giving it an immediacy and buoyancy that can be mesmerizing. As one police officer stated, they have to develop a sense of humour about what they do. So their toughness, their panache for strange parlance and anecdotes, and their occasional bursts of machismo are delivered first-generation, Fletcher having the good sense to hold back on her editorial comments (something a writer like Colin Wilson overindulges in, making his books extremely moralistic) and just let her subjects tell their stories.The book started off slowly (the foreword explaining the approach, though useful, was cut-and-dry stuff, though certainly useful), but after getting through the first section, I plowed through 200 pages in one sitting. Some of the stories are plain hilarious; some disturbing and sombre; some made me downright sick to my stomach. The child-molestation section was harrowing; I'm usually very objective in my approach to reading, but the story of the mother &quot;selling&quot; her six-year-old child to strangers gut-punched me.Reading through this book, you begin to understand that the police have one of the most strenuous, underappreciated, and potentially corrupting jobs in Western society."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"I read this book before I became a Chicago cop. I felt like an outsider looking in and was curious as to how true the book was. I can tell you that this author knows what she is talking about. Working the streets of the southside, seeing murder, child abuse, prostitution, drugs, addicts etc... I can say without a doubt there is truth to the words in this book. There is truth to the after-effects cops can have from becoming part of this world, the drinking, the crying, the sleepless nights and the eventual hardening of the heart and beoming apathetic. This is a must read for anyone getting on the job. Read it and make sure you know what you are getting into. This is the best job in the world, but being prepared on how to deal with the pitfalls of it is essential."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This compilation of interviews in the words of genuine Chicago cops was put together by the sister of one, which gave her an entree into the \\"closed society\\" of law enforcement. Most of the officers she spoke with \\"work or have worked\\" in the city's Area Six, which encompasses everything from the notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects to the glittering upscale Gold Coast along the lakeshore. Yet crime is a constant, as it has been ever since human beings began to develop a society more complex than that of the cave-based clan. These officers have seen it all, and their cynicism is evident, yet the knowledge they've gained is broad and fascinating. Have you ever wondered how the Mafia (called in Chicago \\"the Outfit\\") is organized? Whether there are still any old-fashioned professional burglars? How a sex criminal or a serial killer thinks? These cops know, and they tell all. They are, of course, cynics, and the closing prediction of one Mob \\"expert\\" on where organized crime is probably heading seems to have been proved wrong; but altogether the book is an invaluable resource for mystery writers, social scientists, and police groupies. (Also read the author's \\"Pure Cop.\\")"},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"This book is the result of 125 Chicago policemen sitting down with Prof. Connie Fletcher of Loyola University at Chicago. In order to give them the freedom to speak without fear of being transferred for political reasons, the names of the policemen interviewed are at the end of chapter, without identifying which policeman was responsible for each excerpt. This is NOT a book for the faint-hearted. It should transform the most hopeless pacifist into a gun owner, if there is any possibility at all. The chapter on home invasions, in particular, is terrifying in its descriptions of the sorts of sadistic brutality done to people inside their homes.This is a book worth reading more for what it says about how Chicago police officers see the world, then for any sort of statistical evidence about crime. At times, in our anger at police as soldiers of an oppressive system, we tend to forget that the police get a very jaundiced view of humanity, because what they spend most of their time doing is cleaning up the pathological part of our society. This is a book for reminding us HOW they see the world, and hopefully, it can make us a little more understanding as to why certain attitudes are so common among big city police officers.The least gruesome chapter was the one on organized crime, and contains some very worrisome statements that makes me suspect that there is more than a totalitarian political ideology or simple-minded idealism pushing gun control:&quot;With an Outfit murder, the car can be seen; it doesn't make any difference. If they felt like it, they could throw the firearm down next to the body and walk away. They have a source for weapons, an illegal source that provides them with weapons that can't be traced.&quot;[p. 316]&quot;The Chicago Outfit controls the unions. Because of that, they're into everything. Chicago controls a big chunk of Hollywood. They don't control the corporations, they don't control the directors and the producers per se, they don't control the actors and actresses. But all the support -- all the catering, the lighting, fixtures -- the outfit that supplies stuff for the movies is not going to be an accidental supply house. The lighting and fixtures -- and everything that moves and walks and talks to cause that movie to be produced -- is probably going to be owned outright or by a fictiously formed blind trust by members of the Outfit.&quot;[p. 310]Especially in light of the successful prosecutions of judges in Chicago several years ago, the following passage seems to be quite plausible:&quot;Everybody can understand and get along quite well, it seems, knowing that our circuit court judges on the state and local levels can be bought. It doesn't seem to excite anybody. People in law enforcement could give you a list -- if you went and just talked to all the people, especially the people that deal with these guys, like the people in the Detective Division -- you could amass yourself a long list of the attorneys that pay off judges and long list of the dirty judges too....&quot;However, that's just peanuts, and people don't seem to be too excited about it. If they were, they'd demand that something be done about it, and they don't. But if you expand that, then, and show that our government is loaded with senators and congressmen and U.S. judges that are just as nefarious, just as crooked -- especially congressmen that owe their allegiances to neighborhoods in big cities -- you know, that would do some serious damage to the national psyche, I think. If we get away from the Chicago-New York-Philadelphia mentality, put yourself in Iowa or Nebraska, it would, I think, bother people of goodwill if the seriousness of it were known.&quot;[pp. 327-328]"},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"What Cops Know is a book with hundreds of true short stories straight from the mouths of real life cops. To the streets to undercover sting operations, these cops dish out the dirt about criminals. One reason I liked this book is that it told tales of murder, conspiracies, and drug rings, leaving out no information. Through this book I discovered how criminals, and drug lords work, and why they do the things they do. The reason I chose to read this book is so I could have some more light shed on the job of a cop. The only thing I knew about cops is from movies, and T.V. With this book I heard it straight from the source. These officers' stories put me right in the squad car with them during their high-speed chases and undercover jobs. These stories showed the grim reality of this world, and cruel nature that is people. I now know how these criminals, rapists, and thieves operate. Cops tell stories of interrogation of eyewitnesses and prime suspects. Another aspect of this book that most would like to read is the stories about crooked cops. Crooked cops are what should be feared, they have the power of the law on their side and they have the choice to abuse it if they want.

There are mind-blowing stories in each, told in short, vivid real cop language.It's compulsively readable and should shock the less stout of heart, not to mention cause you to never look at people the same again.There are plenty of books that take you into the mind of killers, but not enough like this, which take you into the mind of the criminal's arch-enemy: the cop. The book blows away the myths portrayed by Hollywood and TV as well as novels whose authors haven't taken the time to pick the brains of the police. For those who accuse the man of law of being too jaded, cynical and guilty of unseemly gallows humor, this book will show you why.You should be left wondering how someone could go through a career, see these sights and take them home with them every night and keep their sanity. Fortunately, there is just enough twisted levity to keep you from going into a deep funk.This is an incredible book, which shatters the myth of the malevolent, persecuting ticket-writing cop. It puts a human face on them. It's a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"A bit outdated and centered in one area in the Midwest (Chicago), but honest and definitely interesting police experiences explained in a lot of detail, leaving nothing out. Still valid today."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"A lot - and a lot of it is unflattering to \`civilians'. Stories and experiences from those out on the beat, alone in the squad car or working to fight sex offenders, organized crime and property crime. Cops form a tight knit community for a reason, no one else can understand what they do and see and they need each other for support.This is a very good sneak peek into the cop's life. True stories told by those who lived them. Some are older, there is mention of a phone booth, whatever that is....but regardless of the seventies, eighties, crime is crime, crooks don't change and the war against crime doesn't stop. The cops also tell you about the criminals - not the sophisticated, white collar but the run of the mill gang banger, robber, rapists, murders - most of which are crimes of passion and against people they know.This is a quick, easy read in one respect - but it's also tough because you really see the rotten side of human nature. It can be depressing hearing story after story about the scum of the earth. There is some humor, gallows humor. Cops have to develop a thick skin, or the emotional toll will destroy them. If you love cop stories, crime stories or just want a glimpse under the rug, this is a good read."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"After reading these first-hand accounts of what life is like on cruel streets, you just have to take your hat off to these brave men and women in blue! It's a dirty and dangerous job, much less one that's fully understood or appreciated by the general public, but nonetheless a job that has to be done.Unless you have a fetish for the uniform and a batch, no one likes cops very much. You really have to pity and/or admire American cops after reading this book. They work in hostile and inhospitable environments that have broken down so much that law and order are not in order.If you're a cop, I have one question for you: why does America's USCIS (formerly called INS) chase away hard-working immigrants and instead welcome criminals the world over? And you wonder why your crime rates are skyrocketing? Do you see the big picture?American cops tell what life is like in tackling various crimes, from violent crimes and drug cases, to sex crimes and property crimes, etc.Exciting narratives provide snapshots of dozens of crimes in various categories. You will read of disturbing and distressing cases, and many others that are yet unsolved and unsolvable. It's an extremely sad reflection of a society that's broken down, where bad guys outnumber the good guys in a system that cannot and simply won't keep up with the good.I'd recommend this exciting book to anyone who wants an inside look on police street work. A must-read for the new recruit at the police academy.Care to sign up for a job that's recession-proof?Talk to your police recruitment office today!Be good and stay in the Light!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"A few years ago I saw a theater version of this book at the Live Bait Theater in Chicago. I didn't know about the book and thought that the playwright had such a wonderful, creative ear to make the police scene come alive. Connie Fletcher has the gift of capturing the words of actual cops in a way that creates a consisent story and strong drama."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"I read Mark Baker's \\"Cops\\" before I read Fletcher's book, which seemed, frankly, like an attempt to capitalize on Baker's idea. Nevertheless, it's a good book--primarily because the cops have good stories to tell. Baker's book covers more departments, while Fletcher's deals only with Chicago cops.To be fair, Fletcher's \\"Breaking and Entering\\" is a much more comprehensive and balanced book than this one. Still, it's a good read and if you're into law enforcement, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"What Cops Know: Cops Talk About What They Do, How They Do It, and What It Does to Them","review":"The stories in this book are the REAL DEAL!

The books, \\"What Cops Know\\" was referred to me as a marketing book to give insight into human nature. The problem with it of course is that much of the human nature that cops deal with tends to be very negative human nature so I am sure how much of it applies to marketing and behavior.Perhaps I don't watch enough TV; however, I found much of it to be very violent although morbidly interesting.What I did learn from the book is that most cops tend to become fairly jaded and synical because they deal with criminals most of the time. What I learned from this is that I should make sure that I spend time with positive people so that I can appropriately inspire."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I was very pleased with the service from this bookseller.

I'm not going to write a storyline description for each book because many other reveiwers have already done so. Sherrilyn Kenyon's story was worth reading but in my opinon really not up to her usual outstanding books. I have to say though that my biggest disappointment was with Melanie George's story. I love Melanie George's books. They have a place on my keepershelf but I had a hard time believing that she wrote this story. The hero of the story, Donovan, came off as a selfish, self-serving jerk and he was never redeemed at anytime in the story. In fact, I found myself almost hating him. I can only hope that this is a fluke by Melanie George and she will be back to her normal writing in her next book. However people who haven't had a chance to read this book won't be disappointed if they pick this book up for Jaid Black's story. I'll be adding this book to my keepershelf because of Jaid Black's story alone."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I gave this anthology a 4 star rating only because of Sherrilyn Kenyon's novella - the first of the three. It's a light hearted romp and had me smiling from beginning to end.I did not like Melanie George's story - too trite - and even Jaid Black, whom I usually like very much, seemed to have run out of ideas in her story. All considered, maybe this book is not worth buying, but I do recommend reading Kenyon if you can get it from your library"},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"\\"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down\\" consists of 3 short stories, and none of them are really worth the price of the book. The Melanie George offering (\\"Promise Me Forever\\") left me wondering what the heck I'd just read. The character development was seriously lacking. I honestly didn't care how the story ended, because the actions of the protagonists were just ridiculous. The male lead had no redeeming features. Just because someone apologizes for being a jerk doesn't mean they won't be a jerk again in the future. It didn't work for me.The Jaid Black story, \\"Hunter's Right\\" was typical Jaid Black nonsense. Note to author: do a little research before you write about a subject. A member of the armed forces would not think, talk, or act the way the heroine of this story does. There was also a disconnect between the job description this supposed Army veteran had in the beginning of the tale versus what was claimed later on. A lot of \\"what the heck?!\\" resulted.I was also disappointed in Sherrilyn Kenyon's story, \\"Captivated by You\\". She usually does a better job of drawing in the reader and crafting a saga. This felt as if she'd rushed to get something to the publisher. It had potential, but it never delivered.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was a sensual escape for me, and, boy, did I need it. When life sucks, you need something to get you back on track or you'll be pulled down into the abyss of never ending gloom. While it may be a temporary escape, it still makes you feel alive. I found this book to be interesting, at times humorous, exciting and written with great passion. Sometimes the plot takes you places you'd never expect to go. I'm not into heavy bondage, but light bondage/role playing can be exciting. This book is well worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I have to admit I liked the first story the best (Captivataed by You). All three stories are mostly romance, but do have a spot in there where there is detailed erotica, although brief. I did enjoy all 3 but not sure I would call them erotica...would suggest you give the book a read if you're not looking for hard core...a discount would make it even better (than paying full price).If you want just a quick romantic story with slight erotica...this is the book for you. check it out!"},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"This book contains three short stories, described below. I'm not sure if the book is worth buying just for one of the stories. But I'm glad I have it, and I'll be saving it. Hunter's Right a re-read for me. I first read it in Nov 2007 and again in Aug 2011.5 stars for HUNTER'S RIGHT by Jaid Black.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I really enjoyed it. It's different and fun. The sex scenes are not the steamiest but they are arousing in a fairy tale way - think modern woman in a barbarian culture. She is property - there for the purpose of giving her warrior a good ride at the end of his day. The first sex scene was touching. He had some insecurity - and he was such a gentleman toward her, which was odd since he was a barbarian. There is more story than sex. There is some nice relationship building.STORY BRIEF:Ronda is in the army and traveling to an arctic station. The plane crashes and she is the only survivor. She discovers a door in the side of a mountain. She enters and goes down the inside stairs to discover a barbarian/medieval culture with Viking influences. She is seen and tries to run away but Nikolas catches her. She is their prisoner. They put her on stage naked to auction her off as a bride to the highest bidder. Nikolas had not been in the market for a bride, but he changes his mind when he sees her fight the men trying to touch her while she is on the auction block.UNDERGROUND VIKING SERIES:Each one can be read as a stand alone.3 stars.

Too sad with conflict due to poor communication. The poor communication is one of my pet peeves: Donovan broke up with Savannah 10 years earlier due to not asking her a couple of questions and assuming incorrect information. He thought she had an affair with a friend when in fact he saw an innocent hug. She also was not communicating properly by not telling him she was pregnant with his child. To break up with all that confusion in the air was not realistic for me. I also didn't like all the sadness. She was sad for 10 years because Donovan left her and she still loved him. Donovan was sad during those 10 years but probably most unhappy when he had to leave football due to a permanent injury. She planned to marry Jake but she was not truly in love with him. It was a nice friendship. Her fianc&eacute; Jake became sad when he realized she didn't love him. Donovan was sad when she told him to leave again.Data:Story length: 78 pages.

She's secretly crazy about Ace, one of her fellow Bureau of American Defense (B.A.D.) agents. Since he's a womanizer and she's set on following the \\"no office romance\\" rule, she acts as if she hates him and gives him the cold shoulder/evil eye every chance she gets. Unfortunately she's been assigned to work a case with him that has her posing as a dominatrix at an exclusive club to catch a terrorist.Ace Krux has got it bad for Rhea, but she hates him and he doesn't know why. Fortunately he's maneuvered her into working a case with him that will involve her in skimpy outfits practicing her dominatrix skills on him. He's hoping that his charm and their near nudity will result in a little action. His prayers are answered and things heat up pretty quickly between them after she ties him down. Only now Ace isn't so sure he likes the idea of sending her into a room alone with a terrorist.The characters weren't terribly well developed, but we did catch small glimpses into what made them who they are, and that made the romance more believable. I like the lengths that Ace was willing to go to in order to keep Rhea safe.Promise Me Forever - Author: Melanie GeorgeTen years ago Savannah Harper and Donovan Jerricho were crazy in love, but with his pro-football career taking off there was a lot of strain on their relationship and when a misunderstanding causes Donovan to believe that Savannah has slept with one of his friend, they break up and Donovan leaves town without looking back. Savannah is pregnant, a fact that Donovan knows nothing about, and never will if she has anything to say about it. Now Savannah, a single mom to a precocious little girl, has finally agreed to marry Jake, her boyfriend of two years. Only, a few days before her wedding, Donovan Jerricho blows back into town stirring up feelings she thought were dead. They are both angry and bitter about the past, but can't help feeling that pull towards each other. Donovan learns the truth about that old misunderstanding and realizes that he made a big mistake and threw away the only woman he ever loved, but can he convince her of that before she ties the knot? He just might if she gave him half a chance, but since she won't he resorts to drastic measures and kidnaps her and plans to hold her hostage in their old love nest until she hears him out. And when will she tell him that Reese is his daughter?I'm not sure how I felt about this story. He resorted to kidnapping, which was kind of creepy, but he couldn't find it in him to hold her. It bothered me that Savannah was willing to marry Jake after she realized that she still loved Donovan and that she loved him more than Jake. It bothers me that such a sweet stand up sort of guy would marry someone who didn't love him wholeheartedly and slept with her ex shortly before the wedding. Seriously, doc, have a little self-respect! Nice is one thing, doormat is something else all together! I hated that Savannah didn't have the guts to let Donovan know that he had a child and that she didn't tell her kid who her father was.Hunter's Right - Author: Jaid BlackCorporal Ronda Tipton, U.S Army, is excited about her new assignment. She's going to be stationed at a research base in the Arctic. Unfortunately, her helicopter crashes somewhere in the Arctic Circle and she is the only survivor. Hoping that she was somewhere near the base when the chopper crashed, she heads out on foot. When she finds what appears to be a door in the side of a mountain, she thinks her prayers have been answered. She soon finds that she was mistaken as she stumbles upon the hidden Viking civilization of New Sweden that has thrived underground for hundreds of years. She is discovered and chased by giant Viking men. She nearly escapes, but is caught by Lord Nikolas Ericsson, a cousin to the King and a revolutionary. He believes she is a military spy and questions her about how she came to New Sweden. When he learns she is telling the truth about the accident, she is sent off the bride auctions. The auctions were once a respected tradition, but the Kings corruption has turned it into something of a sex slave auction where the men fondle the women who are brought before them naked and shackled. When it's Ronda's turn up on the block she takes serious offense to being manhandled and uses her martial skills to smack down the offenders and get free. Just as all hell is breaking loose Nikolas claims Hunter's Right, the law that says a man may keep a woman he has captured. Nikolas did not intend to marry until after the revolution, but not only did Ronda make him hot, she was a fighter and he hated to see her punished or handed over to one of the Kings vile friends. Ronda believes she must escape and find the base so that she can inform the military of what is going in this secret world, but she soon finds herself drawn to Nikolas. Will she choose freedom or love?The sexual stuff is hot ... really hot, though this whole chains and aphrodisiacs stuff kind of squicks me. I really enjoyed the characters and though the whole women as property thing doesn't appeal to me overly much, I found myself very intrigues by their world and most especially that prophecy of theirs. I've read one other novella andDeep, Dark & Dangerouswhich were both set in New Sweden and I have to say, I'm looking forward to more."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I bought this for Sherrilyn Kenyon's piece, and have to say all of the stories are entertaining. Am I glad that I read them? Not really.Kenyon/MacGregor is an auto-buy for me. And while I enjoyed her story the most, I feel as though this \\"BAD\\" series in no way compares to her Dark Hunters. I know that they're two totally different storylines but, if I later found out that she really didn't write this series, I wouldn't be surprised. Not to mention, it would be better to just buy her \\"Born to be BAD\\" where you get this novella plus the previous two at the grand \`ole price of $7.50.After having read the prior reviews, it's funny that most people disliked Melanie George's \\"Promise Me Forever\\" so much, while I found it to be an average read. I didn't find the heroine to be a push over, and I didn't think the hero did anything out of character. After making a mistake he decided to rectify it. The timing was poor, considering it was the eve of her wedding to another. Nothing very memorable with this one, but that's better than disappointment, which is what I got with the third story.As far as Jaid Black's contribution is concerned, while it was well written and will stay with me unfortunately, it was the worst piece in my opinion. Yes, we get lots of hot sex scenes but with no... emotion, tenderness. The world the author created, while well thought out, reads more like a nightmare that the heroine never really gets to wake up from. I love alpha hero's but this guy is just too much. The heroine is debased and humiliated at every opportunity. In my opinion, what could have been a very interesting premise, turned out to be a setting compiled totally for the opportunity to incorporate sexual situations that I found to be extremely distasteful. Nude women, captured, plucked, and sold on an auction block was just the beginning of the ugly mess. If you want to read great erotica I would recommend Lora Leigh and Sarah McCarty."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"While I enjoyed Kenyon's and Black's stories, the best part of this book was \\"Promise Me Forever\\" by Melanie George. While I'll confess I'm a die-hard Melanie George fan I wouldn't let that sway me (and she writes more historicals than contemps so it was something different). But she did not disappoint! No one writes hot, sexy, tortured men like George, and Donovan Jerricho, superstar on the Grid Iron, is no exception! Donovan is misguided, without a doubt, his head is too full of the game and his own self-importance, but when fate intervenes he learns the true meaning of what is important in life - and making amends to the only woman who ever meant anything to him.

I have to say that \\"Captivated by You\\" was the best of all three. If you like short, steamy, predictable stories you'll like this book!"},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I bought this book because the blurbs on the jacket looked good for the first and last story. Perhaps, because I did not have high expectations about the authors, I thoroughly enjoyed both stories, especially the last one by Jaid Black. I have read a good amount of erotic romance, such as this book, but this is the first story I have read by Jaid Black. If, as another reviewer suggests, this is a poor example for her work, I would love to get my hands on any of her other stories!The second story did not look interesting, but I ended up reading it anyway. While it wasn't as bad as I feared, I agree with other reviewers that the chartcters and plot leave something to be desired. I don't want to give too much away, but it is unlikely that in real life (at least I hope so) the lead female character would make the choices that she did in such a short period of time in which the story's events take place.Basically, I've read better, but I've also read worse. This book has a mixed bag of stories. Jaid Black's story has both a well developed plot and interesting characters. I would highly recommend it. Sherrilyn Kenyon's story has a mildly diverting, but predictable plot, and standard characters. It is worth reading if paired with other good stories in an anthology. Melanie George's book has a poorly developed and predictable plot and cardboard characters. I would give it one star.So, if you like erotic romance, this is worth a read, but you may want to buy it used or categorize it as a low priority read."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"Reading Jaid Black's novella, Hunter's Right, was a real treat. In fact, it is the only good novella in the Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down anthology. I am a big Black fan since I read The Possession and I admit that am partial to her work, but her scrumptious tale stands out among the three stories in this book. Ronda Tipton is a Corporal of the US Army. The chopper she is in crashes, leaving her as the only survivor in the collision. Alone in the middle of the Arctic Circle, she discovers a secret civilization of Vikings. The men in this alternate place sell women in auction blocks, branding them properties of the men who buy them. Ronda could not go back to normal civilization. And she may not want to after she meets Nikolas Ericsson. Sherrilyn Kenyon's Captivated by You is the second part of a series. I thought the story of a female undercover agent and her feelings for her fellow partner wasn't all that hot. I did not like Melanie George's Promise Me Forever at all. I thought the heroine was quite pathetic and too much of a conformist.As said earlier, and as another reviewer pointed out, Jaid Black's novella is the only saving grace in this anthology. The others have little or no heat. I think Pocket Books has exaggerated the whole erotica concept of this book. The stories were not that erotic. Even Jaid Black's novella read like a toned down The Empress' New Clothes (her hot Ellora's Cave novel). All in all, if you are in the bargain for some steamy romantica, check out the Ellora's Cave anthologies. I'd suggest you skip this one unless you're a big fan of one or all of the authors here."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"\\"Captivated\\" By You: Sherrilyn Kenyon-- focuses on 2 agents from a secret government agency, Bureau of American Defense (BAD), who have long been attracted to each other, but never acted on their feelings. Our heroine, Rhea Stevenson is assigned as a dominatrix to capture a terrorist, but first needs practice to perfect her technique. Fellow agent \\"Ace\\" Krux volunteers to be her training slave, and their attraction takes over from there.I thought this story was the best in this series. It had a lot of humor, some exciting action sequences, and steamy romance. The characters were pretty well developed, and the story probably would've been better in novel form, but was just too rushed in short form.Both the other stories in the book were a big disappointment. Promise Me Forever: Melanie George was about as exciting as a trip through the car wash. It was about a ex-pro football player who returns home to a small town after an injury ends his career. He tries to reignite the flame with his high school sweetheart, who is engaged to another man... No big surprises here.Hunter's Right: Jaid Black-- also really disappointed me. Ronda Tipton is a US Army Corporal who, after a helicopter crash in the Arctic, stumbles on an underground civilization of Vikings. There's a marriage auction... and a revolt... a little too far fetched for me to become involved with the story.If you're looking for something along these lines, but a little more intriguing, try BOUND AND DETERMINED by Shelley Bradley, THE POSSESSION by Jaid Black or her \\"Best of\\" anthology."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"Or at least it doesn't compare at all to what I've previously read. The first two stories are like any Harlequin short story. The handcuffs added a touch of humor to the stories and the abduction, if it can be called that, was pretty mild mannered.The biggest disappointment was the Jaid Black story. The first few chapters were good, the plot, the leading lady, but after the Hunter claimed his \\"rights\\" to marry, it turned into a disaster. The dialogue was crude and uninspired. It felt like being catapulted into a bad parody of an x-rated movie. Before trying to sell this anthology as Erotica, the publishers should have researched the subject by reading an Emma Holly book, or a Black Lace novel."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"The title is very attention grabbing. And Sherrilyn Kenyon is a \\"must buy\\" for me, and will always remain so. While I usually stear clear of anthologies, with Kenyon's name on the book, I couldn't resist.Romantica, no. Fluff, yes."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"The problem most readers will always find within an anthology is the shockingly short stories that they include. The reason for this is one, they need to give each author a far amount of pages, and two generally anthologies are a way to introduce new talent by drawing the reader in with a well-known author. This anthology though features three well-known and popular authors within the romance genre. Why is this a problem? The answer is simple we the reader are used to their full-length efforts so we feel cheated by the fact that each story is less than 100 pages.All three stories are good although Melanie George's effort was my least favorite by far. I felt that the ending was too rushed and that this story would have been much better if given a long page count. There was simply to much crammed into too few pages. Otherwise all three stories offered yummy alpha male hero's, fun story lines, and of course great chemistry between the hero and heroine.If you are \\"new\\" to any of these authors this is a great introductory read. If on the other hand you've read these authors don't expect to be blown away, but do expect a fun and entertaining way to spend a few hours. Final assesment...I would recommend this read but would caution readers to lower there expectations just a tad and remind them that these are SHORT stories and to keep this in mind when diving between the pages.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"Anthologies either tend to be really good or really bad. With authors Sherrilyn Kenyon, Melanie George and Jaid Black, I was expecting great stories and only Jaid Black delivered. If not for her story Hunter's Right, this book would have rated a quick trip to the garbage can.The first story in the series is Sherrilyn Kenyon's Captivated by You. Secret Agents Rhea and Ace are assigned to a terrorist case whose leader prefers S&M.; Rhea and Ace must learn the ins and outs (no pun intended)to successfully convince their quarry that they are legitimate S&M; artists so they can gain his confidence and get the information to crack the case. The problem with this story is all the cheesy one liners and predictable interlog and jokes. It was actually rather boring.The second story \\"Promise me Forever\\" by Melanie George was the worst of the three. I only thought the first one was boring until I read this story. If you want to be dumped by your longtime boyfriend after he becomes a famous football player only to take him back after he is down and out (and by the way dump your good as gold fiance for him) go ahead, but don't expect readers to buy it. There was no passion and no warm fuzzies with this story.The last story by Jaid Black \\"Hunter's Right\\" was by far the best of the three stories. Ronda is a military official on a secret mission in the Artic Circle. When the helicopter she is on crashes, Ronda is the only survivor. Knowing there is a secret military headquarters nearby, Ronda goes searching for help only to stumble across a hidden underground civilization of an ancient race of Vikings. Believing the prophecy that their forefathers warned of where women would become near extinct because of genetic tampering with births, these Vikings venture above ground from time to time and steal unattached females to put on the \\"Bridal Auction Block\\". An injured Ronda stumbles onto an auction in progress and is horrified to see these women striped naked and inspected like livestock by men looking for wives. She attempts to flee, but is captured by gorgeous Nikolas Ericsson. Nikolas covets Ronda but believes she wouldn't want him, however when he sees her taken away in chains after beating [...] out of the auctioneers, he claims hunters rights to keep her safe. Nikolas is building his weapons supply and army to overthrow the current leader of the underground nation. He wants to restore more dignity to the bridal auction and make civilization better for all the citizens. When Ronda realizes she can never return to her old life, she decides to make the best of her marriage. Ronda and Nikolas end up falling in love. The sexual scenes definitely are not boring, however some people may be turned off by the crude language and descriptions both Ronda and Nikolas use. However, I think this story saved the series. I kind of wish it had been a longer more in depth story as these characters deserved development, but it was still good."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"First of all, I've never been a big fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's BAD series. I think the stories are unrealistic, the heroes are arrogant alpha males with no redeeming qualities, and the women are too fast-mouthed and sassy for my tastes. Also, I'd already read the collection Born to Be BAD and had read the short story in this collection. I wasn't impressed the first time, and I was equally underwhelmed this time.As for the Melanie George story, it was such a snooze, I skipped to the next story after reading the first 5 pages. Boring!Thank God for Jaid Black, who might be the only reason this collection even sold. Hunter's Right is erotic, passionate, and entertaining--almost enough to make up for the clear misses by Kenyon and George. I read another story about Black's underground Vikings in the novella collection Playing Easy to Get, so if you liked Hunter's Right, I'd suggest you check that one out. It has another equally bad BAD story by Sherrilyn Kenyon, but also includes the first story in Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark series, which is a real treat if you like paranormal romance. I have that collection to thank for leading me to Jaid Black, and while Hunter's Right was great, it's not enough to make Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down worth purchasing. I'd buy it used or check it out from the library instead."},{"Title":"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down","review":"I like all of these authors, but this book had very little to offer in the way of erotic romance.

I started out with little knowledge of ActionScript and working with the ActionScript associated with Flash's XML objects and methods. The authors explain almost every thing so clearly, that you understand not only how to work with the XML objects and methods, but how to work with ActionScript. I've found that there are quite a few errors that cause things not to work, which kind of bugged. But with my new knowledge was able to correct the bugs. ....

Elaine Batcher's \\"Building the Barriers: Adolescent Girls Delimit the Future\\" provides an ethnographic study of a community of middle-class adolescents in Toronto and the group formation that arises from their (seemingly endless) time at the local shopping mall. Batcher's observations and interviews produce an insightful reading of the various factors that limit teenage girls' assumptions about their own capabilities and roles. In the chapter that follows, Naomi Goldenberg's \\"Resurrecting the Female Body: An Agenda for Feminist Theory\\" attempts to tease out what \\"the body\\" and its articulation in theory must include. Goldenberg laments the isolation and \\"deadness\\" caused by modern mechanized culture, and calls for a resurrection of body as signifier that would broaden to include affective and unconscious life in addition to physical experience."},{"Title":"Calibration: Philosophy in Practice","review":"I had read this book because of an ISO 9000 issue after an audit. This book was very helpful on metrology fundamental and uncertainty statement, that was our concern. The explanations are very good for a begineer. Because Fluke is a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment (DVMs, oscilloscopes, calibrators), the book covers only themes regarding the metrology of electronic devices, including fundamental of electronic equipment calibrations. I recomend sections two (Elements of Metrology), section five (statistics)and section six (Laboratory Management). Chapter 22 is very good explaining uncertainty issues. However, the book is focused in calibration laboratories and it isn't clear metrology applications according to ISO 9000 requirements, that is a widely required by many people."},{"Title":"Calibration: Philosophy in Practice","review":"This book was written by the Fluke Corporation, a major manufacturer of quality electronic testing equipment such as digital multi-meters (DMM). Most chapters explain a feature or standard to be measured. The chapters explain how the standard is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Testing) and explain how the Fluke Corporation performs its calibration. This reader believes that if this subject matter appeals to anyone, the chapter overviews and summaries are the most interesting. The book has many schematics and shows various testing and calibration circuits, enough to cause anyones eyes to glaze over. This book is not really for someone in the general quality-calibration field interested in the \\"philosophy of calibration\\". I found it a narrow specific technical book that would be of interest to a few people planning to setup up a calibration laboratory for a large company or a service company. This book really goes in-depth into the calibrating equipment, circuits and various alternative ways to measure the same feature. I reviewed this book to let it be known that the title is a little mis-leading and gives no hint to the onslaught of technical information within. The book is more for someone known as a calibrator's calibrator. It will give some appreciation to why some DMM cost $10.00 and some over$600.00"},{"Title":"Calibration: Philosophy in Practice","review":"\\"Calibration\\" reviews some of the most important application notes of Fluke on devices and techniques that are still important to most metrology laboratories around the world. It is centered around electrical metrology, and some of its last chapters are dedicated to laboratory management and control. Just to keep it short, the sections on AC metrology and AC-DC transfers call for special attention, as they are very up-to-date even at the present days.The scope of the book is very large; yet, it can be very specific on most of the chapters, and present all the most important topics and bibliography on subjects, without getting too deep into complicated language and technical obscure terminology at all. All this make of it a book which must certainly be among the prime references of the experienced metrologist as well as people new to metrology, or anyone who, for some reason, needs to make use of any metrology tools."},{"Title":"The Curse","review":"Houppert offers extensive information.

Thorough in description, tracing events from the initial encounters between US and Pakistan since 1947, to President Clinton's visit to Islamabad in March 2000, Kux's narrative makes for an absorbing and gripping read. Heavily referenced, it has drawn from a variety of sources, including the US national archives, the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson presidential libraries, Nixon's papers and the Public Record Office in London. He also obtained documents by invoking the US Freedom of Information Act. Moreover, he was able to interview over 50 senior Pakistani officials who had played key roles in their country's dealings with Washington. The result is some rare insights into the making of history, much of it so far hidden from view.Kux has an added advantage since he served in the American embassy in Islamabad in two critical phases, from 1957 to 1959, and again from 1969 to 1971, and was eyewitness to many of the events that led to the blossoming of the relationship.Few relationships in the international arena have been as turbulent as Pakistan's with the United States. Washington's engagement with Islamabad has swung like a pendulum in the last fifty years or so. Ambassador Kux tried hard, with some success, to remove the misgivings of Pakistanis about the American lack of sincerity in bilateral relations as Washington always dumped the country once its interests were served. This once again is the topic of intense discussion in Pakistan today, even among the educated and the pro-Western class. To understand the dynamics of this ever changing relationship, especially in the emerging scenario, this timely book is a must read."},{"Title":"The United States and Pakistan, 1947-2000: Disenchanted Allies (Adst-Dacor Diplomats and Diplomacy Series)","review":"For anyone curious about Pakistan-US relations, this book by former Ambassador Dennis Kux tells the story.

The target audience is advanced high school students or college undergraduates. It is much more like an outline on all the steps required to write a math paper. That is everything from choosing an idea, to keeping a journal, to formatting the paper, to presenting an oral presentation.The math is shown in the examples which are great. Proofs are discussed with examples, but remember the focus is on the project and not math theory. Most of the math is basic geometry and very easy to follow along. Gerver states that problem solving is assessed problem to problem. To learn it you have to solve problems. For example, there is an exercise where you draw a simple picture and your partner, without looking, ask mathematical questions to see if he can recreate the drawing.The paper will outline everything for the project. Chapter 10 deals with statistics and seems out of place, but again, the examples are excellent.One drawback was on the Kindle some of the example papers were impossible to read. But the book is an easy read. A lot of the discussion seems like common sense, but as you read along you see that everything fits nicely.(If you are a high school math teacher you will want this book. There is an appendix for instructors.)"},{"Title":"The Hampstead Poisonings: A Mycroft Holmes Adventure","review":"The Hampstead Poisonings is an investigation by Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes' older and more intellectually-able brother.One of the best aspects of this novel is the slow unfolding of plots within plots, with the story taking a few unexpected turns to keep the reader on his/her toes.However, I wasn't overly impressed by Petrie's supporting characters or even his portrayal of Mycroft Holmes. He seems determined to portray the British characters as upper-class twits, sometimes only in the speech patterns but often in their other actions.I was also disappointed that Mycroft was not either a complete armchair theorist nor a man of action. Had he been portrayed as one or the other, he might have seemed more consistent. Instead, while he states an unwillingness to carry out physical activity, when the time comes he charges in with the best of them without a second thought at the time later.My view: a clever plot somewhat let down by the characterisation and writing.

The main characters in this book is John Procter, Abigal, Paris, Mr Hale, and the judges in the trial. This book takes place in 1692 in Salem, Mass. There are several people who are suspected as witches, and are making the children sick. Abigal a 17 year old girl is suspected of titilating John Procter. Procter is trying to convince the judges that his wife Elizabeth is not a witch. Paris was the town minister who's daughter is sick. Mr Hale is a minister from a neighboring town and is known for his work in casting out demonic spirits. Overall this book was okay. Miller was comparing the Salem witch trials with the McCarthy hearing which was going on when Miller wrote the book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's play &quot;The Crucible&quot; is a play that defies all boundaries of time relevancy. It applies not only to the literal period in which it is placed, but also for other time periods most notably the Red Scare of the 1950's, set off by Senator Joe McCarthy (R-WI). It deals with the idea of hysteria and the terrible concept of guilt by association, and blindly blaming individuals, or blaming them for one's own financial profit. However, the play in and of itself is a great literary work. Miller does an outstanding job to convey the dark, melancholy atmosphere. He also portrays the hysteria of the town very well, chilling sometimes even his reader. Miller does a good job at showing a variety of characters and an intriguing plot. Miller creates a compelling story that explores the basis of a society powered by fear and greed."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play is a major must-read.

The play as a whole was very good. I liked how I learned a lot about Salem Mass., and the witchcraft that sappositly happened at that time. My favorite character of the book was Proctor, because he was a ladies man, and stuck up for the town, by saying that he did perform witchcraft, mean while he really did not. The only reason that he did, was because he did not want the whole town to sufure. What it sounded like, was going on in the play, was that everybody was blaming each other for the problem that had occured. People were figthing over land, and about the witch carft thing. Proctor, being the man that he is took part of the blam, to save others.The play as a whole was good. It had some good morals in it, but it was not great.

To make things worse Proctor is married Elizabeth. The story dosnt stop there. Abby is telling the town that Elizabeth is a witch. John Proctor is also under suspision. They have trails and so forth..............Arthur Miller does a great job of summing up the 17th century. New people are coming to America to settle. All the people that come are from different parts of the world with different beleifs. This is how the witch trials started.

(Except for To Kill a Mockingbird, that was a brilliant choice on the Board of Education's part.) I found that however negative my attitude to school books was, it disappeared throughout this play. It was not close to the best play ever written (especially when it has Shakespeare as it's competition) but it was nevertheless, ultimately very entertaining in watching war movie kind of way. You cannot comprehend what is occuring, yet you cannot tear your eyes away from the truth. (Or part of the truth.) The characters annoy every facet of my mind, with the selfish Abagail, the (what must be pedophilic) John Protor and of course the Preist Parris. How could I forget.

Miller, a brilliant yet flawed man, experienced personal tragedy in his tempestuous marriage to and relationship with Marilyn Monroe. He watched as many of his friends suffered the wrath of the government during the McCarthy era. Miller distilled his own experiences into one of the most memorable tragic figures in American Literature: John Proctor.John Proctor is the protagonist of Miller's play, The Crucible. Set during the Salem witch trials, The Crucible is an extended meditation of the destruction that occurs when people falsely accuse others.Proctor is no hero. He is a man who is deeply respected by his fellow townsfolk. When accusations of witchcraft start flying around Salem, Proctor is urged to declare that the chief \\"confessor,\\" Abigail, is a fraud. The only problem is that Proctor had once had an affair with Abigail. His concern for his good name causes him to hold his tongue.The plot begins to broil when Proctor's own wife is accused of being a witch. She is then arrested. Proctor accuses Abigail of having accused his wife out of jealousy. Yet Proctor's plan to expose Abigail fails when his wife lies to try and protect his name. Proctor himself is accused of being a witch and is arrested.One of the ministers involved in the trials becomes doubtful of the whole situation. He tries to convince the accused of making confessions rather than face death. He persuades Proctor's wife to ask Proctor to confess. Proctor finally surrenders his personal pride and agrees to make a false confession about having been a witch. Yet when he makes his confession, the court tells him that he must name others. Proctor refuses and as a consequence, is sent to the gallows.One gets the sense that Miller saw a lot of Proctor in himself. Miller, though not righteous, was willing to publicly decry the with trials of his own time. The Crucible had a considerably shorter theatrical run than Miller's earlier works. During the virulently anti-Communist fifties, Miller was putting his career on the line by writing The Crucible. While not on the same scale as Proctor's sacrifice, Miller's dilemma was great. Notwithstanding its contemporary importance, Miller's play, and the character of Proctor in general, speak more broadly to the ideas of America and the America tragic hero than they do the issues of their respective periods.America is a land born of cooperation. The States had to unite in order to throw off the British Imperial yoke. Yet America has also always been a land that holds the notion of rugged individualism dear. Though Jefferson gave it clear expression, rugged individualism had been a characteristic of America since its earliest colonial days. These two elements (cooperation and individualism) have combined to form a conflicted national identity.This same conflict occurs within Proctor. Proctor is an individual and proud of it. Nothing means more to him than the picture of personal honor he presents to others. The great irony of Miller's play is that Proctor measures his individual worth by what others think of him. It is this concern for the community that twice is his undoing.The first time Proctor is undone it is in a negative way. His concern for his good name with the community leads him to not expose Abigail as a fraud. He is rendered silent by his fear of exposure as an adulterer. Abigail's power and influence grow in the meantime. This eventually leads to the arrest of both Proctor and his wife.The second time Proctor is undone is depicted more positively. He refuses to falsely accuse others of witchcraft. This means certain death for the individual (Proctor) and uncertain good for the community (Salem). Proctor's ultimate choice is that the good of the many is superior to the concerns of the individual. Yet the community is malignant. It is the source of many of Proctor's woes. Perhaps this is the main point of Miller's play: the true tragedy in America is the country's unfulfilled dream of individual independence. Whenever dangers threaten the land, be they real or imagined, the individual suffers in the name of the common good.John Proctor is a hero in as far as he is representative of all Americans. Whatever the ideological persuasion of the reader or audience member, something about Proctor's plight speaks to the American experience.The Crucible is a great play. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I bought this so my learning disabled students could read along in class with the play. However the sound is so low and the actors speak way too quickly for them to understand."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Excellent play. Enjoyed reading it and rehearsing with a friend before auditioning. Didn't make the cut, but it was well worth the experience. Ray Baird"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller just passed away but left us a legacy from which we can interpret economic and political realities. In this play, a group of women are charged with witchcraft. In order to save their own skins, a few of the young female denizens of Salem denounce others as participants, asserting accusations of spiritual assaults etc... The interesting point here is that we assume that one is guilty until proven innocent. In 17th century Salem, one is guilty until proven innocent. This is both a critique of the fallacies of our perceptions concerning our government and the nature of Christianity. After the fall we are all guilty in a way.I will skip the communist interpretations as it has been performed ad nauseum. We are entering another witch hunt for terrorists and their allies; either you are with the terrorists or with us. There is a subtext of patriotism that informs guilt. While we are not to the point that we were in the fifties, I don't think we are that far off. Another interesting point, Tituba is characterized as the ringleader. She is from the Carribean and I would presume black. Substitute Arab and it begins to look very plausible. The play works on many levels and is not only a critique of McCarthyism, it is also a critique of our misperceptions and the way in which we perceive."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I surprisingly enjoyed this book though it was assigned reading for school. The obvious parallels of the play's setting, in the time of the Salem Witch Trials, to the Red Scare of Arthur Miller's time actually add to how one may reflect what they've read in this play. In place of Abigail pointing her finger and crying \\"Witch! Witch!\\" at anyone who crosses her, one can easily see McCarthy pointing his finger in every direction and crying \\"Communist! Traitor!\\"My favorite thing about this work though are not the parallels to the 20th century Communist scare. It is the realationship between John Proctor and his wife Elizabeth. They suffer the most at Abigail's whims, Proctor having had an affair with the girl and Elizabeth dismissing her from serving in their household when she suspected as much. Even through Proctor's unfaithfulness and the accusation of Elizabeth practicing witchcraft, the couple holds a certain tenderness to each other and maintain it even through tenser scenes. I loved the ending though it was quite sad. It added to the melancholy of the theme."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I read this play in the beginning of eighth grade. For the Salem Witch Trials always fascinated me. So I read this book. It is a beautifully written play telling of the events of the Salem Witch Trials. It was excellent. However, difficult to read, at least I thought so, if you did not really know the History of the Salem Trials. Anyway, I recommend this play not read by children under thirteen. It was quite intense. Some parts, were extremely frightening. Anyway, the main characters of this play were: John Proctor, Abigail Williams, Tituba Indian, and Elizabeth Proctor. The book was about this: In the beginning Salem's minister catches a group of girls (including his own niece!) in the woods practicing witchcraft along with Tituba. Then accusations of witches began, and hangings began. I will not tell more of the story-I will spoil it. But, read this play.

This play takes place during the late 16th century (I think) in the town of Salem where one girl persuade almost all of the townspeople into believing there were witches in the town. From there, she starts accusing the innocent people of witchcraft. This play also shows how one girl's love is so strong for a man she loves that she is willing to do anything for it, even if it means getting hurt, or killing people. This is a very touching play of Arthur Millers. This is a book everyone should read to experience how those times were corrupted. People should learn from their mistakes in history, for it may repeat itself......"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Overall, the story was good, although I believe there are some historical inaccuracies.For one, Proctor died before Giles in the real trials.I didn't like the fact that the author interrupted the dialouge to inject some of his own commentary (in the form of an essay) under the pretense of talking about a character.I did, however, find the story, especially the ending, an interesting commentary on the Salem Witch trials, and the petty jealousies we all hold."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This was a good. I think this because it was talking about real life, and what happened to the people that didn't confess that were accused. It showed the truth about how the witch hunts went and how the accused people got treated. Abigail Williams was very inconsiderate of others. She just was saying the lies so she wouldn't get in trouble. No one was listening to all the sides of the stories and so later if they found out that they were not witches they wouldn't care. So if they were to listen so many people wouldn't have been in jail. Also the characters were brave especially the one's that were punished. Thamas Putnam was very selfish in how he wanted the land for himself. I think he should have gotten hung, but not for witch craft but for killing for no good reason, but to help himself and his money. Also when the girls just started to yell out names everyone believed them. I couldn't believe the judges believed the girls when they were acting like they were getting witch craft fellings from Mary Warren. The judges were just believing anything that was brought to him that involved witch craft. Rev. Hale I thought acted very well and was trying to stay within what God thinks is right."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The CrucibleThe crucible is a pretty good book. It is not only a good peace of literature but also a good history lesson. It sends a mix of messages throughout the story such as , good vs. evil, why are the towns people so cruel?, why do they put so much judgment on each other and lastly are the townsmen turning other suspected witches in for the sake of the town or to cover their own backs? As you read the book, it gives off a sense of evil and demonic feeling. Although, you probly feel annoyed with certain characters in the book, you soon come to realize that they're only doing what they thought was in the best interest for the town.The crucible is all about the excommunicating of witches in the early 1900\`s. All the people believed excommunicating or even better, burning them at the stake would eliminate the problem. I think for the time it took place and obvious lack of trust that was in the town the people were truly fighting for the best thing in their minds. I also feel like the people are living an unaccomplished life because all they did was fear each other and accuse each other of witchcraft.In my opinion, the book is a good read and it offers a lot to think about when you put it down. That is if you can put it down. All in all the suspicion , hatred, accusations, and judgmental attitudes turned out to be one of the most interesting parts of American History. This book is a good piece and Id recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The CrucibleA witch hunt is what they wanted and a witch hunt is what they got. The small town of Salem is devastated to find out that its own young and seemingly innocent maids, daughters and even wives are Satan possessed witches.This story starts out simply enough, in the village pastor's house. His daughter has been odd lately and doctors and ministers have come from far and wide to help the young girl and others suffering from similar symptoms in the town. They will quickly find out that they are dealing with something far more potent that the flu.I don't usually enjoy reading, but this book had a certain something to it that pulled me right in. Perhaps it was the relationship you develop out of sympathy for Mr. Proctor and his wife. Maybe it's just the curiosity of who will be accused of witch craft next. One would have to read the book for them to find out. The Crucible is a play and is written in the format of a play. This can pose a problem to someone who spaces out or confuses easily. In the beginning of the story the characters run in and out of the scenes so quickly and with such little description that its easy to get lost or completely forget who entire families are until they are completely re-presented to you in later events. Either that or you'll have to go back and re-read everything that confused you.Other than the mild difficulty I experienced following who was who in the beginning (I might just be an idiot), I found some very interesting quotes and poetic phrases in this book. It is very well written and definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible, one of Arthur Miller's best, and most well known books, is based off the Salem witch trials.John Proctor, a middle aged farmer, is in a town run by the local preachers. Abigail Williams, a 17 year old girl, gets the town to follow her, after accusing many of the town leaders, of being witches. Something happened between John and Abigail, and it obviously hurts John. John tries to stop Abigail, while keeping his secret underwraps dduring the trial.The play is pretty short, aroung 150 pages, and is in a somewhat old-southern language, so the reader should understand it before reading.I highly recommend this to any play reader and any avid reader.\\"He have his goodness now. God forbid I take it from him.\\""},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's \\"The Crucible\\", although a great play in its own right, was a reaction to the hysteria and panic that proceeded during the McCarthy trials. The Salem Witch Trials of 1692 are the backdrop for the book's premise, and they seem to parallel the whole idea of chaos which ensues when \\"mass idea\\" takes over a community, in this case the belief that many of the townspeople are involved in some sort of witchcraft.Concisely written, \\"The Crucible\\" does not waste words, yet still packs a serious punch. The underlying themes encompassed within the novel-mass hysteria, intolerance, faith (and lack thereof)-are issues not only dealt with in this society, but ours as well in certain cases. Embedded within the message of the work is the idea that \\"mass thought\\" can affect how a society believes and operates, and in this case it is of the girls and other members of Salem accused of dealings with malevolent forces.John Proctor, despite his faults, is the one voice of common reason and logic. He gets Mary Warren to return to court to try and discredit the testimonies of the girls accused, but in the process seals his own fate. As a symbol for protest against all the illogical reasoning, Proctor shows his willpower in the play's climactic scene.All in all, this is a thought-provoking play that takes on many subjects relevant to both the 1950s and today. If you are interested in the McCarthyism of the 1950s or the Witch Trials, you are sure to find this book interesting. I'm glad I finally decided to sit down and read this book after hearing so much about it!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's most famous of works, The Crucible comes through in ways few plays do. Miller's powerful language portray the chaos and fear of the time in spotless fashion, as the accusations of witchcraft get passed around like a basket of buns at a Thanksgiving table. It's almost as if Miller lived through one of the more perplexing eras in American history. This classic piece of American literature is a must read for any High School student."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"What is really unfortunate to the mesmerizing Arthur Miller's play\\"The Crucible\\" is that is was written after his \\"Death of a Salesman\\". Hadn't the play writer written \\"Death...\\", \\"The Crucible\\" would certainly be regarded as his unique masterpiece -- however, I believe the honor must be shared-- which is not that bad for readers and audiences.Performed for the first time in 1953, \\"The Crucible\\" is loosely based on the famous Salem witchcraft trials that happened in 1962. Miller used the actual even as an inspiration to create a fable that resonated in his time's politics -- which was called the witch hunting. The play was written in response to Senator McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee's crusade against supposed communist sympathizers. Despite the changes, as Miller states in a prose prologue to the play, his objective is to \\"the reader will discover (...) the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history\\".At the end of the play, one can be sure that the writer achieved his aim. \\"The Crucible\\" paints with the right paints a portray of mass hysteria, paranoia, chaos and manipulation. What's more, it achieves a higher level when it manages to deal with the 50s politics -- which happened to be touched by mass hysteria, chaos and manipulation as well.As a whole, the symbolism in the play is the paranoia about communism that pervaded the United States in the 1950s. with his text, Miller managed to bring up several parallels between the House Un-American Activities Committee's rooting out of suspected communists during this time and the seventeenth-century witch-hunt. In both cases, the narrow-mindedness and the excess of zeal ended up blinding people. Like in Salem, the communists were encouraged to name names and confess their \`crimes'.In \\"The Crucible\\", Miller's concern is not to with the fact that the accused are witches or not -- but rather with the unwillingness of the court to believe they are not. In this case, in the McCarthyism era, so full of excess, many innocents were condemned, and this parallel is what resonates from Miller's words even more than 50 years later.Miller vaguely based his characters in the actual ones, but in his prologue, as a disclaimer, he alleges that he was forced to make many changes. Abigail's age for instance was raised, the judges were symbolized by only two etc. But, as he explains, this is not a historical work.One of the most impressive points in the play is the theocratic society --where church and state are one, and the only allowed form of religion in Salem is the Puritanism. The witch trials represent the expression of intolerance --while the hanging is the means of restoring the purity of the community. On the other hand, hysteria plays the role of tearing this society apart. It supplants logic and people start to believe that people they have always known are not what they believed to be. Abigail is the character that has an important role triggering this hysteria, since she wants to marry John Proctor, and for that must get rid of his wife. Others simply use her device --while others fall into her trap. In the end, the community is into pieces.As one of the characters says that was \`a strange time'. So was when Miller wrote his play -- and so is today. That is why Miller's \\"The Crucible\\" is such a timeless piece. Reading this play --opposed to watching it performed -- is an enhancing experience. Many of the writer's digressions are not in the stage -- that's why reading this book is a complementary homework for those who have already seen it performed or in the 1996 movie version."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller is among the world's greatest play writers in history. This is among his best works. It is great not because it is largely factually accurate, but because it was a courageous statement about a Wisconsin politician causing similar hysteria about communism.Vendettas and greed for land and money caused neighbors to turn on each other in Salem. These weaknesses in society allowed a collection of teenage girls to hypnotize Salem with their lies. In the end, most of the town ends up being accused of witchery. It was only when the town exhausted their search for potential witches that the hysteria slowed. Recognizing the error of Salem's court, the government was forced to step forward and compensate the families of the deceased.From a literary standpoint, Miller wrote The Crucible masterfully. Reverrend Parris is the corrupt minister who naturally draws the reader's ire. The groupthink that causes others to follow him is one of the most dangerous elements in society. Many of these elements are very present in today's world with a media that thinks for people. This is truly a literary and theatrical masterpiece."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"As much as I love DEATH OF A SALESMAN (my favorite play), A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE (a gripping modern Greek tragedy), and ALL MY SONS (a sadly underrated play), I am sometimes convinced that THE CRUCIBLE is Arthur Miller's masterpiece. It is Shakespearean in structure and has a large cast of intriguing characters, the most fascinating of whom is the protagonist, John Proctor. Unlike SALESMAN's Willy Loman, Proctor is a true tragic hero, because his \\"fall from grace\\" - his adultery - makes it necessary for him to face a series of trials that test, with ever-increasing severity, his moral character (hence the play's title). In the end, Proctor loses his life but saves his soul - or his \\"name,\\" as he calls it. I find the final image of Proctor tearing his false confession and following his friends to the gallows extremely moving. Proctor is a hero because, though flawed, he is a basically good man who is tested to his limits and ultimately passes the tests. Proctor does what is right even when it means he must sacrifice his life.Having read the play four times and seen it twice, I do think that some may find it a bit too \\"cerebral.\\" This is because Miller has so many IDEAS about the meaning of good and evil and of honor, justice, etc., and his characters spend a lot of time TALKING about them. There is a lack of action in THE CRUCIBLE if one compares it to (say) A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE. However, the theatricality of the sequences in which the girls of Salem seem to be possessed by demons more than compensates for static stretches in which the characters talk only (for instance, the scene in which Reverend Hale is questioning the Proctors). Is THE CRUCIBLE Miller's masterpiece, after all? I haven't decided yet. But it is a fascinating drama with a great tragic hero, John Proctor."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Truly Artur Miller's greatest work. I own at least three copies of this book and have read it over twelve times. No matter how many times I have read it, watched it live, watched it on tape, or performed in it, the story has never bored me. It constantly reveals something new to me and forces me to look at my world in a slightly new manner after each reading.By far Miller's best play, it is also his most well-known. It contains strong connections with McCarthy-ism and is therefore relevant to even today. It is important to realize that while it is set in 1692, it has connections to all time periods and thusly, must not be trapped within it's own time period.A driving piece of work that will blow you away."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This concise and well-crafted play takes a look at the singularly dark and surprisingly medieval events of the Salem witch trails. The play was written by Arthur Miller, the acclaimed American playwright from Michigan and one-time husband of movie icon Marilyn Monroe. All other accounts of this story tend to suffer by comparison to Miller's. His characters (most or all were real people in the actual event) are convincing and the language believable and tight. The story recounts the events, the awful trials and the subsequent \\"justice\\" administered on those concerned. Theories since have suggested voodoo, ergot poisoning, land-grabbing, religous fervor, blatant evil, lust and superstitious ignorance as possible explanations for the events -- but Millers account seems as reasonable an account as any and better than most. Having read this play at school and seen it performed live, I must admit that I preferred reading it to watching it, although I saw a rather unusual contemporary version. \\"A fart on you Thomas Putnam\\"!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"After seeing the recent New York production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, I felt compelled to rush out and buy a copy of this powerful play and devour it. The play does not lose its impact as a piece of literature divorced from its theatrical presentation. This portrayal of Salem witch trials was written as a shadow commentary on the McCarthy trials but the play still has a terrible relevancy to today's raucous world. This play rips away the black-and-white, simple good-and-evil view of the world of many leaders and shows the relativism and the dangers of such view points. Aside from this, though, this play is entertaining in a very breathtaking way with very powerful character portrayals that makes these historical personalities both universal and powerfully true to their historical period."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"There's so much going on in this play that I don't know where to begin. On the surface it's about the Salem Witch trials, and if that's all you get out of it that's more than enough. But there's so much more there as well. It's an attack against Mccarthyism too. If you know your history it's easy to see the parallels. In either case it's about paranoia (the first ones to go are the ones who're a little odd), mass hysteria (self explanatory), revenge, (if someone has crossed you, why not accuse them), and greed (Abby's accusing Elizabeth so she can have her husband). It's about guilt too, primarily that which John Proctor feels, (I hope I'm not giving away too much here, but John had an affair with Abby).So where does the naming of names come in. Well, both in the trials and in the HUAC (House Unamerican Activities Committee) hearings, you could assure your own safety, and prove your innocence by implicating someone else. The argument is put to John Proctor that what harm will it do to accuse someone who is all ready condemned. The same occurred in the HUAC hearings. In the end Proctor has a chance to save himself, but lose what honor he has left (he is after all an adulterer, and while not as serious now, it was a big thing then), or die honorably--to leave some suspense in it, I won't say which he chooses, although you can probably guess. In the HUAC hearings there were those who named names (Elia Kazan is the only one I remember, but yes, this is what the controversy about him receiving a lifetime acheivement award hinged on), and those who didn't (Miller, Dashielle Hammet, Lillian Hellman to name a few). While no one died as a result of the HUAC hearings, as far as I know, careers were in essence permanently ruined."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible- A play, I enjoyed reading that had an interesting plot and showed how humans act when faced with life or death depending on their testimonies, and how life is a series of tests until death.The word crucible means a heat-resistant container or a severe test. I believe Arthur Miller, the author, had called it \\"The Crucible\\" because his play is about a severe test or tests. The main characters are Reverend Parris, who has a daughter Betty, John Proctor, who is married to Elizabeth, Abigail Williams, is a teenage that lies, has an affair, and is a niece to Reverend Parris, and Reverend Hale, who is a young minister that claims he is an expert on witchcraft.I liked this play because it is similar to everyday life of facing good and evil. It gives an outlook for knowing the right things to do and putting words into actions. The play illustrates the effect it can have on someone's life when so much evil has caused damage before learning to be honest and doing what is right. Throughout the play there are times when the character must make a choice, lie and live, or tell the truth and die. The test of lying to live is something I would never want to have to face, especially in that time period when the means of execution was hanging.John Proctor, a farmer, is truly put to the test. He is a good person, but has an affair with Abigail. When Reverend Parris' daughter is said to be bedridden due to an unknown illness, everyone in town is concerned. The truth of what happened is that Abigail and a few girls did a witchcraft dance around a fire at night and drank blood. Because Betty is feeling so guilty, she stares and doesn't talk while she is bedridden. Abigail wants everyone to lie about what happened around the fire. John Proctors comes to visit Betty. When he arrives, Abigail looks at him with alluring eyes. Proctor states, \\"Ah, you're wicked yet aren't you!\\" (22) Here is a test for John Proctor. He has done wrong by having an affair and now alone with his former lover, he is tempted by her to try again. Abigail tries to encourage him, but he refuses her. This part I like in the played because it is a test of what is right.Elizabeth knows her husband is a good person, even though he has sinned by having the affair. John stops going to church because the guilt of his affair and the dislike he has of the sermons of Rev. Parris about material things. John states to Elizabeth, \\"He sees no light of God in that man\\"(58) John recognizes this greed, but also his sorrow for his affair and having to be reminded by it, if he did go to church. Here is another test for John, a test of faith.Abigail has her group of girls having everyone in town believing that the town is filled with witchcraft. Her followers are: Mary Warren, Ruth Putnam, Mercy Lewis and Betty Parris. They tell everyone that they have seen different people with the devil. Of course, Abigail eventually states that Elizabeth is working with the devil and tried to put a needle in her. The town goes into hysteria and people are brought to trial. During the start of the trial John's wife, Elizabeth begs John to testify in court that Abigail is a liar. Here is another test for John. Should he admit his adultery to the town or let Abigail continue to lie at the cost of others' lives? John states, \\"My wife will not die! I will bring your guts into your mouth, but that goodness will not die for me!\\" (76 )John's wife forgave him for the affair but now her life is at risk. John once again is faced with a test, to lie and live or not.Finally, John admits about his affair with Abigail. Abigail's jealousy and lies have caused the deaths of so many. John is placed in jail. Now John has to decide to cleanse his name or lie. John knows Abigail lies about witchcraft and falsely accusing people from her town as following the devil, caused deaths of innocent people.Elizabeth cries out at the end, \\"He have his goodness now, God forbid I take it away from him!\\" (126) John had a choice to lie and save his life, or tell the truth and die. Elizabeth knows John is a man who is right, even though he has not always done the right thing. Should John lie and save his life? This is the final test for John. To find out the ending, read \\"The Crucible!\\"This play is a test about life and finding out how important honesty is to you."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The last time I read &quot;The Crucible&quot; was in high school back in the 1960s. Over the years I had forgotten much of what it was about, however it wasn't until I listened to the excellent production by L.A. Theatre Works that the raw emotions of this gripping story came to life.As a few other reviewers here have suggested, this story works better as a play, not just a high school &quot;textbook.&quot; I'd suggest that any students who have to read this book also take the time to listen to this recording.My impression this time is that a merciless, judgmental religion is no true religion. I hope that young readers, or listeners, will realize that this is not the type of religion that Christ intended."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible, Arthur Miller's allegory for the McCarthy era trials, is a wonderful story of pride, love, power, and redemption.Act One sets the stage very nicely, with a sense of distrust and suspicion in the air that's just waiting to erupt into full hysteria. We're introduced to several interesting characters. There's Parris, the self-righteous minister; Abigail, the voluptuous young woman; and Proctor, the protective farmer. Of course, these are just a few of the characters, but, in my opinion, they are the most interesting. My only complaint on Act One is the lengthy side notes made by Miller used to make characterizations that didn't fit into the play otherwise, and explain historical facts and rumors in more detail. Despite these missives being useful, they also tend to be quite intrusive. I often found myself backtracking through the pages to remind myself what was going on.Act Two continues to set the stage for impending hysteria, with the arrest of Elizabeth and numerous other women accused of witchcraft. Giles Corey and Francis Nurse's wives are also taken into custody, despite the evidence against one of them simply being an interest in books.Act Three introduces us to the unrepentant Judge Danforth. In my opinion, he's the second most unlikable character, bested (for serious lack of a better word) only by Abigail. He's the main proprietor of the idea that neutrality on an issue is simply non-existent, and this coupled with his vicious ideology make him quite a deplorable character indeed.It is also in this act that John Proctor, the protagonist, is charged with witchcraft, while his wife is let free due to a pregnancy. Tensions stir, causing a complete eruption, ending in the resignation of Minister Hale from Danforth's proceedings.Act Four finds Proctor in jail, facing execution unless he confesses to having been under the control of the Devil. In Elizabeth's confidence, he firmly defends his innocence, but ponders the possibility that perhaps he should confess to save his own life, which Elizabeth supports.Proctor reluctantly decides that he will lie and confess to save his own life. However, when he finds that Danforth intends for his confession to be in writing and hung upon the church door, he retracts his confession and states that he would rather die than tell a lie and be the judge of others. The curtain falls as Proctor is brought out to hang, with a cry from Danforth of, \\"Hang them high over the town! Who weeps for these weeps for corruption!\\"There's a running sense of doubt among all the characters, which perhaps adds to the fear of God that causes the eventual aberration. It's an extremely moving tale on its own, but the fact that it's almost a flawless mirror of the McCarthyist era makes it all the more affecting. The characters are all amazingly believable; I truly felt pain for Proctor, Elizabeth, and Giles, just as I truly felt contempt for Parris, Danforth, and Abigail.I recommend this play to anyone, but especially those who have read and enjoyed any of Miller's other work."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play has always held a special significance for me. It was the first Arthur Miller play I ever saw performed on stage, and it is also a chilling comparison between the past and present.Miller uses the Salem witch trials as the setting of his play, but it is actually play of its time. Written during the McCarthy Era, a witch-hunt of a different kind, Miller uses the Salem witch trials to illustrate what was happening (and is still happening) in the USA. &quot;Guilt by association&quot; is the order of the day, civil rights are violated, and many individuals and families are destroyed.This also hits me personally, as I know of one individual who was a victim of the McCarthy witch hunt. I just recently found out about this, and after reading Miller's play again after many years, it took on a whole new significance for me. I am grateful to all who stood up to those who tried to take away our most precious rights, and to Miller for writing this play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller wrote this play to oppose the McCarthy witch-hunt. This aspect has aged. But the play keeps a universal value in the way it describes how, in any closed society, in this case religiously closed, all those who do not conform the pattern will be prosecuted and executed. It shows with great depth the process of accusing the victims and how the victims are trapped between their refusal to lie due to their religious faith, and their desire to survive even if it is by lying. But the situation is so tense that this lying becomes impossible because it implies accusing others, hence it goes against the grain of any moral and human behavior. This is still true in our world. As soon as something does not go the way we want it to go, we look for scapegoats and we accuse them of being the disturbing elements. This has been true with the Jews, the Gipsies and some others under Hitler. This has been true of all those who opposed the regime under Stalin. This is still true in our societies in many areas. We are always ready to start a crusade against the outsiders and those who are different to defend our own order. And in such situations private life in invaded, the rights of individuals are negated. Any purification policy is built on a whole set of tyrannical actions. Arthur Miller reaches a universal meaning when he says such actions are true of any society at any time. A society seems to always look for some homogenized unity, rejecting diversity with great ease. The new element that may be seen today in some societies is the protection of minorities by the law. But the temptation remains.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible describes the anguish of a sinner (John Proctor) as he wrestles with his conscience. Around him the Puritan world is succumbing to the whims of clever young girls who manipulate the superstitions of their elders by pretending to be oppressed by &quot;witches&quot; in their New England community. Proctor, a married farmer, resists the hysteria, but reluctantly as he is guilty of an affair with the ringleader of the girls and feels he is unworthy to stand for what is right. When finally he makes a dramatic stand, it is too late to stave off the bloody tidal wave that we know of today as the Salem Witch Trials, but it is not too late for him to realize the significance of his own integrity.Arthur Miller was compelled to speak before a McCarthy hearing in the 1950's and expected to incriminate associates of his as Communist spies. His encounter with the &quot;red scare&quot; is the inspiration of this play and he is highly successful in exposing an extremely dark potential that lurks within the gullible and uncritical human society.The Crucible is unrivaled in drama and punch."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's The Crucible comes very close to being the perfect model for the so-called 'tragedy of the common man', an idea which Miller himself propounded in an article in The New York Times, in the same week that his other great work, Death of a Salesman, was premiered. Miller's idea of drama was to put the common man, or the working man, at the centre of a situation that would require him to act in an uncommon way. This is exectly what we find in The Crucible. Although not written with this idea of the tragedy of the common man explicitly in mind, The Crucible conforms to the definition more closely than does Death of a Salesman. Motivated, of course, by the witch-hunt-like MacArthur hearings in Washington D.C., The Crucible focuses on a man under attack, a man who is flawed but who is good. A common man in uncommon circumstances.Possibly this is Miller's greatest work, as it combines the timeless quality of tragedy with contemporarily relevent themes in a way that is neither ambiguous or overly intrusive. This is a play which should continue to be read in schools and studied with care, particularly for its historical value."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"A considerable number of plays from the 50s come across as melodramatic, cynical and stilted today. In contrast, Miller's classic remains powerful and universal - but not for the usual reasons you'd expect. As a drama it has more in common with 19th century works in the tradition of Ibsen or even the novels of Hugo than with the 50s authors like Williams, Beckett, O'Neill, or even the Miller of Death of a Salesmen. Instead of the drab, pathetic, cowardly, sad, sniveling, or absurdist characters of some of his contemporaries we see people of moral stature. People in the mist of an irrational hysteria with normal human frailties but with moral sense. An interesting dimension is added in the portrayal of the villains. At one point in the play it seems expedient for the 'chief inquisitor' to temper or betray his crusade. He chooses to follow his vision (I am being vague to avoid giving away any plot). Compare this to Hugo's Javert in Les Miserables. By writing the villain in such a manner both authors create a drama that pits two moral codes - two views of reality. This elevates Miller's play to the level of a romantic realist drama.Many of the other reviewers will point out the intended parallels to events of the 50s. However, Miller's play is more universal and can be viewed in relation to any fanatical hysteria. This is still timely today given the Politically Correct hysteria on college campuses."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play draws you in from the beggining, each character begging for your attention and pity. But as you watch the characters and the story unfold, you are forced to pick sides. The confused and manipulated girls can make you burn with anger and feel great sorrow for their entrapment. The adulterous husband first hits you as a cold, unloving man but soon woos you into seeing his honest and passionate character. Arthur Miller masterfully sends his reader on an emotionally journey through his chilling rendition of the sad affair of the Salem witch trials. Beautiful work, very worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I absolutley loved this play. I recently re-read it and it was incredible. It's not very long, and it is definitly something everyone should read. You feel like your at the trials, and you can just see the wretched abigail..Buy it, borrow it, get it from the library. just read the play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Exciting and eventful, The Crucible by Arthur Miller is a joy to read. Arthur Miller succeeds in bringing the thrill of each event in the play. Filled with wonderful imagery and actions, The Crucible remains one of my favorite plays.Miller is able to create masterful scenes through the dialogue of the characters. He can set the tone and mood of the setting through how the characters talk. This allows readers to actually envision the setting and feel as if they too are part of the play.The characters are wonderful in that they are not one-dimensional, and they appear very real. Each character feels very human- as if the reader has already met the character before. It is interesting to see each character have a different persona and different motives, which leads to an interesting and complex plot. Because each character has a different motive, it makes the plot much more interesting as there are also added subplots which entice the reader to know more about each individual character.The events that occur in the play contribute greatly to the overall excitement of the story. The accusations are extremely vivid, so readers can feel the fear and the hysteria the town itself is feeling. They appeal to the senses as readers begin to feel engaged in the story.If you want to read a short, engaging play, The Crucible is the way to go."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"A powerful and exciting rollercoaster is what this play will bring. Its plot, its characters are all engaging and interesting to read. In The Crucible, Arthur Miller has written a book that not only entertains but forces the reader to question the integrity of human beings at its instance of greatest power and weakness.Set in the late 1600s, The Crucible depicts the horrendous events of the Salem Witch Trials. Even before reading the book, the subject captures the interest of many as images of the mysterious and mystical come to life. As a play, this story already entertains its readers but as a masterfully written piece of literature, this play makes it all the more worthwhile to read. With the backdrop of the Red Scare as the inspiration for this play, Miller plays with the ideas of jealousy, vengeance, and radicalism against the infamous Salem Witch trials to show how quickly problems can escalate out of hand. The plot of the play centers on the couple of John Proctor and his wife, Elizabeth, who are caught up in the middle of a city-wide scandal to rid the town of \\"witches.\\" The problem begins when the town's reverend finds his daughter and a few other girls dancing out in the woods during the dead of night. Alerted, he requests the help of Rev. Hale, an expert in supernatural affairs. Soon the girls are accused of being witches and are forced to name others. Acting in the worst of human character, they indict those they hate and the conflict flares up and consumes the entire town.The power and brilliance of this plays stems not from its ability to entertain but from the reader's ability to connect with the characters. Miller has created characters that seem like common people caught up in a malicious scandal. We all erupt in fury as Abigail escapes unpunished for her crime; we cringe as Mary Warren betrays Proctor and we weep as John Proctor is executed for a crime he did not commit. Within the play, Proctor is the only beacon of righteousness that, for his honor and pride, would forfeit his life than lie. This powerful thought provoking event ends the play with a dramatic question lingering in the reader's mind: What would I have done in Proctor's shoes? Against the incessant cries of others to lie for his life, Proctor refuses and will rather die for his beliefs. The audience is dismayed that Abigail and the other girls are capable of such evil. With an impactful ending and solid ability to entertain, The Crucible will leave readers grasping for more."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Written in the early 1950s, Miller's literary work was meant to be a parallel to the \\"Red Scare\\". He focuses on the 17th century witch trials in Salem where its citizens out of hysteria participate in wild witch hunts, acts that killed numerous innocent civilians.His story focuses on John Proctor, a relatively honest and good man who had an affair once with his wife's helper. Out of this lust, he initiates the start of the mass hysteria because Abigail, the helper, has fallen in love with him and will stop at nothing to make him love her, even killing his current wife. Her jealous rampage snowballs into a full blown mass hysteria where she implants ideas of the presence of witchcraft into the minds of the small town's citizens and brings to trial many people, including his wife. Throughout the entire story, Proctor knows her true intentions and we see the inner struggle within himself: To either to keep his good name and let his wife die, or confess his adulterating sins and besmirch his good reputation that he holds dear.Throughout the entire story, the reader is engulfed within Miller's storytelling, his writing style and sentence structure whirling us into the tense and upbeat atmosphere of those times. With his masterful use of short and repetitive sentence structures, he is able to make them feel this tenseness. With this kind of writing style, it makes The Crucible one quick and satisfying read.Overall, I found The Crucible to be a fairly good book with an interesting plot and a classical heroic ending. I especially liked the fallen hero archetype that redeems himself in the end after struggling with his inner mind.Although I was slightly perturbed at the fact that the author would play around with the historical facts, in order to make it more realistic, I feel that the story would have been of greater impact had he left the original details within, but other than that, this book is worth the time and money spent!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"With its suspenseful plot, melodramatic characters, and excessively strict setting, Arthur Miller's The Crucible expertly captures the helplessness of the wrongfully-accused.The Crucible follows the story of a stubborn cynic in the midst of his society's chaos and paranoia. Not particularly moral, for he had committed adultery, John Proctor is the typical man struggling with his beliefs that are not accepted in his community. His different thoughts violate the society's unsaid policy of conformity, rendering him the perfect character to play out the pitiful hardships of a heretic. Since he neither entirely good nor completely evil, Proctor's character represents the common man, and the average reader can relate to his thoughts about society. Because of this, readers are more able to sympathize with Proctor, drawing the reader more into the book's plot as it goes on. Because of this, the reader eventually faces the same gnawing conflict Proctor faces in the end. While yielding to his society's chaotic witch-hunting disturbs his conscience, holding fast to his beliefs guarantees death. Throughout the play, Proctor battles it out with his pride when he is forced to choose between his life and his conscience. Instead of just a story of trials, The Crucible represents a moral test -is being honest worth dying for? The reader contemplates this inevitable question as he flips faster and faster (and his heart beats faster and faster!) to reveal the fatal end - his ethics win, and Proctor hangs dead.Only by placing his story in a strict community would Miller be able to illustrate the overwhelmingly contagious fear of evil -and he did just that. Prior to the introduction of John Proctor's character, the story begins with a young girl's false accusation of another of witchcraft in Salem, a Puritan settlement. The idea of the Devil's work, witchcraft, in their own pious community vastly alarms its citizens. Immediately, this fear spreads like an uncontrollable wildfire in a million acre forest. With this paranoia and fear leading to chaos, which eventually causes its tragic finale, The Crucible disapproves of the Puritan society's intolerance of dissent, almost mocking its gullibility and piety.Also, characters developed in the play symbolize different aspects of the human nature. Abigail, the girl who initiates these accusations, does so because of her vengeful stubborn nature -a perfect representation of the play's antagonist. Her anger and confusion towards her banishment from Proctor's house motivates her revenge. Goody Proctor, the symbol of moral goodness, is, of course, John Proctor's wife -a daily painful reminder of his past sins. Throughout the play, she reflects a self-less personality, creating a standard for her husband to achieve. These characters help further shape John Proctor's dilemma at the end.As for context, Miller compares these Salem witch-trials depicted in the play to the 1950s Red Scare in the United States. As the witch-trials begin with one accusation, so does the Red Scare. The piety and overwhelming fear in the Devil in the community allows the witch-hunt to continue throughout the Puritan settlement. Paralleling this fear, the paranoia of Communism in the steadfast Democratic-Republican United States allows the trials and accusations to pervade throughout America.As readers, we see the absurdity of these Salem witch-trials. With Miller's amazing suspenseful style, we ourselves feel helpless as well because we cannot intervene with the story. Instead, we could only sit back and watch as the ridiculous fear swells out of control within the community. By being able to relate his protagonist to the reader and recreating this very helplessness in the reader as well, Miller thoroughly explores the desperation of the wrongfully accused. Yet, Miller also comments on the ridiculous period of the Red Scare, when people allowed the accusations to get out of hand. This fantastic, discreet but not imperceptible, parallelism between the Salem witch-trials and the Red Scare period adds a historical flair.The Crucible is an exciting and engaging play, holding suspense until the very satisfying end. Like a Shakespeare play, The Crucible makes a reader fully experience from the initial complications to the final catharsis."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Does The Crucible pass the test?When Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible, America was going through its heavy stages of McCarthyism. Threats and accusations were everywhere, and nobody was safe from the possibility of being called a communist. Even Miller himself was accused of Communism. Miller wrote this play about a similar situation to McCarthyism, but with the consequences for being accused being a lot more severe. The engaging tale is very cleverly written, describes actual events, and is about the Salem Witch Trials. The book is excellent, and should definitely be read in all high school English classes.The Crucible is an excellent piece of writing. It digs deep into human character, and exposes flaws in human nature. Some flaws explored were greed and hysteria. Greed was addressed when the townspeople began to cry witch on neighbors for which they had grudges. The hysteria that followed came when those accusations were taken seriously, and the accused were arrested. Here, Miller takes obsession to a whole new level. He makes the townspeople sentence death onto each other just so they could take their neighbors' land. Although the reader obviously knows that the accusations are fake and ridiculous, Miller has Hale and the judges give reasonable arguments for the accusations. They base the fact that witches exist on the Bible saying that they do(the Bible was law). In order to prove the accused blameworthy, they do things like catch them in the act of lying. They then claim that lying in court proved the accused guilty, no matter what the lies were about. The fact that we see points of view from all points in this story is what makes this a truly good read.This play is based, and mostly even consists of actual events. The Salem Witch hunts really did occur in America in the 1690's, and people such as John Proctor, Abigail Williams, and Elizabeth Proctor really did exist. Miller did change some of the details, such as the ages of John Proctor and Abigail(they were actually 60 and 11, respectively), but that was just to strengthen the plot with a love affaire(which was also made up). He also made a few other small changes such as the wage of Betty Parris, and nonel. These changes were not significant enough to make the play be considered historical fiction, and the history was presented in an interesting way, unlike most pieces on history that I have read.What makes The Crucible so unique is how even though it takes place far in the past, its events are really parallel to the present. After reading this, we think about present-day witch-hunts, such as McCarthyism and sexual abuse cases. In The Crucible, people falsely accused others of something that we today would not find a crime. The accused often had their lives ruined. McCarthyism is the term describing a period of intense anti-Communist suspicion in the United States that lasted roughly from the late 1940's to the late 1950's. During it, Joesph McCarthy accused hundreds of Americans of being Communists. This caused humiliation and often a loss of jobs for very many of the accused. Like with The Crucible, we would not find this accusation to be a major crime today. Lastly, this makes us think about court cases where children accuse adults, often doctors, of sexually harassing them. The children are seen as fragile and innocent, so their accusations are often taken seriously, with serious punishment done to the accused adults. Unfortunately, as in the case of the Salem Witch Trials, the children are not always telling the truth. All too often, they are told by their parents to lie to the court about being molested. Since the court typically sees the children as innocent, they often overlook this paramount fact, which results in the lives of the adults ruined.In conclusion, my opinion is that The Crucible most definitely \\"passes the test\\", and should be read by generations of English students to come."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is my absolute FAVORITE piece of literature.

When the Proctor's wife, and later on the Proctor himself, are unfortunately called under trail for relations with the devil, the pair suffers through the ordeals of asking for forgiveness of their sins or dying with pride as they know they are innocent. As they are being tried in court, Mary is the sole person who can testify if the allegations against them are true or not. In the beginning, she stayed loyal to the truth despite the pressures from society to condemn them. Yet eventually Mary breaks under the pressure of her peers and agrees that the pair is indeed guilty of their accusations, although they are innocent. She clearly gives in because of the fear she had of her own life, worrying if others would become suspicious of her. The proctor eventually refuses to repent for something he does not do, but is he still eventually hanged for his crime? Read this story to find out! As you read, benefit from it's parallels to the struggles in our society today, where the justice systems gets overly involved in the moral investments and rumors of the outside world. This book is the perfect historical account to one of the most despicable times in history, it preaches loyalty to the truth even in the worst of times."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This will remain, in my opinoin, one of the best pieces of literature ever written."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play, based on the infamous Salem witch trials of the 1690's that New England still has not lived down, was written by Arthur Miller in an earlier period in American history, the 1950's, when hysteria over the alleged internal \\"Communist menace\\" dovetailed with the opening of the coldest part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union. The dramatic tension of the play cannot be understood except as a parable on that then current atmosphere. Miller draws parallels with the earlier period of hysteria, in this case the irrational hysteria over witches in the isolated, inward-looking fervently Puritan community of Salem, Massachusetts. The comparisons in reaction to the witches and \`reds under the bed' are startling as far as the response of the societies and individuals in those societies community were concerned. Obviously in the play one needs a hero, even if it is the flawed and \`fallen' John Proctor who will stand up, in the final analysis, even unto death for his principles. We will always find a few, even if reluctant, fighters in such circumstances. What is more compelling, and frightening, is the reaction of the \`honest' town folk. Then, as in the case of the Cold War hysteria, those \`good' folk turned the other way, joined actively in on the action or in some way justified the trials. As we are again in a period when the new hysteria is over Islamic fundamentalists and their motives this remains an extremely powerful cautionary tale.

Earth to readers - the Communists were invading our government. All this hysteria against those who sought to keep that invasion from happening is so misplaced it would be funny if it weren't so dangerous.Try catching up with what has been learned since the 1950's. A good place to start would be learning what the Venona Intercepts were and what they showed. They proved conclusively that the Communists were highly infiltrated into the US State Department and that many knew they were at the time the so called \\"Red Scare\\" was taking place. That was the reason there was so much effort put in to rooting out these influences.Then you could read up on what was learned from the KGB archives after the fall of the Soviet Union. All the heroes of the left like Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs were guilty as all get out. There is concrete evidence to back this up.If you are one of the people still railing against the \\"Red Scare\\" you are proving you haven't learned a thing in the last 50 years. The left in the US has so much credibility staked on these issues that many refuse to admit the obvious truth but it is the truth anyway. Anyone who continues the hysterical crusade against those who sought to root out communism from the US government might as well be screaming that the earth really is flat.

However, in reviewing the item in light of the fact that the local High School is putting on the play, I am struck by a common theme many of the other reviewers have touched upon. That being some common thread between witch trials and Joe McCarthy. McCarthy was many things, many of them bad. However, the substance of his claims were far more right than wrong. America, including many high offices in the government, of the 1940's and into the early 1950's was substantially infiltrated by Communists.

If not, make sure you have a pillow with you when you open to that first page."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"the book was ok, its used bud if just need to read it its perfect."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Salem witch hunt corresponds with the time period of the McCarthy Era. The McCarthy Era began in the 1950s when Joseph McCarthy charged the State Dept. for containing 200 communists. Society as a whole became suspicious and afraid. Although these charges were not backed up with any evidence, he appeared on television and radio programs where he restated his accusations once again. The careers of many government officials were ruined because of this suspicion. This relates to the Salem witch trial because people were accused of doing witchcraft without any solid proof. So many lives were taken because of superstition.The Crucible by Arthur Miller is set in a Puritan New England town, Salem, Massachusetts. The plot revolves around the witchcraft that breaks out in the small town of Salem. Act I introduces most of the main characters in the play. Reverend Parris discovers his daughter dancing in the woods with her friends. His daughter, Betty, is in a coma. Reverend Parris calls on his friend Reverend Hale to investigate his suspicions of witchcraft. The reader also finds out about the affair between Proctor and Abigail. Betty and Abigail stir up when they give out names of people who supposedly are witches.John Proctor learns that his wife, Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft. Two men come to the Proctor's house to arrest Elizabeth. John goes to court to save his wife. He brings Mary Warren, his servant, to testify that the girls are lying about witchcraft. The girls claim Mary is lying so Mary says Proctor is the Devil. Proctor is arrested as a result. At the time for executions, Elizabeth is brought in to get John to confess for his life. John confessed but retracts his confessions when asked to sign a paper that would be hung up on the church door. He rips the paper and is then sent to be hung.As a group, we believe the screenplay brings to life the harsh treatment of those accused of witchcraft in Salem in 1692. We don't think it's fair in either the case of the witchcraft trials or McCarthy Era, that innocent people can be accused of heresy of different beliefs. In today's society we are free to believe whatever we choose and are not penalized for it. Unless there is total proof that a person believes in communism or has associations with the Devil, there is no reason to harm the person, or put them on a list where they cannot get jobs.Overall, we enjoyed the screenplay and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a story with a little twist of fate and the true accounts of the Salem Witchcraft Trials."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"\\"The Crucible\\" is about a fascinating time in America's early history: The Salem Witch Trials. I found that Miller portrayed everyone as being naive and at times childish, and I found myself focusing on the utter stupidity of events, rather than the complexity of the characters. Until the fourth act, I found myself bored and frustrated. But, the pace picked up by the last act, and true drama surfaced. With very little stage direction, I cannot be fully taken with this play. I think it would have been better as a novel, as that is how it currently reads. You could write a good character analysis, once you get past the yearning to scream at the characters about how wrong they are. But other than that, this play is somewhat of a letdown.

It is made like this because of it's play written format, which makes it difficult to read, and comprehend by tour self. However, in a class room setting, The Crucible is better then most assignments. In the play, there is the ever present theme of the accused putting the blame on others. By the end of the play, a Massachusetts judge is brought in too make an attempt to secure the justice brought upon the many accused witches.

If the book was written in regular form, then it would be good for the classrooms. This book was interesting to read but hard to understand. You had to some what jump back and forth between people talking.

With a few wonderful exceptions, these are not people you really want to know. Many moons later I've re-read it and found it as interesting a character study as ever.When in high school in the 60's, we weren't told about Arthur Miller's disguising of the Mcarthy \\"witch\\" hunts in this play. Much like the T.V. show \\"M.A.S.H.\\" was really about Vietnam, this is about another embarassing time in American history. Although well veiled, it's really does point out the extremes those driven by their own delusional dogma will go to to be considered \\"right\\" and righteous."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is a book that we are reading in my class these days. I had been waiting for the book to reach my hands since the day the teacher agreed on reading this book as a class syllabus. It was a long wait for me before the book reached my hands.I was mainly interested in the witch craft. The day I got it I promised myself that I will read the whole book in the night before I got to sleep.Well it took me two nights instead to finish the book. But I was and still am very facinated by the book. I even managed to write a poem on the book.Mainly about John Proctor, Elizabeth Proctor and Abigail.The love story between them. It is very suprising that a group of young teenaged girls could be so effective in conspiring again the prominent figures of the Salem Village and be responsible for their crucification. The Crucible is a great book and very thought provoking.I was once haunted by the book in the night when I thought that I could hear something tapping on my window.Actually the book has nothing to do with real witches but it is all about the evil people.

The story, set during the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s, centers around the relationship between protagonist, John Proctor, antagonist Abigail Williams and Proctor's wife Elizabeth. The beginning of the play portrays the circumstances that caused the trials to begin. As the trials proceed Proctor struggles with his own pride as he debates whether or not to release certain furtive information. The uncovering of which could end the vindictive trials by exposing the leader of the prosecution, Abigail, as a fraud, As progressively more people are accused and incarcerated, the facade of Salem fades as true motivations for the accusations are unveiled. Proctor struggles with his pride as the hangings begin. The lives of the accused come to depend upon whether hubris will prevent Proctor from giving the authorities the truth. Elizabeth's presence is that of a wife who has been shamed by her husband's lust for another, yet she bears this burden as a saint, her presence tempers and guides John through his journey. When Abigail accuses Elizabeth, Elizabeth's life along with that of the others incarcerated depend upon John's confession.At the time of the play's publication the country was going through another witch-hunt. Miller wrote this play in response to the Red Scare of the 1950s led by Joe McCarthy. Miller himself was asked to give the House Un-American Activities Committee lists of people he knew to be communists. Miller's play is timeless in its ability to relate times of hysteria and irrational discrimination throughout history. Modern examples include: AID's hysteria, McCarthyism, Japanese internment camps, and post 9/11 anti-Middle Eastern sentiments. Human nature is constant and the basic inclinations toward jealousy, vengefulness, pride, vanity, and guilt will always remain. Miller's ability to create characters whose emotions and reactions are ageless creates this classic piece of American Literature."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The amalgamation of history and literature in this play makes it a real work of art. Even though the audience is familiar with the historic denouement of the Salem Witch trials, the plot compels it to follow until the very end. The dramatic irony, by which the audience identifies the real victims and the spuriousness of witchcraft, is key to the enticing complications of the plot.From the secret affair between Abigail and John Proctor to the false accusations of witchcraft, Myers criticizes the superstitious and Puritan society of Salem in which religion forms a moral law, and reputation can stand in a person's way to do what is good and just. Because of the theocratic nature of the society, moral laws and state laws are one- society is responsible for individual salvation. Ironically, they hang those accused of witchcraft based on the testimony of a group of teenage girls.The play reflects the minimal role of women in the Puritan society of Salem and how witchcraft, for many girls, was a way they could get back at society. Tituba, whose status is lower than that of anyone else in the play by virtue of the fact that she is Black, manages to deflect her blame by accusing others of witchcraft. Similarly, Abigail also retaliates at the Proctors for having fired her and for John's denial of his affair with her.In Salem, everything and everyone belongs to either God or the Devil; dissent is not merely unlawful, it is associated with satanic activity. This bifurcation functions as the underlying logic behind the witch trials. Arthur Myers demonstrates the role that hysteria can play in tearing apart a community. Hysteria supplants logic and enables people to believe that their neighbors, whom they have always considered upstanding people, are committing absurd and unbelievable crimes. At the end of the story, John Proctor prefers to be hung than to falsely sign his name on a paper confirming his involvement in witchcraft. The paradox of individualism and society's impact on its members conveys the trouble resulting from hysteria and lies."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This follows the play 99% of the time - every once in a while a word is substituted or a phrase turned around, but that's it. My students had no problem following the play. In fact, they prefer the taped reading over reading aloud in class.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"As relevent today as in Miller's time. Human nature doesn't change, no matter how we try. Power corrupts, and young women can always find a man to manipulate. Overall a good read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible by Arthur Miller is a great book to read with a mother-daughter book club. It provides an outlet to talk about issues the girls are covering in school, and to find out about how their perspectives differ from those of their moms. The issues of witchcraft and socially sanctioned violence against a targeted group seem eerily relevant to some of the things going on in our world today. This book challenged all of us to think about the most important things in our lives and what we're willing to sacrifice to achieve a higher cause."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I really enjoyed reading this classic tale. I found it interesting from an historical and literary point of view. It forces you to think about very real moral dilemmas, like what you might or might not give your life for."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This short play dives deep into the minds of those who participated in the Salem Witch Trials during the 1600's. Miller focuses entirely on human emotions as he attempts to discover the real reason for these ridiculous witch accusations. \\"The Crucible\\" is intriguing and mind-bottling as readers realize the severity of the trials. Many people's lives were changed and it leaves one to question: \\"Why didn't anyone verify the claims?\\" The play centers around a man named John Proctor and his relationship with the young Abigail Williams. John commits adultery, cheating on his wife Elizabeth with Abigail. In the Puritan society, adultery is a major sin in which the individual would face a severe punishment if convicted. When Proctor tells Abigail he does not love her, she takes revenge by accusing Elizabeth of doing witchcraft. The claims are absurd, yet not a single person in the town attempts to clear Elizabeth's name. Abigail uses her manipulative powers to get the other girls in on her plan. The play shows that both fear and revenge can cause people to do horrible things. The townspeople are involved in this \\"witch hunt\\" and add to society's ignorance. They fail to challenge authority even though they know what is right. I found this book engaging as I tried to fathom the events that occurred in Salem, Massachusetts. Miller does an excellent job of trying to understand why this happened. I learned that Puritan society was weak and that many individuals feared speaking out against authority. The entire Puritan society was based on control. By instilling fear in people, the Puritan leaders could maintain leadership over the rest of them. This is a great read if you want to try to understand history and apply it to our world today."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Miller's \\"Crucible\\" amazingly parallels the McCarthyism era and provides a frightful yet realistic account of the possibilities caused by human desires. Its short length combined with its easy-to-understand language allows the readers to become fully absorbed in the plot.During the period of anti-communism, suspicions were placed among all types of people, ranging from outcasts of society to the most-trusted educators. The hysteria of the Red Scare spread rapidly through the belief of a necessary social conformity. Despite questionable evidence combined with exaggerated threats, suspicions were often deemed credible in a court of law. Consequently, once suspected, few individuals were able to completely clear their reputation. As with the witches accused, suspected Communists were given the chance to escape punishment through confession and identification of other Red Sympathizers. This gradually led to false accusations of others to save oneself, resulting in the condemning of many innocent individuals. Paralleling the Salem Witch Trials to the persecutions of the McCarthyism era, Miller emphasizes the ability of mass hysteria to overpower the apparent irrationality of the Red Scare.Miller's outstanding use of historical context further emphasized the power of human nature to cause the spread of mass hysteria. When looking at the \\"Crucible\\" as a play, it seems too surreal and frightening to be true. Any reader could easily mock the people of the community for being nave and hanging nonexistent witches. However, the scary irony that Miller uses is the fact that the whole scenario has happened before in history, numerous times. Not only did the settlers of Massachusetts hang supposed \\"witches\\", but also people in the twentieth century have allowed mass hysteria to spread unjustifiably.\\"The Crucible\\" is an exciting play that fully grasps the attention of its readers. It is not only an entertaining book for any occasion, but is also a meaningful retelling of a tragedy of human nature."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Miller's Crucible is worth reading because of its valuable lessons and interesting plot. The story is suspenseful up until the last moment and is especially intriguing as it is set in the midst of an actual historical event. Exploring the Salem witch trials, Miller recreates the scenario in a vivid way and ponders the conflicts that led to the witch hunt.Applying this historical event to the McCarthyism of his era, he provides insight upon the Red Scare. Miller chose to use the witch hunts because of the many parallels between it and the Red Scare. Miller saw the strongest resemblance between the procedures of the trials held during the two periods of hysteria. Another area where Miller created more parallels was in the ambiguous evidences used to accuse a person. Because the social events of the time and the witch trials were so alike, Miller was able to use \\"The Crucible\\" as a way to express his thoughts of the era.Also, Miller's style is easy to read and comprehend as he allows the character to speak in a modern fashion.The Crucible is gives much insight on the Salem witch trials, the Red Scare, and modern events. This play is engaging and one that can be finished in a matter of hours."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"red it for yourself and you'll find outjanice kosak"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I bought this book on the basis that the introduction was good.

I wanted to kill Wynona in the movie but I also liked it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the &quot;perfect&quot; people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"What was Miller writing about in this play? Was it an examination of the psychological and social phenomena that led to the Salem witch trials? If so, it failed, because the story departs too much from historic fact and thus changes the motivation of the protagonists. Miller makes Abigail older and Proctor younger than they were in reality, and makes them erstwhile lovers, which they never in fact were. So Abigail is motivated by the jealousy and resentment of a spurned lover. Another character is motivated by a desire to seize the property of the victims. Although greed and the settling of old scores no doubt played a part in the terrible events of 1692, they could not have been the whole story. Deeper and broader religious forces must have been at work to bring about the execution of 20 innocent people. The Crucible does not enlighten us on what those forces were. That play remains to be written.The conventional interpretation is that Miller was really writing about the McCarthy anti-Communist hearings, and likening them to a witch-hunt. This too is problematic. Miller draws the parallel in the notes in this book and elsewhere, but never explicitly states that it was the real, prime theme of the play. And once again, the essentially domestic and personal themes of the play do not shed light on the political forces that shaped the McCarthy hearings.What is clear is that the play stands as a dramatic tour de force. It is a gift to actors, being one dramatic, emotional crisis after another. So, if it lacks the intellectual density that Miller said he aimed at after his success with Death of a Salesman, it has the dramatic force to keep it a perennial favorite in theaters. It has one weakness dramatically, and that is an excessively large cast, particularly in the first scene, where all the entrances and exits in Betty's bedroom are rather ludicrous.The Penguin Classics edition has a good introduction by Christopher Bigsby and incorporates notes by the author. It also includes - as an appendix - Act 2, Scene 2, which is omitted in most productions."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This item was lost in the mail; however the dealer did refund my money, so I'll call it even.

It was difficult to follow at times when there are many characters in one scene.I thought the twist in the plot at the end very surprising and it reveals that not just women are prejudiced for witchcraftery, but men too. Miller's organization of character importance was slightly off balance as he considered some of the more innocent characters such as Abby more important than John Proctor (although he does appear often in the play but the urgency to keep him the spotlight just wasn't there)"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I have always been interesting in the Salem Witch trials, and this book just heightened my interest. I read it in class, and there are so many nuances that you might never pick up on if you read it by yourself. For instance, the title. Another reviewer stated that it didn't make sense, but really, it did (that person's review made no sense at all). A crucible is a small metal container that you use in lab experiments, you place it over the fire, and it gets hot.

It seems like almost every event in our national and world history has been put into the form a fictional story. This does not nesecsarily make these stories boring or uncreative. There are many classic historical fiction works. For example, &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; was excellent. However, the manner in which Arthur Miller wrote &quot;The Crucible&quot; gives the reader the feeling that they are wasting their time. &quot;The Cruicble&quot; falls into an akward place, because it cannot be read by people who want to learn about the Salem Witch Trails (because of historical inaccuracies), and it cannot be read for the fictional story, because, outside of the historical facts, the plot is weak at best. Arthur Miller's &quot;The Crucible&quot; is the story of the Salem Witch Trails put into a play format. The only plot that Miller created outside of what actually happened is an affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams. Abigail then becomes jelous of John's wife and starts accusing people of being witches, eventually accusing Mrs. Proctor. Ironically enough, John ends up being hung, while his wife is spared. Weak. Miller needs to get off the fence and decide if he wants to write a play or a textbook, because his mixture between the two is neither entertaining, nor educational. Overall, I think &quot;The Crucible&quot; is worth reading because any literature is worth reading, but Miller &quot;wasted&quot; the topic of the Salem witch trails.

During that time, many women were hung under the assumption that they had dealings with the devil and had practiced witchcraft. In The Crucible, Arthur Miller depicts the constant struggle between the Lord and Satan. This universal theme is also seen in Steinbeck's East of Eden with a struggle between good and evil.This has an allusion to the biblical story of the War in Heaven between Lucifer and God in order to steal God's throne. This biblical allusion summarizes the entire play in one sentence. People believed that women could be possessed by the devil and ordered to do witchcraft. If the women did this, they were turning their backs on God, as Lucifer did. After the war in heaven, Lucifer lost and was banished to Hell where his name became Satan. The people of Salem, Massachusetts believed that it was Satan, the devil, which inhabited women's souls. The play also symbolizes a struggle between good and evil, as does the war in heaven. The war was a struggle between God, good, and Lucifer, evil. Also, the characters in the play have to constantly decide whether they will be on Satan's side or on God's.Put your own moral sense to test here.Let you be the judge of who should live or die and see if you could do it.As everything in society comes tumbling to the ground, who will be the people that are still sane and who will be the ones that betray their so called \\"loved ones\\"?"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is like a historical play with a love triangle hiding a politically driven allegory attacking the behavior of Americans during the late 1940s-1850s.One of the many plays schools across the world students are required to study, The Crucible is one of the most interesting out of all. The easiest way to contrast The Crucible in relation to other play is with Shakespeare's plays, often hailed as the best tragedies of all time. The Crucible is much easier to read than Shakespeare's plays. Shakespeare's plays need to be translated before any analysis is able to happen; once understood, the plot of his plays and his very hidden meanings are intriguing. But the problem is that it takes too long and is too agonizing to try and understand. Miller's play is relatively simple and direct. He makes it so easy to appreciate his work. Moreover, Miller's ability to recreate the atmosphere during such times of mob rule makes the reader feel the frenzy and hysteria of mob rule. There are no periods of boredom between the action.Before reading this book, brush up on your knowledge of the McCarthyism era. Miller uses the backdrop of the Massachusetts in 1692 to compare the distinct similarities between the Salem Witch Trials and the Second Red Scare, exposing the evil capabilities of man when cornered. The Crucible is a great play with or without the knowledge of Miller's allegory to McCarthyism. If you do remember McCarthyism before reading Miller's play, The Crucible becomes a two in one deal - both a great play and re-evaluation of our actions. The additional knowledge enriches your understanding of this play and enriches Miller's message.It's just so sad to see how easy it is for us to lose all sense of logic and rationale when they are most needed and how weak we become from fear."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Excellent audio - acting is well relayed by the quality of the audio."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"&quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller, was a very intriguing, and exciting book. There were many exciting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot, which kept you on the edge of your seat. The ending was my personal favorite, and one of the most exciting spots in the book. There were many assumed events that were surprising in how they turned out. The characters were also well explained so that you could get a feel for how their personalities were, but vague enough that you could still use your own mind, and imaginaiton to elaborate on them.I felt that the most intriguing character was John Proctor. Every time you thought that you had an idea of how he might react, or what he would do next, there would always be some twist to keep the book interesting. Reverend John Hale was also an character that was not easy to predict. He never seemed to take a side in the whole matter, he seemed to want to do the right thing, but he would never let his emotions fall to the wayside of the law. As I read the book, I found one character who seemed to be somewhat shakey, and a little shady at times. This was Reverend Paris. He seemed to put out an aire to the townspeople that he was there to help them, and to do God's will, but he never looked to follow it. It appeared as though he would never do anyhting based on what he felt was good and true, he would base his reactions on how it would effect his reputation, and popularity with the townspeople. For example, in the beginning of the book, he is talking to Abigail, and trying to get her to tell him what had happened the previous night that caused Betty to fall into what appeared to be a coma. He tells her that he does not want his name to be soiled with the town, that he doesn't want to be involved with something that is so bad, witchcraft. He also says later on to the others in the room with him, that he should be paid more, because he graduated from a better college, as if to say that he is worth more to them.The charcaters are what made the book so good, they made the exciting scenes more intriguing, and the riveting scenes seem as though your heart would stop. The plot is built around the characters in the book, and how they react to the incident that is happeneing with the town. They keep the book at top notch.The developemnt of the chacters in the book, and the plot around them is constantly moving and changing. The book is written so that when you reach the climax, it has been so built up, that you can't even fathom what will happen in the ending. I found it to be a wonderful, and riveting book, and the writing by the author is fabulous, and makes you unable to put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible by Arthur Miller is not really a book, but I've decided to count it anyway. The play is short, and I finished it in one afternoon because I was so engrossed. Also, I enjoyed it much more than I did The Death of a Salesman, also written by Miller. One of my favorite aspects of the play was its relevance to modern times; at points, I couldn't tell whether the action was set in Salem in the 1600s or Washington DC in the 1950s. In addition, the first act included one of my favorite lines I've read recently: \\"Their fathers had, of course, been persecuted in England. So now they found it necessary to deny any other sect its freedom, lest their New Journalism be defiled and corrupted by wrong ways and deceitful ideas.\\""},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When I read this play, when I heard it performed, I just wanted to make the crazy escalation of events stop. It seemed so ridiculous that this whole town, these people's lives, depend upon the words of teenaged girls with \\"axes to grind.\\" It's even more scary when we realize Miller is writing not so much about the Salem witch hunts but about the witch hunts that STILL go on. How do you defend yourself against an unjust, ungrounded, illogical attack when even the system set up to \\"protect\\" the innocent has an agenda?Miller's writing is probably best experienced in a performed setting-- it's hard to read a play and really \\"get it.\\" But you should read the text too-- because the language, the beauty and craftsmanship, is sometimes lost in the acting."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller describes the historical situation of this play very well. He writes about the fate of every single person and about the influence which people can have on other people. Reading the story you can witness how the whole village is plunging itself into misery. This play is written to sympathise with each character. It's tragic how innocent people get hunted because of little differences to the majority of society. At the time where Arthur Miller wrote this play in America was the witch-hunt after communists. This state is almost a repetition of history. So we would say that it's worthy reading."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"&quot;The Crucible&quot; was a play that I could really get into. It was very easy for me to visualize the events through Miller's writing. Miller did a very good job of developing the characters. Such characters as Abigail were successfully portrayed as evil. She was corrupt, adulterous, immoral, a liar, and a murderer. Her lies led to the deaths of a number of innocent men and women. On the other hand I was really uplifted by Proctor's character. He was a &quot;good guy&quot; that didn't exemplify the qualities of what most protagonists have. The hero of a story shouldn't be innocent and perfect with no faults as heroes are portrayed in many Disney movies. Proctor made mistakes (his affair with Abigail), isn't a devout Puritan (often skips Church, plows on the Sabbath, and doesn't know ALL the commandments), and he tells it like it is. When questioned about his faith, he tells Hale that the church is corrupt and that he disagrees with Reverend Parris. He well exemplifies a man with good morals, who is sorry for his sins. He dies with dignity. He was smart and knew that the witchhunt was a farce. He knows that he will get his reward in heaven. I believe that despite he didn't fit the qualifications of a prince charming, John Proctor was the hero of &quot;The Crucible.&quot;I think that Miller did a very good job of linking the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s to the Communist Red Scare of the 1950s. Both situations had formidable outside tribes that caused paranoia and trepidation. More than just the factual similarities, Miller is able to go deeper into how people should have reacted. He condemns those who join the bandwagon and try to destroy the heathens or outsiders. Instead he wants us to act as Proctor did and to identify that the chaos is just a farce. He wants us to keep composed and moderate. This play teaches us to look at our own conscience rather than our social status."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is as twisted a story as any that I've read before. In the late 15th century, Salem, Massachusetts was in the form of a theocracy, which stirred up conflict between government leaders and citizens as well as citizen vs. citizen battles. Witchcraft was the big talk of this play because it played such a huge role in the vast number of trials and executions. When you begin to take in the information of the text, you see that witchcraft became a way that any citizen of Salem could blame their enemies just to have them killed. Several small groups of people (factions) who fought over such topics as land and governmental positions would accuse their opponents of witchcraft and in many cases it would result in imprisonment or death. Examples of battles between two people are Abby and Elizabeth Proctor who fought over John Proctor and Putnam and Francis Nurse, who were in a dispute because Nurse beat out Putnam's brother-in-law to become a member of Salem's ministry. Even though this play may not be historically accurate, it made me realize exactly what was going on in the world 300 years ago and make me appreciate the United States' government today."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"this play was really well constructed. It portrayed the characters well back then. It had the radical people that accused left and right. It also had the priests, the judges, the weird suspects and the one noble person. It kept my attention through the whole time. It had very good description of the characters personality that made me keep on reading. The end has a weird twist that makes you wonder if it was a joke or just spooky. overall a good rating of four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"After reading &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller I've begun to realize the importance of children's actions.

It is well written, the characters are wonderful, and all in all it is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Millers, The Crucibal, is a wonderfully written dramatic play. It is intersting and absorbing. The history of the play begins from the communist &quot;witch-hunts&quot;, which inspired Miller to write the book. An easy reader, but very thought provoking. Worth reading at any age!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This is the first play by Arthur Miller I have read, and I inquired into mostly because of my interest with Witchcraft and the Salem trials. A wonderful play that shows the hypocrisy of a town threatened by purported withcraft. The cried of &quot;witch&quot; by anyone in this town aroused and scared everyone. The lead characters Abagail Williams along with Reverend Parris and John Proctor. I will not give any story here, for you should read it and be surprised and amazed. Nonetheless, the story lets one wonder how such a town and belief in the Bible (more so than God) can lead to such havok. The laws are simple: 1) You are not a witch until someone points the finger at you. 2) You can deny these charges, but you will be hung. 3) If you confess you are a witch, then the sentence is jail. 4) If you do not believe in withcraft you will be hung. These were the beliefs of the time, and it is demonstrated in this marvelous play. Arthur Miller tells an exciting story based on history (although he says its not literal history for there were some need for dramatic purpose), of a time when things were simple in America and Massachusettes, yet like all towns in the world, there is always something brewing in the minds of the good who want to banish evil from their homes. Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"esta obra de arthur miller demuestra gran ingenio de su parte, ya que combina un tema antiguo e historico como fue la cazeria de brujas del poblado de salem, hecho que se recuenta en la letra escarlata de hawthorne aunque no directamente y lo une con un hecho presente, la cazeria politica que se vivia cuando se escribio la obra es interesante,porque combina un tema politico con la persecucion religiosa y las mentiras que se tejen alrededor de reputaciones con el fin de terminar con un supuesto enemigo que solo esta en las mentes de los perseguidores.Luis Mendez"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I enjoyed this book, especially since it was in play form was also very exciting. I would most definitely suggest this book to friends, family, as well as neighbors."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When I first picked up this book I had the impression that it would focus more on witchcraft than on politics. The main themes of the book had more to do with trickery, descite and revenge than on witchcraft. The book's main focus is swirled around in how the main characters, such as Abigail and Putnam, get even with people how they dont like or people who they have past quarrels with. The Salem witch trials was just camouflague to what was really going on. People would accuse other people of witchcraft thinking that that was the fastest way to get rid of someone that was causing a problem to them. Most of the time no one had any evidence to back up their daft accusations. Abigail used this thinking to the fullest when she accused just about everyone in the general Salem area of witchcraft. She accused John Proctor's wife of witchcraft because she thought that once she was out of the picture, she could get with Proctor. The Crucible and the Salem witch trials were all about hidden agendas and nothing was what it seemed. This book really didnt do it for me because all that happened was a couple of stupid girls accused people of witchcraft and through the ignorance of the people at the time, those people were put to death. I expected a little more action than what was in the book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible provides the reader with insight on, not 1, but 2 periods of American history. The Crucible blatantly compares the Salem witch trials to the tumultous time of Senator Joe McCarthy's (R-WI) &quot;witch hunt for Communists. Arthur Miller provides a thoughtful play that can relate to his contemporaries within Senator Joe McCarthy and the House's Un-American Activites Commitee. There were heroes in such characters as John Proctor that can relate to the people who refused to cooperate with the commitee, thereby ruining their entire reputation throughout the entire industry. There were also Abigail's who would do anything to wipe their hands clean of Communism, including naming the names of innocent people. The Crucible provides us with an interesting perspective on the Red Scare period of American history."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This book is a wonderful parallel to the Joe McCarthy trial of the 1900's. For example, if you were associated with someone such as a witch in the Crucible, or a communist in the McCarthy trials, you were pretty much guilty of being a witch or a communist. Strange enough, Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible around the time of the Joe McCarthy trials. The Crucible is a story about the Salem witch trials. According to this story, 19 men and women were either lynched, crushed, or suffered to death in jail. This book leads you to believe that the character known as Abigail was the the one who very carefully pinned the blame of witchcraft on everyone else. John Proctor was a man who Abigail titillated and caused Proctor to commit adultry. Through this book, Abigail tries to win Proctor over and get his wife executed for witchcraft. With Witch-Abigails success, Proctor and his wife are in the center of the Salem Witch Trial."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I had to read this book for my English class. The book would be much better if we lived in the time that it was supposed to satirize, the 1950's. Arthur Miller depicts the McCarthy era by using the Salem witch trails which is a very effective way of showing the the insaness of McCarthy's ways. The Salem &quot;Witches&quot; portray McCarthy's &quot;communists.&quot; It is a good book, but at times it is a little slow and you must trudge on through the book. Overall pretty decent book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible was an interesting book that comes out in the end. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"It was an ok book. Some parts were interesting, but some parts were left to be desired. It was a bit complicated too, too many characters, kind of hard to follow along. But other than that, it was pretty good."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This was a very good play. I was actually forced to read it for school though. Usually I'm reading books like \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The A-list\\", so this was a big change. The whole play is based around the character \\"John Proctor\\" who had an affair with a young girl, also neice of the Reverend, Abagail Willams. Abagail is determined to get him back, but John does not want her back and has to live with his guilt of adultery forever. Abagail,angry that John doesn't want her accuses his wife of witchcraft, along with many others. I won't tell you the ending, but it is pretty simple, how these people really thought that these people living around them were witches. The play is based on Mcarthyism... it was a really good read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible by Arthur Miller is a play on the times of the Salem Witch Trials. It is based in old time Massachusetts before the American Revolution and its about the inhabitants of Salem. Sadly I can only half recommend this book. This book has an interesting story of how a town becomes engulfed in their obsession with Satan and even raises the question of the fallibility of the church. The only thing is that Arthur Miller is an amazing playwright but when he actually tries to write a narrative in the middle of a scene for background information it is just painstaking to read. He will actually make a pause in the scene and say, \\"as they pause lets go into such and such character.\\" And he'll ramble on for pages and pages. This is a great story but it just starts at so rough because of all the background. Of course one must keep in mind that he took all this story from the records of the trials, so that is an amazing feat. Sadly, Arthur Miller should stick to writing plays. If you have read this book I commend you, but if you want to read Arthur Miller read Death of a Salesman because that was a great story, and even if it did have narratives, the balance was much better. I give this book Three Stars. And that's my final verdict."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The book &quot;The Crucible&quot; is interesting. In the beginning, this book was a little bit boring, but then it got interesting. This book talks about lies and adultery. This book will be good for people who like history because it's a historical book. This book is about 152 pages long and it's intended for the intermediate reader."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"My English class wanted to read a novel so my teacher selected The Crucible. After reading the four acts I've learned a great deal about the Puritans and how most people would be shocked to learn that the \\"pure people\\" would ever accuse someone of being a witch just for dancing in the forest. It makes you realize how far our civilization has come. Today it's more the opposite way. More people are killed because they are Christian rather than the fact that they worship the devil. It's sad how times have changed but this book is great to use in the schools because it shows how rediculious religion was back then and how much it has changed. The story is basically about a group of teenage girls who are accusing everyone in town of being a witch when really it is them who we find out that were talking to the devil. The love triange between Abigail Williams, John Proctor, and Elizabeth Proctor breaks and shows how true a man can be to his wife when it is a matter of love."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"In Harris' &quot;The Crucible&quot;, we are introduced to many interesting and complex characters fit in 1692, Salem. The antagonist, Reverend Parris, is a selfish, power-hungry, father and preacher. He shows his evil ways by using his status as a respected preacher, going around accusing any person who challenges his power. Another great character is the protagonist, John Proctor. A simple, heathen, farmer, he leads the revolt against the leaders of Salem, Reverend Parris and Judge Hawthorne. He saves the day by being martyred for his determination and morals, to save the women of Salem. The farmer is not an avid churchgoer he is accused by Parris, of course, of dealing with the devil. The other minor characters are the Abigail and Goody Putnam. The conniving Abigail plays little ms. innocent who at the start is perceived as a girl who was corrupted by Tituba. However in actuality, Abigail is the leader and instigator, who has a black name in the town because of her titillating encounters with John Proctor. The characters in \\"The Crucible\\" make this social drama a great one. It displays all the great characters: the antagonist, the protagonist, and the complex characters."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's \\"The Crucible\\" takes a deep look into some of the ugliest moments in American history. Yes, Miller's melodramatic play depicts the infamous Salem Witch Trials of the late 17th century, but his sheer brilliance lies within the plays almost perfect parallel to McCarthyism of the 1950s. The underlining theme of this play is moderation-take time to thinks things out. Jumping to conclusions too rapidly is always bad.The Salem Witch Trials occurred at a time of ripened hysteria. In the small Massachusetts village, the conditions were just right: both politically unstable and economically itchy. The Massachusetts government was a theocracy with a strict Puritan foundation. It is out of this form of government, that the idea of guilt by association rises to the surface. If people did not follow these austere laws, the state came down hard. The thing was in Salem, one could indict another of witchcraft (if it was true or not), and the victim was guilty until proven innocent. Why would someone do such a thing? Ask Putnam, for land of course. Various other economic reasons played part in who was accused. After the landslide of accusations had begun, the floodgates were open. It was a serious and bloodcurdling matter to see your neighbors and loved ones jailed and even killed. At this point in the play, everything was out of control.When one looks back on this situation, he/she relies its pure stupidity. How could this ever happen again. Well it did! And our beloved Senator McCarthy was the reason. During his reign, McCarthy accused hundreds of being Communists. Almost all of this finger pointing was random. Some to settle grudges. McCarthy stirred up a deep fear in Americans that there could be Communist within them. He damaged the careers of several and ruined those of others. The reasons for the red scare were no different than those for the witch scare. Instead of Puritanism this time, it was patriotism. The patriotism of the McCarthy era was just as unforgiving and vengeful as the Puritanism of the 17th century Salem."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Ultimately, we never enjoy novels or plays we are forced to read as much as free choice reading selections. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my school's decision to do a reading of 'The Crucible.' With the exception of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', it would have to be one of their better choices. 'The Crucible' is cruel and frustrating, but is certainly a book that teaches us much about this period of time in this area of America. It has to contain some of the most hypocritical characters in a written piece I have ever encountered. My frustration and dislike for Abigail, mounted steadily to a growing hate at the close of the play. I feel that whilst this was not close to a perfect play, and occasionally frustrated me with it's consistancy, it is both informative and relatively entertaining. A somewhat short read, which I am sure would be marvellous to see as a play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much! It has a really important message and the plot really holds your attention.The end is great! I really admire John Proctor for what he did. The whole book he is struggling to forgive himself for what he did. I feel he finally makes his peace with God, his wife, and everyone when he makes the discision he does at the end. The author does a wonderful job of making you really love or hate certain characters. I think the most important theme in this book is the affects of &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;. This is awesome book! I really recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I enjoyed this play very much. Although historically relevant to the salem witch trials in my opinion this play's meaning had little to do with them. What I see Miller focusing on is more the symbolism of the events transpiring within and their relation to modern events (e.g. The Mcarthy Trials). While portraying what happened in Salem during that era, what Miller is focusing on and what he try's to inform you he is focusing on is how he feels it relates to the times in which he lived. Not as a historical account, but dealing with the act's of propoganda, lie's, and how gullible people are to be drawn into a web of deceit such as portrayed within the play"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I bought this cd set to read the play along with my students. It's very theatrical and there are a lot of sound effects. The actors go so fast, that it's hard to follow along if you're reading the play. There's a lot of mumbling, sighing, heavy-breathing. Anyway, if you are wanting to just listen to it, this is a great purchase. If you want to read along, I would try a different cd set."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This is one of the greatest works of all time. It is also reflects current events. Since September 11, there has been a withhunt. Instead of determining if you are a witch or a communist, it is now, \\"Are you a terrorist\\". I think that this book is even more important now since these tragic events. We need to not get ourselves too caught up in the modern mass hysteria towards terrorism and to remember to use common sense."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"without a really good screenplay! In this case, Arthur Miller wrote the play that was to later become a moderately successful movie in 1997. Much has been made of the play's relevance to the McCarthy hearings in the early 1950s, but its impact can carry over to race relations in this country through the 1960s (and today), Hitler's domination of Europe before U. S. involvement, political situations abroad, and a whole host of social issues in 2001 America. This work will always be important and relevant--that's one of the reasons it is a big-time classic!Another reason is the spectacular dialogue between John Proctor and Judge Danforth. The movie tends to draw out the conflict between Proctor and Abigail Williams, but Paul Scofield, who plays Danforth, should have been on the movie poster beside Daniel Day-Lewis. The conviction with which Danforth condemns those accused of witchcraft is truly chilling, whether in print or orally. Proctor's tarnished morality is incredibly compelling. The &quot;wrongness&quot; of the whole situation is amplified and exemplified by those two individuals. Read the play, watching for that gritty dialogue, and then watch the movie. Miller co-wrote the screenplay, so you know that what happens on-screen is of his doing. He fills in the gaps of the play that, while they are very effective on stage, would be distracting to a movie audience.As a play, it is a great read with just incredible dialogue. That translates well onto a stage or onto a movie screen. It just doesn't get any better than this for American drama."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"On my walk through the LoA edition of Arthur Miller plays I bypass The Enemy of the People, the Ibsen adaptation, which I think is a waste of everyone's time, and go straight to the Crucible, which I had never read, nor watched on stage or screen. Very odd. It is a truly gripping piece of modern classic stage writing.Of course AM needed to educate us always, so this story is not just a story about the witch trials of Salem, when perfectly harmless people, including some citizens of standing in the community, got identified as witches and hanged for it. (Which somehow looks like progress over the burnings in Europe.)No, this is generally about fundamentalism and totalitarianism and theocracy, and more specifically about McCarthy and I wouldn't be surprised if it was also about the Ayatollah Khomeini, whatever you may say regarding anachronisms, and the Taliban. Let's not forget the Cultural Revolution of China.If I seem to mock the play just a little bit, I haven't made up my mind yet, not quite. There is something strangely wrong in the tone of the dialogues. Can't quite nail it. Anachronistic for sure; is that all? Have to think about it.The message that AM put into his morality tale is that power and property interests are behind the maddest manifestations of disinterestedness and righteousness. That was sure true in the other historical witch hunts that we know about. Whether it is an accurate reflection of the Salem case, I do not know. (I will definitely look for the DVD and give DDL a chance for redemption in my eyes.)"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Just as 'High Noon' shows the courage of a man who refused to cut and run from great danger, 'The Crucible' is usually regarded as an allegory which attacks the 1950s intolerance of anti-communist zealots.Perhaps it is much more. Liberals get a warm fizzy feeling over Miller's portrayal of fundamentalist religious persecution run amok; but, this limited acumen ignores the terrible \\"engine\\" of such persecution - - - the American adversarial judicial system.The play portrays hapless victims accused of imaginary evils and then convicted by a judicial system based not on truth, justice or mercy but on the absolutes of guilt or innocence. No mitigation is allowed. In Act III, Deputy Governor John Danforth states, \\"But you must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court or he must be counted against it, there is no road between.\\"It's the same idea used by President George Bush to justify whatever he wants to do, always of course within the law and within the Constitution, in his War on Terror. Likewise, Gov. Danforth in 'The Crucible' always acts within the law. Miller asserts all power corrupts, and the power to kill someone corrupts absolutely.It sums up the essence of the play; our court system is either win or lose based on adversarial confrontation. It's origins are in ancient \\"trial by strength\\" rituals. It was thought God would not allow the guilty to triumph, and so victory was considered proof of absolute innocence with no room for doubt. In Act IV, a plea to delay the executions a week was rejected by Gov. Danforth because, \\"Postponement now speaks a floundering on my part; reprieve or pardon must cast doubt upon the guilt of them that died till now.\\"Sound familiar? We are now told that a withdrawal from the War on Iraq \\"must cast doubt upon the sacrifice of them that died till now.\\" Miller is very clear in portraying the corrupting power of government: Never admit a mistake, regardless of the cost to the innocent.As the play ends, one condemned man is urged to sign the false confession he has just spoken. He responds, \\"You have all witnessed it; what more is needed?\\"Why sign? One preacher explains it has nothing to do with guilt, innocence or mercy, instead it is solely because \\"the village must have proof that - - -\\"The man responds, \\"Damn the village! I confess to God, and God has seen my name on this! It is enough!\\" He tells the governor, \\"You are the high court, your word is enough!\\"But judicial rules reject God. Mercy is not by God's truth, but only by the lie demanded by the court. There is no interest in truth, justice, guilt, innocence or mercy. The man refuses, because personal honour means more than arcane rules. He explains, \\"Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How can I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!\\"The court refuses. Justice, says Miller, is not truth or fact; it depends solely on court rules. 'The Cruicible' uses real events from 1692 to illustrate the basic weakness of an adversarial judicial system. It applies today, as much as to the McCarthy era.This is a play for today. It applies to our procedural-bound courts, to religious fundamentalists and to intolerant political extremists. It shows what happens when government officials believe \\"extremism in the pursuit of liberty is no vice.\\" It applies to us, now."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arhtur Miller's &quot;The Crucible&quot; is a masterful work in its representation of the horrific time period in early-American colonial history during the 17th-century when the Salem witch trials were taking place. As well as doing the aforementioned within his play, it presents a stunning metaphor for a time period in which America was plunged into the communism scare by Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy. Accusations were hurled both in Salem and in the McCarthy-era and a &quot;disease&quot; of sorts was taking root within these misguided ways. In the case of Salem, those in question were subjected to court proceedings of the most unjust and one-sided ways. The fear of Satan influenced the ways of the Salem population and therefore, all who were suspected of mingling with the Prince of Darkness were executed. In the case of McCarthy, if one failed to conform to the &quot;true&quot; American way, they were immediately suspected of communist ideals and dealings and accusations were further hurled and imprisonment was in line. For one to fully understand the aim of Miller's work, the reader must first understand the time period in which he was writing and the events therein. However, if one would simply desire to get a look into not only a dark side of American history, but a dark side of the human being itself, &quot;The Crucible&quot; depicts both in excellent style and is well worth reading. In the words of Levar Burton though, &quot;...you don't have to take my word for it...&quot; PEACE!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I had been intrested in the Salem witch trials for quite sometime, so that lead me to picking up 'The Crucible'. This is a great document of the chaos that went on in Salem, Mass. in 1692. The trouble starts when Betty Parris, 10, falls under some unknown illness with symptoms unknown, everyone immedietly belives it to be causes of an unknown evil that put her in her inert, and practically lifeless. the work of the devil. The town is in histerics and begins a crazy terrorous witchhunt when accusations are fired out. Arthur Miller's story gives the whole Salem Witch Hunts a realistic spin and puts it in uniform and shines up its buttons. The story is inthralling, and the characters (Abagail in particular) are wonderfully designed and intriguing. The book is written in playwrite format, which makes it somewhat clunky to read, but is still fluent. I would love to do this play in drama class. *has been begging her teacher* Any one who is intrested in witchcraft or the salem witch trials will deffinetly enjoy this. You really get to see the evil of scociety, and how quick people are to point fingers, and the results.. 19 innocent men and women hanged.

Theatre Works' rendition of Miller's _The Crucible_ is an excellent demonstration of the actor's craft, as the tenor, pitch and emotive power of the play bring the characters to life. On the recommendation of Amazon reviewers, I used this for my English class (in addition to the Daniel Day-Lewis / Winona Rider DVD and a class read-around) to get a feel for the play and the various theatrical interpretations of the work.As a previous reviewer noted, there are some differences between the audio version and Miller's script, but they are minor, and if one is not using the entire CD, a moot point. The performances are fantastic, and, as others have mentioned, it certainly gives life to the written word. Outside of a classroom, I couldn't recommend it, but as a teaching tool, it is first-rate."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Can someone get the death penalty when accused of being a witch or warlock?

A young group of girls had been dancing outside in the religious city of Salem and to avoid being punished they blamed all their wrong doings on having been possessed by local witches. Their where so many allegations of witches that they created a board used to determine the truth in the accusations, and the girls that where accusing where present to help out and find the guilty. One of the girls that were dancing that night happened to be the same one that Mr. Proctor had had an affair with and in hope that she could take Mr. Proctor's wife's place she claimed that she was possessed by Katherine, Mr. Proctor's wife. Her plan did not work out as she had thought, Katherine got a pardon for a year because she was pregnant and Mr. Proctor was the one that went to jail to be hung. Mr. Proctor was given a chance to go away free if he admitted to the crime of witchery. He admitted but was not willing to sign a paper with his name so he died at the gallows along with many other innocent people. The Crucible is a very emotional and dramatic book that really sheds light on what happened with the witch trials many years ago.The book can be very dramatic at some points, leading you through a series of suspenseful sequences. When the scene where the priest from far away specialized in finding witches comes and looks at this girl who fainted in the forest he thinks it has to do with witches and the devil almost immediately. He believes whatever they say leaving you angry at how blind he is. In the hearing against Katherine when Proctor admits to an affair and it is up with his wife to be consistent with his story it is very dramatic. She fails and they are both scheduled to be hanged. When Proctor agrees to admit to being a witch, but then refused to sign a paper that stated the same thing insuring he is going to be hanged it is very dramatic,The book can be and makes you emotional sometimes. When the girls rely on this horrible back up story and start to spout off names of the people they do not like that so called \\"possessed\\" them it can make you emotional. When Katherine, who never lies, fails to be consistent with her husband's story it is very emotional. Also when Proctor has the time to decide whether or not to admit safe his life and does it is very emotional. But even more emotional after all that is when he refuses to sign a piece of paper and is hung anyways it leaves you with a strange and bad feeling.The book was very opening for me in the behaviors and things that took place in the witch trials. The way that the girls accused others leading to their death just because they did not want to be punished was horrible and after seeing that the accused where going to die and still not tell the truth is absolutely disgusting. When the young lady that Proctor had an affair with took advantage of the witch trial situations and peoples fear in hope to better improve her own situation it really opens up how horrible someone can be to somebody else just to get their away. Also how Proctor let his pride get him killed really leaves a mark on you and makes you think what you would do if placed in the position of dieing or admitting to something that you did not do.The Crucible is a very well written book that helps you better to understand what the witch trials where all about and the evils that some people committed in spite and for other reasons. The way the author gets the image out with this dramatic and emotional not only teaches you about what happens but also gives great characters to relate to as you are reading. The Crucible is an emotional book worth reading that sheds light on events that happened in the past that make you think what you would have done put in various peoples positions,M.

Though he has sinned by committing adultery with Abigail Williams, he believes the witchcraft trials which have ultimately consumed him to be the result of human, rather than godly, forces. Playwright Arthur Miller sets the scene for this action in an Overture explaining the theocracy which controlled Salem. Powerful clergymen, some more rigid in their interpretations of Scripture than others, \\"protected\\" citizens by enforcing conformity with the church's teachings.Through detailed character sketches inserted into the structure of the play, Miller broadens the realism, and when a group of hysterical young women makes accusations of witchcraft, resulting ultimately in the deaths of nineteen of their fellow-citizens, Miller has prepared his audience to accept the trials and the behavior of the characters as plausible. His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young \\"afflicted\\" girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a \\"hook\\" with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves. In reality, Abigail Williams was eleven, and John Proctor was sixty, quite different from the dramatic circumstances here. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's The Crucible, a play in four acts, deals with the witch-craze in Salem in the 17th century. A minister from Salem discovers a groups of teenage girls dancing naked around a fire in the woods. As the girls are aware of the fact that they will have to face severe punishment for their action, they claim to have been possessed by evil spirits. This causes a major outcry in the Puritan community of Salem and a court is formed to deal with and investigate the accusations of the girls in further detail.At first, only a few people are accused of witchcraft but in the course of events over a hundred people are accused of bewitching the girls. Even people with a very good reputation who have never acted against the will of God or the community are sent to prison due to suspicion, gossip or denunciation.It is clear that in many cases theo girls accuse people with whom they have had some kind of problems or against whom they hold some sort of grievance. Abigail Williams accuses Elizabeth Proctor, her former employer, after having been dismissed from work by Mrs. Proctor. Abigail was the Proctors' servant but had to leave their home because Elizabeth Proctor suspected her of having an affair with her husband.Elizabeth Proctor is sent to prison but not hanged immediately due to the fact that she is pregnant. As John Proctor tries to come to the rescue of his wife, he himself runs into difficulties because he is suspected of undermining the court.Some of the accused avoid execution by \\"confessing\\" that they have a pact with the devil but 19 people are hanged. John Proctor does not want to confess a crime he has not committed. However, he changes his decision because of his wife and his three children and decides to sign a confession in order to save his life. But he immediately regrets his decision, tears up the confession and is brought to his execution.The Crucible is a very impressive and powerful play. It illustrates the irrationality of the people which is strongly connected with their fears and superstitious beliefs. Miller manages to show that the people really believed that what they did was right and only done to protect a community of god-fearing people.By reading The Crucible you can learn to understand the point of view and the world of the accusers. You begin to understand that the actions of the Puritans are very logical in their own way. You start to understand the beliefs of the accusers and even develop a kind of sympathy for them and their fears.On the whole, The Crucible is easy to read and can also be read in one setting. The plot is easy to follow, extremely exciting and keeps you in its grip from the fist to the last line. I believe that The Crucible is hugely recommendable for everyone who is interested in understanding the witch-craze and the point of view of the accusers as well as the accused."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible demonstrated human nature at its worst, and what happens when the oppressed are given the power of life-and-death over others. Interesting how democratic America had its roots in such unfairness, and how, despite how much civilization has progressed, the strong still often team up against the weak, and people aren't willing to stand up for the truth.It takes place during a time of suspicion, the Salem Witch trials. A girl named Abigail is given the power to decide who is a witch(and should therefore die), and who isn't. She uses this power to get revenge on the wife of the man she loves. Little does she know that, eventually, this man is killed, as are many other good people in the village."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I was hoping to use this in my 11th grade class to go along with the text of The Crucible, but there's just no way. The readers certainly do express the emotions in the scenes, but it's pretty overstated. Did they record this whole thing in a sauna, or something? Enough with the heavy breathing! If you just want to listen to it for your own purposes, it's great, but in a classroom, expect your students to feel awkward and make jokes about how some parts sound like a bad porno."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's masterful play explores the consequences of greed, envy, vengeance, extremism, and hypocrisy run amok. It is set in Salem during the infamous witch trials, but could easily translate to other times in history (Robespierre's reign of terror during the French revolution, McCarthy's Communist hearings, etc.). Miller shows how the witch trials took flight and gathered speed and power until they nearly consumed the whole of Salem. He also shows how the officials in charge refused to hear evidence contrary to their purpose so as not to lose face publicly by standing down. Through the story of John and Elizabeth Proctor, a couple caught in the center of the firestorm, the tragedy of the trials is made abundantly clear. In a futile attempt to save his wife from the machinations of Abigail Williams (the young girl Proctor had had an affair with, and who kicks off the accusations with her friends to get Elizabeth Proctor out of the way so that she can be with John), Proctor fights the system by challenging the court to see the motives behind the accusations. His attempts to bring reason into madness are met with the insistence that if he is not with them, he is against them (which should sound eerily familiar to anyone with a television set). After Proctor himself has been accused of colluding with the Devil and sentenced to death the officials in charge become determined to use him to validate their holy terror. If Proctor, a popular and well-liked man in town, were to lie and give them a confession that he had conspired with Satan it would legitimize all of the hangings that went on in the public eye. Giving a false confession would save Proctor from hanging and allow him to live to see the birth of the child Elizabeth is carrying -- but can he go through with it? Miller's multilayered play is a classic for the ages -- a truly timeless work of drama that is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first produced in 1953 (at the height of the McCarthy hearings), and which will most likely prove relevant in another fifty years as well. That is a sad statement for humanity, but a credit to Miller for his perceptive eye and his courage to capture it so eloquently. Perhaps with the example set forth in \\"The Crucible\\" we can learn from the past, and not be doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I thought this play was excellent. I haven't read many American plays before, but this one was definitely great. It takes place during the Salem Witch Trials, and follows the inhabitants over a period of several months. I thought it was interesting mainly because it gave me some insight into how terrifying it must have been for the people who lived back then. It shows how hysteria can make people believe anything and how a small minority can destroy so many people's lives, once they realize how much power they have. It was very disturbing, because it makes you realize how fragile our society is; but it is also very enlightening."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is a book about a parish and community inSalem,Mass. during the Salem witch trials.

I hated this book with the intensity of a thousand suns. From the get-go the book is more caught up in describeing the situatin than the characters and often gets way off subject. Also many of the characters are so far-fected it is hard to take this book seriously. Many of the characters, like Abigail Williams, are so caught up in their lies that they are believe them and the play is more about a mentaly unstable, oversexed girl, and a guy who dosen't know how to keep it in his pants.Also durring the play, many of the characters, like Tituba, just drop out and you don't know what happened to them. I also found the plot to be extermly dull and lacking real thought. The main idea of the play is the main character, Abigail Williams, is so caught up in revenge on the wife of the guy that she got into bed that she goes crazy. The entire village of Salem say that her madness is caused by the devil, and Abibail uses that to her advantage and manipulates them to believe her far-fecthed story about being bewithed by the devil and her lies got nineteen people and two dogs hung. Even though this play was meant to mirror the Red Scare that was going on when Miller wrote this and represent the real Salem Witch trials, I found this play boring and had a lack of plot and characters.I would not recomend this play for a monkey to read, and the main reason I held it together when reading this was my English grade was depending on that book, and it was short.

So began the whole situation of Abigail blaming people for witch craft, she wanted John Proctor, but she didn't want her name to be tainted in the town.

One thing it is not is a piece of history, so be warned. Too many people read this as a historical text, despite Arthur Miller's explicit instructions in the play's notes to not do so, and thus they miss the forest for the trees. This is not an examination of the Salem Witch Trials, but rather a fictional rendering of a historical event, in order for the modern reader or viewer to examine their own bias, prejudices, hypocrisy, or concepts of honor.To me, this play is about one's man's personal redemption. The protagonist of the play, John Proctor, is a fallen man for many reasons, and the play really traces his moral progression to final absolution through honor, truth, and dignity. The events of Salem in 1692 are used for dramatic purposes to tell this story. And what a story it is.Every time I read this play I feel intense hatred for theocracy and dogmatic religion wherever it may be found, and I also find myself examining my own personal code of ethics and seeing how I stand in the world of moral affairs. \\"The Crucible\\" is wonderfully structured in four acts, each one better than the one that preceded it, and it builds to a crescendo and a very abrupt ending that leaves the reader with a pounding heart, an angry mind, and a moral quandary. No small feat!The text has a very large cast of characters, but in this edition all of Miller's notes are included, and so it reads like a novel, and is a very enjoyable experience, even if one never actually sees it in performance. In the hands of a bad acting company it would be deadly dull, but done well it is exciting. The film version, for which Arthur Miller also wrote the screenplay, is not bad either. Daniel Day Lewis is an excellent John Proctor, and it captures the spirit of the text very well.If you don't know this seminal American work, you should.

I like the format, because it brings out each individual character, and puts each one on the spot, so I can easily delineate each character's tone as they conversed.Described as a timeless classic, The Crucible provides everlasting insights that are not just clich&eacute;d themes, but perceptive recurring themes that are demonstrated through mankind's idiosyncrasies. This book unearths essential themes that will stay in the history of mankind, due to its significance and accuracy towards human flaws. The fact that humans would selfishly perform acts of self interest at the expense of others in the midst of fear and hysteria has been repeated throughout history and will continue to be one of many human's shortcomings.I liked how the book reflects what happened in reality. Mainly referring to the Salem witch trials and the Red Scare, The Crucible asserts that opportunistic people, who perform self-interest, immoral acts that saves their lives at the expense of others' is essentially wrong and selfish. Much like Abigail, many people from Salem have intentionally accused the innocence for witchcraft to sway the attention and blame, when in actuality, they are blameworthy.At the peak of the Red Scare, many people, in hopes of being vindicated for wrongdoing, attacked innocent reputation, pretending to serve the community by finding the menaces, who in this case are the communists, of society, while, ironically, the accuser is actually the culprit. Because everyone was afraid of communists, some used that notion to their advantage to lock people, who had done wrong to them, a tactic that is wrong and immoral.Since I have read Othello, I noticed a parallel between it and this book. That humans would selfishly perform acts of self interest at the expense of others in the midst of fear and hysteria is a theme, around which The Crucible revolves; this very theme parallels to that of Othello by Shakespeare, because both Abigail and Iago perform culpable actions just to find a scapegoat, who is supposed absorbs all the blame.In The Crucible, Abigail understands her options, and the only way to sway all the attention that is imposed on her originally is to find a scapegoat, who eventually becomes John Proctor, who upholds a reputation and refuses to reveal his scandalous relationship with Abigail. Because Abigail is accused of witchcraft, the only way to survive is to use Proctor as a scapegoat, because she is certain that he will not refute that accusation, unless he unveils his adultery, which he avoids to keep his reputation clean. Abigail's opportunistic nature essentially saves her, but ultimately kills Proctor.I did not really like the characters per say, but I really was intrigued by the fact that people do blame other people just so they could be vindicated. I look around myself, and I do see this as a universal theme."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I find that books on CD help my 17 year old get an edge on his English projects.

It lived up to exceptional reviews, including the first ever six star maximum awarded by TimeOut's theater section.Some plays read better than they ever perform. Others perform better than they read. Others are equal. This is a play that reads and performs well, but a theater production is extremely demanding, if for other reason the number of actors required. The RSC had the requisite numbers and quality.Miller was quite open about the play's symbolizing of the McCarthy era of smears, innuendos and attacks that ruined the lives of many innocent people. Miller made it clear that his play was fiction that was loosely based on the Salem witch trials.The play is also about human character -- how revenge, jealousy and other motivations sometimes bring out the worst. In the 50s, few played much attention to the allusions to the Puritans, who had no tolerance for other Christians, much less other faiths. For them, as the play says, you are either with us or you are against us. A familiar refrain. Well performed or well read, the play is thought provoking. But your mind must be open to at least consider putting yourself honestly into Miller's shoes and his era.There is a reviewer who condemns this play even while admitting he has never read it or seen it performed. He is only concerned with imposing his point of view. What he contends is that McCarthy was more right than wrong and that there was no witchhunt because there were communists -- and some in government. It's a popular theme among McCarthyism deniersCondemning a book or play you know nothing about is akin to book burning -- or witch hunting.Witch Hunt is defined as \\"an attempt to find and punish people whose opinions are unpopular and who are said to be a danger to society\\" My Webster defines \\"the searching out and deliberate harassment of those (as political opponents) with unpopular views.\\" Miller got that right and the revisionists of facts get it wrong. From the earliest days, witch hunting has never really been about witches, but those who held those unpopular views or lived differently.You could get to be a \\"fellow traveler\\" by speaking to the wrong people. Most American communists had quit the party in disillusionment well before McCarthy came along. McCarthy in his \\"Crucible\\" style kangaroo court went after people anyone who could give him a headline. He gave no due process or fairness. It was about confessions and naming names in a Soviet-style show trial. Which is strange for a man who and other right wingers in Congress who succeeded in overturning the conviction of the SS troops responsible for the Malmedy Massacre. It was all in character.McCarthy won his first local election by smearing a respectedl jurist. And then, exaggerating his own war experience, he smeared Sen. La Folette as a draft dodger even though LaFollette was 46 when Pearl Harbor was attacked. McCarthy requested a DSC he almost certainly did not deserve (similar to LBJ's Silver Star). And he claimed to have flown missions (in varying numbers) when he was actually a desk bound intelligence cipher. And then he saw opportunity as a demagogue on the communist threat identified by George Kennan in the \\"Long Telegram.\\"In February, 1950 he waved a list of people who he said were communists who in the State Department. A review is no place to recount basic history of who our WWII allies were -- or that Churchill, a devout anti-communists needed the Soviet Union against Hitler as did we. There were real problems. In 1946, the State Department itself prepared the list of security risks McCarthy eventually waved around. Most of them were dismissed as security risks, not as Communists, but for other reasons, i.e. sexual preference, alcoholism, bankruptcy, etc. McCarthy got the names from a Senate report done years before. Some had been guilty of having a contrary view on China, citing the corruption and weakness of Chiang Kai-Shek. McCarthy's, who attacked gays, could not have passed the security standards due to his own sexual preferences and alcoholism.McCarthy leveled the charge of helping the communist agenda against General Eisenhower, President Truman, FDR, General George Marshall, Secretary of State Dean Acheson and many other great men who were staunch anti-communists. In fairness to McCarthy, he did some of his worst smears while drunk or close to it. He would drink with reporters, then feed them their stories. Anyone looking at the old film can see that he was frequently intoxicated -- and his performance on the Murrow See It Now, was not only smear but out of control. Easy to see in Good Night and Good Luck. No one could damage McCarthy in the end as he did himself.Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican conservative, strongly condemned McCarthy in her Declaration of Conscience speech in June of 1950. Others joined her, but most were afraid. Eisenhower, who had despised McCarthy for years, did not respond until McCarthy went after the Army. McCarthy targeted political opponents, e.g. Sen. Millard Tydings was tarred by McCarthy's committee with a faked photograph of him with a Communist. He smeared a Connecticut Senator who questioned his actions. Even J.Edgar Hoover had to wash his hands of him. So the smears continued until 1954 when the Senate finally censured McCarthy for conduct unbecoming his office.McCarthy did no good and damaged the U.S. counter espionage program. It was in any event Richard Nixon who pushed the Alger Hiss case -- before the election when McCarthy discovered ommunism was his ticket. Other major cases involving communists, for good or ill, were accomplished before McCarthy came along.The climate of fear and division McCarthy engendered was perhaps Stalin's greatest victory. The McCarthy hearings called those who would make a good show confession-- or provide a list of names already given. Artist and writers and bureaucrats who had done nothing feared for their jobs for youthful indiscretions, or knowing a wrong someone -- or for nothing at all. McCarthy not only stifled dissent, he cast a pall over American intellectual life more in line with Stalin than the US.Carl Foreman, who co-wrote the script for \\"High Noon\\" and co-proiduced it, is an example of those forced into exile (to Britain). As it happens, High Noon, once wildly condemned by the right, is one of the most requested film for presidential viewing. Reagan loved it. So did Lech Walesa, who cites use of its imagery, i.e. the movie poster of Gary Cooper, in Poland's first almost-free elections. Why? As Walesa said in the Wall Street Journal: \\"Cowboys fight for justice, fight against evil, and fight for freedom, both physical and spiritual.\\" Some conservatives now rave over its depiction of duty and courage.So too, is The Crucible about core American beliefs of nothing going along with the crowd, joining the lynch mob. The unpopularity or even complete wrongness of some views does not make it correct to punish people for having those beliefs. If you want to criticize it, first you have to see the play and understand it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is one of the most well written and captivating plays I have ever read. It follows the story of the Salem witch trials from start to finish. This is a wonderful work to read because it holds a reader's interest while providing them with an accurate account of historical events.The play opens with the mysterious illness of young Betty Parris. When no other option presents itself, witchcraft is suspected. The play then follows the accusations of witchcraft made against many of Salem's citizens by a group of teenage girls. After their wives are arrested as witches, a group of men attempt to plead on their behalves: a worthy endeavor that proves disatrous for all involved.While the play's beginning is slightly confusing, it quickly looses that quality and becomes very entertaining. I recommend The Crucible highly and completely for readers of all ages. {Megan, 2005}"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When John Proctor says these words to his wife Elizabeth at the conclusion of this play, he has faced accusations of being in league with the Devil and is ready to face consequences meted out by the religious tribunal he has faced.

His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young \\"afflicted\\" girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a \\"hook\\" with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves.

Abigail is the leader of a group of young girls who start accusing other people in the town of being witches. Even though there was no real proof any of these people were witches, they were arrested, tried, and found guilty. The ones that confessed were allowed to live, but the ones that refused to confess were hung.When Abigail accuses Elizabeth Proctor of witchcraft, her husband, John, goes to the judge and tells him that Abigail accused Elizabeth of this crime because Elizabeth had discovered that he and Abigail were having an affair. The judge has Elizabeth brought to the courthouse, and he asks her if her husband had been unfaithful. She doesn't know John has admitted to this, and she lies in order to protect him. Then John is accused of being a witch and he is arrested.John agrees to confess so that he can live, but he refuses to accuse anyone else of being a witch. But when they ask him to sign a public confession, which they plan to hang in the church, he refuses and retracts his confession.I first read this book over 20 years ago in high school and recently re-read it. This was one of the few 'classics' that I was able to fully appreciate when I read it as a teen-ager.The story is fascinating, even more so because it's based on real historical events and people, although some facts were changed. For example: In reality, Abigail was 11 and John was 60 (in the play their ages were 17 and 40) and they never had an affair.The Crucible is a story of injustice resulting from mass hysteria. It's also about courage and honor. It took a great deal of courage for these people to die rather than to tell a lie so that they could live."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When John Proctor says these words to his wife Elizabeth at the conclusion of this play, he has faced accusations of being in league with the Devil and is ready to face consequences meted out by the religious tribunal he has faced.

At times it can be difficult to follow because is in a play script format but it is laid out well. Some things are different in the book than are in the real life events. Some of the girls ages are changed. This end up just adding more to the drama of the book and makes it more realistic to our time. There are some great characters in the book such as Giles Corey the grumpy old man thinks the who thing is a hoax. He is very dynamic and adds a great contrast to the chaos that goes on in the book with the other characters. Another great aspect that Arthur Millier added to the story was the narration.

I hope so you delivered that book ."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When I was up at Cambridge back in the olden days when there were only three women's colleges and men's colleges were single sex, I tried my hand at acting and ended up joining an \\"indie\\" production of \\"The Crucible. By \\"Indie\\" I mean that it was not produced by either the of the two drama societies the Amateur Dramatic Club and the Mummers, nor by a college drama society. It was instead produced by this second-year student and performed in a church and performed by people who answered an ad in Varsity. That was how I got into it.I probably got the part of Tituba because I am Chinese and they didn't have a more authentic applicant. I also was a member of the ADC. What we did have was the up and rising freshman actress to play Abigail Proctor. We happened to be reading English at Griton in the same year. She was a much better actress.But one thing that really struck me when I was reading this play was how it was basically the McCarthy Treason trials and Miller's take on them. I didn't know about the trials first-hand but I was certainly aware that they had happened and the kind of hysteria behind it.Having said that, I also did not think that Miller was trying to portray Salem, Massachusetts when those trials took place. Gone from the picture in spite of the presence of a minister is any sense of the religious fervor and fear which also played a significant role then. This went beyond orthodox political thinking. I don't think that we ever quite got the crying-out scene right, but I don't think there was all that much guidance either. And actually, looking back now, I am not so sure that the rest of the cast were quite as aware of the McCarthy trials as perhaps they should have been. Certainly they were never mentioned at any rehearsal I ever attended. And the copy we used was not footnoted or anything, nor did it have an introduction.All this indicates to me that Miller's play did not travel all that well, as is the case with a few others I have read. Not \\"Death of a Salesman\\" though.That little production did all right though. It was also the last time I acted in Cambridge. I didn't figure there were going to be too many opportunities for a not-so-wonderful Chinese actress (of course I didn't think so then) and started working for the newspaper rather more seriously. But I still have the play, and I read it again every so often."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"When is lying justifiable? Is it good in certain situations but bad in others? The Bible explicitly says, \\"Thou shall not lie,\\" but most nowadays choose to neglect that rule and seek our own good, whether it be by telling the truth or by lying. Arthur Miller's The Crucible is memorable in that it illustrates the malicious extent of a person's lie. Miller recounts a person's desire to destroy one another by using false accusations to highlight the destructive result of humanity's egoistic nature.A look at the period in which the book takes place is crucial in understanding the immorality behind the punishments those accused of witchcraft received. Set in the early 17th century America, the enticing play quickly build up climax as the characters struggle to fit in their superficial society of the Puritans. Those latter strongly believed that any contact with evil spirits merits death. The presence of a sinner in the midst of the community would mean danger and melancholy to all. Therefore, it was crucial to spot the guilty and remove him/her.Since the firm Puritan belief of the seventeenth century upheld witchcraft as a direct contact with devils, and if not Lucifer himself, the accusations of Abigail and her associates cause great hysteria in the calm city of Salem. By falsely accusing others of being involved in witchcraft, Abigail succeeds in fooling the deputy who then orders many venerable citizens to burn at the stake.It is also interesting to realize that Miller passed through a period that exactly parallels that found in his play. Driven by the impulsive McCarthyism ideology of his era, Miller parallels the anti-Communist fervor of the 1950's with the false accusations of the Salem Witch trials of the 1690's in order to highlight the outlandish prejudice of both eras.Senator John McCarthy eliminates Communist compellers from the United States by ensuring that all those partaking of the Communistic party be severely punished. As in the case with the Salem Witch Trials, people in the 1950's accused others of Communistic involvement in order to escape their awaited severe punishments.In both eras, the policy of encouraging others to confess resulted in great hysteria and settled long-held vendettas. In the 1950's, those who refused to confess were forever blacklisted, and in the 1690's, they were condemned and hanged. In both eras, it is evident that the envy of the miserable toward the happy is what caused many people to sell others.Overall, the book is enticing and holds many moral lessons that the reader must deduce after seeing the consequences of the characters' actions. If you want to discover some history as well as enjoy a book where you will be able to see yourself, then I strongly recommend this play for you."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"An amazingly lyrical account of the Salem witch trials. Miller brings out the hypocrisy and hysteria of the trials. Brief but memorable, it also includes some digressions where Miller narrates some of his thoughts about the time. Far from being just an indictment of Salem and McCarthyism, this is a book for all times, for all settings -- the evils of common opinion where common opinion and humanity go mad are nowhere better expressed."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This novel represents a time in history where religion,family, and community tower over all other desires. The Puritan age was a time of harsh discipline towards the human faith.In the small town of Salem Massachusetts there is a community with overwhelming adversity, and the inhabitants of this place could have never prepared for the times which they would face. Two young girls in the town, Betty and Abagail, get into mischief by choosing to dance in the forest with a black slave woman named Tituba. They end up being caught by the local minister Reverend Parris. After being caught Betty slips into an unexplainable coma, and the word of the community is that whitchcraft is responsible for her condition. The town becomes curious and fearful of what may happen to them. The Reverend chooses to question Abagail about what exactly happened, but she still preaches that the girls were doing nothing but harmless dancing. Whitch trials proceed after this point, and the true identity of the town is revealed.As the story transpires there is a large question mark throughout the duration of the story as to what happened to Betty and Abagail in the woods, and this constant dragging on made me a bit shy towards the book in the middle of the story. Betty eventually wakes up from her coma and the trials continue.The town is exposed during the trials as being accused of misduing for some time and the community becomes split among families where whitches are supposivly turning up everywhere.I gave the story a 3 point review mark because i believe it was a well written novel, but lacked the attention development throughout the middle of the book. The beginning and end were my favorite parts to read, but overall a decent book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's play &quot;THE CRUCIBLE&quot; is fantastic. It gives a true insight to the time of hysteria during the Salem Witch Trials.I have never read a piece of work of literature in which human nature during hysteria is so well portrayed. Abigail is one person whom I disliked because she's cold-hearted, selfish and wicked. I did enjoy the book's social message because the entire Salem scenario repeated itself in the 1950s."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The story shows an hysterical witch hunt in the United States of 1692. I think it's a very fascinating play which is also able to show the witch hunt very well. It shows that people searched somebody who had to be the reason (the scapegoat) for everything they couldn't explain with their knowledge. Another very paradoxical thing for me is that being afflicted was a reason that another one was a witch. It is also very strange that children could say anybody is a witch and then the one was a also a witch even when children hadn't much to say in this time. I would recommend to read the play to anybody who is a little bit interested in history, it's a very good experience."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The play shows very good how people believe blindly what the others say. The church is the only puplic building at this time and the parishioners follow its roules. I find it incredible how they believe the words of the &quot;afflicted children&quot; even though children had nothing to say in that century. Probably that is the reason why they want to get attention by telling this lies. I think they can't imagine the consequences. It's terrible how the people wait to accuse their neighbours. They just want to take vengeance. Miller knows very well how to make the story thrilling. Until the end you I didn't dare to breath,because Proctor can't decide. But I think he did the right thing."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"At the moment I am a high school student and I am perfoming this playwrite in a production. I must say, that when I read it for the first time before we started to rehearse, I didn't think to much of it. I finished i in two nights, but I didn't see what was so increadibly special about it. There is a witch trial, some people get hanged and a guy talks to his wife a lot. It wasn't until I started seeing it 3-4 times a week and really discussing my character (John Hale) and seeing other people disscus theirs, I realized how much was in this book. If you think carefully, you realize that there is not a single unimportant sentence in the whole thing. There are so many little things that come out when reading it for the second or third time, that this bok becomes so much more than at first expected. All in all, I recommend this book. If you liked it the first time around, I say read it again, it only gets better."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I liked how The Crucible focused on the Salem Witch trials, because the Salem Witch trials fascinate me. I liked how Arthur Miller focused on the young girls playing in the woods trying to conjure spirits from the dead. I found it funny when the girls blamed others for practicing witchcraft. If I would have got in the same situation, I think I would have blamed someone else to. I liked how he let the audience feel like they were witnessing the trials.I didn't like how Abigail was having an affair with Proctor and tried accusing his wife of witchcraft. It was stupid to do that because, it wasn't Proctor's fault. I didn't like the character Putnam, because he murdered his neighbors and accused them of witchcraft. Just so that he could get their land.My favorite characters were Proctor, because he was put through a lot. He resembled me in a way, because when he would do something wrong, or something bad would happen, he would try working it out. I like Reverend Parris, because he didn't want to leave even though certain things were happening. I liked Elizabeth proctor, because she was honest. I liked Deputy Governor Danforth the most, because he sentenced the people who refused to confess their crimes to death.The characters I didn't like were Betty Parris, because when her dad caught her in the woods dancing, she started accusing other people of witchcraft. I didn't like Abigial, because she had an affiar with Proctor, and makes others say they see spirits too, and accused Proctor's wife of witchcraft. I didn't like Thomas Putnam, because he was accusing people of witchcraft so he could have their land.The development of the play was well organized. Arthur Miller introdcues the four most important themes, which are deception, possession, greed, and the quest for power in the first act. That way his audiences can become aware of what is important. The narrator provides the best background information. The explanatory passes allow the directors and actors to focus on the characters motivation. That helps them have a better understanding of the characters and the historical period. The characters in the play are more engaging because they all have some type of tension between them."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is as twisted a story as any that I've read before. In the late 15th century, Salem, Massachusetts was in the form of a theocracy, which stirred up conflict between government leaders and citizens as well as citizen vs. citizen battles. Witchcraft was the big talk of this play because it played such a huge role in the vast number of trials and executions. When you begin to take in the information of the text, you see that witchcraft became a way that any citizen of Salem could blame their enemies just to have them killed. Several small groups of people (factions) who fought over such topics as land and governmental positions would accuse their opponents of witchcraft and in many cases it would result in imprisonment or death. Examples of battles between two people are Abby and Elizabeth Proctor who fought over John Proctor and Putnam and Francis Nurse, who were in a dispute because Nurse beat out Putnam's brother-in-law to become a member of Salem's ministry. Even though this play may not be historically accurate, it made me realize exactly what was going on in the world 300 years ago and make me appreciate the United States' government today."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The printing is of poor quality, some pages are genuinely difficult to read.

What poor character development! Miller has to develop his characters through long, boring paragraphs instead of just allowing them to speak and define their personalities that way. This guy should take a hint from Shakespeare (specifically, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar): develop characters by what they say and the way they say it. And then, on top of a slow plot and dry story line, Miller has the tenacity to set the entire play in only four or five rooms. For two acts they are in Betty's bedroom and Procter's living room. This book is a sleeper.

The text is wonderful, full of ironies and dramatic scenes - for example, the scene where Elizabeth lies for the first time in her life to save Proctor's reputation, only to realise that her good intentions have unwittingly helped Abigail. Land wars, revenge and a host of other reasons show us the repressed state Salem was in in those days. The relationships between the main characters : Proctor, Parris, Abigail, etc, were understandable and one could actually feel himself or herself praying that a particular character would survive the madness, or feel sympathy for even the villains.

The end of the play has a hurt and confused wife holding forth a dripping burlap sack full of hacked up pieces of a dead goat as her husband weeps into his hands.

Do we allow a person to marry a goat?\\"This is ludicrous and anyone with a little common sense should see that to jump from same sex to bestiality is both crazy and propaganda. But let's play with this bit of stupidity for a moment: Imagine a young woman taking her goat home to meet the folks for the first time. \\"Mom. Dad\\" she says timidly, \\"This is Billy.\\"In 1955 there were actually Senate Congressional hearings where individuals were seriously asked about their connections with the Communist Party and asked to give names of those with whom they worked who might just be \\"red\\" as well. Lucille Ball, married to a Cuban, managed to escape ruin because Ball and Arnaz ran one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. No one was hiring Lucy; she did the hiring. And no Senator was going to tell Americans not to watch the beloved Lucille Ball. Others were not so lucky and were blacklisted, never to work again. Some managed to escape. Shirley Jackson and Stanley Edgar Hyman were members of the Communist party as students at Syracuse university in the 1930'[s/. they escaped persecution but one of their very talented writer friends wasn't published until the early 70's when Woody Allen hired him as a screen writer. Ralph Ellison was published first. Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible- tightly researched and accurate (ironically, Shirley Jackson wrote a book called The Witchcraft of Salem Village but for different reasons) and America saw how the Red Scare was a witch hunt- smart America anyway.Sadly, The Crucible remains relevant as it could now go on a double bill with Albee's The Goat. One, defining the purity of love using our homophobic culture's bad taste as a well produced metaphor and the other, Miller's Witch hunt that could easily occur with anyone from the Jews in Europe to the Gays in America.To those who didn;t live in the middle of the cold war, either as the first group, who were cojlficted about siding with Germany to protect from The Communists, to the last generation who simply lkived with the fear that a series of buttons would be pushed and the world would end.\\"What would you do if they droipped the bomb?\\" a seven year old boy asked her grandfather who was a nuclear physcisit. He thought about bomb shelters, canned food, bottled war. His grandfather's answer scared him more than anything in his loife.\\"I'd go outside and watch.\\"But Miller was talking about the witch hunt of paranoia that filled the fabulous 50's. In the same time we were doing Nuclear Testing in northering Nevada and Utah while more and more countries continued to do the same and the Communist was seen as so dangerous to the fabric of life- not just American life. Arthuur Miller's point seems to have been that in retrospet the whole thing would be seen with the same foollishness as the Trials of Salem Village. It's true now, but sadly, Communists have been replaced by others of whom we are afriad: Enter Edward Albee.The other thing these plays have in common is that they both won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; the authors collected multiple Pulitzers, a plethora of Tony Awards and a production life that will go on in Regional Theatres, community theatres, colleges and High Schools for hundreds of years.And sadly, they will likely both remain relevant. Because if a German is not allowed to marry a Jew and is shot for having a relationship with one, then why can't a man be shot for having a relationship with another man? Genocide still goes on, as Paul Simon wrote in \\"Old\\" and Al Gore pointed out to the UN (One can use Google Earth and look down upon the vast concentration camp at Darfur Sudan) as we all stand in line at Wal-Mart on Black Friday 2012, where, according to the news, there were only three Wal-Mart handgun incidents. It takes very little and a Holocaust sneaks up on us while we're worrying about our gas bill and snow tires.My Country \`tis of thee.

It is not just an indictment of the McCarthy era as many describe it, although those allusions and allegory are present. I see this play as the story of how awful one can become to one's own neighbors, if one's end goal is that neighbor's property. We still see episodes like this in modern life.I think this play gives pause to the idea of religion as the basis for education in our country. Given that one can target a person who does not believe for destruction, and in a fervent religious community even the facts have no bearing. Truth is the highest commodity of all. And John Proctor is the only character in the play to see through the mendacity from the beginning.This is also a cautionary tale on the power of government. When our leaders show up wanting to pacify a mob, instead of standing for the truth, everyone is in trouble. In this play, the deputy governor wants to find a witch, so he finds a witch, regardless of the utter stupidity of the charges and the facts. A government with the power to eviscerate its enemies in such a way needs to be brought to heel, and as we read in the epilogue to the story, the people of Massachusetts do just that.I highly recommend this play for High School kids. They need to understand that power and truth are not always aligned."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The book itself was in good condition and just a little worn on the spine;nothing really to be concerned about.

It starts off when one character begins hysteria all throughout the town by accusing others for different objections. Mr. Hale was brought into the town to find who is causing all of this. When Abigail would never confess, other characters began to pay punishment such as being hung, stoned to death and many more ways for doing nothing wrong. After reading the story, I enjoyed it a lot due to the suspense that was being created and how the ending turned out. When the movie came out for this story, it helped clear any confusion for the story because it showed a visual on how the town was being destroyed by witchcraft. I recommend this story to anyone because even though you may not enjoy old stories, this one will always want to make you keep reading."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's classic play based on the Salem Witch trials of 1692 demonstrates superstition, hysteria, and control. After being discovered dancing in the woods (strictly forbidden) one girl refuses to wake, and suspicions arise. Under pressure, the girls soon confess to communing with the devil. Young Abigail Williams senses her power as lead confessor, and milks the opportunity. Soon many stand accused, special judges arrive from Boston, and the town is quick to condemn. Hysteria reigns, and none are safe from its blows. The gallows await the imprisoned, thought they may win a reduced sentence by confessing their guilt. A couple skeptics led by John Proctor speak up, but the tables turn and they soon find themselves shackeled. Those that grimace at the willingness of the judges to trust superstition and obvious frauds should consider the power dynamics of a fundamentalist, church-ruled society. Those that understand the hysteria of McCarthyism in the early 1950's should see clear parallels from this moving demonstration. This play is well worth your time, as is the stirring 1996 film with Winona Ryder and Daniel Day Lewis."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"While this version is a fine audio production, it is labeled incorrectly as the unabridged version.

It is a historical reminder (and a warning) that people died because of hysterical fanaticism in an authoritarian culture. Miller takes this important lesson in history, adds words to the historic figures, and makes a darn good fictional drama depicting their roles in this historic event. The action inside the court room is beautifully constructed and explores the idea of injustices being perpetuated in a sanctuary designed to create justice.Miller does a great job creating scenes that evoke outrage and indignation while keeping the characters real and human. John Procter is not be looked upon as the \\"hero\\" or \\"victim\\" because of his past indiscretions and ignorance, just as Abigail Williams is not to be looked upon as the \\"villain\\" because her actions are perpetuated by a persecuted youth who is suddenly granted power by the courts. The characters are an interesting mix of people caught-up in a blizzard of conditions that were just right to give innuendos truth and superstitions law.I found the play very enjoyable and entertaining even without all the parallels to what was happening in the 1950's when it was written."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I have recently read 'The Crucible' by Arthur Miller. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it to everyone. This was a moving and rather depressing story of the Salem witch trials but I loved it. Abigail is a young girl who, with other girls in the town, claims to be tortured by spectors (spirits) in the village of Salem, but really just makes these accusations up. But these aren't just friendly accusattions. If you are accused of being a witch you can confess and \\"come back to God\\" and be fogiven, or you can deny the accusation all together and be hanged.This is an intense story of love, courage, and tragedy and how the peculiar town of Salem reacts to all of these.If you can handle this great tear-jerker, then I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"McCarthy's Red Scare as opposed to the Salem Witch Trials. Arthur Miller's The Crucible takes an interesting as he takes a historiccal tragedy and compares it to one of the hot botton issues of his time during the 1950s. As Miller describes the chaos and ignorance during the late 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts, Miller also successfully compares the mania of a Puritan-dominated era to a supposedly more progressive era of the 1950s, a time where the Red Scare was at its height. His brilliant commentary in between the scenes of the Salem Witch Trial remind the reader how our fears of the unknown time and time again result in our own ignorance and weakness as a society. It's fascinating how the language of these two time period are so different, old english vs. contemporary, yet these tragedies are joined by one main thing. The ignorance, fear, and hatred manipulated into both societies is what threatens their own foundations. Miller's style and organization of the plot is intriguing as it makes events that occured during the Salem Witch Trials parallel with what went on during the Red Scare. This is an effective political drama that urges the reader to step away from fear and focus on understanding."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"A quick read considering it being a play, the Crucible offers some insight into the victims and those involved in the Salem Witch Trials.Since it was a play, Miller's style did not amaze me in anyway, but i enjoyed the play aspect in this case, since it was something different from the typical read. Instead of the common vivid descriptions or the over the head type of figurative language, Miller uses subtle detail to create the same effect, it is hard to explain just how, but each minor detail seems to add so much to the picture projected in my mind, and it really seemed as if a play was held before me.I could see everything--the fear in the people's eyes, the tension between every conversation. There may not have been a lot of words, but I felt that even the single \\"no.. no.. \\" told a lot.Most shocking was the inhumane--yet ironically humanly--moral depictions of the characters. I was surprised with their extremely careful eye for reputation and name--to the point of setting up innocent friends and family to the sacrificial alter to calm the fearing people. So much for honestly, so much for loyalty. The people were monsters when it came to saving themselves at the cost of anybody. Though disgusted as I was with these characters, I was more a little shaken myself. Looking now to the type of society around me, I could envision another enactment of the witch trials. Yes, it was inhumane; yes, it could have been avoided. BUT, I find that many of the characters' flawed traits still exist in today's society. We see people hiding secrets, hurting others, telling lies, to save their own name. We see people dressing up with hope of impressing--or sometimes, deceiving--others. Society today still has its hand tightly gripped on reputation, and it doesn't seem as if it is letting go soon.Rather than the typical history lesson, The Crucible is a drama that tells a lot. Love triangles, back stabbing, and affairs flood the story, and characters with every aspect revealed hold it up. The Crucible was meant to depict the mind settings and the circumstances of the people involved in the Salem Witch Trials--and it did just that."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The play's main narrative line tells the story of the Salem witch hunts which took place in Massachusetts, 1692. At a deeper level, Miller raises several powerful and important questions about human life and morality. But the play's most amazing quality is that it is not \\"deep\\" or \\"philosophical\\" by traditional standards. Miller has, in a short and easy-to-read manuscript, opened the door (or maybe I should say he presents the reader with a mirror) to modern political life.The play is essentially a crtique of McCarthyism and the the communist scare of the 1950s. Miller saw the parallels between the witch hunts and the McCarthy trials, and found the witch trials to be a compelling vehicle for discussing modern events. Key themes include:1. People gaining absolution from the powers-that-be by confessing the sins of others.2. The power of community rituals, such as confession.3. The role of political opposition and the consequences of compliance (passive or active).4. The consequences of a polarized world views and mass hysteria.These are just a few of the themes. The play is quite clearly a great tragedy, but remains a tragedy for our times. Through characters we can connect with, Miller convincingly shows us that the lessons from the witch hunts still apply. As a reader, I am convinced that Miller's play remains relevant and powerful in the twenty-first century. Miller has left me with questions, regarding world events in 2002 and 2003, that I did not have before reading the play.I read this play in only a couple hours. It is compelling, engaging, and difficult to put down. Personally, I feel this text stands a great chance of making it onto my \\"top ten\\" list of best manuscripts. I highly recommend this play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"As usual, Arthur Miller was in rare form when he wrote \\"The Crucilble.\\" Although on the surface it is about the Salem Witch Trials, Miller's true inspiration came from the Red Scare that plagued Hollywood in the middle of the twentieth century (and included his pal Elia Kazan). The fact that Miller wove factual history with the hysteria of his day makes \\"The Crucible\\" all the more chilling.Throughout the course of the play, a collection of teenage girls 'confess' to having seen various women and men of the town of Salem with the devil. This hysteria sweeps over the town as even the authorities fall under the sway of these lying young girls. Caught in the middle of these hysteronics is the Proctor family - John and Elizabeth, who have struggled in the past, but are trying to rebuild their marriage. They are rent apart when Elizabeth is suspected of being a witch. John hopes to clear his wife's name, but only manages to make matters worse for both of them.The hysteria experienced in Salem is chilling in the fact that these sorts of witch hunts occur today, in all different areas of society. \\"The Crucible\\" shows how easily people can be swayed, with the barest of evidence, to believe something that is false. Miller's play is extremely well-written and informative, and almost too frighteningly real."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Using the historical and controversial subject of the Salen Witch Trials, Arthur Miller's play The Crucible presents an allegory for events in contemporary America. Miller's play employs these historical events to criticize the moments in humankind's history when reason and fact became clouded by irrational fears and the desire to place blame for society's problems on others. The play deals with the corrupted town of Salem, Massachusettes, in 1692. John proctor, a blunt, out-spoken farmer and the play's central character, gets caught up in a conspiracy not even his own stength can control when his ex-lover, Abigail, throws false accusations in his wife's direction. As Proctor tries to free his wife and prove all others also accused of withcraft innocent, he finds himself being accused as well. This play is a story of vengeance; one man stands in a tug-of-war battle between God and Satan, pride and damnation, and good and evil. It all leads up to a climactic ending in which one lost soul finds peace with himself and realizes the importance of one's integrity."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I used this recording this year while teaching &quot;The Crucible&quot;. My students loved it!! The emotion conveyed by the cast is SO much better than the typical monotone voice that students use while reading out loud. Even though there were some small parts that are skipped when following along with our textbook, it was completely worth it (and the parts skipped were very small - it was very easy to read it aloud if necessary)."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play is truly and epic for recent times. The language used by Miller for his characters are intelligent and eloquent, but not to such an extent as to make for difficult reading (like Shakespeare for instance). Miller's Crucible is largely based on the Salem Witch Trials and contains more than a few actual quotes for his characters that came from transcripts of the real trials. The plot is so very clever with many layers and themes and subplots running throughout. There is the obvious top layer that almost anyone can understand about the horror of the witchhunt, and then there is a more subtle layer about the inner nature of humans... sometimes it can be quite dark (like Abigail, the girl who really leads the accusations) or cowardly (like Parris, whose only real drive seems to be saving his own skin and reputation) and yet there are others that are good (John Proctor, who takes on almost like a Christ figure) and righteous (like Rebecca Nurse who is practical and strong willed through the whole ordeal). The writing is brilliant and it is easy to become thoroughly entrenched in the horror that life in Salem in 1692 came to be. There are many tense moments, and many agonizing situations, and I was quite swept up with the futileness and frustration that many of the accusees more than likely felt. This play is brilliant, and was written in response to the McCarthy horror that swept the 1950's, and serves as a disturbing warning that the intolerance and hysteria of the Salem Witch Trials has happened before, and can happen again."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"While Arthur Miller was more likely known for his most popular play DEATH OF A SALESMAN, which won the Pulitzer Prize as the best play in 1949, THE CRUCIBLE is regarded by many critics to be a much more superior work.THE CRUCIBLE was written in response to the ridiculous charges made by Senator McCarthy, who accused the Democratic administration of harboring and supporting Communists in the United States Government. Miller wrote the play in 1953, at the same time America was involved in a formidable struggle with the former Soviet Union. America in general had this secret and unexpressed xenophobia of this social-communist power.Miller had used the famous McCarthy saying in the play - the senator oftained maintained that those who opposed his hearing were Communists, and consequently, any public official who offered criticism, questions, or doubts of the hearings soon found himself defending himself against the charge of being a part of the Communicst conspiracy.In THE CRUCIBLE, we also found struggle and conflict between the Salem people and the Authority. At a more personal, narrower level, this conflict exists between John Proctor vs. Reverend Parris. John Proctor was a local member of the church who had opposed and challenged many of Parris' unnecessary expenditures. Like those who dared the power of the government and questioned authority of hearings back in 1950s here in America, anyone who opposed the authority of the Salem judges was automatically suspected of trying to undermine the court in the 17th century.Besides McCarthyism at the time when the play was written, THE CRUCIBLE reflected so much the concepts of Puritanism back in the 17th century. The unusual nature of the Puritan religion led to all kinds of and different levels of fear of witches and persecution. Puritans, like the authority in THE CRUCIBLE, deeply felt that their way of life was absolutely right and all other ways were wrong. Therefore, Puritans believed that government should be totally controlled by the church.THE CRUCIBLE is an authentic examination of the Puritan Age of America. It was written at the time when McCarthyism outburtsed and people lived in hysteria. It served to parallel the Salem Witch0hunt which brought about fear and persecution some 300 years ago. Interesting play. Fun to read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Like many others, Elia Kazan flirted with the American Communist party in the 1930s; again like many others he was soon disgusted by the vicious totalitarianism of the Soviet Union and left the party. In the 1940s Kazan emerged as a major director, creating such films as GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT for the screen and staging playwright Arthur Miller's landmark dramas ALL MY SONS and DEATH OF A SALESMAN--but in the early 1950s his former affiliation with the American Communist Party came back to haunt him the form of the House Unamerican Activities Committee.In the wake of World War II the American goverment began to fear that Soviet agents had infiltrated the country and were working for the overthow of American democracy. The film industry became a hotspot of investigation, with conservatives claiming that motion pictures were being used to popularize communist thought. Unfortunately, the House Unamerican Activities Committee was less interested in getting to the truth of the matter than in maintaining political power: American citizens were hauled before the committee; attacked, often for no reason; and found their careers and lives destroyed as a result. But there was a way around this. If you confessed you had been a communist (whether you had been or not), if you recanted your former beliefs (whether you had held them or not), and if you named names of others involved in the party (whether they had been or not)--you could survive. And when Kazan was called before the committee in 1952 that is precisely what he did.Arthur Miller was so outraged by Kazan's behavior that he terminated both their longstanding friendship and highly successful working relationship; although they would eventually resume a working relationship, they had no contact for more than a decade. He also wrote a play about the situation: THE CRUCIBLE.On the surface, THE CRUCIBLE is a retelling of the infamous Salem witch trials of 1692. The power-hungry Rev. Parrish has met with resistance in the town, and when his daughter Betty, his ward Abigail, and several other teenage girls are found dancing in the wood the community fears the worst: witchcraft. In order to protect himself, Parrish calls in Rev. Hale, an expert in such matters. In order to protect themselves, the girls confess--and then begin to name names of \\"other witches.\\" In order to placate the court, those named must name others in turn, and the lies and hysteria turn into a cycle of power-grabs and revenge.Among those named as a witch is Elizabeth Proctor, wife of John Proctor--a man who had a sordid affair with Abigail, who now sees the opportunity to get rid of Elizabeth via hanging and force Proctor into marriage. In an effort to protect his wife, Proctor goes before the court and denounces Abigail, but Abigail now turns on him as well, accusing him of being a witch. He is arrested and sentenced to hang. Rev. Hale, now aware of the fraud involved, begs Proctor to confess, even though the confession will be a lie. Proctor refuses and pays for his integrity with his life.In broad historical outline, Miller's tale of the witch trials is quite accurate; he does, however, take considerable license with individual characters and relationships. Whatever the case, the result is a uniquely powerful play, not only as a story pure and simple but on a deeper level in its warning against the communist witch hunt of the 1950s--and any similar witch hunt, regardless of nature, which relies on a process created by those with ulterior motives and uses as evidence testimony extracted by fear of reprecussion. While most consider DEATH OF A SALESMAN Miller's finest play, I have always given that title to THE CRUCIBLE; unlike SALESMAN, which has a dated quality, THE CRUCIBLE has a timeless quality, remarkable in intensity, thought-provoking in subtext in ways which most plays are not. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"For dramatic tension, for a resounding lesson in the ethical treatment of others, this four-act play excels. Set in the 1692 Salem witch trial debacle--a black eye in our heritage--Miller wrote the play parallel to the McCarthy hearings. America in the 1950's was then in the classic, titan struggle against a new threat: Communism.But in 1692, 19 people were executed for the crimes of witchcraft and associating in the black arts. Miller takes this historical arena, stirs in a failed love tryst, and the dramatic tension never lets up.The play is worth studying for several reasons: First, it has a strident moral tone that is extremely important for students to explore. Justice is not always a given in our society, and in the execution of justice, if we lose our sanity, we can err into several pitfalls of bad logic, or fallacies--the fallacies of Bandwagon, Hasty Generalization, False Cause, Two Wrongs Make a Right, and so on. Second, it teaches us our own history, with scars. Third, through Miller's deft use of language, we watch (read) a classicly structured play develop."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This story made my jaw drop to the ground...several times! What a frightening play! The message is timeless. Although it was written during the McCarthy era, it is appropriate for even these days...given the state of foreign policy in our country, and the popularity of Jerry Springer shows for example, where mob rules.I was horrified at the ignorance, the hipocracy, the will for personal vengeance that the characters displayed. It's a perfect example of how we as people do NOT learn from our mistakes, and that as a society, events like the salem witch trials continually repeat themselves in many forms, exposing how hell-bent we are to destroy each other!I've never seen this performed onscreen nor onstage but now I can't wait until the opportunity arises, because I'm sure that when The Crucible is performed, it will be utterly powerful. I hope that theaters will continue to produce this play forever, because no one should forget the irreparable damage that fear and ignorance can cause."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This was supposed to be an unabridged version. It is not. Thus, the audio is not helpful when trying to use it while reading the play -- there is nothing like missing whole sections of the play while trying to find where the cast has skipped to next. Also, the way that the characters are interpreted make the Puritans out to be cartoonish. Perhaps, that is the way that some view the Puritans (or other highly religious people), however, when combined with some of Miller's lines (which can at times come across like a bad church play), the characters lack genuineness. As someone with a theater background, I kept on wondering what Abigail's character would be liked if played straight.

This story starts out simply enough, in the village pastor's house. His daughter has been odd lately and doctors and such have come to see if they can help the girl with her problems. They soon realize they are dealing with something far more evil then any disease. I personally hate reading unless I have to, but this book had a certain something to it that pulled me right in. Perhaps it was the relationship you develop out of sympathy for the townsmen and their women. Maybe it's curiosity of who will be accused of witchcraft next. Whatever the case, I simply couldn't put down that book. The Crucible is a play and is written in the format of a play. This can pose a problem to someone who doesn't read a lot of literature, or is confused easily. In the beginning of the story the characters run in and out of the scenes so quickly and with little more then mentioning their name. So some might completely forget who entire families are until they are brought back to you later on in the story. Either that or you'll have to go back and read everything again just to make yourself sure you know who they are. I did. Other than the difficulty I experienced following who was who in the beginning. I found myself trapped in this book, and had to find out what happened in the ending. This book is very difficult to read, but if you can make it through the first couple of chapters, this will be one of your favorite books. It is very well written and definitely worth checking out even if you are only moderately interested in these kinds of books.

Several people were accused of making compact with the devil and for committing witchcraft, a capital crime in those days. The reason for the mass hysteria was the fact that some of the girls in the village practised dancing in the woods with the Negro-slave of the town's minister who saw them doing that. They danced around a burning fire and drank blood. Two of the girls fell ill and in fear of the consequences the other ones accused each other. A major character in that context was Abigail Williams. She also accused the wife of John Proctor, a farmer, who she had had sexual interferences with. Several other people were accused and in the end, 19 were hanged.The movie is about mass hysteria and the unscrupulous behaviour of people who get in trouble.In my view the movie on \\"The Crucible\\" is very good. The producers knew how to create tension very well. The best part in the movie was - from my point of view - the scene when Elizabeth Proctor was led to court to tell Governor the truth about her husband committing the crime of adultery.

The whole Proctor/Abigail thing is intriguing, and Giles Corey just has to be paid attention to, because he's funny (&quot;I say a fart on Thomas Putnam!&quot;).

It all leads up to a climactic ending in which one lost soul finds peace with himself and realizes the importance of one's integrity."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The story shows an hysterical witch hunt in the United States of 1692. I think it's a very fascinating play which is also able to show the witch hunt very well. It shows that people searched somebody who had to be the reason (the scapegoat) for everything they couldn't explain with their knowledge. Another very paradoxical thing for me is that being afflicted was a reason that another one was a witch. It is also very strange that children could say anybody is a witch and then the one was a also a witch even when children hadn't much to say in this time. I would recommend to read the play to anybody who is a little bit interested in history, it's a very good experience."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This book was great!

He really realted the two things good!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Daughter needed it for a project for an accelerated class. It came in time and she was able to complete her assignments with a new book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is a great book. Since it is a play, the book is relatively short. I believe that most readers can finish this book peacefully in an afternoon. The plot revolves around the historic events of the Salem Witch Hunt and how one person can start it all. This character, by the name of Abigail, is fiery and very cruel. The way she treats the people around her is astounding and reprimandable. I spent most of the time, trying to express my anger over her actions to John Proctor. The historic base of this novel provides a sense of interest to readers and the plot is quite rudimentary but exciting. It is exciting because of the hysteria and complicated values that run through this play. Though I am instructed not to spoil...I will not discuss the plot but rather the tone of the play in question. Because it is a play, the voice is perhaps unique to every individual reader. You have to read out the lines to live out the plot and characters. Overall, this book astounded me because it provided a ficticious swing over history and really sparked my anger over Abigail. Arthur Miller does a fantastic job doing this.This was written to honestly give my opinions over this play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I think that this book was actually really good. By reading this, you learn a whole lot about the 17th century and the Salem Witch Trials. You can really tell how much effort and research was put into the writing of this book. Arthur Miller did a stupendous job. In the beginning of the book they have a whole lot of information about Puritans settlers in the area of Salem Massachusetts. All this information really made you think about all the differences between now and back then.This play was very entertaining also; you never really could guess what was going to happen next. There is a bunch of detail so you can really picture what everything looked like and how everyone acted whenever they found out something new that the girls did. There seems to be a very good conflict in the story between the protagonist (John Proctor) and the Antagonist (Proctor facing his own weaknesses) I also like how they broke up each scene. They transferred from scene to scene very well developed also. There are so many great dialogues in this play. Many of them occurred with John Proctor. In the first scene, you can tell how much Reverend Parris cared about his daughter Betty Paris and his niece Abigail Williams.The outcome of the play is very great. The actors stand up for what they think is right; this book really teaches a great lesson. I highly recommend this book it is a truly great dramatic play."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This book is typically easy to read however the first act is a little har to get though because of the format. the author will stop every once in a while to talk about the history of the town or the charcters backround. Once you get to the second act the book begins to pick up and get a lot better. i am in high school and had to read this for a summer reading assignment. Once u get to the second act the author is past the exposition of the plot and it is easier to understand what is going on."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Showing affliction in almost every character, this play shows you the consequences that many people faced for their beliefs. The Crucible was a very well written play. Arthur Miller chose an excellent topic to write about. Learning about the Salem witch trials and the ways of that time period was interesting and very informative. While getting boring at times with the same scene, I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I love Arthur Miller and this was a great play..I recommend. If you were not one who was required to read it in High School, then you are missing out."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"For our fall play at school, they did &quot;The Crucible.&quot; When I reviewed it for the school newspaper I actually had to use a thesaurus to think of more positive words. So maybe it's not historically accurate, but it sure can spark one's interest in the Salem incidents in 1692. The whole Proctor/Abigail thing is intriguing, and Giles Corey just has to be paid attention to, because he's funny (&quot;I say a fart on Thomas Putnam!&quot;). The courtroom scene has to be spoken for. In order to get the full effect, you really need to see it (the screaming, the anger, the rage!). All the same, though, it's a pleasant reading experience."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This as one of the better things I have read for school. It kept my interest. It went pretty fast, also. I tend to like things with drama in them. This play was full of drama. The book cleared up a lot of things for me, actually. I had always wanted to learn more about the Salem Witch Trials, but I never had time to. It also gave you some background information on how things were when America first started to develop. How similiar it is to today, but also how much differant it is. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning about history in a non-history teaching way."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"THE CRUCIBLE is a book on witch trail during 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts. This book talks about the Puritan community at that time and how people belived in Witches. Proctor fights against himself and Abigail and Elizabeth. Paris fights against his daughter and his neice. All the villagers are wondering whats going on. To find out about this READ the BOOK. I would recommend this book to who is around 14 or older, even the movie."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"An obvious metaphorical look at the McCarthyist 1950s, this play is stark and no fun. I think this is one of the best retellings of what happened in Salem. Students should read this, but need a good history lesson before hand."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is the first Arthur Miller play I've read. The plot summary and reviews I read made it seem appealing, suspenseful if nothing else. But no matter how great something is, it is nearly impossible to convey those feelings in the form of an Amazon review.It's easy for me to admit that after reading the introduction I was turned off by the language, not esoteric enough to be genuine 17th century english and not terse enough to be mid 50's language, the intro exists in a world in between the two describing the key characters in the play and the setting which it is taking place. Having decent knowledge of the Salem Witch Trials and how Miller correlated the tragedy to his experience with McCartheyism during \\"the red scare.\\" Miller's details are so personal that it almost seems like this is a first hand account of the trials. The play evolves under perfect dynamics the exposition is descriptive but not boring, the main conflict had me at the edge of my seat grimacing in Proctor's pain and burning with hatred at the injustices being executed. Finally the climax brings arrays of the human emotional spectrum into a pleasing and redeeming conclusion.Overall this is the best American Play I have read, although my knowledge of American playwrights is limited I would venture to say that Arthur Miller is a genius and that this play is one of the crowning achievements of American Drama."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The CrucibleA witch hunt is what they wanted and a witch hunt is what they got. The small town of Salem is devastated to find out that its own young and seemingly innocent maids, daughters, and even wives are Satan possessed witches.This story starts out simply enough, in the village pastor's house. His daughter has been odd lately and doctors and ministers have come from far and wide to help the young girl and others suffering from similar symptoms in the town. They will quickly find out that they are dealing with something far more potent than the flu.I don't usually enjoy reading, but this book had a certain something to it that pulled me right in. Perhaps it was the relationship you develop out of sympathy for Mr. Proctor and his wife. Maybe it's just the curiosity of who will be accused of witch craft next. One would have to read the book for them to find out. The Crucible is a play and is written in the format of a play. This can pose a problem to someone who spaces out or confuses easily. In the beginning of the story the characters run in and out of the scenes so quickly and with such little description that its easy to get lost or completely forget who entire families are until they are completely re-presented to you in later events. Either that or you'll have to go back and re-read everything that confused you.Other than the mild difficulty I experienced following who was who in the beginning, I found some very interesting quotes and poetic phrases in this book. It is very well written and definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This is a wonderful play that is timeless even if it was originally intended as an indictment of the Mc Carthy era witchhunts. The action centers around the character of John Proctor who is forced to choose between saving his wife from false accusations and saving his own reputation. The dramatic tension is palpable as the story progresses from the introduction of the various characters and their backgrounds and motivations to the climactic courtroom scenes. The play is destined to survive because it explores essential truths about human nature including the willingness of people to accuse their neighbors and follow mass hysteria and these are timeless themes."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"In 1692, in Salem, Massachusetts was a major conflict between government leaders and citizens arouse. Witchcraft was what everybody began to fear. They (the towns people) all believed witches surrounded them. It all started when a girl named Abigail Williams and a bunch of her friends were discovered in the woods dancing. When Reverend Parris came upon them they were dancing around a kettle of soup, singing song of a different tongue. All of a sudden the next day two of the girls are acting strange. One of them is stricken to bed and is almost in a coma state. The other girl constantly paces and will not eat. This is when the parents demand to know what was going on that night. All of the girls that took part in the activity clamed that they were just dancing, until one of the girls slips and lets out what really happened. They were in the woods and Tituba (Reverend Parris slave) was leading songs in the Barbados language while trying to conjure the sprit of one of the girl's dead sister. This is where the real conflict begins. One of the girls (Reverend Parris's Daughter) was the girl that was bed stricken. It is not socially sound for the daughter of the reverend to be conjuring up sprits. If the daughter had really been conjuring up sprits the Reverend would be pushed out of town. How could he run the church if he can't even control his daughter? This is when the conspiracy begins.In order to avoid punishment Abigail tells the elected judge that she once sided with the Devil but is now back on Gods side. She would like to tell the town folk the names of the other people that still have a pact with the Devil. If a person is tried for making a pact with the Devil (witchcraft) they would be hung and their belongings would be auctioned off. Not only did Abigail and her friends list some name of people that made a pact with the Devil, they listed most of the Town. This is when the judge start to have trial, but these were not normal criminal trials, these were witchcraft trials. There was no one to defend the accused it was just the girls word against the accused. People seemed to care but not too much until one very important day. The day when John Procter's Wife, Elizabeth, name came up in court. This infuriated John because he knew exactly why his wife name came up in court. Abigail made up a story about Elizabeth because she had once kicked her out of the Procter house. When Elizabeth had gotten sick (after childbirth) Abigail helped John run things around the house. This is until things turned sexual and Elizabeth found out. Knowing why Abigail brought up Elizabeth's name made John furious. This is the point in the story where the action really heats up. But you will have to read to see exactly how hot it gets."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Yes, here is yet another poor student who was forced to read this and similar writings on the Puritans! To my pleasant surprise, however, I found &quot;The Crucible&quot; to be better than I had first expected - this probably has to do partly with the fact that the story is rather short, but also with the fact that the story is rather interesting as well. Written in the form of a play by the thought-to-be-communist Arthur Millar, &quot;The Crucible&quot; can really bring you into the story if you let it. The main subject behind this book is the hypocrisy of the Puritan civilization, dealing mainly with the witch trials and burnings in Salem during the late 17th century in early America. The story is crafted around actual fact and history texts, but some of the characters and scenes Miller describes are fictitious, naturally. Even though the fiction element is strong, the book also carries a level of realism to it that takes you back to those horrible times in 1692 quite well.While I don't really like the reasons Miller wrote the book (to somehow prove he was innocent of ties with communists....what does that mean?), the book was still interesting and provocative. Students out there, stick with it - the book isn't that bad, it's short, to the point, and actually can have your complete attention at times."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is very touching in places as Abigail strives and does everything in her grasp to get Proctor for herself, and ends up going too far. I am only 15 and yet I know a good book when I read one and this is a good book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Though the pace is slow, Miller manages to create a luring work of social commentary. Sadly, his anti-McCarthyist message seems to have been lost amidst the historical aspects of the work . . . Far too many people tend to concentrate on its Puritan aspects, ignoring the general comment it makes: We are far too easily led."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I am only 15 years old and am in a 11th grade Honors English class. We recently read the book and watched the movie afterwards. It really moved me and gave me an inspiration towards life. It is a must read and see. Arthur Miller portrays this story almost exactly relevant to the actual time period, only a few facts are absent. Thank you"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"At first I read this play because it's on the recommended reading list of English Honor, but dain this is good stuff. I hate it that most of the other high schoolers are gonna miss this great piece of work. Since then I read almost all of Miller's plays and they are all good if not fantastic. Miller brings humanity and morality to literature, and makes it interesting and exciting at the same time. I guess that's why he's great."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I enjoyed The Crucible, it was interesting, the charcters were so taken for the times, 1692. The book takes you to that time but the play could be of our times which shows how information , wrong made up lies can cause problems within a society, a family and the world. I also read it because my grandson had to read it for tenth grade summer reading assignment. It was fun to discuss the book with him."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"It is perhaps unfortunate that \\"The Crucible\\" has become so closely associated with McCarthyism. It was, of course, the playwright's deliberate intention to use the Salem witch trials in order to attack McCarthy, and he succeeded in his intention to such an extent that it is today difficult for any historian to write about the proceedings of the House Un-American Activities Committee without using the phrase \\"witch hunt\\". Whether this has done the play's long-term reputation any good is another matter. McCarthyism may have been a burning issue in the fifties, but today, at least to anyone under the age of seventy, the HUAC seems nearly as remote in time as the witch trials themselves.Moreover, the parallels that Miller draws between Salem and McCarthyism are not, in my opinion, persuasive. Fear of Communism in the nineteen-fifties was not the equivalent of the fear of witches in the sixteen-nineties. Miller is never able to argue convincingly against the objection that the danger which the people of Salem feared- malevolent witches armed by the Devil with supernatural powers - was wholly illusory, whereas the danger from the hostile Stalinist dictatorship which confronted America in the Cold War was real. It is no answer to state that people (or at least some people) in the seventeenth century believed in witches; the fact remains that we today do not and that our view of the events at Salem is inevitably coloured by our disbelief. (If we did still believe in witches today, we would view those events in a very different light). The central moral question raised by McCarthyism was \\"How should a modern democracy protect itself against the adherents of anti-democratic totalitarian philosophies?\\" By setting his play in America's remote past, Miller avoids answering this question. Senator McCarthy was open to criticism on the grounds that his measures were not only unconstitutional (given that the Communist Party was never an illegal organisation) but also actually destructive of the very freedoms which they were ostensibly aimed at protecting. To criticise him, however, on the grounds of a fanciful comparison with the superstitions of the seventeenth century seems perverse.Why, then, given that I disagree fundamentally with the author's political position, have I awarded this play five stars? The reason is that it has become a play that has taken on a life of its own, independent of the political concerns that prompted it. We do not today worry ourselves greatly that Shakespeare's \\"Richard III\\" was originally written to demonstrate the legitimacy of the Tudor dynasty to which his patron Elizabeth I belonged, or that his \\"Macbeth\\" was written to ingratiate himself with her successor James I. We read those plays because they are two of the greatest tragedies in the English language. Similarly, we can read and enjoy \\"The Crucible\\" even if we disagree with Miller about McCarthyism, or even if we have never heard of McCarthy, because it is one of the greatest tragedies written in English in the twentieth century.The modern play which comes closest in theme to \\"The Crucible\\" is, in my view, Robert Bolt's \\"A Man for All Seasons\\", another play inspired by real historical events and which has as its hero a man who would rather forfeit his life than tell a lie. Bolt's Thomas More, however, is a somewhat idealised figure, whereas Miller's hero, John Proctor, is a classic flawed tragic hero, a man who becomes involved in the tragedy because of his human frailties. Proctor, a prosperous farmer, has been unfaithful to his wife Elizabeth with their maidservant, Abigail Williams, but has repented of his adulterous affair and, at his wife's request, has dismissed Abigail from his service.These events come back to haunt him. As the play begins, Abigail is the leading figure in a group girls and young women who begin to accuse their neighbours of witchcraft and who, in the prevailing climate of superstitious Puritanism, are readily believed by the authorities. Abigail, still obsessively in love with Proctor and consumed with hatred for his wife, accuses Elizabeth Proctor, who is arrested. Proctor's attempt to prove his wife's innocence backfires, and he is himself accused and sentenced to death. He is told that his life will be spared if he confesses; he therefore faces the dilemma of whether he should save his life by confessing to a crime he did not commit, or whether he should continue to maintain his innocence, which means that he will be hanged. Besides Proctor, there are a number of other memorable characters, such as the spiteful, hysterical and vindictive Abigail and Rebecca Nurse, an old woman in her seventies who maintains her dignity despite the absurd charges that are brought against her.Paradoxically, the factors which make the play a failure as a political allegory are the ones that make it a success when seen as a human drama. Miller could, had he wished, have written a play which dealt with McCarthyism directly, just as Charlie Chaplin did in his film \\"A King in New York\\", but there would have been a risk that such a play would quickly have become dated. (Chaplin's film is all but unwatchable today). By setting his play in the past, and by concentrating on the human aspects of the Salem witch-trials, Miller has produced a timeless work which still speaks to us today, not as a satire on a long-dead American politician, but as a play about injustice and the struggle against it, and as a study of a man fighting to retain his integrity in a world gone mad."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's play, &quot;The Crucible&quot; gives a true insight to the time of hysteria during the Salem Witch Trials. Reading the book, I thought the Puritans could do no wrong, commit no sin, or speak slander about each other; but then I realized these people were human and made mistakes. I have never read a work of literature in which human nature during hysteria is so well portrayed. Abigal was one character whom I despised because she is the kniving, cold-hearted, wicked vixen guys hate to love and love to hate. I did enjoy the books social message because the entire Salem scenario repeated itself during the 1950s, when Sen. Joseph McCarthy led teh nation on a Communist witch hunt."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"THE CRUCIBLE is a classic. That's probably the best thing you can say for any play or book. It's survived through the years and remained popular and widely read. Material from it is used in acting classes and workshops. (I know - I did a monologue from it!) The characters are absolutely marvelous. They all have strong motives and reasons for what they are doing - even Abigail. Every minute of the play keeps you engrossed, for even though you know what must happen in the end, you see so many ways out of it, and keep hoping that the characters will, too. But they're all caught in a trap, and there's no getting out once they're all in. A must-read for any student, but ESPECIALLY acting students, and also aspiring playwrights. (I'm in eighth grade and loved it, so try it! It may not be Animorphs, but variety is the spice of life.)"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play by Arthur Miller is definitely worth reading, partly because of its engaging storyline and also for its succinctness. This play can pretty much be a model for what play should really be like. It has complex characters that at times both amuse and scare us, a straightforward storyline that is not without it's twists and turns, and most importantly, a fascinating topic that is in relation to historical context.The plot revolves around the historic Salem Witch Hunt in Salem, Massachusets. A young woman named Abigail is among the others who are accused to performing witchcraft and for enthralling ordinary civilians. When they are finally proven guilty, they stand before court, but not before Abigail gains power in the justice and randomly convicts innocent women to be the \\"real\\" witches. The hyseria and corruption surrounding the court and Salem society as a whole will never be the same, as the innocent are convincted while the guilty are let go. Although fiction, this play does relate immensely to historical times, in which women indeed were sentenced to death during the trials for no reason and were never proven guilty. The story is written with eloquence and wit, with the occasional tad bit of humor and irony in the mix. The best part? The language is easy to understand, for us mere mortals at least."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible is overall a very good book. It is the heritage and back round of the puritans, which creates the storyline of this book. The Story is an interesting tale of the events and strange happenings surrounding the Salem witch trails in 1692.It begins with the discovery of some of the young ladies of Salem dancing at night in the woods. There is immediate talk of witchcraft around the town. I enjoyed the way that the book begins. It is not slow, the plot and storyline is introduced right away. It does not drag on like many novels.The Crucible is a short and interesting book. That is what I like about it the most. The young girls in the book are put on trial for witchcraft along with the black slave Tituba. The mood of the book fits the story tremendously. The mood is evil and how nobody is trusted in the novel. Everyone is superstitious of one another. In the end of the novel the triumph of good over evil is evident, this is what keeps the reader reading. Throughout the novel you cannot tell who is going to triumph in the end. It is a to the reader at the end when Protector sacrifices his own life for the good of the town and for what he feels is righteous.The ending is very fitting and it shows how a town can be haunted by wrongdoing and spilt apart by the beliefs of their families. The Crucible is a fantastic novel that shows the troubles that small puritan community encounters in the early years of its existence."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This is a play that is based on the Salem Witch Trials, and I have heard that acutal quotes have been taken from actual trial transcripts in its writing, but I haven't delved into the actual transcripts to find out for myself as of yet. It is because of the historical nature of this play that I enjoyed reading it. Although the spoken language that is used by Miller for his characters is eloquent it may make this a difficult read for some. I didn't find it as hard to follow as the language used by Shakespeare, but there a few times that I had to re-read a line here or there.The plot is surprisingly clever and gives the reader the idea that this could very well have been how it happened. The author's ability to touch on every aspect of the experience is truly moving. The writing is brilliant and I was engulfed in the tradgedy caused by the horrors of life in Salem during this time period. There are numerous moments filled with tension, and I found myself hoping for the best for all of the wrongly accused.This is novel that points out the cruelty of human nature when survival is a person's only concern. It also points out the level of hysteria a population can reach. If a reader doesn't take those two lessons away as learned, then perhaps they will take the simpler lesson that is rarely touched upon away with them. Be kind to your neighbors as ou never know who will have the next profound effect on your like."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The drama \\"The Crucible\\", written by Arthur Miller in the 1950s in respond to the mass hysteria that evolved around Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy who spread the fear of communism among American citizens, deals with witch hangings at the end of the 17th century as a dark spot in American history.The story is short to tell: Abigail Williams, a seventeen year old servant to Elizabeth Proctor, falls in love with Elizabeth's husband, John, after he has used the long period of his wife's sickness to start a little liaison with Abigail. Thus, the girl is so passionate about John ( who is father to three kids) that she and the other girls of the little town Salem, Massachusetts, dance around a fire and spell curses on John Proctor to make him fall in love with Abigail. This creates a problem since half the people in town are strict Puritans and now start blaming others for seemingly strange events that have occurred in town. Thus, Abigail plays a key role since she could end the witchcraft rumours by stating that there are no witches in Salem that could possibly have any influence on people's fate. In the end, nineteen people were accused of witchcraft and hanged.Although the book is confusing at first, it is very interesting throughout the story. Especially the author's humour and sensibility he applies to carefully approach the topic make the book worth reading. The tightening tensions are noticeable as well, leaving the reader shocked in the end: The experience that the play is just repeating history indeed is scary."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I had to read this in high school and again recently in grad school. I am not convinced the actual writing is great, but the story and the characters are fully developed and crucial. The story is a very important one to grasp and fully understand. Depicts how real life &#34;witch hunts&#34; began and are able to reach dangerous heights when laced with irrational people, ignorance, and narrow minded outdated beliefs. Scary part is, this is still happening on smaller scales all over the world. Again, not my favorite piece of literature because I enjoy old gothic romance (Wuthering Heights etc.) but I would highly recommend as a piece of writing any reader should take in at least once. Also, it's a piece of cake to read and takes no time."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"So far hasn't been able to keep my attention.

It is a drama about The Salem, Massachusetts witch hunt in the 1692 and people were accused of doing witchcraft without any solid proof because lots of people were being killed. I've noticed that the world has seriously changed from the 1692 till today. In the present days, who would still believe in witchcraft? Almost no one talks about it. But during the 1692, people believed in witchcrafts, they even believe that their relatives are witch. Men, Women, teenagers, child, anyone, any age! If you have any certain strange action, people will assume you are a witch. For example, Abigail and the girls were dancing around the fire. Well, the village people saw it and they started accusing that Abigail and the girls are witches. If more than two people think that you are a witch than that is it, everyone will treat you as if you were a witch. I've never read a play before. And this drama really caught my attention. I was amazed by what one person will do to save his reputation and others lives."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Personally, I do not like plays at all, and I still do not; however, I do like the plot and ideas behind the Crucible. I was met with mixed feelings about this book because there are many good and bad things about this piece.The fact that this was a play does hold some significance in my not liking the Crucible. Plays require much more energy to visualize and see. I often found myself reading out loud every line trying to figure out what was happening. Also, without text, there is nothing to praise about Arthur Miller's skill in writing. Although there is a character that serves the narrator function in this piece, I like reading character actions in sentences rather than in quotation marks. The book also lacks a sense of imagery. Being a play, Miller gives a few sentences to provide a brief location or background. Descriptions are straightforward and just bland.The storyline itself is great. Arthur Miller skillfully criticizes the paranoia that results from unwarranted superstition. I just love the complexity of the plot, with people accusing each other through petty bitterness and hatred. The Crucible illustrates a society with no emotional control. I also found some of the irony humorous, chuckling at the mention of having the minister's daughter be accused a witch. I loved the poignant ending that taught me an important value of being truthful. The plot had substance, but I think that it would have been better as a novel.The Crucible will be sufficient for a quick afternoon read, but nothing more than that."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I ordered this book for my sons class, and after no response to my order from the seller, I took it upon myself to ask what was the hold up, but it was too late, my son got a very low grade because the seller neglected to inform me in a timely manner that they could not find this book.

I believe the theme Miller is trying to convey throughout this novel is hysteria. People are accusing these women of crimes for which they have no proof of their guilt. The major conflict in the book is that society is too accusatory. Everyone is guilty by association in their eyes. Miller uses metaphors throughout the novel to allow you to visualize objects better in your mind. I did not like this novel because it's characters are too suspicious and unreasonable.

A friend of mine recommended this book so I decided to read it. This book blew me away. The plot was engaging and there was never a moment when I became disinterested. The story of one girl turning a whole town against a group of wrongly accused people of practicing witchcraft blew me away. The whole time I was reading the book I was rooting for Abigail's manipulation and lies to be exposed. The one thing I liked about the characters in this book is they all had a driving purpose. It ranged from wanting the affections of a married man to trying to redeem ones self by saving a town from a group of evil women. I feel this a great educational book. It gives insight into the Salem Witch Trials and also Puritan religion. It has all of the drama and secrets of a great book while also teaching an important moral lesson. It shows how one lie can spiral out of control and have devastating consequences. After reading this book, I was interested in the characters real life stories and researched. This is one of those books that will keep you thinking after your read it about the characters, plot, and the sad ending. This book will always remain on my bookshelf for future rereadings."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I have been buying used books from Amazon.com for almost a year now.

I prefer buying books here now than in the local store especially if it is for school. Though the shipping took a bit longer than expected, everything else is good."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller created a timeless classic when he wrote The Crucible. A play composed of themes describing the courage and integrity of those who were trying to remain upright, authorities gaining too much control, hypocrisy overtaking a people, guilt for past sins, revenge that was fueled over generations, and mass hysteria that gripped the Puritan village of Salem in 1692. In addition, being published in 1953, this book reflects the McCarthy era and the Red Scare hysteria that was created from an idea that had no significant evidence. Although this play is set in a time of long ago, the overriding themes and lessons that can be taken from this novel are still relevant for people today.The small Puritan village of Salem is obsessed with the idea that there are witches residing among them. Since they are resolute about living a life lead by the Bible which states \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\" (Exodus 22:18), they are overcome with fear that witches will corrupt them. Once the young, promiscuous Abigail Williams begins condemning common people from the town for witchcraft, mass hysteria is created and more and more people are accused of this fatal sin. People are thought to be witches until proven otherwise, and even some of the town's most highly-praised citizens are condemned. John Proctor who once had an affair with Abigail, is condemned of being a witch himself and deals with conflicts within himself of guilt, fear, and even courage as he struggles against what he believes is right and what others are telling him is right. The Crucible provides countless thoughts that provoke the reader to think about society, their beliefs, and examine their own inner selves.How do people react to crucible situations today? This novel has many connections with the McCarthy Red Scare that completely ruined the trust and reputations of many innocent people in our government and society. It is a play which is easy to understand yet possesses many thought-provoking and deep ideas about how one person can make such a huge impact on so many people's lives as did Abigail Williams. Even when characters in The Crucible knew that what was occurring was wrong, they were either too late to protest or did not have enough courage to stand up for what they believed. The Crucible will benefit anyone who reads it, and encompasses many topics relevant to people today."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play is pretty historically accurate on its portrayal of the Salem witch trials, and shows how religion played a huge role in governing the people of the early british colonies in America. The characters are pretty interesting and explores human morality and the importance of a man's reputation. This was not ones of America's smartest moments and teaches us how our history was a little screwed up when religion controlled everything. The girls were pretty messed up and you sometimes wonder why they set everything up and preteneded to be witches. This play is an interesting one, but I don't think its anything that is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am glad that i finally did. THe Salem witch trials have always intrigued me and this book/play gave me an insight into them. I liked how throughout the book the author gives you details about each character and explains why they are they way they are. It is scary to think that a group of children could wreck havoc on a town with only their imagination and acting skills. I can't help but feel sorry for the victims and their families. Again this is a must read for anybody interested in the witch trials."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller writes another classic. This time, it's about a village during the Salem Witch Trials. It revolves around characters closely related to people during the McCarthy Era in the 50s. This play show what would happen if mob mentality came into power, like it did during the Salem Witch trials. Overall, this is a great play with highly developed characters, setting, and history. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's The Crucible, a play in four acts, deals with the witch-craze in Salem in the 17th century. A minister from Salem discovers a group of teenage girls dancing naked around a fire in the woods. As the girls are aware of the fact that they will have to face severe punishment for their action, they claim to have been possessed by evil spirits. This causes a major outcry in the Puritan community of Salem and a court is formed to deal with and investigate the accusations of the girls in further detail.At first, only a few people are accused of witchcraft but in the course of events over a hundred people are accused of bewitching the girls. Even people with a very good reputation who have never acted against the will of God or the community are sent to prison due to suspicion, gossip or denunciation.It is clear that in many cases the girls accused people with whom they have had problems or against whom they hold some kind of grievance. Abigail Williams accuses Elizabeth Proctor, her former employer, after having been dismissed from work by her. Abigail was the Proctors' servant but had to leave their house because Elizabeth Proctor suspected her of having an affair with her husband.Elizabeth Proctor is sent to prison but not hanged immediatley because she is pregnant. As John Proctor tries to come to the rescue of his wife, he himself runs into difficulties because he is suspecting of undermining the court.Some of the accused avoid execution by \\"confessing\\" their pact with the devil but 19 people are hanged. John Proctor refuses to confess a crime he has not committed. However, he changes his decision because of his wife and three children and decides to sign a confession in order to save his life. But he immediately regrets his decision, tears up the confession and is executed.The Crucible is a very impressive and powerful play. It illustrates the irrationality of the people which is strongly connected with their fears and superstitious beliefs. Miller manages to show that the people really believed that what they did was right and only done to protect a community of god-fearing people.By reading The Crucible you can learn to understand the point of view and the world of the accusers. You begin to understand that the actions of the Puritans are very logical in their own way. You start to understand the beliefs of the accusers and even develop a kind of sympathy for them and their fears.On the whole, The Crucible is easy to read and can also be read in one setting. The plot is easy to follow, extremely exciting and keeps you in its grip from the fist to the last line. I believe that The Crucible is hugely recommendable for everyone who is interested in understanding the witch-craze and the point of view of the accusers as well as the accused."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"A very twisted tale on the society who's life, and laws were dictated by \\"God\\". This play shows a grim and evil side of America in the 1600's, and gives us a glimps of the dark side of christianity."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"In Harris' &quot;The Crucible&quot;, we are introduced to many interesting and complex characters fit in 1692, Salem. The antagonist, Reverend Parris, is a selfish, power-hungry, father and preacher. He shows his evil ways by using his status as a respected preacher, going around accusing any person who challenges his power. Another great character is the protagonist, John Proctor. A simple, heathen, farmer, he leads the revolt against the leaders of Salem, Reverend Parris and Judge Hawthorne. He saves the day by being martyred for his determination and morals, to save the women of Salem. The farmer is not an avid churchgoer he is accused by Parris, of course, of dealing with the devil. The other minor characters are the Abigail and Goody Putnam. The conniving Abigail plays little ms. innocent who at the start is perceived as a girl who was corrupted by Tituba. However in actuality, Abigail is the leader and instigator, who has a black name in the town because of her titillating encounters with John Proctor. The characters in \\"The Crucible\\" make this social drama a great one. It displays all the great characters: the antagonist, the protagonist, and the complex characters."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"As usual I stumbled into this one almost by accident. There was a fair of used books at the language institution where I am a teacher of English, and I wound up purchasing a large number of books, and this one was one of them.As I read, I realized that I knew the story, but could not place where I'd seen it. I later remembered the film with the same name starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Rider, which I thought pretty good at the time. I was not, however, prepared for the literary criticism of the play, which was used by the author as a way to confront the McCarthy days in the US.The play was written in the early fifties,a time when an anti-communist craze was sweeping the nation. Arthur Miller was one of those who fell victim to the HUAC, and he wrote a great piece of art ironizing the situation of his time.In the reader's version, some characters are described by the author in a contemporary way,in which he compares the attitudes of the semi-fictional characters of the play (most of them were true, such as judge Hathorne, an ancestor of Scarlet Letter author Hawthorne) to those who supported Joseph McCarthy and his followers.Of course those are days that are now long gone, but the play is nevertheless awesome and it is a pleasure to read.By the way, if you want to go further, take a look at the film and compare it to what you have read."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"&quot;The Crucible&quot; is an excellent book that portrayed the Mc Carthy hearings, as well as the actual witch hunts. Arthur Miller provided the readers with the actual pain that went on through these times. Most people don't realize how horrible everything was. &quot;The Crucible&quot; brings up many important points such as &quot;Why would the innocent be hung if they didn't confess-for something they didn't do?&quot; It showed how unfair and unlogical people were. The book was great because it left you with not quite enough information to know the whole story. For instance, you never really find out what exactly happened in the woods or what the actual story behind the poppet is. It leaves you wondering and deciding what you think really happened. The decision John Proctor made at the end was, in my opinion, the right one. It was tough, especially with it's consequences. But, eventually you must realize it was actually for the better. Abigal Williams was a character that frustrated me. Moreso, the people around Abigal frustrated me. She was so evil on the inside. Everything about her, her motives, her goals, her values, were incredibly wrong. All of these bad things went on inside of her. Her outside appearance was quite different and false. Most people in the book made her out to be a sweet, innocent child. If they had seen the real Abigal, the trials would have gone quite differently. Overall, I loved the book. I definately recommend the book to anyone in eighth grade or older. As an eighth grader, I was still able to enjoy and understand it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This book actually kept me partly interested... I usually pick up a book then it is boring in the begining and I end up forgetting about it... But this book kept me interested the whole time...

I will read it again anytime."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"My high school performed this play two years ago. I also read the play for English class last year. I can never get tired of it. Arthur Miller brings history alive, in lines you can't forget. Stick with it, you'll understand everything at the end, I promise!"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This ranks right up there with Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; It is a play that has the same tragic ending as Romeo and Juliet, but has more of a historical significance to it. It tells about one of the most tragic events in our colonial period. Miller brings up the Salem Witchcraft Trials so vividly, and talks about a subject that other writers refuse to talk about- a devastatingly terrible time in our colnial period. He was the first writer I ever knew to actually be brave enough to talk about a dark time in our supposedly glorious colonial time. I definitely give this 5+ stars."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"At first when i began reading this book it was SO boring. For the entire first act i had no idea what was going on.

Abigail, the leader, has one goal, she has her eye on one of the towns married men, and she causes all sorts of harm trying to gain him as her own. If you were accused, this wont necessarily make you feel better, it'll just make you glad you weren't alive in this era of time."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play was about the Salem Witch Trials and the hysteria of it all.

Very interesting."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Miller's characters provide great external and internal conflicts. The overall theme is inspiring. Read this book."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This play was a sublime, undertoned attack of McCarthyism. The entire idea of persecution of what is unknown drives the characters to believe witnesses which otherwise would have been untrustworthy. At times the insanity taken so seriously is actually funny. All of the characters have central points of weakness and virtue alike; creating complex interactions. I was required to read it, unoptimistically, but it evolved into one of my favorite plays! I never truly understood the power of the phrase,&quot;Witch, Witch!!!,&quot; untill I read THE CRUCIBLE"},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Shows the retalliation of a group of children whose parents place consticting restraints on them.You see what happens when power goes to the head of people not mature enough to handle it."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"My friend was working on a project, which required The Crucible. It took him shorter than a week to read, and everyday, he would tell me how the characters drove him crazy. He described the Puritan era with fury. I had to check it out for myself.Based on the historical account of the Salem witch trials, the story begins with the Reverend Parris' discovery of his niece Abigail and several young girls playing in the woods, attempting to conjure spirits from the dead. When the girls are accused of signing with the Devil, they accuse others of practicing witchcraft. Ironically, the girls avoid punishment by accusing other innocent men and women of the very things, which they are guilty of. This desperate and perhaps, childish finger-pointing results in mass paranoia and an atmosphere of fear in which everyone is a potential witch. As the number of arrests increase, so does the distrust within the Salem community. A self-perpetuating cycle of distrust, accusation, arrest, and convistion emerges. By the end of 1692, the Salem court had convicted and executed nineteen men and women.Arthur Miller's \\"masterpiece,\\" as many refer to The Crucible as, wasn't exciting for me until the last half of Act IV. Speaking in classical terms, the book can't get any better. However, I'll be honest. I'm not the type to read Othello and A Tale of Two Cities more than once.The Crucible informs you of how corrupt the government was during the witch trials and especially during its inspiration, the McCarthy hearings of 1950. If you're simply bored and wanting to gain knowledge of this frightening historical era, give it a shot. But if you're not into all the dramatic intensity of Shakesphearean-esque themes, you're in the wrong place."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The subject of witchcraft has always intrigued me. Unfortunately this play did not keep my interest. The biggest reason was because the introduction, written by Christopher Bigsby, gave away the ending of the play. He said that damages were paid to John Proctor's wife Elisabeth after he was executed on August 19,1692. I know the play was for the most part historically accurate. I just didn't understand why he needed to state the anticipated ending of the play on the book on the second page of the book. The rest of the introduction was interesting. I liked how he compared the fear the people in Salem had of witches to the Red Scare. He said the only difference was that communists were real. This analogy helped me to relate the ridiculous fear these people had of withes to something tangible. The play itself was less exciting than I thought it would be. It was a little hard to follow. There were many characters and many things going on at once. I didn't like how there wasn't a single character who you felt like you could relate to. I liked how throughout the play you couldn't help but have a sense of disbelief about what was going on. I was amazed that the people of Salem so easily believed children without proof. It was unbelievable how by simply telling a judge that you saw a person with the devil they were guilty until proven innocent. I gave this play three stars because it was a good story. It wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I think it was more me than the book that was the problem. I would suggest reading the play before reading the introduction."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"Arthur Miller's play &quot;The Crucible&quot; came to Broadway during the 1952-53 theatrical season. But the events of the play take place more than 250 years prior to that time. The literal action of the play concerns a real historical phenomenon: the &quot;witch hunts&quot; that took place in Salem in the 1690s. But the play could also be read as a metaphor for the era of McCarthyism (1950-54), during which a United States senator led the country in a frenzied and destructive modern-day &quot;witch hunt&quot; for suspected Communists.&quot;The Crucible&quot; is a stunning exploration of jealousy, lust, mistrust, rumor mongering, religious fanaticism, and the arrogance of power. Miller's dialogue crackles with energy, and his characters are compellingly real. The play as a whole is graced by the author's intelligence and compassion. By turns infuriating, horrifying, heartbreaking, and inspiring, this is truly one of the masterworks of the American stage.The play succeeds in book form as a gripping read. Although I have never seen a stage production, I heartily recommend the excellent 1996 film version, directed by Nicholas Hytner, and featuring a superb ensemble cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis. A fitting companion text to &quot;The Crucible&quot; would be &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; the excellent play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee; like &quot;The Crucible,&quot; this play explores a real American historical event involving religious fanaticism."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"This is my fifth on my list of favorite books. I was shopping and bought a copy. When I opened it I instantly felt like I was back in highschool again."},{"Title":"Crucible, The","review":"The Crucible starts off pretty slowly, but by the end of the first (of four) acts, the craziness has been wrenched up sufficiently. Miller's play chronicles one of the best-known cases of mass psychogenic illness, wherein a group of teenage girls begin seeing devils and accusing their neighbors of witchcraft, an act that results ultimately in hundreds of arrests, 19 hangings, and Giles Corey's infamous death by pressing.Because the play was written as a reaction to McCartheyism, it avoids the more esoteric witchcraft tests and spends practically no time in trial. Instead, it focuses on the citizens who are losing their family and friends and their futile attempts to fight back. Miller employs some nice devices to drive the story home. First, the somewhat archaic dialog feels stilted and overly formal, which provides a nice contrast to the utter madness of the girls being \\"witched\\". Second, the tension is upped by the benefit of perspective. We know that there was no witchcraft in Salem, and so we feel John Proctor's frustration as he tries to argue his wife's innocence. We like to believe that reasonable people will accept a rational argument and that the truth will out, sooner or later. But time and time again, Proctor and others are thwarted by the over-simple, hyper-religious hysteria. That's what makes the play so terrifying. Sometimes rational people can succumb to madness and any who oppose them will be tortured and murdered. It resonates as strongly today, in the days when American citizens can be indefinitely detained and tortured without trial, as it did during the Red Scare of the 50's.The presentation of the play on Kindle is severely wanting. Long tracts of historical data are dropped in the first act haphazardly without any indication that they're editorial notes and not part of Miller's work. They really disrupt the flow, because you'll have 6 or eight screens of non-canon text between lines of speech. Stage directions and dialog are difficult to distinguish (directions are italicized... that's it) and the frequently spill over into each other, which makes the reading a bit more difficult. And it's $12 on Amazon for 134-page document, which feels steep (hello, library card). And some things are just lost in reading a play verus seeing one. So my overall experience was mixed."},{"Title":"Harrap's Concise Spanish and English Dictionary","review":"Of all the Spanish dictionaries that I own, this one is by far the most complete.

I like the novels of Mazo de la Roche (1879-1961). Her best-known books are the Jalna series, a long-running (16 books) generational saga about the Whiteoak family and their adventures in Canada from 1854-1954. The Building of Jalna is, in terms of internal chronology, the first of the series and the best place to start, though none of the books require knowledge of the others in order to be enjoyed. Loosely termed they are romance novels. The books are of a different era and some of the attitudes are very dated. But they're filled with adventure and they have a sweep to them that's exhilarating. The series was incredibly popular in its day and most of the books can be found in used bookstores, but chances are no one will have all of the titles at once, and some will be harder to find than others.

And the raw ingredients for a good story are there: a young, wealthy, beautiful Anglo-Irish couple (he's English, she's Irish) are bored and frustrated with their life on a military station in India. When childbirth leaves the fiery and high-strung Adeline low and dejected, a change of scenery seems to be a good idea. So when Philip's uncle dies and leaves him a large estate in Quebec, Philip and Adeline seize the opportunity for fresh adventure in the New World. He sells his military commission and his polo horses, Adeline sells the furniture, and after a brief visit with family back in England, they set out on a ship for a new life. Going along with them are the baby's Indian ayah and Adeline's two younger brothers, whose antics have got them kicked out of school and made their father all to ready to see the back of them.On their way to Canada they encounter storms, sickness, a near mutiny and the escapades of Adeline's brothers. Then they finally make land in Canada and, well, that's as far as I got. This book and the rest of the series continues on with the dynasty that Philip and Adeline built in the New World, but unfortunately, the author's style put me off and I was unable to finish. Although there is a well-turned sentence (and occasionally an entire paragraph) here and there, they are scattered pretty thinly between the rest of the narrative that is, unfortunately, not well-turned. The author tells -- makes that declares -- rather than shows, and she does it with short, choppy sentences that read like a first draft written by a high school sophomore. Take this passage for example:\\"Her anger was gone. She had a basin of hot water brought and herself bathed his head. Their friendship was restored. But the next day she was not well. She could not leave her cabin. The weather became stormy. She suffered from nausea.\\"Granted I am a very picky reader, so perhaps such immature writing isn't a problem for others; but for me, life is just too short to read stuff like this, when there are so many other books waiting in my TBR pile."},{"Title":"The building of Jalna,","review":"this is the story of the whiteoak family and their voyage to quebec,canada(circa1850s)to start their new life and build the \\"dream house\\" that they want so much.the character development was so-so. i never found myself really caring about any ofthese people.the most interesting part of the book was during the journey to canadaand all the other people that adeline and philip whiteoak met on the ship. i read it through just to see what happened in the end. there is nothing racy or scary inthis book. i think other readers might enjoy this series,especially readers wholike very light reading and no emotional involvement. this is homespun,cheerfulentertainment."},{"Title":"The building of Jalna,","review":"I first read this book about 30 years ago and fell in love with the Whiteoak family and their history.

During that time, he gained a reputation for his reservoir of anecdotes and humorous stories.The book is divided into topics and the material is easily adaptable. I particularly like the definitions, which I find are a great source for humorous one-liners."},{"Title":"Braude's Treasury of Wit and Humor","review":"In the modern world of coarse humor, jokes are often expected to be crude and contain expletives or sexual references. However, not all audiences can be exposed to such outbursts and in those circumstances, one must use a joke that is good, clean and will not offend any group in the audience. While the jokes in this book are clean, there are many that will offend people, in particular women.Many of the jokes are based on dated clich&eacute;s about women. Some examples are:Hypochondriac - a woman who always broods over her health, but never catches a remedy.Eavesdropper - a woman who loves to listen in, but not as much as she loves to talk out.Adam - the first white slave.Therefore, while this book is a good source for jokes that can be used in front of an audience, one must be careful to make sure that you take them through at least some kind of data correction filter. While these jokes were considered appropriate forty years ago, many of them have not aged well and are sure to offend some of the audience members."},{"Title":"Braude's Treasury of Wit and Humor","review":"My very intelligent twelve year old loves this book. She finds it to be very entertaining, but I appreciate the fact that it is also somewhat educational. It is well written (although perhaps a bit dated) and it's funny, but uses a bit of an advanced vocabulary that exposes my daughter to a higher level of words (& concepts) than she generally encounters in today's dumbed down world. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Engineering Examination Review 2001-2002 Edition","review":"Here are my thoughts on this book.Pros: 1. Very reasonably priced as a comprehensive review book and supposedly a money back guarantee.2. It is current and up to date (as of the April 2003 exam)3. It has a pretty good variety and quantity of examples and practice problems.Cons: 1. There are a large number of errors in the example and practice problems. I found at least 50 errors in using this book as a review guide and it is difficult, especially on some of the example problems where I would wonder for half an hour where I went wrong. Some of the errors are obvious, others are difficult or near impossible to spot if you are trying to relearn this material and remember very little. I am sure there are significantly more errors since my review did not cover the book comprehensively and I'm sure I missed a lot as well.2. The text is not very well written. Some sections go into too much detail while others simply scratch the surface. There were times when I learned more from reading the EIT handbook than from this review book.3. Lastly, I was a little disappointed when I went to take the practice exam and I found several identical questions to the practice problems provided in the different chapters. The least they could have done was make sure not to reuse questions so that when we'd like to take the practice exam we haven't just seen the questions from review sections."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Engineering Examination Review 2001-2002 Edition","review":"This book is ok but youre better off taking notes from a class or another who already passed"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Engineering Examination Review 2001-2002 Edition","review":"I bought this book because it was significantly cheaper than any other review book. Boy, what a waste of money! A friend lent me the EIT review manual (twice the price) and although it is not perfect it is far, far better. Each chapter in this book seems to be written by a different author. There is no consistency in the type, style or level of review. The thermo chapter for example assumes that you remember what every symbol in every equation represents without first providing a table or list. The reason I am using this book is that I DONT remeber what u, q and w represent. After slowly trying to make sense of the chapter I skipped to the end and found a table with each symbol listed. Am I meant to tear it out so that I can use it on every page?Some of the review is ok but I dont think any of the authors have taken the EIT in a long time. The problems seem very unlike the EIT style problems I have found online and in other review manuals.I would NOT purchase this book again and if I could return it and get my money back I would. If all you want is a quick, cheap overview of the exam material then get this book. If you want something that provides a bit of explaination or tutoring, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Robin and the Pirates","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with Jonathan. This was my all-time favourite book as a youngster, mainly because the pictures are just so amazingly detailed - especially the truly outrageous sea-battles where cannon-balls are flying and pirates of all shapes and sizes are doing battle between the ships.

It's the story of a boy who lived in a fantastic Lighthouse with his gandfather. He is captured by a press gang and put to sea as a cabin boy on a Man'o war. His adventures trying to return home bring him in contact with a rich variety of characters (archetypes really) remeniscent of Barron Munchousen or Stevenson's Kidnapped, but written for a younger audience. Written in the finest tradition of childern's literature, there is a rich subtext and dry humor that make good childrens books fun for the adult as well. However,it is the illustrations that really make this book stand out. Cartoonish, by comparrison, they are similar to the works of Peter Brughel. Each page is so full of subplots that every reading is a new adventure. In fact the vivid colors and stories they tell could be enjoyed by non readers as well. If you like Where's Waldo, Barron Munchousen, Stevenson, or London there's a good chance that you'll enjoy reading this with your children. Approximate Reading levels: second thru fifth grade."},{"Title":"Robin and the Pirates","review":"Although I haven't seen or read this book in decades, I vividly recall this book as being absolutely wonderful.

It has been so long since I've had it in my hands that I've forgotten many of the details of the story but the illustrations are what stick out most vividly in my head these many years later. In particular I remember seeing a wizard-like pirate character in there (with an owl?), and a night sea picture of the pirate ship with bats flying about! So much fun! Surely, with the pirate craze of recent years, this book would go over very well with readers, young and old, once again."},{"Title":"Robin and the Pirates","review":"This is the BEST children's book I've ever read. I begged my mother to buy it so I could read it on a trip to Florida in 1979. Beautiful, amazingly complex illustrations that a kid constantly finds new things in; the illustrations are designed to be EXPLORED to the last detail; you'd have to read it yourself to understand what I'm saying. The story isn't too shabby either, and has a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. Famous sea-going figures such as Captain Ahab and Moby Dick are encountered by Robin during his adventures. I sincerely hope that soemeone picks the rights to this CLASSIC back up so that a new generation can experience it!"},{"Title":"Robin and the Pirates","review":"I remember looking at this book for hours as a kid.

It was originally published in installments for subscribers. Jones's illustrated plates and design motifs drew from nineteen different cultures including the ornament of Oceania, Rome, Byzantium, ancient Greece, Renaissance Italy, Rome, and Moorish Spain.The Grammar was adapted to architectural decoration, fabrics, textiles, tile design, furniture and wallpaper during the second half of the nineteenth century. It has remained influential among designers worldwide.The quirky colorways are decidedly of another era and worthy of study. I have effectively used them to thwack my creativity out of occasional dead ends or potholes. This is a respected, classic reference.

Based loosely on Welsh legends, Taran Wanderer is a book for young minds and young hearts, no matter how old they may be chronologically. Like many of us, Taran wanders through life, searching for who he really is. Unlike many of us, in this book, he actually finds out. If you are a wanderer, seize this series of books. Read the first three, just to get to this one, and then read The High King to see how it all turns out. Learn from this book.....and wander no more."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"In this volume Taran decides to search for his heritage. Taran finds his way hard due to his desire to have noble blood (in order to marry Eilonwy who is, after all, a princess). He has to face his fears, prejudices and the prejudices of others before he finds the truth. Of course, truth is relative and Taran doesn't get a totally satisfying answer.My favorite part of this book are Taran's interactions with the Free Commots, people at ease with themselves and each other, who allow Taran to be whoever/whatever he wants to be.In Wanderer, Taran becomes a man, leaving behind most of his more childish ways. He finally returns home to Caer Dallben just in time to join in the final push against Arawn."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is the best of the Prydain Chronicles. It clearly shows how Taran matures from a stubborn boy into a thoughtful, courageous young man. The lessons he learns are full of truth for all people, but the book never preaches. It is full of common sense, humor, and good writing, and has plenty of action and mystery to counterbalance Taran's soul-searching. It is on a par with epics such as the Fellowship of the Ring. Read it."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"The purpose of this book (hopefully I'm not giving away too much of the story here) is basically to further develop the main protagonist's (that'd Taran of Caer Dallben) character before sending him off to the grand finale in the 5th and last book of the series (The High King). I believe I read somewhere that this was actually written AFTER Lloyd Alexander finished a complete draft of The High King, and then he wrote this because he decided Taran's character needed some more development. This story takes longer to get through than any other, which is not a big deal for me today, but the first time I read this series when I was maybe 13 (which is really a LOT closer to the audience I suspect Lloyd Alexander had in mind when he wrote the Chronicles of Prydain series), it felt really long. Anyway, aside from the relative length (which is both a good and bad thing), this book has the same strengths and weaknesses as all the series: The weakness is the plot is a bit contrived compared to the very best fantasy novels I've ever read (Tolkien), though I've certainly read fantasy books with bigger plot holes as well, and the plot here is probably tighter than in any of the other books in this series. In contrast, even though these are relatively short books that were probably aimed for kids in middle school, the main characters have depth, staying power, and evolve through each book, and there are basic moral themes present throughout every book (for example power leads to temptation and corruption) that seem even more relevant to me now nearly 20 years after I had to read &#34;The Book of Three&#34; in school. Highly recommended for anyone in the target audience, and still a decent (if short) read for an adult."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I think this is probably my favorite book in the Prydain series. It is the book in which Taran grows from a boy to a man, in a much more real sense than in any of the prior novels. The sequence at the end when he journeys through the Free Commots are some of my favorite passages in fantasy literature, because of the real attraction you can feel Taran feels to the various crafts."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I've have loved the Chronicles of Prydain series since I was a kid in the 1980s. All the books are wonderful, but Taran Wanderer has always been my favorite. It has a different tone than the other books. In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out on his own to discover what he should do with his life. There is something noble, profound, and a little lonely, about this kid wandering around on his own, with only his horse and Gurgi, trying to figure out what type of man he should become. This book is more thoughtful and moving than the other books, and sets the scene for the big finale in The High King."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"The fourth book in the Chronicles of Prydain finds the hero Taran in a state of frustration. In the last book, he discovered his love for Eilonwy. She is now far away on the island of Mona learning to be a princess. He'd like to marry her but he does not know who his parents are. He fears he will be unworthy of her hand if he is lowly born. He sets off to discover whether he has noble or peasant blood in his veins. Thus Taran, assistant pig-keeper, is transformed into Taran Wanderer. He soon finds out that the Mirror of Llunet (forgotten somewhere in the Cantrevs countryside) reveals one's true identity. He hopes to discover a royal origin so he can marry the princess. But he will have many adventures on his way.The book moves at a brisk pace from adventure to adventure, slowly building up Taran's character as he learns much more about the world he lives in and consequently about himself. The descriptions are delightful even if some of the names seem unpronounceable. The ending is satisfying except for one hanging plot thread which I hope is resolved in the final book, The High King. I was going to read something else in between but now I'm continuing on to the next volume."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This was still a very good story because it is involved with the famous classic Chronicles of Prydain, but the main reason why I did not like this as much as the other books mainly was like the reason for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the story line, there was just too much traveling for one person to contain, as Taran looks around the entire realm to find out who he really is and who his parents were. This was altogether a good story, but not as much action to keep me in suspense. But I still recommend this if you can tolerate long traveling chapters."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"The book was written in the late sixties for children to be read (that is: not to be interpreted by film makers). The language is very well suited for this purpose.I read the 5 books that make up the Chronicles of Prydain in the late seventies, then read then to my sons in the late eighties, then had then in my elementary class in the nineties. If all the children had to mark these Lloyd Alexanden works, I'm sure they would give it top marks - so much so, that one of the five got 'lost' in my class: Taran Wanderer.Now I've got Taran back, and the book is still very readable. The quest is as big as any other fantasy book, but the humour that shines through is greater, the moods more subtle. Alexander once said (Author's note in The Castle of Llyr) that \\"The nature of fantasy allows happenings which reveal most clearly our own frailties and our own strengths. The inhabitants of Prydain are fantasy figures: I hope they are also human\\".If you measure how real people are by the times they crop up in idle chit-chat in your family, Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur Fflam are as alive now as they were when I started reading their story to my sons 30 years ago.I suggest you and your (grand)children enjoy all five books:- The Book of Three- The Black Cauldron- The Castlde of Llyr- Taram Wanderer- The High King"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is my favorite book in The Prydain Chronicles! Alexander dedicates it to \\"For Wanderers still journeying, for Wanderers still at rest.\\" More than any of the other books, this one makes me think of The Wizard of Oz with its routine introduction of new characters and settings. In this way, Alexander has found an ideal way to introduce readers to the varied landscapes of Prydain. Herein, you cannot help but fail to appreciate Alexander's ease in handling descriptions.Cantrev Cadiffor: \\"The countryside had long since changed from gray moors to green meadows and pleasantly wooded lands with farmholds nestled in the clearings.\\"Caer Cadarn: \\"Unlike the palisaded strongholds of the cantrev lords, Smoit's castle was a fortress with halls of hewn stone and iron-studded gates thick enough to withstand all attack.\\"Hill Cantrevs: \\" The farmstead Taran saw to be a stumble down cottage, whose walls of stone, delved from the surrounding fields, had partly fallen away.... In the midst of the high summits, hemmed in closely by thorny brush and scrub, the farm stood lorn and desolate.\\"Free Commots: \\"This was the land of the free commots, of cottages clustering in loose circles, rimmed by cultivating fields and pastures.\\"The place Taran most seeks however is the Mirror of Llunet, which can be found in the Llawgadarn. The significance of Its description, which I won't reveal here, lies in what it reveals to Taran.Like Dorothy, who in The Wizard of Oz seeks a way home, Taran wanders in search of his identity. Taran hopes to find that he is of a royal lineage, so that he might propose to Eilonwy whom he deeply loves. While seeking his lineage, he learns many truths:* The secret of luck is to sharpen one's wit to use what falls into one's hands.* Life is a forge. Metal is worthless till it's shaped and tempered.* One's lives and days intertwine; Wise is he who can see the pattern.* Nothing is ever lost, but comes back in one shape or another.The most important truth, which I won't reveal here, lies in what the Mirror of Llunet tells Taran about his parentage. When upon meeting the herdsman Craddoc, Taran learns that he might have finally found his father. What will his reaction reveal about Taran as a person? To find out, you must travel along with Taran on his journey in Taran Wanderer."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Things slowed down a bit here from his last book. I would have liked to see more of the conflict with Morda...it just seemed to get resolved too easily. No Eilonwy, either, but I guess she would have hindered the story that Mr. Alexander was trying to tell here. It was more a story of growth for Taran. We'll see what happens in Book 5, The High King."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I just gave this book to my little brother who is addicted to Harry Potter. I wanted him to read older books that have similar styles. This collection was a winner. He read the entire series in 1 month. Its great to see an 11 yr old love reading so much."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain, along with Lord of the Rings, was my introduction to literature and the beginning of my love of reading. I first read Taran Wanderer when I was about 8 years old, and it was by far my favorite. It was about growing up, being a kid, trying to reach adulthood, all in a fast paced fantasy adventure.I have probably read the book fifteen to twenty times since then, and I learn more about myself and what is important to me every time I read it. Forget Narnia, I think this is the best children's book and series I have ever read. I plan to read it to my own children in the future, and I recommend it to any adult now. A superb book."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer is also a good book. It was slow at times, but I was always wondering what would come next. Taran sets out on a quest to find out who he is really, and who his parents were. Eilonwy, sadly, is not in this book. This book is much more serious than the others. The highlights of this book are: Two quarreling Cantrev Lords, an evil sorcerer, a man who claims to be Taran's father, and a ruthless wandering rouge named Dorath.I enjoyed this quest thoroughly and suggest you give it a try."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"We're about half way through the book. So far, the first half of the book my wife and I weren't as impressed as we were with the previous books in the series. However, the book is beginning to pick up a bit, and I'm sure we'll ultimately be happy we read it so that we can watch Taran grow."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This was the best and perhaps the most slow books of the series but I absolutely loved it? Who IS Taran?"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This was a good book. But the begining was not very good. It was basicly about going from kingdom to kingdom. The main charcter is Taran. He is a very interesting charcter. He starts on a quest to find his parantage. And he goes through mountains, castles, swamps and even caves. The biggest conflict comes into place when he meets Dorath. Dorath is a meen charcter who is part of a group of \\"hired swords\\". He treis to convince Taran to hire them but he doesnt so he becomes a enemy of Taran. He challenges Taran for his sword and a few other items that dont matter. But he wins and take sthe sword for his own. Taran has a grudge on him until he fights him again and defeats him by breaking his sword. Taran also faces a wizard who turned his freinfd Dolly in to a frog. Taran defeats the wizard and he turns Dolly back into a dwarf."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"The Prydain series takes a turn for the introspective with this particular book in the series. Throughout the series our hero, Taran, has been sort of an everyboy. He's never physically described in the books, a fact I've always ascribed to the notion that the guys reading the books can picture him as themselves. Up until \\"Taran Wanderer\\", the boy's been alternately foolish and brave. In this particular adventure, however, author Lloyd Alexander decides to do an old fashioned boy-learning-to-be-a-man storyline. Though the writing is fairly fine, in the end this stands as probably one of the weaker books in the Prydain series.As the book opens, we see Taran attempting to come to grips with two things. On the one hand, he has decided that he loves Eilonwy. On the other hand, he wants to know who he parents are. Unfortunately for the reader, Eilonwy remains in this story only as a pretty memory in Taran's mind. She never actually appears in the narrative. That leaves the parentage quest. Taran has decided that he is probably descended from noble lineage. Now, you might think this to be a pretty egotistical idea on Taran's part. But when you consider that roughly 50% of the people Taran comes into contact with in his adventures are either kings, princesses, or princes, it's not that crazy a notion. This series is rife with royalty. Setting off away from his beloved Caer Dalben with the faithful Gurgi in tow, Taran goes to find his destiny. What he finds instead is who he is as a person.As I mentioned before, Eilonwy is missing from this book, and this is a serious failing. With Taran lovestruck and doe-eyed, the girl's caustic wit and good sense are sorely lacking. We get plenty of adorable Gurgi and funny Fflewddur and even a bit of Dolbi, but Eilonwy's space cannot be filled. The fact of the matter is, she always used to temper Taran's melodramatic musings and monologues. With her gone, Taran launches into huge bouts of self-pity and depression without respite. Other small flaws concern the finish of the tale. Though the ending is meant to give the reader an important, rather than easy, finale, it comes off as slightly disappointing. That's the problem with a book that's supposed to be \\"meaningful\\". If you haven't a good sense of humor and ability to laugh at yourself, what good are you to the reader? Taran's so doggone EARNEST all the time. You just wanna slap the little guy and tell him to lighten up. I'm sure Eilonwy would. If she were around.Though the action and swashbuckling abound in this tale, it's not the same. I was disappointed in this particular installment. I'm certain it has its admirers, and certainly it's a fine book. The fact that it doesn't live up to its fellow books in the series doesn't mean it isn't worthy reading. Just don't expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Pig boy has status envy and the horn.So, not thinking he can do a princess he goes off instead, and has some magical animal stuff happen again, this time, in the form of a cow.

All in all this book was strange and had little plot developement and action."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is a replacement. I don't remember if it was used or new when it arrived. Lloyd Alexander books get snapped up and passed around in our house. It doesn't look new any more."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a bit of a different take for Lloyd Alexander as he continues the \\"Chronicles of Prydain.\\" Unlike the action stories featured in earlier volumes, Alexander presents a story more focused on character growth and familiar faces from the previous books either do not appear or play a much smaller role in this book. Taran grows a great deal in this story and Alexander shows more of the land of Prydain than he does in the earlier books--including a touching look at farmers and other people looking to etch out a living even in the shadow of epic conflict. It's an angle often overlooked by fantasy writers. There is much wisdom here and Alexander does a wonderful job of making his points in a subtle manner. It's certainly different than the other books in the series--and some readers, especially younger ones may grow weary of it. Nonetheless, this is book is ideal for most young fantasy readers."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Besides being one of the best children's books ever, this book is also part of a great 5 book series. I read this book aloud to all my children, now that my children are adults reading this series is almost a requirement for their spouses in order to be part of our family! A requirement their spouses fulfilled with pleasure, I might add. Besides the basis in Welsh mythology, I feel that the theme of the series is Taran's search for identity as he slowly learns, with mistakes along the way, what it means to be an adult of value in the world. Though Eilonwy isn't in this book, she is a good, strong role model for girls throughout this series as well and does have \\"her own\\" book in The Castle of Llyr. I cannot recommend this book, or the Chronicles of Prydain series, enough."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Like many of the best children's authors, Lloyd Alexander created a fictional universe to teach his readers how to understand and live in the real world. His Prydain books are fantasy for kids, but full of the introspection of a thoughtful adult. All the books have nice moments, but some of the best writing in the series comes in the second half of TARAN WANDERER (the fourth book). Taran, an orphan who wants to be a hero, wanders through Prydain (based on medieval Wales) to find information about his parentage and meets an aging shepherd who is struggling on an unproductive mountain farm. The shepherd claims he is Taran's father, hoping that Taran will stay and work, which he does. When the shepherd dies, he reveals that he is not his father. Taran is first happy, then ashamed for wanting to be free and for being embarrassed to claim the poor working man as his father. Taran decides he is not worthy to return home and journeys on through poor counties, meeting a blacksmith who offers to apprentice him (I know I'm over-explaining why I love this book, but hear me out). After toiling at the smithy, he meets a weaver and, thinking that weaving is woman's work and probably easier, offers to work for her. After a month of cleaning wool and operating a loom, he knows better. Then there's an interlude where he stays with a fisherman, who tells him that life is a river and you have to be ready to grab things when they come to you (very true). Finally, in a moving chapter, he meets a famous potter and asks to learn his trade. The potter tells him he can learn the craft but maybe not the art, and Taran eventually learns he is right. Then robbers who have been pursuing Taran (and who represent the destructive element in all societies) kill the potter and burn the county where Taran is living, so he leads them away and finally reaches his destination, a pool which is supposedly magic and will answer the question of who he is. He looks in the pool and sees himself, changed by the people he has met and the work he's learned to do. The robber stomps in the pool and kicks the water out, but Taran has found what he wanted to know."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This one stands apart from the other books in the series, as it has far less action and far more character development.I read it something like 12 years ago and still remember most of the plot!"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"So, in the last book, we had one person get taught their station in life, in this one, we have another go searching for their station in life. Over these past two books we've been inside the head of certain characters so as to set up book five. One thing we learn from this series is that not all is what we wish or want it to be. But we are who and what we are we must accept that. It is one of lifes many lessons. We wish to be one thing to find out we are maybe something else. But, when we learn to know ourselves, we can learn to move on in life."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I read the Prydain Chronicles as a child and still find them enjoyable today. I look forward to one day sharing these tales with my children."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"While most of the Chronicles of Prydain follow the traditional fantasy style of epic adventure, the fourth book, Taran Wanderer, takes a journey into the realm of self-discovery instead. The result is not only another amazing entry in Lloyd Alexander's classic series, but also one of the best fantasy novels ever written.Taran Wanderer again follows the journey of the assistant pig-keeper Taran as he seeks to find his place in the world. Except for Gurgi, most of his adventuring companions are absent for this journey. Fflewdur Fflam and Doli only make short appearances, and Eilonwy is absent entirely - indeed, it is because of the distant princess that Taran undertakes his latest adventure in the first place. The lack of a slarge supporting case allows Taran to really grow as he seeks his true parentage and learns that it takes more than swordplay to make a man.Taran Wanderer does not have one epic storyline to tie the book together, but instead is a series of minor adventures that each help Taran learn more about himself. While Taran has matured bit by bit throughout the series, this book is the one that will finally turn him into a man. His adventure is humorous at times and heartbreaking at others. Overall, this novel represents one of the best character-driven narratives in the entire fantasy genre. Whether you are familiar with the Chronicles of Prydain or not, you should definitely give this story a read."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"A friend loaned me her copies of this series. I enjoyed them so much I wanted my children to be able to read them, but I was apprehensive about having them read her autographed copies, and they weren't available at our local library. I was so delighted to find them at amazon.com and at such a great price I just couldn't pass them up. This is one of those true classics, great for both kids and adults. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I was a little guy when I first came across the Prydain Chronicles. I had long since lost the books and had forgotten that they even existed. And then one day I saw &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; on sale for 25 cents at a Garage Sale. Right away my mind jumped back to my youth. Needless, to say I bought the book as well as the complete set. Now that I am an adult I am amazed at how inspiring the books are. There is so much behind the words written in these books and I am grateful that I took the time to re-read them 15 years later! I think the idea of Taran searching for his history is reflective of many things in the lives of all people - young and old! There is a magic to these pages that I hope will not become a rarity in books written by todays authors. Alexander doesn't write books, he creates visions. I'm just glad that he decided to share his visions with many others."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer, the fourth book of the Prydain chronicles, is, in my opinion, the best book in a wonderful series.All four books focus on the character of Taran of Caer Dallben, an orphan who is raised by a wizard (Dallben). The plot of Taran Wanderer focuses on Taran's quest to find out who his parents were. Taran hopes that he will find that he has the &quot;noble&quot; blood that he believes would give him the right to ask the Princess Eilonwy to wed him.Needless to say, he does not have an easy time, wandering the length and breadth of Prydain searching for parents he does not know, who can barely remember him.The book's joy, however, does not lie only in its plot, but also in the development that Taran undergoes through the course of the book. In Taran Wanderer, more than any other book, Taran grows into manhood. The trials he passes through temper and shape him, as he journeys through both familiar and strange lands. His experiences teach him lessons, but he learns even more from the people he meets.Make no mistake. This is not a pure novel of character. Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, meeting kings and wizards, and also farmers and tradesmen. Along the way, he has many adventures and faces many hardships. As said earlier though, the solid plot is not the highlight of this book. The characters are. The myriad of people Taran meets in his travels provides a welcome break from the pattern of the other Prydain chronicles, where almost everyone seems to be either a king, a bard, or a magician (or some combination of the three). After so many books walking the heights, Taran finally returns to earth.For those who have read the earlier books, you will see many familiar faces, including faithful Gurgi, the (not quite) bard Fflewddur Fflam, King Smoit, and even three old friends from the Marshes of Morva. You'll also be intrigued by new characters, some of whom have had hidden influences on characters you already know. And through it all, the beautiful tapestry of plot that Lloyd Alexander has woven will captivate you.Taran Wanderer is a great book. I recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This book is definitely the most unique of all the Prydain Chronicles. Instead of urgent quests to find magical pigs, destroy evil cauldrons or rescue a beautiful princess--with good constantly pitted against the forces of evil--this volume is instead focused on Taran finding out about himself.Instead of a quest resolved in a matter of weeks or months, this story covers a couple of years, years in which Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, first in search of his parents and then in search of his own place in the race of men.His motivation lies in a desire to be worthy of the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage; she's absent from the story, still on the Isle of Mona, so Taran's only constant companion is the loyal creature Gurgi.Old friends Fflewddur and Doli make brief appearances, though the bulk of Taran's time is spent meeting new people: the old farmer Aeddan and his wife, who fight for survival on a land impoverished by the Death-Lord Arawn; Goryon and Gast, petty lords whose bark is worse than their bite; Morda, the enchanter who despises the race of men in its entirety; the outlaw Dorath and his men; the shepherd Craddoc; and the people of the Free Commots: Llonio the lucky, Hevydd the smith, Dwyvach the weaver, Annlaw the potter, and Llassar the farm boy.The lessons Taran learns in his travels aren't always obvious or profound for the casual reader, and the limited amount of swords, sorcery and peril may be unusual for some. However, the transition Taran makes into manhood is handled convincingly and realistically with each step he takes."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran, who we met as a boy in The Book of Three and whose splendid adventures we breathlessly followed in The Black Cauldron and The Castle of Llyr, decides to find himself and his past in the fourth marvelous Prydain Chronicle by gifted storyweaver Lloyd Alexander. An orphan raised by the wise Dallben, he has none of the history and connections that come from parents and family. Now, he off alone to find some answers - hopefully noble ones - so he can be \\"worthy\\" of his royal love.If you're like me, you didn't love Taran automatically - he could occasionally be sullen, petty, and prickly during his \\"growing up\\" phases in Books 1 to 3 (necessitating Eilonwy's great put-downs and quips). Continuing his growth, Taran Wanderer marks his first journey into adulthood. This is the one where my respect for this character solidified and I really began to care for him. This is the least \\"heroic\\" of the books, and yet, I believe this is one where Taran is most admirable.He explores the land he has been fighting for by connecting to the common people as well as kings and wizards. We are introduced to more excellent characters (besides some old ones) and a deeper understanding of Prydain with the intricate ties that bind all of them together. On a quest for the Mirror of Llunet, Taran roams old and new territory from the Marshes to the Free Commots doing everything from making pottery to facing off against kingly challenges. The change is how he sees the world, with its ugliness and beauty, as he searches for his place in it. Along the way, he learns about himself: humbly, intelligently, honestly, and courageously.As it closely builds on the last book in particular, and is in general an evolution of his maturity, reading the books in order is strongly recommended. (Considering how wonderful the others are, this is no chore.) It's a relatively quiet book compared to the rousing chases of the previous ones, but Taran Wanderer is ultimately more powerful and moving."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer was not given the Newbery Award like it's successor The High King; nor was it awarded a Newbery Honor medal such as it's predecessor The Black Cauldron. However, Taran Wanderer is the most complete book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Lloyd Alexander deftly tells the tale of Taran's quest to find his parentage in hopes of being decendant from noble blood. Gurgi, Taran's faithful sidekick journeys with him through far off parts of Prydain. Along the way, old friends and faces reappear such as Fflewwder Fflamm the bard/king, Doli of the fair folk, Kaw his hijinxing bird, Llyan the giant cat who Fflewwder now rides as his mount and King Smoit whose army rescued Taran and his companions at the end of The Black Cauldron. Taran's journey to find himself takes him to a number of different trades such as metallurgy, weaving, farming and pottery. He also meets his fair share of adventure and enchantment along the way. At 254 pages Taran Wanderer is the longest book in the series but it reads the fastest because there is so much action and uncertainty in what Taran will finally find out about himself. The Chronicles of Prydain still stand as some of the greatest fantasy stories ever written and Taran Wanderer is the BEST book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Unlike many of the older readers reviewing the Prydain chronicle, I have never stopped reading them. The series was almost permanently taken out in my name from the childrens' library in town for about five years, from second or third grade on. Finally I broke down and bought paperback copies of all five, which are now dogeared and mangled, the biding broken. Not from mistreatment; from my sheer love of the books. These are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of books for me; I've read them countless, countless times.While all five books are excellent in their own personal way, Taran Wanderer, I believe, is my favorite. It didn't used to be; as a child I liked The High King, which was admittedly more action packed. I think the switch came around adolescence; Taran Wanderer was then less a boring filler between books and more a boy's journey to adulthood and to find himself. Somewhere along the line I began to appreciate this for what it was, and what the other books, though infinitely wonderful, were not. There is subtle poignancy in Taran's friendship with Gurgi, mediation between Gast and Goryon, attempts to peaceably deal with Dorath, and most of all his finding of value and nobility in even the common folk of the Free Commots, where he proves to himself that he doesn't necessarily have to be a hero to be a man.You don't have to have gone through adolescence to appreciate the beauty of this book. Maybe not the most action-packed of the Prydain chronicles, or the most climactic, but so much more than filler: literary wonder."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I read it at six. I read it at sixteen. I read it at twenty-six. I read it at home. I read it wandering. At all times and all places, I have identified with Taran Wanderer more than any other literary character. I'm not excluding Shakespeare, the classics or modern novels.Taran is a boy trying to become a human (it applies to girls just as much.) This is the beginning of all great mythology, as the late Joseph Campbell would have agreed. This boy travels through a world of magic swords, undead warriors and medieval villages. It is an escape. Or is it? Taran deals with truth, the true worth of himself and others, the search for meaning in a career and in life, the excitement and high price of violence and love. I AM Taran in 1997, as much as he is in an imaginary world. I bet a lot of you are, too.Alexander never talks down to you, whether you are young or old. It is fun and meaningful. This fourth book of a wonderful five-book series is an excellent encapsulation of the entire series. This is not a book for adults or children. It is a book for people. A great one."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer is perhaps the most personal of all the Prydain Chronicles, as the story focuses on Taran searching for his lineage. Taran is an orphan, raised by the wizard Dallben, and he wondered for a long time who his parents really were. Now he has an intense urge to find out if he is of noble line, because he wants to marry Eilonwy, enchantress and princess of Llyr. Of course he didn't tell her his feelings, as he is not sure that he worthy to ask and also because Eilonwy is not in Prydain throughout the story of Taran Wanderer. As a result, this Chronicle has a distinct feel from the other Chronicles. Taran roams around Prydain, looking for clues and having his own personal adventures, and the book really shows that he is clever and intelligent. There's a part that ties the third Chronicle in very good with this one. Taran finds out many different things about himself, but what he set out to look for yields surpising results. A good book, but a bit slower than the others in the series. It has many life lessons though, and it's still interesting despite not having large battles; it has personel encounters and small skirmishes. However, Lloyd Alexander more than makes up for that in the last Chronicle, The High King."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"In essence, the entirety of the Prydain Chronicles is a journey, Taran's journey from boyhood to manhood. Well, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; traversed a mile of the journey with a single bound.After &quot;Castle of Llyr,&quot; we know that Taran is pretty obviously bonkers-in-love with Eilonwy, but since he's an Assistant Pig-Keeper and a Princess, he doesn't plan to ask her until he can discern who he is, in terms of rank and birth (she'd probably think he was nuts to think this, and make some amusing comparison, but she sadly doesn't appear in person in this one--warning to Eilonwy fans).Taran first travels to the Marsh of Morva to ask for advice, then sets out on his journey with Gurgi, who shows the levels of his faithfulness in this story. He comes face-to-face with amorality, selfishness, greed, and various other human failings. But Taran manages to handle them all with grace and wisdom...... until he meets a crippled shepherd who might just be his father.After he meets the shepherd, Taran's journey becomes far more mature. He is forced to face his own failings and his own beliefs about whether he would be worthy for Eilonwy, as he tries to change his life. Is Taran a prince? Or a prince among men? And which matters more?Such favorites as King Smoit (a personal fave of mine--his last scene with Taran is wonderful), Doli of the Fair Folk, and Fflewddur Fflam appear in this book, but it's really Taran's story, with a good dose of Gurgi thrown in.This takes all but one step toward adulthood--the last step is taken in &quot;High King.&quot; Taran is one of the most unique and sometimes haunted heroes in fantasy literature, for children or adults. His journey of self-discovery is amazing, truly amazing.Why this book never won a Newbery is beyond me--it doesn't have a lot of swords clashing or involved battles. It's a journey of the heart, and possibly one of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"As a child, the Chronicles of Prydain were among my favourite books.

Only Gurgi goes with him, though the two do meet up with an old friend or two eventually. Taran learns where he may be able to find the answers he seeks, and sets off to do so, but finds himself entangled in a number of complications along the way that teach him valuable lessons about the meaning of life, and his place in it. It's good stuff, as usual, though the book eventually takes on an episodic feel that none of the others has; get into a situation, learn a lesson, get into another situation, etc. There's no overlap, which is kind of odd, and made like the book less than those that came before it; still, if you've journeyed this far with Taran and Gurgi, you certainly shouldn't stop now. ***"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"A friend of my father's brought me a box full of used books when I was 9 or 10.

What he discovers, however, is something poets and storytellers have been telling us for centuries--true nobility is in how you act, not in who your parents are. Finally Taran discovers his father--or is it his father? Since being a shepherd is not much better than being an Assistant Pig-Keeper (probably worse, since the pig was the oracular pig Hen Wen), Taran would just as soon that he wasn't.

In the proccess he meets many new friends that teach him many lessons of life, and in the end, although he failed in his quest he gained more than he could ever realize. I recommend this book to all fantasy fans."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is perhaps the deepest of the Prydain Chronicles, as Taran learns to master his pride and selfishness. There is so much we can learn from Hevvyd, Dwyvvach, Annlaw as each in their own way describe life. It is my second favorite in the series, since here Taran becomes more than he was before and here we come face-to-face with our own pride and prejudices. This is a great book for kids and a must-read for adults. But read the other three first, otherwise this one looses some of its charm"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is my favorite of the Prydain Chronicles. I'm afraid Ican't remember whether this was true when I first heard the story atabout age 5, but the theme of self-discovery is still relevent to me today. I have, at times, been as proud and as stubborn as Taran. Like him, I have gained skill in many areas that have still failed to satisfy me. And like him, I have desperately yearned for things beyond my reach. Who says this is just a children's book?"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"One of the great joys of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles series is the steady progression from lighthearted children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a lifetime of journeys, learning from them as they went.This is very much front and center in \\"Taran Wanderer,\\" a sad, lonely tale of Taran's quest to find out who he truly is. While appropriate for all ages and sure to be enjoyed by young readers, older readers will find the harrowing decisions Taran has to make gripping and heart-wrenching.Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth and legend, the themes and situations here will feel familiar, like stories you've read many times before. Yet that never comes across in a tiresome way. It's a story that operates in a welcome comfort zone, nice in a time when so many books try so hard to be different solely for the sake of being different. The story told in \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a timeless tale because of its familiarity and will engage readers for many years to come.The focus here is more strongly on Taran than in any other volume, though the rest of the cast of characters returns: Eilonwy the stereotypical spoiled princess, Gurgi the crazed Gollum-like creature, and Fflewddur Fflam the hapless bard who is prone to exaggeration. Others from the past also rear their heads.The pacing in this, the fourth of five books, is more deliberate. Some would say slow, but this being the type of story it is, that would be an unfair description. Rather, it lingers in Taran's quest and Taran's sadness and uncertainty.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"With all respect to Ms. Rowling, this is one of the best Fantasy Series. It's got everything. Alexander knows more about the craft of writing than any fantasy author living. If you or your kids like Harry, please give this series a try. You'll be glad that you did!"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This book is probably my favorite of all the Prydain Chronicles . . . It's maybe not as intense as some of the others are, but I love how Taran travels around and meets so many interesting characters and learns to view life differently by seeing how they live and view their own lives. It's just a very fascinating journey, one that I'd like to take again and again. A Journey that I'd like to share with my friends and family. . . And someday, my own children."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer, is the third book of the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander. So far this is the best one of the series. The first two book were great, but this is even better. The main character, a boy named Taran, is looking for the truth and he learns that the truth can play with you. It's a very unusual book, you won't find many like this.Taran Wanderer is an amazing fantasy adventure book. It's got magic, enchantment, a few funny parts, and suspense. It has a grumpy dwarf named Doli. Doli is the kind of person who always turns up at the exact right moment. Taran is an adventurous boy who tries to gather wisdom and friends wherever he can find them. He goes on several quests. My favorite part is chapter eight, when Taran meets the magician, Morda. It's scary and has an unusual ending.I read this book in less than a week. It just took me captive! I don't want to give away the plot, because I don't want to spoil it. You should read it for yourself. I can't wait to read the next book in the series, The High King.Ben (age 10)"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"\\"Taran Wanderer\\", the fourth in \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" is very different from the other books in the series. One obvious difference is that Eilonwy does not appear in the book (except in the thoughts of the other characters). Another is that this book does not contribute to the ongoing battle between Taran and his friends and the forces of Arawn of Annuvin. This book is Taran's adventure of self-discovery, as he traverses the land of Prydain in search of his roots, a search which takes him from the Marshes of Morva, through the kindom of Smoit, and on to the land of the Free Commots."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I read many Newbery Award winners as a child, and none has affected me as much as &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; the penultimate book in Lloyd Alexander's &quot;Pyrdain&quot; series. I was fortunate enough to have found the book at age 12, and the protagonist's coming of age experience paralleled my own coming of age as a reader. Although the first three installments in the &quot;Pyrdain Chronicles&quot; are beautifully written children's fantasies that teach important life lessons, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; possesses a maturity and complexity making it the jewel of the series. No longer seeking magical cauldrons and oracular pigs, Taran embarks upon a vague quest for self discovery that finds him engaging in lackluster tasks such as weaving and pottery-making that rarely appear in a children's fantasy. While &quot;Wanderer&quot; still contains the requisite evil wizards, talking crows, and magic harps, somehow Pyrdain has become a less black-and-white world. After reading &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; both Taran and myself were no longer children, and the action-packed finale of the &quot;High King,&quot; despite being wildly entertaining, could not recapture the innocence of the earlier books. The work introduced me to an adult world demanding diffuclt choices and temperance, a world which sadly replaced the delightful child's land where a magic sword could vanquish evil. However, despite this sacrifice, Taran's journey is one worth making, and Lloyd Alexander gracefully introduces his young readers into an adult world surrounded by a subtler type of magic. Ten years later as a computer science graduate student, I can honestly say that the impact of &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; has not faded."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I have read these books before when I was a lot younger, and recently I decided to read them again, after I bought the set for Christmas.

It is a great contrast between reality and the world we live in and a fantastical land (Prydain). The way it was written it can be picked up and read before the others or read in it's actual order. I fell in love with the chronicals of Prydain as soon as I picked up the first one. Taran seems more real in this book than the others because the conflicts are more real... for example his original quest and what truly happens in the end and that he learns more than he thought he would is a great finishing touch to such a great book.

I highly recommend this series to any child or adult who likes Harry Potter or any other series of fantasy fiction. Taran Wanderer is my favorite of the series because it brings into view the changes the main character has made in the three previous books and sets the stage for the final episode. A wonderful book about the journey to find 'self'."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"In many ways, this forth book in Lloyd Alexander's \\"The Chronicles of Prydain,\\" is the odd one out. It is the only story that does not pit our characters against the forces of supernatural evil (well, except in one small instance). It is the only installment in which Princess Elionwy is completely absent. It is the only story that has no clear destination in its quest narrative. Even the title is a little different, lacking the usual \\"The\\" before the noun.Rather than pitting the forces of good against evil, \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is about the journey of self-discovery, making it a much steadier-paced, introspective book. Although some readers may feel that it's less exciting than the preceding books, discerning children will find many hidden rewards here. The core of this series has always been the growth of Taran from a somewhat foolish, hapless boy into a man, and with each consecutive book he learns a little more about himself and the world around him. \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is the book in which Taran fully steps into manhood.With the intention to ask Princess Elionwy to marry him when she returns from her training on the Isle of Mona, Taran desires to learn more about his heritage. Having never known his parents, he harbours a secret wish that he has noble-blood in his veins, and on gaining Dallben's permission, he sets out to discover the identity of his parents and find his place in the world. His only companion is the faithful Gurgi; not-quite-a-man, not-quite-an-animal, and best described as a benevolent version of Gollum.On his travels he learns of the mysterious Mirror of Llunet which is said to show the true self of anyone who stares into it. With this as his somewhat vague goal, Taran heads out into the world. What follows is not so much a single overarching story, but a series of encounters and problems in which Taran has to solve with his wit, compassion, bravery, common sense, and only occasionally his physical strength. From feuding lords to evil wizards, lawless mercenaries to the lessons of forge, loom and potter's wheel, each life experience leads him closer to who he really is.Yet Alexander also finds time to add commentary on the human condition, and it his greatest achievement that he manages to do so (not just here, but in his other books) that it is done subtly and wisely, rather than just by slapping a moral on the end of every sentence. Taran comes up against the amorality of an outlaw, the injustice of a warlord, the arrogance of a wizard, and the simple dishonesty of a shepherd, and yet never relinquishes his own integrity, even as he faces fear, shame, and bitter disappointment.But it's not all doom and gloom: there's plenty of room for humour, wonder and hope, usually obtained in the presence of Taran's beloved companions: faithful Gurgi, the wandering bard Fflewdur Fflam (who carries a harp who snaps a string every time he tells a lie), the grouchy dwarf Doli and the mischievous talking-crow Kaw (my own favourite!)Another aspect worthy of note is that Prydain itself (based on the myths and legends of Wales) is explored in more detail than in previous books. Whilst we've previously dealt with castles and princes, warlords and enchanters, we now get a look into the more humble - and more important - inhabitants of this imaginary world. The reader learns much from the simplest of folk, including kindness to animals, respect to elders, the beauty of nature, and the simple pleasures of good food and a warm hearth.However, some of the \\"special features\\" of the book are a little disappointing: specifically, an incomplete pronunciation guide and a truly hideous map of Prydain that looks as though it was drawn by a three-year old (seriously, the rivers look like random scribbles). Yet the current edition of the series has new cover-art by the gifted David Wyatt, so if there was ever a time to invest in the complete collection, now is it.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is enlightening, bittersweet, joyful, thought-provoking and timeless. At its conclusion, all the pieces are in place for the final installment in this series:The High King (The Chronicles of Prydain), a book which is as close to perfection as you'll ever get in children's literature. Seriously."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"A nice fit between the fairy tale innocence of Lewis' Narnia and the epic saga of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Fun to read, with some good morals woven into it."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Of the five splendid books in the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander, my favorite is the fourth, TARAN WANDERER.The previous three books: THE BOOK OF THREE, THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE CASTLE OF LLYR are superb fantasy for children. They share a common theme that nothing comes without work or sacrifice and show that glory is less fine than friendship. The final book, THE HIGH KING, picks up this theme again as the struggle between good and evil is played out to the end.Just as its title is different TARAN WANDERER is different. Here our young hero, the orphan boy Taran, is growing from a boy to a man. Suddenly he is aware of the gap in rank between himself and his childhood friend Princess Eilonwy; suddenly he knows he loves her but can never marry her unless he has land or rank to offer in turn. So he leaves the only home he has known, the farm of the enchanter Dallben and sets out on a quest to discover the truth of his origins. Was he high-born or low?This book is different. Always before when Taran set out with his friends to find some magical item, he would find the unexpected. While some chapters might be grim the quest was always lighthearted and the comrades always entertaining. Here Taran sets out not knowing what he is looking for and he finds the commonplace. The challenge that Taran faces is one that most adults are familiar with: one can search for Truth, but it is not always to be found. Disappointment is part of life and must be faced. Taran's search takes him from the magical marshes of Morva to the rude hut of a shepherd, from evil sorcerer's stronghold to the campfires of a bandit gang. He searches the length and breadth of Prydain and does not find his parents. He does discover the common people of Prydain, how they live and work and love and comes to the realization that nobility is not necessarily found in marble halls.I have loved this book since I first read it more than forty years ago; I love it still. Great fantasy for all ages and all times. A real classic, as are all the books of Prydain. If you have not yet visited this magical kingdom loosely based on Welsh mythology, you have missed a real treat."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"I have been a fan of the Prydain series since I first read them in junior high long, long ago. At the time, had you asked me which book was my favorite, I would have said The Black Cauldron. My least favorite would have been Taran Wanderer. But as I grew older and reread the series several times at different stages in my life, I found myself developing a fondness for Taran Wanderer and today I would say it is my favorite of the series.I cannot say for certain, but when I read the book, I get the feeling that it is not really written for independent readers and early teens. They will, of course, find much to enjoy in it between the memorable characters and the occasional action scene. But I feel that it is a book best enjoyed by those who have already embarked on their own quest in search of who they truly are. Until a person has walked that line between youthful innocence and adult responsibility, the nuances of this book are not fully revealed. At least they weren't for me. But now that I have grown up and had to discover who I am, this particular story has a poignancy that it lacked when I was twelve years old. It was a good book then but it is a better book now and its greatest strength is that it is a book that has meaning and substance no matter how old the reader may be."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"This is the 4th book in a series called &quot;The Prydain Chronicles.&quot; This book is about Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, and his quest for himself.

When he goes to see the Witches in the Marches of Morva they send him on a wild goose chase to seek the Mirror of Llunet. On the way he gets himself into crazy situations and he finds creative solutions for complicated problems.I really liked this book because it's easy to read when it is really late and you are very tired. There aren't a lot of hard words so you don't have to think, and you can just read for the fun of it. I also liked this book because I liked the way he creatively dealed with his and others problems. I never would of thought of some of his solutions.I would definately read this book and the other three books before this one in the series because they are classic children's literature.

The problem now is that he doesn't believe that his bloodlines are worthy of her. She is a princess after all, and he is but a lowly assistant pig keeper, a orphan that does not know where he really came from. So he sets of with the ever faithful Gurgi as his companion in a quest to find out who he is.We are visited by several old friends from previous books in the series and introduced to a handful of new bad guys. I have to say the bad guys are getting better - or more badder? - as the series progresses and more and more inventive plans are needed to foil their plots.Taran learns much about himself through his journey and learns some very important lessons along the way, with one of the most important being about who he really is. I loved the sorcerer, Morda. It seems all of man's faults are wrapped up quite nicely in one little package. Fflewddur returns with Llyan, such a wonderful friend that manages to save the day at least once. Kaw, the pesky crow shows us that help comes from the least likely places. And of course the faithful Gurgi, the best friend Taran could ever have is along for the ride.I think this will have to be my favorite so far in the series. With just one more left, The High King, I can't wait to see how everything ends.4/5"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"In my opinion, this was the best book in the series by far.

It was almost like a storybook with different stories in it. I especially liked the part where he was staying at that guy's house.( I forget his name. It was Llonio, I beleive.) This book does not have a lot of action, but I like it because it gives us a chance to get to know Taran better."},{"Title":"taran wanderer","review":"Taran Wanderer is the fourth book in Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. The book is a tale of Taran's journey to find his identity. He hopes to find that he is of noble blood, and thus worthy to ask for the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage. With only the perpetually anxious, yet always faithful almost-but-not-quite-human creature Gurgi as his companion, Taran sets off across the length of Prydain in search of answers. Along the way he meets old friends from the earlier books who join him on his quest: Fflewddur Fflam, the bard-king with a habit of embellishing his own bravery and accomplishment; Doli, the bad tempered, yet dutiful dwarf, and Kaw, the talking crow.The friends face many adventures, including a search for lost cattle, battles with a group of bandits, and an escape from an enchanter who has the power to turn men into animals. However, the greatest conflicts that Taran faces are within himself. In a variety of ways, Taran is offered the noble name that would make it easy to marry the princess, but at a cost of losing her respect. In the end, Taran learns more about his true identity than he ever hoped, but in a most unexpected fashion.The book is even more skillfully written than the three previous in the series. Every scene in the book ties tightly together. It makes for an exciting tale and a compelling presentation of the themes that recur throughout the Chronicles. Among these are: that the most valuable things in life are easily overlooked, that a useful and productive peace is more glorious than victory in battle, and that sometimes, the key to finding oneself is to be willing to sacrifice everything."},{"Title":"Guinea Pig: Your Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This book covers everything you need to know about our cavy friends.

Any math teacher will tell you, it's not the numbers per se that are important, but the relationships and interactions that are important.Lastly, the story illustrates the math concept of geometric progression, how after a few turns, little number 'explode' into big ones.Overall, excellent story that teaches both social values and mathematical concepts."},{"Title":"The King's Chessboard (Picture Puffins)","review":"Have you ever paid the price for being a little too nice? \\"The King's Chessboard\\" was about a proud king in Deccan, India who paid the price for rewarding a wise man that didn't want to be rewarded.

Then, each day for 64 days the wise man would recieve twice as much than the day before for each square on his chessboard.

His Autobiography, \\"Living with the Himalayan Masters\\" was an inspiration and much more modern and accessible to me than many enlightened masters autobiographies. Considered a great sage and master, Swami Rama, born in 1925, was raised from childhood in a cave monastery, by a Master who allowed him to study with all the adepts in his monastery and area. By his twenties he was a famous singer, and the youngest Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) in Southern India and studied at several European universities, and taught in Japan. He also started an Ashram in India and founded The Himalayan International Institute of Yoga and Science and Philosophy. Having studied in the west and performed countless scientific experiments verifying his minds control over his body, he combines the eastern teachings with a nod to western science, philosophy and religion, making them applicable to any walk of life or philosophical system. I highly recommend all of his books but this is one of my favorites.In this classic, he tells us how to find, know and transform our true self and live a positive life that acknowledges our humanness, while striving for perfection. This is accomplished through an understanding of ones self, negative emotions and habits, while strengthening ones willpower, memory, intuition and spirituality. He teaches us how to have spiritual and loving relationships, gives a simple no-nonsense approach to becoming your own therapist, and an example of good parenting, all through a simple basic understanding of meditation and self exploration.A simple core lesson from this book is that we often \\"blame others and expect others to make us happy. No one else has the capacity to make you blissful, your mind is your own mind\\" Swami teaches us that it is our own \\"Samskaras\\" or the collective soul experience (kind of like a basement in your subconscious) and how we react, or control these, that make us happy or unhappy. By \\"journeying within\\", anyone can come to an understanding of ones own distorted thinking process and train, change or improve their life direction, finding a way to joy and happiness. One can discover within the self the source of negative and positive thought forms and how they affect our emotions and then use this knowledge to retrain our minds into being happy.While this is an \\"Art\\" that takes time and energy, and perhaps a life time, its practice will result in self actualized transformation and manifest in our external and internal happiness, thus changing our own world and perhaps the world of others around us.I highly recommend this book to anyone of either a western or eastern philosophical approach.

This is a book you would want to read and re-read to really understand and practice Swami Rama's teachings in daily life. It's full of wisdom. Swami Rama in his books teaches you what real Yoga is. Yoga is not about just practicing postures, seating around candles and (pretend to) meditate, listening to music etc. Yoga is life style; it's way of living life joyfully, free from pain and misery. As Swami Rama teaches, whole life is meditation.I highly recommend to read other books by Swami Rama especially Meditation and Its Practice, Path of Fire and Light (Vol 2).

They even have a betting pool on what brought him there. Harry's not so much hiding out as biding his time until he can vindicate himself as a result of a scandal that he's managed to keep secret. He cleans house and discovers that the job he thought would be a piece of cake is actually going to take up a lot of his time to get it to turn a profit. He also finds himself drawn to the city editor, Jamie McClane. They have an antagonistic relationship while trying to keep from acting on their pent-up feelings. Jamie is mistakenly informed that it was sexual harrassment that got Harry canned, and when he finds out, he does his best to flirt with her and make her uncomfortable for investigating him.Enter a sexy pregnant ex, a career building story about a child's murder, and assorted office politics, and you have the makings of a humorous and steamy story of small town life.

In the cases where the President was unmarried, female relatives served as the official hostess for White House gatherings.Many also tend to think that the First Lady engaging in political activity is a recent phenomenon. That is historically inaccurate; some of the very first women to hold the position were politically active and made their opinions and influence known. Martha Washington, Abigail Adams and Dolly Madison were all extremely active in the affairs of the government.It was gratifying to see that Clinton is very clear about the power of these women in the early years of the country. The popular history is that Eleanor Roosevelt was the first First Lady to become active, this myth should be debunked and it is done in this book. The role and history of the First Lady of the United States is something that should be learned in elementary school, as they can and do serve as role models for the half of the population that is female. This book makes that possible."},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, thinking I would learn something more about the region that's been so much in the news lately. It isn't really that kind of book; after all, the Middle East conflict is thousands of years old. Instead, I found a jewel of a novel. In some ways it reminds me of Demetria Martinez's MotherTongue, the poetry in the language -- it's also better, with a strong story line, characters that won't let you go, that are as real as your next door neighbor, even though they're not of my culture.

I agree with what all the reviewers, both professional and customers, have said. It has been one of the great reading experiences this year. I teach Middle East Studies here in Vermont and so must read a great deal about the area. But this transcends anything I've read to date because it is true fiction that also gives readers a window onto a distant time and place. Ms. Hamilton is, without question, a superior novelist.

Although it is set just before the 1967 Israeli War, it isn't really a political novel. A reporter for many years in the region, Hamilton gets under the skin of her characters, from 11 year old Jammana, her Grandfather Harif, with whom she shares the gift (and sometimes curse) of seeing visions, to the rebellious midwife Faridah. This is a novel that will stay with you -- that will haunt you. Masha Hamilton is destined to be a major talent. It is a truly amazing novel."},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"Masha Hamilton has created a world steeped in mystery and tangled with superstition, ignorance and merciless retribution mostly affected against women. Her heroines stand their ground in a land where that can cost your life.

This praise does not come lightly. I truly felt I was there, every step of the way.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in great writing."},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"I picked up Masha Hamilton's novel, thinking it was a small book because it is, physically. I took it on a plane ride from Boston to London, and didn't stop reading it until I walked through UK immigration counter.

It has everything a great novel, or a great movie, must have: Unique characters, compelling plot, surprises of all sorts. A very special consciousness runs throughout &quot;Staircase...&quot; which must reflect on the author, who remains invisible throughout--a rarity with first novels.

Currently, she accompanies her mother Rafa on a visit to the latter's hometown of Ein Fadr where the same families can trace their roots to Abraham and Allah's strict rules.Jammana's beloved grandfather Harif also has psychic powers though his talent enables him to see into the future, making him somewhat of an outcast among the villagers frightened by that power. His spouse Faridah is a midwife delicately walking between tradition and independence. As Jammana struggles with her skills, her grandparents tell her tales of long-buried secrets. Meanwhile the confused Jammana alternates between believing she is damned vs. chosen while growing up rather fast when tragedy and betrayal strike.STAIRCASE OF A THOUSAND STEPS is a powerfully insightful look at life in a small ancient Jordanian village. This is not the usual westernized character study as Masha Hamilton's brilliant novel provides insight to a complex society especially the roles of women in what is typically described as simple and servant, but in this novel is much more. Fans of deep glimpses into small village life will fully relish this strong tale starring three generations of tremendously developed characters.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"(...)This is one book which all of our (book club) members enjoyed.

I think that all the political &quot;news&quot; misses the point of ordinary people's lives. So, that is one great thing about &quot;Staircase..&quot; The other is that Nothing here is ordinary. And since I love all kinds of intuitional and psychic stories, especially ones as realistic and fabulistic as this, I give it 5 stars and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"In the small village of Ein Fadr, just before the advent of the 1967 Israeli war, the world has hardly changed for centuries. The villagers live as if their ancestors still walk among them, nothing forgotten in the long history of generations that tread round and round, in the same deliberate path.Jammana wishes to see her grandfather, drawn to him by recurring dream's of her mother's difficult birth. Soon to leave Egypt for America, Rafa, takes her daughter across the desert miles for a last visit. She leaves Jammana in the care of her grandfather, Harif, and her great-aunt Khalah, of the gentle hands, as well as the village midwife, Faridah, who assisted in Rafa's delivery many years ago. The midwife is the one person Jammana secretly wants to question, because Faridah is also in the dream and Jammana had known and loved her all her young life. The very familiarity of Faridah is comforting to the child, her smells, her habits, her gathering of herbs to treat villager's ailments.When Harif's wife dies during her second confinement, Harif is at last free to be with the true and lasting love of his heart. Harif will be ostracized by this union of unequals, so, sacrificing her future, Faridah refuses his offer; they remain dear friends, but never man and wife. Over the years their bonds strengthen, allowing them a closeness that they treasure.But there is trouble brewing in this small village, as the ancestors seem to crowd upon their living relatives, and secrets are uncovered while old hostilities are rekindled. Ein Fadr is beset with petty complaints and jealousies and Harif finds himself accused of duplicity and no longer trusted. But he has troubles of his own, too preoccupied to worry about gossip, as the tension increases. Jammana continues to be haunted by her vivid dreams, anxious for Faridah and her grandfather, confused by the unsettled air of the village, where time passes but nothing changes. Finally, for Harif and Jammana everything changes, as the hot desert sun holds everything motionless in its fierce and unflinching gaze."},{"Title":"Staircase of a Thousand Steps","review":"How do you write a review on a book that hasn't yet arrived?

Jammana is an intensely emotional child torn between the ancient way of life represented by her mother & her family in Ein Fadr and modern times represented by her father who sees no future for them in the Mid-East and wants to go to America.I was attracted to this book because it seemed to promise insight into a culture I know so little about and it does that, there is an intimate look into the hearts and minds of several of the villagers. There is not much of real plot here though, rather most of this story is a child's memory.

She spent another five years in Moscow reporting on the break-up of the former Soviet Union.Having personally observed the culture and lives of Palestinian Muslims, Hamilton decided to put their story in fiction form. &quot;Approaching this fictionally allows you to find greater truths, I think, that you can't find strictly through journalism. And in fiction you have a right to go there and try to find the inner truths and, I think, sometimes the greater truths through that.&quot;One week after the terrorists attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Hamilton and a group of Tucson writers e-mailed a letter to their friends, asking those who agree to forward it to the President or Congress. Hamilton favors a U.S. military response to the terrorism, but is concerned about the President's resolve to punish all countries that harbor terrorists.&quot;If we answer evil with evil, that may not be something we want to do as a country,&quot; Hamilton says.The letter calls for a commission made up of quote &quot;our best minds, intellectuals, spiritual leaders, artists and philosophers, women, Arab-Americans and other minorities.&quot; The commission's job would be to suggest creative and precise U.S. responses to the attacks.&quot;These terrorists are absolutely fanatics, no question.

While below he decides he wants to make a cake for his crew and starts mixing random things together.

Great for any kid that likes pirates (or even those who don't--it's just a fun story)."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"This is an adorable children's book that is thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike! Cute humor is interspersed in this story of a jolly pirate. As one might imagine, a jolly pirate is not exactly ideal--or is it? And is there a reason for a pirate flag to be called The Jolly Roger? Read this book to find out. A great book to accompany this one is How I became a Pirate. This story has become a favorite in my second grade classroom. It was a great bargain. Share this book with a special child in your life. I love books that can combine humor with a plot that hooks kids; this is one of those books."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"While on the ship, Roger is constantly made fun of for his odd behavior as a pirate. He is constantly ridiculed and put below the deck when they attack someone. But, in the end, it's Roger's silliness that saves the day for the ship.Roger the Jolly Pirate is not only a well written book, but it's also very well illustrated. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys pirates. The vibrant colors and great detail make for very exciting pictures to match the text. They can easily catch ones eye. Also, the song at the end provides for a great closing to the story."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"This picture book illustrates the story of Roger, a bumbling pirate, whose attempts to be a great pirate fail miserably. When he tries to make a cake for his pirate buddies, it results in a fantastic event. He impresses his buddies so much that they honor him with a flag, the jolly roger. This book offers a light-hearted explanation for the grim subject of pirate imagery. It's fun to read aloud and has fantastic illustrations. I recommend it as a read aloud for four-year olds and up. Even second graders will appreciate the fun ending."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"Roger has a problem. He is too jolly and kind. Whenever there is a fight, the other pirates send him below and out of the way. Just before one fight was to begin, Jolly was again sent down below. He was sad that the other pirates didn't like him. He got a great idea! He would make them a cake. He found what looked like a big pot to bake the cake in. He put in any ingredients he could find. He stirred the ingredients. Jolly found a place to light the pot so that he could bake his cake. What a surprise! (You'll have to get the book to find out what it was.) All of the men they were fighting fled from fright. The other pirates thought Jolly was GREAT! They even made a flag to honor him. Most pirate ships fly this flag; they call it the Jolly Roger.This is a delightful pirate story. The illustrations are vivid and alive with action. The text is just the right length for preschool and above. One of my favorite pirate books!"},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"A story about a pirate who's just terrible at being a pirate! The story is silly and full of the great pirate terminology kids love to hear over and over. The illustrations are great too. We purchased this for our[...]nephew and a year later he still asks for it to be read to him over and over and over again. I have to say, I wasn't sure if he'd like it, and he didn't, he LOVED it! I recommend it for any little pirate!"},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"Created by the illustrator of the Lemony Snicket series, this rollicking and imaginative story is a \\"must\\" for any adventure lover, particularly a pirate lover who wonders about the origin of the frightening, skull and crossbones \\"Jolly Roger\\" flag. Helquist's fictional explanation even provides an important lesson for any child was treated or treated another child like a misfit or outcast: Be nice to misfits because they may be very helpful to you one day! Here, Roger is a \\"lousy pirate\\" who \\"couldn't tell the starboard from the larboard, the windward from the leeward, or the mizzen from the main.\\" A misfit who \\"smiled instead of scowling,\\" \\"grinned instead of growling,\\" and \\"never struck fear in any sailor's heart.\\" The \\"real pirates\\" disapprovingly call him \\"Jolly Roger\\". Whenever there is \\"serious pirating to be done,\\" he is banished to the ship's hold. But, bumbling Roger manages to become an unlikely hero. Helquist tells the story in lively, whimsical, humorous verse that's flawlessly matched by his hilarious, lively, and bold illustrations in watercolor, pencil, and pastel. The \\"Ballad of Jolly Roger\\" provides a nice finish. Highly recommended for ages 4 and up."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"If your kids like pirates, they will like this one. This is one that get's chosen for the bed time book a lot."},{"Title":"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","review":"The book was definantly written for smaller children as my nephews are 4 and 7, the 4 year old loved it, but the 7 year old not as much. If a person does know what a Jolly Roger (a pirate flag) really is well then you can see it kind of takes it's real meaning and makes it for the age group the writter was aiming at, in my opinion being 5 and younger. However there is fault in that by saying, they are little and don't understand when someone is using a gentler, kinder way to explain something really rough, they see it as the truth. So let's just say that yes you can read this at bed time with no problem. But if you have a kid like the 7 year old, he started reading everything about real Jolly Roger's and found fault and un truth, a baby book in his eyes."},{"Title":"Assessing Allegations of Sexual Abuse in Preschool Children: Understanding Small Voices (Interpersonal Violence: The Practice Series)","review":"This is the standard for sex assessment of young children. Dr. Hewitt has made a valuable contribution and her work has a research base for keeping children safe and convincing the court regarding child vulnerability."},{"Title":"Assessing Allegations of Sexual Abuse in Preschool Children: Understanding Small Voices (Interpersonal Violence: The Practice Series)","review":"I am a certified family law specialist who practices primarily in the areas of child custody and child welfare law. I wrote the book Child Sexual Abuse in Civil Cases for the American Bar Association and have handled child sexual abuse cases for 35 years. Family courts have a difficult time knowing what to do when there are credible allegations that preschoolers have been molested by their fathers, but there is not enough evidence to meet the evidentiary standard to stop visitation. In such cases judges often just treated the case as if there were no allegations at all, a reckless approach that provided no safety for the child. In 1991 Dr. Hewitt published an article, Therapeutic Management of Preschool Cases of Alleged but Unsubstantiated Sexual Abuse, 70/1 CHILD WELFARE 59, at 61-64 (January-February 1991), which revolutionized the way these cases could be dealt with in a way that protected and empowered the child, reassured the mother, and allowed safe contact between the father and child. I was so impressed by her protocol that with the publisher's permission, I included a portion of that article in a legal treatise I wrote, Handling Child Custody, Abuse and Adoption Cases, at Appendix 16-5. I was thrilled when Dr. Hewitt expanded that article into this book, which has allowed mental health professionals to become trained in how to implement Dr. Hewitt's protocol in their own cases. I have been successful in getting courts to order the use of the protocol in appropriate cases, which has worked very much to the benefit of children who would otherwise have been left unprotected. This book is a unique game-changer that should be on the shelf of every mental health professional, lawyer, and judge who handles child sexual abuse cases and every parent who is concerned that good-faith allegations are not being taken seriously. The protocol is useful even if it turns out that the child was not, in fact, molested, because parents and child will have clear boundaries, which can only help both the child and the parents. I give this book my highest recommendation possible."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"&quot;The Port Wine Sea&quot; starts out well, with a laugh-per-paragraph for O'Brian fans (the first sentence is, as parody, dead-center perfect), but for me, the joke wears thin quickly. There's just not enough to fill out an entire book."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"To enjoy this great little parody to the utmost, you need certain qualifications. One, you have to have read (and loved) the POB Aubrey/Maturin series. Secondly, you have to have a sense of fun. Thirdly, to have to enjoy someone having a real ball playing with words (and music). With those qualifications, you will have a wonderful time, for there is no joke like the &quot;in-joke&quot; -- and this is what this fun with &quot;Captain Audibly&quot; and &quot;Stephen Natterling&quot; (who needs his daily pint of opium to function on three cylinders) is all about (they even get to meet with Horatio Hornbearer, with predictably hilarious results. This is a great little book for a rainy day or a long, tedious flight -- except that it would be nice to have a like-minded friend beside you, so you could read out delicious tidbits every now and then. Brava, Susan Wenger!"},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"Obviously being a breast thumping member of MENSA does not automatically mean one posesses side splitting humor. This novel is nothing if it isn't less funny and less creative than the original novels.Relying only on the most obvious gags, this novel makes &quot;Three's Company&quot; style humor out of an already humorous series. The only things missing here are canned laugh tracks and a sailor who yells, &quot;DY NO MITE!&quot;I recommend reading the originals again for some real good laughs, and investing the money in something a bit more intelligent and a lot less self promoting."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"Many of the paragraphs are spot-on parody. There are many deliciously funny bits for the Patrick O'Brian fan -- just flip through and pick them out. But for those who like to immerse themselves in a well-told tale, the book quickly grows tedious. One of O'Brian's strengths is the ability to describe his fictional world vividly enough to draw the reader in The sheer density of Wenger's parodied rephrasings of various bits of various books in the Aubry-Maturin series becomes a string of interruptions -- an impediment to the reader who wants to enter the world she is creating. Wenger's approach could make for a brilliant short humor piece. Always leave them wanting more!This is true of any number of parodies, so I suppose it is unfair to complain. This book is certainly more clever and intelligent than &quot;National Lampoon's Doon&quot; (parody of Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot;).Certainly not a must for fans of Patrick O'Brian, but probably enjoyable for those who love parodies."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"I thought this was the funniest book of the year. I laughed out loud all the way through. A must For O'Brian fans."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"Ms Wenger's re-working of Patrick O'Brian is simultaneously raucous and deep, as perhaps only a truly affectionate parody can be. Port-Wine Sea pokes cheerful fun at our devotion to O'Brian and his characters rather than at the books or - Heaven forfend! - the author himself."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"This is a hilarious book for O'Brian fans. A spoof of the entire series, a laugh on every page. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"I love the Aubrey novels. I love a good parody. I love an atrocious pun. I love clever and obscure wit. I hate...well no...I dislike this book. It is dull, clunky, disjointed, repetitive and unimaginitive. I sense that Mrs. Wenger was unsure if she was writing a parody, or trying to write a story for inclusion in the series. The author alas demonstrates how so many bright people are also seen to be dreadful bores. I am halfway through the book and I fear I will do what I almost never do...put a book away unfinished. No greater disrespect can I show for any book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"Its a shame, but i'm only up to chapter four and I'm having trouble keeping awake. The author is perhaps a bit too proper to write a good parody. This O'brian series is a delight but it is also plump and ripe for a rollicking, wicked, down-and-dirty lampooning. Mrs Wegner just isn't up to it (as if you couldn't tell she's just too nice of a lady from her picture). So far the jokes are tedious, thin, and lacking in depth. I really really wanted this to be good, but its not, which is a shame after all the work I had to go to to locate a copy.Don't waste your time, this would do better as fan fiction on a web page. Me...I'm going to reread Bored of the Rings to remind myseld of what a parody is supposed to be. (To be fair parody is tough...the harvard lampoon failed pretty badly on their 2nd try, Doon.)"},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"Life is entirely too serious! Take a break from ponderous thinking and buy this book! Susan not only pokes fun at Jack and Stephen but gets a few jabs in at Hornblower as well. This is not an insulting parody but one written by someone who truly appreciates Patrick O'Brian's style. Entertaining! And Susan in a dead shot with a jelly bean in a crowded theater as well! Such a talented author!!"},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"First, a word of warning. DON'T read this on any form of public transport. You will chuckle, chortle, laugh out loud, guffaw, and eventually find yourself upside-down out of your seat gasping for breath and giggling feebly whilst the other passengers contemplate you with pity, sympathy and the Heimlich Manouevre.It is hilarious, no two ways about it.But, as others have noted, you need to be a fan of Patrick O'Brian's books to get the full impact, otherwise most of the broadsides will sail in one eye and out the other. For those who know what Susan is talking about, this book is a hoot.It is a gem, and it was one of the hilarious highpoints of my life to read it for the first time. I don't think my sides have stopped aching since.Susan is a deep thinker, and I am afraid that she lapses into philosophy towards the end. Good stuff, to be sure, but I was hoping for more sustained laughter and I was disappointed at actually having to engage my brain to get through it all.But, that minor niggle aside, this is a great book for fans of Patrick O'Brian, and there is a joke on every page. A joke in every sentence on some pages, and these are where you need to tighten your seatbelt to survive the trip!"},{"Title":"The Port-Wine Sea, A Parody","review":"A parody neither particularly inspired nor artful which, like most works of this type, grows tiresome when the novelty wears off after the first few pages. I can't recommend it unless you're a die-hard Patrick O'Brian fan who's devoured the whole series (and similar works by other writers) and is at a complete loss for something to read."},{"Title":"Sugar Ray","review":"This books really (disappoints)! One of the things that bothered me the most, was the overkill of references to other bands when trying to describe Sugar Ray. Korn was mentioned at least 7 times, as well as Rage Against the Machine and RHCP. The author (Anna Louise Golden) kept saying, twice to be exact, that Sugar Ray's sound was not \\"a million miles from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\\" And by page 112, Golden had concluded that \\"They'd stop trying to be another Korn or Limp Bizkit.\\"Plus, to what seems to me like major space fillers, Golden writes mumbo jumbo like \\"As 1999, drew to a close, and the new year, century and millenium began...(129)\\" It would have been just as effective if she just left it with \\"as the new year began.\\" I'm surprised she didn't go on and on to say \\"December 31st, the 24th hour of that day, etc.\\" Her writing is weak, both structurally and grammatically, but aside from that, content-wise. For a great portion of the book, the author analyzes each and every song!That it is LAME!!! It's basicaly a big album review. Golden has no idea how to critique either. She dissects each song, adds some BS comment, then always concludes with \\"it all combines to work beautifully.\\" Uh, duh!Throughout the book, there were innaccurate facts and quotes. On page 141, she mentions the band's nomination, but NOT successful win, in the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards in Favorite Group:Modern Rock, 1998. Finally, she just straight up doesn't know one band member from another. On 143, Golden writes \\"For Craig, one of the greatest moments was opening for KISS, who'd originally inspired him to pick up a guitar and make music.\\" HELLO?!?!? That's RODNEY, not Craig.Major scarcity on new info. too. The stuff that she mentions we (for all the diehards out there =) have already read over and over again in mags and on the net. Here, she compiles it with the three album reviews. Woopee. Stuff that I didn't know: Mark's dad was a real-estate developer, Gretchen's a counselor, Craig's BMW has a tv in it and he lives in West Covina. So there, now you don't have to read the book!The only good thing was the pics and the 10 Seconds Down recognition. BUT, the author failed to mention OTHER great websites! The fan sites that she did mention, she managed to pull off of the UBL listing...Wade's Sugar Ray page, Tekuila's, and Peaches. Wade's and Tekuila's haven't been updated since '98 and Peaches was under construction at the time of the writing. Why these three sites??? Sarah And Michele's \\"Rod Is God\\" site is MUCH MORE qualified than the ones in the book, both on strong content and web design merit. (...) All these deserving fan sites, with no acknowledgment.Anyways, it just goes to show how people will (write) for a buck these days."},{"Title":"Sugar Ray","review":"It probably took the writer less time to write this than it will for you to read it. It's one of those pulp books that get churned out quickly, in case the pop sensation it's about fades before the book hits the shelves. But if you know nothing about this band, this a decent place to start. I went to the same high school (Corona del Mar High School) as Mark McGrath and Stan, so, aside from loving their music, I have a sentimental feeling for the band. (I graduated just before their freshman year, so missed them by a year, so never got to pass them in the school halls). It's funny to read, though, that Rodney played Shaka in &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; for 5 episodes because I knew in high school the guy who replaced him as Shaka: Philip Paley! Which means, too, I'm afraid, that Rodney is older than he lets on! I don't care. I love Sugar Ray!"},{"Title":"Sugar Ray","review":"I got this book at my local bookstore and it is really good.

Harold Monkhouse is a very sick man but no one including his docter seems to know what is wrong with him. When he is found dead of arsenic poisioning, hisbrother demands an investigation. Who was behind thiscruel death; the loving wife, Barbara; her friend, Madeline or wallingford, the rather eccentric(to put it mildly) secretary?Rupert, their loyal friend enlists the help of Dr. Thorndykewho with alot of twists and turns solves the case. this is a\\"cant put down\\" mystry."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Like so many English majors, I had to read the title essay in a theory class I took in college. The thing that really impresses me about Sontag is how she incorporates so many different reference points (Benjamin!) into her writing, which add a tremendous sense of richness and history to her thinking. The quality and methods of her analysis are spot on, and her style has a tightness and (I think) a forcefulness which is often lacking in contemporary cultural analysis. As with Foucault, her ideas have substantial implications across a wide variety of disciplines and perspectives."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I looked at this book years ago. It interested me because I am a photographer. I was struck by her small understanding of the photographic process. She is just wrong many times like someone writing about music who does not realize there are different key signatures. Her book reads like a college sophomore who has just discovered sexual symbols in the world around her and is applying them willy nilly to everything around her. She makes pronouncements without substantiating them. The sophomore would probably get a C for effort by the TA. I saw a youtube.com video of her recently and she was the same regal oracle making pronouncements again with no substantiation, about as convincing, but less witty than William F. Buckley. No real interest in understanding is there, just enlightenment flowing from the noble brow, daring you to question the received truth. Silly book and silly woman who knew how to negotiate academe. Why is it that people follow the direction of the the most pretentious charlatans? Why don't their BS meters work?"},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Even for $2.50 this book would be a waste of money.The only thing it contains is waffle. Elitist, pretentious, contentless waffle.This book is for people that believe that likening a camera to a male reproduction organ makes sense.One really wonders whether Susan Sontag (former partner Annie Leibovitz) became jealous of photography and needed to get some hatred down on paper.Here are a couple of quotes from the book:\\"The method [photography] especially appeals to people handicapped by a ruthless work ethic---Germans, Japanese, and Americans. Using a camera appeases the anxiety which the work-driven feel about not working when they are on vacation and supposed to be having fun. They have something to do that is like a friendly imitation of work: they can take pictures.\\"\\"The camera as a phallus is, at most, a flimsy variant of the inescapable metaphor that everyone [that includes you] unselfconsciously employs. However hazy our awareness of this fantasy, it is named without subtlety whenever we talk about \\"loading\\" and \\"aiming\\" a camera, about \\"shooting\\" a film\\".\\"\\"[Photography] is the most successful vehicle of modernist taste in its pop version, with its zeal for debunking the high culture of the past (focusing on shards, junk, odd stuff; excluding nothing); its conscientious courting of vulgarity; its affection for kitsch; its skill in reconciling avant-garde ambitions with the rewards of commercialism; its pseudo-radical patronizing of art as reactionary, elitist, snobbish, insincere, artificial, out of touch with the broad truths of everyday life; its transformation of art into cultural document.\\"I say no more."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"The book was good but hard to follow at times. Very interesting to read and leaves you thinking about the world and photography."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I purchased this book for my photography class. Thus far the book has been quite interesting indeed. Even if it were not a required book for the class, I would have purchased it. Great information!"},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I liked it fine except the way it shows up on my PC screen, and then adjusting to reading it differently then normal reading for me."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"This book is a classic. Even though it was written in the 1970s, it is as relevant today as it was then. A great perspective on photography, how it relates to the other arts, and its place in our society."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. First read this back in the 70's when it came out and I was a photographers assistant in a popular studio. Flash forward 40 years and I reread the book recently to find that my annoyance with Sontag and her ideas has not changed. Her affair with photographer Leibovitz notwithstanding, Sontag is a dilettante regarding photography and tries to pack as many 50 cent words into a sentence as possible. This doesn't pass for brilliance on the subject, just time wasted when I could be out damaging someones soul by photographing them."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I just graduated from art school with a BFA in Photography, and now that I'm free of classes all I want to do is...read art theory!! I've read a lot of passages and chapters from the \\"greats\\" in my course studies, but there's just something different about sitting down and reading them in their entirety and really digging into the work in context. Sontag is a name that always pops up when talking about photo theory and for good reason! Sontag is a brilliant, fluid writer; her prose is not so verbose as to obscure her message (like some theorists I could name!), rather her eloquence draws the reader in. She challenges the reader to think about photography in new and different ways. I can't seem to go a few pages without finding a line that speaks to me, whether because it matches up with my own philosophy, addresses a significant trend in photography, or challenges me to consider a new perspective. Of course, I never take an author's message as fact without serious consideration, weighing it against and combining it with other knowledge and opinions - I wouldn't be a very good student if I just believed everything I read! But Sontag makes me think and I like that. \\"On Photography\\" is relevant to my understanding of art history, contemporary photography, and my own photographic practice. In short, this book makes me excited about photography, and what more can you ask from a book on photo theory?"},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Susan recants many of the things she says in On Photography in her book Regarding the Pain of Others published in 2003."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I selected this book as a required reading for next semester's Contemporary Trends class, even though the collection was published over 30 years ago. Part of what makes Sontag's essays such a compelling read is how the concepts can be applied to photography in the digital (filmless, Photoshopped, sharing / authoring) environment. Not as much has changed as the reader might initially think, and Sontag's concepts still have reach. Consider her chapter on \\"Melancholy Objects\\" and note how her claims about the Surreal nature of photography prove the redundancy of many digital manipulations. Especially for the aspiring photographer and the sensitive viewer of photographs, Sontag's book provides good grounding in a noisy age."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"These essays helped the scholarship of photography get a fair shake. Even the publication of them in a book was a noteworthy entry in the history of photography. It is easy to look back now and criticize this book, which is basically an intellectual discipline in its infancy, but it remains important. I actually still enjoy the writing, which I find warm and inviting - not because of the tone, but because of the author's sense of adventure. It might be closer to a flight of fancy than a disciplined philosophy, but you have to start somewhere. I still think this is one of the best, most accessible reads on the subject."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Before I read this book I heard from my photography master \\"I wouldn't buy it. I'm afraid it's too loaded with all that artistic talking we hear everywhere around. You know, I would start photographing stones, bushes and claim it as a great fine art. I would stop seeing photography\\".Well, I didn't start photographing bushes, after all, so stop worrying ;)This is not a book one can read at one sitting, nevertheless, it's worth recommending. Susan wrote about many things aspiring photographers think about - despite she wasn't photographer herself.I'm convinced that for reading this book one has to know a little bit about Photography Masters, their work and Photography at all. It's not a book for beginners, but worth trying. To encourage you, here is what Susan wrote in it:\\"The ultimate wisdom of the photographic image is to say, 'There is the surface. Now think - or rather feel, intuit - what is beyond it, what the reality must be like if it looks that way.\\""},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Imagine, a book &quot;on photography&quot; without even a single photograph! Well written, thought provoking, but a too little rambling for my taste. The structure of some of these loosely organized essays just eluded me. Where is she going? When did she get there, if she did indeed get there?Also, the author assumes that the reader can instantly recall all the photographs she mentions. If some of the more important ones (by this I mean the ones she refers to most often) had been reprinted in the book, it would have made following her arguments much easier. But then, there is a certain type of intellectually-minded author who doesn't really want the reader to understand his/her book ..."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"if you have a serious interest on photography, this book is a must buy. It keep pushing you on considering the meaning of taking a pic, the relationship between the real world and photography, and many other perspectives related to photography. It provide large amount of examples to support its views. I truly think this book is a bible for every photographer. Even if we enter the digital era of photography, the content of this book isn't out of date and have precious value.Regard to the fact that there is no picture in the whole book, I think that is a right choice. Any presented pictures will limit the universality of discussion, rather than realize it.Overall, I give five star for this remarkable, historic book."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"S.S offers an in-depth and original analysis of what she considers to be the most important photographers from the beginnings of photography until the mid-late 70s. She questions the validity of the pretentious claims made by photographers, the relation the medium shares with the world as we know it, it's effect of creating a visual catalog, she also offers a response to the long expired debate on whether or not photography is an art.S.S proves to be an expert on photography by offering analysis which offers well-documented contextual information on photographers such as Diane Arbus, Richard Avdon, L.Hine, E.Weston, E.Steichen etc...\\"On Photography\\" is considered by many specialists to be a work of reference in regards to criticism and philosophy on photography, and after reading it I can understand why.\\"On Photography\\" is a great tool for understanding the evolution of photography from its beginnings throughout the 20th century and for seeing the camera for what it is- nothing more, nothing less. I would recommend it to art critics, anyone who is passionate about photography or interested in the history of photography, photography as an art form and its limits."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"The first and last essays of this book were surprisingly readable. I expected to find it quite dense, and it was, in places."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I originally purchased this book based on the extraordinary, glowing reviews - you know, the same ones on the back cover: \\"book of great importance and originality\\", \\"the most original and illuminating study of the subject\\", \\"raises important and exciting questions\\" etc. etc. etc.Since buying it, I've attempted to plow through it at least 4-5 times, managing to get about 3/4ths through. And I LIKE philosophy and alternative thinking! The problem I think, is that much of what Sontag writes about photography is simply wrong. That leaves out what is self-contradictory, such as saying (as I would characterize it) in one place that modern and documentary photography is manipulative and exploitive, while elsewhere saying it is meaningless (at one point saying a photo of a dwarf is, after all, just a dwarf).Photography as an art form - even without considering digital photography and up-to-date image manipulation and creation - is, like any art form, foremost about point of view. That's a commonplace notion that taught in photography texts and mentioned in countless art books. Sontag starts with this and points some of them out - the idealism of early photographers imitating painterly scenes, for example.No problem so far. Where Sontag strays, however, is in assigning personal, cultural, and political motive to the points of view taken, and casting them in the worst possible light. So in her view the photographer becomes \\"aggrandized\\" as a \\"self-expressing ego\\", his work (put in the most over-wrought fashion) \\"a heroic copulation with the material world\\"! She even goes after the motives of snapshooting tourists, characterizing picture-taking as an anxiety-driven imitation of work! This sort of blue-in-the-face prose reminds me of nothing so much as conspiracy theorist and expose writing.The book was ill-timed because it came just as the world was diving full-on into the internet, in the process transforming photography again. All of a sudden, photos, videos, graphics, and derivative and creative versions of them are embedded into everything we do, at every level of art and expertise, from every direction, and seemingly from everyone. In this world, the oppressive and heavy-handed motives Sontag ascribes to photographers and those who use images in evil ways are swept into irrelevance. It's not that such things don't exist - witness the controversy over the Time magazine cover shot of O.J. Simpson, as a small example - it's that when incidents like this are one among millions or billions in a world where people create their own connections, communications, and communities, and the old mainstream press and book publishing world has lost its position in the world, much of what she argues ceases to have importance even if you accept it.My recommendation is to pass On Photography by.

This book is for those who wish to take a wild ride upon a bucking whirlwind of a mind as it rides across the landscape of photography."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Photography, probably more than any other medium, is emblematic of the nature of modern Western society. Photographs are concerned chiefly with appearances, they are deceptively nuanced but essentially narrow, yet somehow they find great breadth in their mechanization and ubiquity. And, like our society, they tend towards an ultimate reduction of the dimensionality of time. Through photographs the past blends into the present, flattening into an omni-present &quot;now&quot; in which history loses its philosophical weight as it increases in familiarity. In a sense photographs are the ultimate invention of a humanist-capitalist society: they provide the commodification of memory itself! And like the society which originated them, they provide equal portions of help and harm, of truth and of fiction; they have undeniable value, but they also result in a certain loss of innocence, and of deeper values.The six essays in this book (all of which were originally published in the New York Times Review of Books) provide a critical evaluation of these themes. Ms. Sontag is concerned with what she sees as the cheapening of experience that the proliferation of photographs in our society has caused. She argues that photography has enshrined a superficiality of experience and contributed to the overvaluation of appearances to a point where image has (subconsciously) replaced reality as reality. In many ways this shift in our modes of cultural perception is shattering; it is also completely inevitable and irreversible. As an example: who after seeing Ansel Adams's stunning photographs of Yosemite could help feeling slightly underwhelmed when experiencing the real thing? Certainly, Yosemite in person retains a certain cachet simply for its &quot;bigness&quot;, but the mystique, the mysticism of the Adams photo is going to be missing from most people's experience of the real place. The image genie is out of the bottle... and Sontag is here to tell us that we have to live with the consequences of its release. On Photography is a lengthy exploration of the implications of the genie's (photography's) work on society. The book is full of insights into the meaning of an image-saturated society, but you won't find many conclusions at the end. It is, as a good work of criticism should be, a collection of numerous deep and provocative statements with few prescriptions. Sontag leaves it up to you, the reader, to sort out the pieces for yourself.In fact, one of the things I found most interesting about the essays was that although Ms. Sontag evaluates many of these societal trends she doesn't seem to have a strictly negative response to any of them. Her attitude seems to be that if, for instance, the easy availability of images of Half Dome makes us enjoy Half Dome itself somewhat less, that rather than stopping looking at pictures of Half Dome or photographing Half Dome we should instead re-evaluate what experiencing Half Dome really means to us. Since we've invented a new society, and new ways of looking at society and nature, it's requisite upon us that we also invent new ways of understanding our experience of life and society. I actually agree with her on this: it's okay to wax nostalgic about the idyllicism of life before the advent of the image-saturation that we have today, but there's no way to go back to that idyllic society. Our time would be better spent in learning to deal with (and shape) our present society than in trying to shift back to an older, now completely lost, ideal of society.Sontag wants photographers to reach a deeper understanding of the implications of their work. She's not asking the photographer-reader to put down his camera and take up a brush or pen instead, but she is saying that without some grasp of the meaning of photography to society photographers are not very helpful or socially desirable creatures. One of the points that she makes, touching on this, is that our traditional understanding of photography in relation to the other arts is flawed. Photography itself isn't actually an art-form, like painting or music. Or in her words, &quot;Like language, it is a medium in which works of art (among other things) are made. Out of language, one can make scientific discourse, bureaucratic memoranda, love letters, grocery lists, and Balzac's Paris. Out of photography, one can make passport pictures, weather photographs, pornographic pictures, X-rays, wedding pictures, and Atget's Paris.&quot; Artistic photography without theme, photography without intent, is about as valuable as fiction without characters or plot. Photographers persist in photographing meaningless objects and minutiae, simply because this is what the &quot;great&quot; photographers have done, instead of trying to draft their own statements and follow their own visions. (Curiously, Edward Weston's photographs of his toilet are actually art; however, my pictures of my toilet would not be art, because I cannot photograph my toilet with any understanding of the meaning of these photographs, and so cannot have any pretensions towards the artistic value of these photographs.)I believe that anyone who photographs should read this book, whether they merely take casual photos while on vacation or are pursuing photography as their career. We all need to reach an understanding of the act of picture-taking, because only with some sort of understanding can we give our work a sense of direction. And only with direction can photography become more than cultural noise, desensitizing us through over-exposure to cliches and making banalities out of the profound."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I am not a big fan of artistic criticism: I often find it pretentious and prolix. Sontag's essays can be described by these adjectives, at least on first reading. I suspected that critics are inherently like this (until I read Nancy Newhall), but I reread \\"On Photography\\" recently and have changed my opinion slightly: critics can be pretentious, but that is the nature of the task.Sontag's essays are complex and thought provoking, eliciting a flow of ideas that one needs to think about deeply: what is a photograph and how does it convey its message? How much truth does a photograph contain, if any? The answer to that last question is much more difficult with the advent of digital photography and the wonderous (or evil, depending on your viewpoint) manipulations that can be done in the digital darkroom.An issue that isn't discussed in great depth is the relationship between candid snapshots on one end of the spectrum, and fine art photography on the other; Photography as a medium for artistic expression vs. a medium for recording reality (or unreality or surreality).The book is not trivially understood: references to philosophy and art history abound, and a dictionary of philosophy and art is almost a requisite. You should also expect to read this a couple of times to get the full impact: do not make your judgement based on a first reading."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book. I still can't believe some of the things I read. Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an \\"obsession\\" with photography. I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography.She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape. To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience. But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision. Self-consciousness is not exactly rape. Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns. The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all. Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description. Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy \\"steals\\" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain. This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books. Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been \\"stealing\\" other people's lives, their pain, etc. Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin. I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes. How is Strand's photographing the famous \\"Blind Woman\\" different from Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood?\\"My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation. She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops. For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche. Really? Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded. I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the \\"everyone\\" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her.Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre. Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world. I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography.One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically. This is despite her inclusion in her \\"Anthology of Quotations\\" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them. Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera. Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's \\"After the Fall,\\" which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe. There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty. In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and \\"stealing the pain of others\\" than does photography."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"This is the ONE book I always tell my students to read, not because they will be better photographers but, because they will be better equipped to see and understand how photographic images have influenced our culture and our self- images.This is now more important than ever in the age of digital photography and images which are crafted to manipulate our feelings and decisions to consume, vote, love and even whether we like ourselves.It establishes a consciousness about the subject which is incisive and memorable. It is a brilliant work and a great contribution."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Sontag is first and formost a philosopher. Her book is a series of essays that were first published in New York Magazine and later compiled for this book. As such, each essay is distinct and does segue easily to the next. Be prepared with these tools when digesting On Photography: a French dictionary, an English dictionary and a philosophy reference book i.e. Bloom's Closing of the American Mind. From the first essay, In Plato's Cave and onto through to Through Images Darkly (an analysis of Diane Arbus' work), once must be familiar with Plato's Republic and know what Arbus' photos look like.

I will say loud and clear that this is not for all, and would suggest reading the 1 ratings here before you move on to purchase this book - it does depend a lot on your character. I do see truth in these ratings and understand them 100%. I personally see another side as well, respecting all regarding this book. It is not typical.I had initially picked up this book for graduate studies in photography, but voluntarily as a secondary resource. Now - as someone whom has been interested in and working with photography for 23 years now I found this book to be quite \\"fresh\\". It takes you by surprise and Sontag presents a lot of extreme ideas that will not be useful, I feel, to the average citizen looking at developing their photographic eye. So, if you just picked up a new digital slr and want to take better portraits, or read about photoshop, this is not the book you are after.If however you have 30ish book on your shelf (on photography) and enjoy reading artists views that may be philosophical, and want something off the wall compared to most of the books you will find - you may now be in a zone of interest. Her writing will make you stop, think, question, and refute. Is this not fine for literature to do? And when you think of some of her \\"strong\\" metaphors being presented you may even be able to find some truth if you think long enough.If you are interested in the \\"world\\" of photography and want to read about uncommon hidden games of photography - get the book, and beware that it may cause queasy feelings from time to time. I personally think this is effective literature. And as of Dec 2010 a price of $10 for the curious mind - it is hard to go wrong. At minimum a interesting artifact to discuss."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Every so often one reads about tourists who are found strangled with the strap of their cameras in some obscure alleyway of Bangkok or Manila. Or New York. The camera is invariably missing, of course, and one would wish that the perpetrator had left a message on the body explaining the crime. A copy of ON PHOTOGRAPHY placed on the victim's chest would splendidly communicate most of the motivations for such murders.People who possess even the rudiments of sensitivity become aware, without any necessary explanations, that holding a camera is not unlike holding a gun. It conveys upon the possesor raw power, whether it is wanted or not. How this power is used may result on the strangulation of the photographer.This book, in a much more elegant way, is about such things. Its essays should be included as part of the operating instructions of all cameras sold in the US. I think that even the users of disposable cameras should read this book because it will not only improve their camera work, but their souls, also.There are some shortcomings to the book. For one it does not have an index, a sin I find hard to forgive in any book of this nature. Nor does it contain any pictures, a most disconcerting fact. For as early as page 7 we are told that David Octavius Hill and Julia Margaret Cameron were early masters of photography. Uh? Never heard of them. And so, as part of this excercise in gaining Kultur, I was forced to purchase Naomi Rosenblum's A WORLD HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY (available through Amazon[.com], naturally), a joyous addition to my book collection, and one in which I was able to find almost all of Ms. Sontag's references to photographers. Cameron and Hill were, of course, prominently discussed and their work carefully reproduced in Ms. Rosenblum's book. The two books in combination are wonderful; but, if on a budget, by all means consider that ON PHOTOGRAPHY is marvelous all by it self."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"This is a collection of six essays on the nature and practitioners of photography which were written by Susan Sontag in the early \`70's. Sontag herself could be wildly polarizing; the responses to this book, grouped in the 5-star and 1-star range reflect that. At the risk of appearing Clintonesque, I will \\"triangulate.\\"The bad is really bad. Sontag can do a wild rant with the best of them, straying far from any underlying logic. \\"Like guns and cars, cameras are fantasy-machines whose use is addictive.\\" \\"...like a man's fantasy of having a gun, knife or tool between his legs. Still, there is something predatory in the act of taking a picture. To photograph people is to violate them...\\"(!) \\"Just as the camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a sublimated murder- a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time.\\" What!! Why on earth don't the 5-star reviewers call her hand on this s...? Why is it that the vast majority of people WANT to have their photograph taken? A death wish?Like another reviewer, I wonder if she has ever taken a picture. Certainly no more than a \\"snapshot\\" that she routinely denounces \\"tourists\\" and other \\"low-brows\\" of taking. Consider the following: \\"Nothing could be more unlike the self-sacrificial travail of an artist like Proust than the effortlessness of picture-taking, which must be the sole activity resulting in accredited works of art in which a single movement, a touch of the finger, produces a complete work...One can't imagine the Overture toRemembrance of Things Past: Volume I - Swann's Way & Within a Budding Grove (Vintage)ending with the narrator coming across a snapshot of the parish church at Combray and the savoring of that visual crumb, instead of the taste of the humble madeleine dipped in tea, making an entire part of his past spring into view.\\" The \\"s-word\\" starts with \\"m\\" in French. Yes, tastes and smells can evoke memories, but photographs may be the most powerful in terms of stimulating some long-dormant neurons. Does any photographer compose? Reject? Repeat? Even spend hours developing their work? (at least in the pre-digital age when she wrote this). She mentions Edward Steichen's photography exhibit,The Family of Man The Greatest Photographic Exhibition of All Timebut does not discuss the last photograph, the one taken by perhaps the best photographer of the 20th Century, W. Eugene Smith. He had been badly wounded as a photographer in the Second World War, and struggled to compose the \\"perfect picture\\" for his post convalescent career. It is the memorable one of two small children, walking up, out of the woods, into the sunlight. Just a snapshot? Sontag moves from her brief discussion of the optimism of The Family of Man to the \`70's icon, the disturbing Diane Arbus, and spends much more time on her bleak vision, and her ultimate suicide.No question, Sontag has a brilliant intellect, and her erudition is impressive, ranging over the fields of art and literature. She even devotes almost a page to one of my favorite, and more obscure photography books, Bob Adelman's 1960's portrait of Wilcox County, Alabama, entitledDown home, Camden, Alabama (A Prairie House book). Even though somewhat positive, she still insists that it \\"descends\\" from Walter EvansLet Us Now Praise Famous Men (Penguin Modern Classics), and that the accompanying prose of James Agee is \\"sometimes overwritten.\\" An elitist Manhattan outlook to the core.I started this review with the concept that I should \\"triangulate\\" the extreme reviews, which should mean that this is a 3-star. Yet in writing it I've realized that someone of Sontag's intelligence should have UNDERSTOOD her subject far better before denouncing it and its practitioners. Thus, the triangle collapses to only a short line with a star at each end: 2-stars."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"After reading this book many will never pick up a camera again or even embark on the experience of photography. Sontag asks important questions photographers should answer before they open the shutter. It's so easy to point and shoot that capturing images can be done without thought. But asking yourself what is your motive or purpose can easily stop the process for want of an answer. I'm not talking about family or vacation snapshots. I'm talking about photos by those who aspire to art. Are you like Diane Arbus looking to capture weird and fringe people to show how democratic you are. Are you trying to shock or change opinions? What do you owe the people whose images you now have and can display whereever you desire even though you have proper releases? Where and how you show them can interpret their meaning. Are there some photos you should never take?Sontag's writing is tough reading because it's done in an academic style originally published in The New York Times Review of Books. If you aspire to photography as a means of self expression, read this book. It will ask the right questions."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"Sontag's On Photography was published in 1977. It includes six named sections which each tackle a slightly different subject. The sections were published independently as magazine articles years before the monograph was assembled--and this is plainly evident (which is my main 'complaint' about the text). The book does not feel or read like a book. It reads like a collection of six disparate essays that have been lightly edited for packaging as a book. The sections work OK as essays, but they fail somewhat as a monograph. For example, Sontag makes numerous assertions about photography which are stated as fact but not supported by any documentary evidence. While this is acceptable in an essay, in a monograph of this sort one would expect more academic rigor. Finally, each essay was clearly intended as an atomic piece and their collection in the book results in a large amount of re-hash of basic ideas at the start of every new section, as well as a very choppy flow between sections.The book is dated (which is entirely understandable--but true none-the-less). Sontag makes a single fleeting reference to digital photography as a quirky alternate method of capturing images. The text's discussion on the pervasive nature of cameras assumes the pinnacle of technology to be the Kodak Brownie. While this was arguably once true, photography has been so changed by digital capture and truly pervasive cameras (think cell phones, etc.) that many of the ideas of the text are only partially developed by today's standards. Additionally, Sontag's insistence that photography is the accidental but obvious champion of the Surrealist takeover of the arts is also dated. Sontag's insistence on using 'big' words and complicated sentences to describe simple things is also somewhat irritating; the tone is unmistakably that of 1970s/1980s critical academia.Having said that, the book occupies a fairly unique niche in the history of thinking about photography. As other reviews have noted, the subject material is (ahem) well focused on the topic and delivers interesting insight into various aspects of photography. It is unfortunate that Sontag did not more-fully edit the source materials into a cohesive text and at least attempt to look forward to a time when technological changes in process and artistic developments in taste could perhaps be different than the norms of the late 1970s."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"One line on page 14 says: \\"The camera/gun does not kill, so the ominous metaphor seems to be all bluff - like a man's fantasy of having a gun, knife or tool between his legs.Wow, I've never had one of these fantasies so I guess I must not be a real man."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"It is a great thing I had my pocket dictionary with me when I read this book.

As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses."},{"Title":"On Photography","review":"On Photography by Susan Sontag. Arrived within time.

Most obviously in his blithe assertion that if there weren't any theists in the world we'd live in a paradise: every ill in the world can be traced back to religion. While on his own professional ground discussing monkey behaviours, and a helpful summary of 'Theory of Mind' (how aware beings are of a) their own identity 'I believe'; and that of others b) 'I believe that you think'; and how deeply you understand their consciousness c) 'I believe that you think that I believe...- these are levels of 'intensionality') there's some interesting reading.But once he diverts into anything outside of that: sociology, linguistics, history - he's a total crackpot theorist - of exactly the ilk of some of the 18th century smug theist scientists he'd pillory. For example, as proof that different languages developed as conscious schemes to identify with one group against another, he tells the biblical story of the shibboleth. This would be OK as an example of what he's talking about, but he invests the story with the notion, 'That's what they did back then,' type generality.There are worse howlers, as when he says that language could never have come from gesture, as gesture is only mime and can never be used symbolically - as if deaf people don't use sign language. To such an objection he says, 'Oh, you couldn't use it at night, so it couldn't be significant.' Whether it is or it isn't, he can be so smug because he's talking about pre-history and will never have to fear disproof.

They range from divine gift to something derived from hunting gestures. With no fossil evidence available, all are speculative and defensible only by logical derivation. Dunbar has offered the most likely scenario for human language. Using persuasive evolutionary roots, tied securely to observed practices of our primate cousins, he builds a coherent picture. While the foundation rests on primate grooming practices, Dunbar shows how this activity led humans developing social interactions to become language. Because we, alone among the primates, also evolved the necessary physical equipment for speech, we are the ones who produced complex languages. Dunbar's account is presented in lively style, showing his own language skills to the full.It may seem a twisted path from scratching in your neighbour's fur to the complexities of human speech, but Dunbar clearly shows us how evolution traversed it. Part of the story lies in our adapting an upright stance and bipedal locomotion. The enlarged human brain, already given a boost by primates having a proportionally larger brain than other animals, also contributed. Our needs drove us to greater mobility leaving less time for interactive grooming. The brain's demand for resources turned grooming into a waste of valuable food gathering time. Speech was the means of retaining contact and the grooming habit was lost. The most important food gathering wasn't the hunt for meat, but the gathering of vegetables. Meat supplied only a small portion of the nutritional bulk compared to the vegetables garnered by the community's females. From this reality, Dunbar proposes speech developed more rapidly in females than in males.Dunbar's analysis doesn't stop at the edge of the African forest, but probes into parties, pub conversations and business meetings. No facet of human verbal communication has been overlooked in this survey of our speech habits. One element of our social structure lies in the size of our personal &quot;communities&quot;. Research shows that primate communities share a viable group size of about 150 individuals. Whatever your living circumstances, a careful count will show you probably interact closely with no more than that many other people. Dunbar shows that even in the urban environment, this figure holds. It isn't the number of neighbours we have, but how many people we communicate with personally. This figure derives from deep primate evolutionary conditions in which 150 was the likely group size in which we could develop effective social skills. &quot;Gossip&quot;, in Dunbar's view is simply a synonym for social communication. We talk more about people than we do about philosophy - or anthropology.In conclusion, Dunbar views the current communication environment with some caution. He notes that the rise of electronic communication hasn't replaced the practices we developed on the African savanna. All the promises of closer ties with distant people don't seem to have brought us together. He notes that e-mail and &quot;chat rooms&quot; are rife with rage and hate messages. People insult one another with the impunity of distance. Our verbal communication is still limited to that 150 member-sized group. Dunbar vividly shows how old ideas of human evolution must be seriously reconsidered. We can't reconstruct the steps of evolution, but we can investigate the possible scenarios to draw the most logical conclusions. Dunbar does this with wit and fine scholarship. It's a thorough and effective analysis deserving close attention.

Here are a few:1. Monkeys developed the ability to eat unripe fruit, dooming the ancestors of apes, chimps, and humans to starvation unless we came up with a response, since we depended on ripe fruit for survival.Our ancestors' response was to move out of the central forest and into the forest fringe, which made us more vulnerable to predators. We responded to THAT in three ways: selecting for a larger size, forming larger groups, and standing up (which allows better scanning for predators and less exposure to the heat of the sun).2. There are lots of social species, but to truly form small-group alliances, a species must be able to imagine what other members are thinking--and thus whether a particular other is a reliable friend or likely foe in the intragroup competition for food, safety, ..., etc. Dunbar calls this a Theory of Mind, and says that only primates seem to display it regularly.Only a Theory of Mind allows for deception (\\"he thinks that I think, but actually I...\\"), and possible deception means that there must be a reliable way to build alliances.3. Females of many species look for an expensive commitment from prospective mates--an elaborate nest, for example, that takes a long time to build. Their implied reasoning is that even if he's tempted to stray, he won't want to go through the hassle of building another big nest. Having to groom your closest friends and allies is the same kind of commitment.4. Dunbar's grad students have done studies of overheard conversations and newspaper contents, and generally discover that approximately 2/3 of a human communication is gossip about oneself or others.5. His theory was inspired by the correlation across primate species of group size, clique size, brain size relative to body size, and neocortex size relative to brain size. According to the graphs, the natural human group size is 150 people. (His arguments attempting to prove this hypothesis are interesting, but not among his most convincing.)This is a fun book, the kind of scientific speculation that lays out a broad theory and invites others to disprove it or come up with something better..."},{"Title":"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language","review":"Prof. Dunbar's book is an excellent read. But don't let its title fool you. His research covers a far wider range than you might expect. He offers a thesis as to how the various parts of the large brain evoloved to meet numerous environmental and social conditions. But the most intriguing part of the book comes in his discussion of optimal group size, an issue that will prove to be of crucial importance in the decades to come. Evolutionary biology and psychology will prove to be the uniting gospels of the future, and their teachings will have their most vital applications in the areas of social ethics, group size, and scale of lifestyle. Prof. Dunbar's book is a valuable opening foray into our own self-definition as a species."},{"Title":"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. Of course, the book is filled with speculation, but the author does a good job at explaining and often synthesizing competing ideas from various disciplines.

Great food for thought!"},{"Title":"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language","review":"The field of sociobiology leaped into our consciousness with the seminal volume by that name, written by the famous naturalist and expert on ant societies, Edward O. Wilson. Wilson was pilloried by social scientists and political activists, who considered any biological perspective on human society to be a sacrilege (see the beautiful and stirring account of Wilson's travails in Ullica Segerstrle, Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond. Oxford University Press, 2000). Sociobiology is founded on the insight that that there are many social species, not just humans, and that the structure of social life is a major force in the tempo and pace of genetic change in social species.In humans, social life is embodied in cultural forms that can be elaborated upon and passed from generation to generation. Thus sociobiology applied to humans leads to gene-culture coevolutionary theory, which studies the dialectical interaction between hominid genetic structure, the cultural evolution based on this genetic structure, and the effect of new levels of cultural sophistication on continued genetic evolution ---see Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Marcus W. Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution ( Princeton University Press, 1981) and Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson, Culture and the Evolutionary Process (University of Chicago Press, 1985).One aspect of gene-culture evolution in hominids is the continual increase in brain size and complexity from hominid origins to the present. Large brains are extremely costly to evolve and maintain. Large brain size required costly restructuring of the human birth canal and led to neoteny---birth before fetal maturation---which entails extended child-rearing and protection. Moreover, the brain requires ten times the energy of the average bodily organ, and uses about 20% of total calories consumed. What could counterbalancing advantages of large brains be?The conventional answer to the riddle of the large brain was the capacity to use tools skillfully, and the value of communication in facilitating mutualistic cooperation. Richard Byrne and Andrew Whiten ---Machiavellian Intelligence: Social Expertise and the Evolution of Intellect in Monkeys, Apes, and Humans (Clarendon Press, 1988)--- deepened the explanation by adding that there are severely conflicts of interest among members of a social group, and a large brain will help a group member to form alliances and understand complex social forces that might well increase his biological fitness. This insight is both correct and quite valuable, but it seems to imply that large brains confer no group-level fitness benefits, but merely consist of an expensive \\"arms race\\" the hurts the species as a whole.Robin Dunbar's contribution in this book is flows from a statistical relationship described graphically on page 63: There is a very strong correlation between neocortex ratio and mean group size in different genera of anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes and humans). Dunbar argues that there is survival value in larger groups, probably because larger groups can better defend territories and survive cataclysmic events, such as contagious disease and war. However, the complexity of group interactions increases with group size, and a large brain provides individuals with the raw materials for forging strong social ties that permit the group to overcome the purely Machiavellian tendencies described by Witten and Byrne. Language, for Dunbar, is not hypertrophied through the need to deceive, but is appropriate to the task of allowing groups of individuals to make clear subtle and conditional promises, threats, and social descriptions.What about grooming and gossip? There is strong evidence from observation of monkey and ape behavior that grooming is a major source of group cohesion. It is carried out for many hours a day, the animals love to be groomed, and grooming solidifies cooperative alliances with great regularity. Now humans have no fur, so they cannot groom. Dunbar suggests that gossip performs the same role in humans as grooming in monkeys and apes: both are functional mechanisms for social bonding. I find it hard to take this explanation seriously---it is the sort of just-so story for which evolutionary psychology is routinely criticized (e.g., Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin, \\"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 205 (1979):581-598.) The costs of a large brain are extreme, and the complex adaptations required to facilitate human communication through language and gesture are intricate and costly. It is implausible that an amorphous group-level function such as \\"group cohesion\\" could not have been ensured in a far more direct manner.However, Dunbar suggests a second mechanism, far more concrete, that was offered for the function of gossip by Magnus Enquist and Olle Leimar, \\"The evolution of cooperation in mobile organisms,\\" Animal Behaviour 45:747-757, 1993. Enquist and Leimar suggest that gossip may serve to maintain social cooperation by allowing individuals to develop good reputations for their altruistic contributions to the group and bad reputations for selfish and free-riding behavior. A good reputation is personally valuable and even fitness enhancing because others will want to form alliances (including marriage) with those who consistently behave altruistically and will shun and isolate those who are selfish and opportunistic.Of course, if the behavior of each individual were observed by all others, gossip would be unnecessary---each group member could judge for himself. But such is rarely the case. More generally, one or a few individuals will observe the behavior of a group member, and the member's reputation can be formed accurately only if his behavior is transmitted truthfully to the group. This is what truthful gossip does. If the Enquist-Leimar-Dunbar theory of gossip is correct, and I will argue below that it is, we have a very strong function for gossip, perhaps even strong enough to justify the immense costs of language acquisition.The key point in the reputational theory of gossip is that unless gossip is almost always truthful, it will not be believed, and hence it will not be performed. But why should individuals gossip truthfully, as opposed to simply saying whatever suits the personal needs at the time (as assuredly some people do---witness the Shakespearian tragedies King Lear and Othello)? This is an important and deep question that is not yet fully answered. I believe there is a two-part answer. First, there is an evolved human predisposition to tell the truth; people will of course lie, but most will lie only when the costs of truth-telling are fairly high. Indeed, were this not the case, human language and gestural communication could not have developed: why bother communicating if people simply tell you what is in their best interest to have you believe. Truth-telling is thus a precondition of the physiology and psychology of human linguistic and gestural communication. Second, humans are very good at detecting lies, so it is difficult for a habitual prevaricator to maintain his credibility---see Leda Cosmides, \\"The Logic of Social Exchange: Has Natural Selection Shaped how Humans Reason? Studies with the Wason Selection Task\\", Cognition 31 (1989):187-276.We thus have a tight causal loop involved with human gene-culture coevolution: hominids developed the ability to detect cheaters and the altruistic predisposition to punish anti-social behavior. This led to a vast increase in the value of linguistic and gestural communication, whence the evolution of an elaborate human communicative physiology (see my treatment in \\"Gene-Culture Coevolution and the Nature of Human Sociality, special issue on Human Niche Construction, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, forthcoming, available on my web site). This capacity for sophisticated and accurate information transmission led to an increased value of gossip as a mechanism of social control, and thence to a further articulation of human cooperative institutions.The experimental evidence in favor of this view has mushroomed in recent years. First, several studies showed that humans are consummate \\"indirect reciprocators,\\" willing to cooperate with others who have the reputation for honesty and altruism in collaborative affairs. For a recent overview of the evidence, see M. Milinski, D. Semmann and H.-J. Krambek, \\"Reputation Helps Solve the 'Tragedy of the Commons' \\", Nature 415 (2002):224-226 and Karthik Panchanathan and Robert Boyd, \\"A Tale of Two Defectors: The Importance of Standing for Evolution of Indirect Reciprocity\\", Journal of Theoretical Biology 224 (2003):115-126. The role of gossip in promoting reputation-building and indirect reciprocity is demonstrated in a recent article by Ralf D. Sommerfeld, Hans-J\\"urgen Krambeck, Dirk Semmann and Manfred Milinski, \\"Gossip as an Alternative for Direct Observation in Games of Indirect Reciprocity,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 104,44 (2007):17435-17440.So, all in all, Dunbar's book is highly innovatory and basically correct, well worth reading even if the reader is up to date on gene-culture coevolution and indirect reciprocity."},{"Title":"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language","review":"This book belongs on the shelf along with \\"The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\", \\"The Moral Animal\\", \\"Non Zero\\", \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" and \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\".

And if that is true, how, when and why did we develop this unique ability? Robin Dunbar's book \\"Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language\\" answers these questions about the origin and purpose of human language in an ingenious, convincing and thoroughly readable way. Comparing us with other primate species, the author shows how pressure from predators caused the early ancestors of chimpanzees and of humans to band together for protection. However, in these large groups social stress and bullying became almost as much of a threat as predators had been. How chimpanzees solved this dilemma with grooming, and how later hominids did so with language, makes for fascinating reading. As an extra, Dunbar weaves together ideas about how we developed poetry, adultery, the company lunch room, regional accents, and a host of other seemingly disparate themes into his extensive net. \\"Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language\\" answers questions you never knew you had, in a style which keeps you up far past your bedtime.

Strongly recommended for anyone interested in evolutionary psychology or cultural anthropology"},{"Title":"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and very much enjoyed it. Oddly enough, I was even able to make use of what I learned from it in my job.There are three main points to the book:1. There is an observed correlation between neocortex ratio (the ratio of the volume of the neocortex to the volume of the more primitive parts of the brain) and group size among social primates. Note that primate groups achieve cohesion partly through mutual grooming.2. Dunbar extrapolates this correlation to the human neocortex ratio, with a resulting group size of about 150. While such extrapolation potentially yields nonsense, in this case there is significant evidence that human group size does have a breakpoint at about this number. Hunter-gatherer village sizes, the organization of armies, parish sizes, and many more examples show a natural limit of between 100 and 200 people.3. Dunbar theorizes that the development of language was encouraged by the need for interaction among groups that were too large for mutual grooming. (Humans are not observed to groom each other the way other primates do, and a group of 150 is too large for this behavior because of the time that would be required.) In his theory verbal interaction--or, colloquially, gossiping--replaced grooming in humans.While Dunbar's theory is interesting, and may be right, even if it is wrong the book is worth reading for the first two points. It is very instructive regarding why groups work the way they do, and why large societies inevitably have bureaucracies.I read this book back in the days when Dan Golden was NASA Administrator, and pushing his \\"Faster, Better, Cheaper\\" approach to space exploration. (Which had both successes and failures.) I later had a government employee, who was planning a multi-billion dollar space program, ask me if I thought it could be managed with a \\"Faster, Better, Cheaper\\" approach, and I said no, it was too large. Although this seemed obvious, I then asked myself why that would be the case. I eventually put instinct together with Dunbar, and realized that you couldn't run a streamlined program if you couldn't keep the size of your core group to about 150 people who interacted with each other. Later reading of accounts of \\"Faster, Better, Cheaper\\" programs that succeeded, and reports from panels set up to examine failures, confirmed this conclusion.So I believe there is a message here for both small businesses and also for larger enterprises trying to decide how to structure programs.

The writer, Scott Lobdell, is pretty decent, trying to revamp the series by bringing it back to its comedic roots. He succeeds more or less, but while the dialogue is actually quite funny, Lobdell overkills it by narrating each issue way too comedically. Every page has a narrator box with some sort of joke and it is a bit too much. My other main complaint was the lack of story and plot, and villains. The villains were poorly introduced and I never was scared for Gen13 for a minute. I guess Lobdell was trying to lighten the series, but I think he needs to learn from Brandon Choi (the original writer) how to balance comedy with action and suspense. I was expecting issue 50 to be full of action and high stakes, but it was a total letdown in my opinion. That aside, Lobdell does do a good job developing the kids of Gen13, and I like a lot of the conversations the characters had with each other.The art is a huge plus for buying this book.

If, however, you want the full libretto with translations, and the full opera on CD, make sure you get the &quot;Black Dog&quot; version which is referenced as &quot;hardcover edition&quot; on the kid's version page. (Hope that makes sense!)"},{"Title":"The magic flute,","review":"This is sheer genius! Put the opera in CD form, and attach a nice picture book for children, and you have a perfect classic. I hope more books like this are on the way. This is a perfect introduction to a masterwork of opera.I confess that \\"The Magic Flute\\" is my favorite opera. It retells the ancient Freemason legends in opera and dramatic form, so you know that the story is rather primeval and sacred. I am glad, therefore, to see that someone has transposed the story for children. The book and the legend hold up well against \\"The Odyssey,\\" Shakespeare, and Harry Potter, and the story has an incredible soundtrack to boot.After all, we are really focused on the mysterious music and the incredible love story of Tamino and Pamina, and the trials that keep these two apart. The more I read and ponder the story, and ultimately its esoteric message, the more I love this story.The CD is perfect and without hiss or crackle. The book is geared for a 3-7 year old, and doesn't do the story justice. However, it is a great introduction to this opera."},{"Title":"The magic flute,","review":"The Black Dog Opera Library Series had outdone themselves once again. In this 1972 recording of Mozart's last opera, we are treated to a fine performance by fine singers, a fully illustrated book with liner notes and commentary, as well as information useful in biographies on the composer and his time. Mozart was close to his death bed at the time he composed The Magid Flute. He made an opera that could be enjoyed at many levels. At one level, it is a comic, brilliant fairy tale for children, at another level, it is deeply symbolic and layed with Masonic ideals of universal brotherhood and love. Mozart and his librettist were both Freemasons, a religous \\"sect\\" that was under hot water in 18th century Vienna for its pagan origins and its advocation of ideas of the Enlightenment. The story is about Tamino, a prince who is lost in a strange land (originally, a mystic Egypt), who is rescued from a serpent by three mysterious women and promised the hand of the daughter of the Queen of the Night if he saves her from the wizard Sarastro. Together with the help of the comic bird-catcher, Papageno, he sets out on his adventure. But halfway through the opera, he discovers that he has been deceived. The Queen of the Night is the true villain and Sarastro is really a holy man. After many trials, the forces of evil are defeated and the opera ends blissfully with a victory.Musically and dramatically, it is Mozart's greatest opera. From the striking Overture to the use of dark strings, trumpet and soaring flute passages, the individual arias which express intense emotions to the neverending theme that good triumphs over evil, the Magic Flute stands out as a great opera to begin with for newcomers and a favorite for old time opera fans.In this recording, conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch leads the Bavarian State Orchestra in a highly effective, thoroughly dramatic and sentimental, full interpretation of Mozart's score. Tenor Peter Schreir as Tamino is exceptional, passionate in his aria \\"Dies Bildnis\\" (This portrait), and again as he plays his flute in \\"Wie Stark ist Nicht dein Zauberton\\" (How powerful is your music, magic flute), his individual lines in the ensembles and his duet with Pamina as they undergo the final trial of fire. Annelise Rothenberger, a sublime German lyric soprano, is moving in her portrayal of Pamina. She has her moments in this recording. Note how her high, melodic voice seems to come from nowhere as she confronts Sarastro and Tamino for the first time \\"Herr! Ich bin zwar Verbrecherin ! (Sir! I am the transgressor). Her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" (O, I feel that happy days have passed) is the finest interpretation, full of pathos and a kind of melancholic madness, as well as her lines in her suicide attempt, finally, she is sublime as a strong woman ready to face trials with Tamino, especially striking when she sings the line \\"Tamino!\\".Kurt Moll's Sarastro is without question the best. His voice is suited for God. So divine and sonorous and full of grace, his voice is especially noticeable in the aria \\"O Isis and Osiris \\" and \\"In deisen Heilen Hallen\\"( In these holy halls). Finally, and not to be missed, is Edda Moser's incredible interpretation of the Queen of the Night. You have not heard the true Queen of the Night, until you've heard Edda Moser. She has a Wagnerian intensity and neurosis in her lines, apt and effective for the role of a Queen bent on deception and the murder of her rival, Sarastro. Her aria \\"O Zittre Nicht, Mein Lieber Son\\" (O tremble not, beloved son\\" is full of lyric dramatic passages and coloratura at the end. The vengeance aria \\"Der Holle Rache Kocht Meine Herzen \\"(Hell's Anger Burns Within My Heart) is full of fire. The way she attacks the dramatic, powerful lines is out of this world and the high F's she escalates are unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The magic flute,","review":"The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflute in German) was Mozart's final opera. It was his favorite and undoubtedly his greatest achievement. When he was in his deathbed, it was said that Mozart requested to hear the score to the Magic Flute one last time. Mozart was a Freemason, although he had been raised as a Catholic and enjoyed sponsorship by the Archbishop of Salzburg for some time. His conversion; into what was a religious and philosophical organization that praised the Englightenment and mystic Egyptian/Zoroastrian beliefs, effected and influenced his musical composition. He had already written music for a Masonic Funeral and Freemasonry deeply influenced the Requiem in D Minor.This recording is out of print in cd form and was probably an LP in the 70's. In 1972, Walter Sawallisch, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the talents of Peter Schreir (Tamino), Annelise Rothenberger (Pamina), Walter Berry (Papageno), Kurt Moll (Sarastro) and Edda Moser (The Queen of the Night) put together what is the definitive, the greatest, the most perfect, the one and only Magic Flute. If you've heard the rest, now try the best. Contrary to the negative comments of the other reviewers, the Black Dog Opera Library has done an excellent job of making this opera accessible, a book full of great illustrations and liner notes on the singers, Mozart and his era. Yes, the Magic Flute has been unjustly considered and theatrically treated as a children's opera, a fairy tale with no real substance, a great work sugar coated into something like Broadway musical or cartoon. Singspiel was great opera (Mozart had tried the form previously with Abduction From The Seraglio) but unlike grand opera, it was more accessible to the ordinary people, to folks who loved catchy tunes they could whistle in the streets on organ grinders or for children to sing at play. It was a people's opera, not a stuffy, overly pompous piece of work. In a way, it was like Broadway or cartoons, simply because people could have fun at the opera. (For an example, take a look at the film Amadeus, in which Mozart is commissioned to write the Magic Flute for a more folk-oriented, Vienna lower class who drank beer and played games on stage while watching the opera, in a nearly circus like environment).Discreetly embellished with Masonic symbolism (the three opening bombastic chords in the Overture, the Three Ladies, the Three Young Boys in the Balloon, the Egyptian rituals of purification, the choruses and the Zoroastrian figure of Sarastro) are all examples. Allegorically, it was the struggle between the ruling court of Empress Maria Teresa and the supression of Masonry in Austria. This book clearly states this fact. Thus, the powerfully evil Queen of the Night, whose arias are icy coloratura, represents Maria Teresa, Pamina represents the beautiful and faithful Austria, Tamino evidently Emperor Franz Joseph or simply any good person who is beckoned by a noble human cause and finally, Papageno is the earthy, common folk who is no less a great one. This recording is absolutely the best. Peter Schreir is a superlative tenor di grazie, highlights being his aria Dies Bildnis and his scenes with Pamina, Annelise Rothenberger a lyric soprano who reaches perfection in her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" and her union with Tamino in the trial of fire. Kurt Moll's Sarastro is poignant, spiritual, a voice suited for God, whose low F's are contrasted by the sinister, neurotic, tempestuous raging scales of Edda Moser's Queen of the Night, who reaches high F's. The score to the opera is spiritual. Nothing Mozart ever wrote could be more spiritual, full of majesty, obscurity, joy, awe and power. Five stars for this excellent recording."},{"Title":"The magic flute,","review":"As someone who has studied over 20 recording of Flute, I can say that this is the BEST Queen on record BY FAR! They need to invent a new fach (heldencoloratura) for Edda Moser. Simply thrilling.

As well as a history lesson I received a German lesson. The included libretto is in the original German, as well as the English translation. Comments about different performances of this opera are scattered throughout the book, giving the reader depth and understanding to the opera. The CDs that are included with the book are wonderfully done. One can hardly listen to the opera and not experiance every emotion possible. Mozart has the ability to transform ones scenses from on extreem to the other.

The performances are usually classic ones and though not necessarily recorded in the digital age they all sound gorgeous.

Edda Moser's interpretation of the Queen of the Night is justly celebrated, achieving not only transcendently perfect delivery, but also a chilling portrait of pure evil. All of the other cast members are excellent. The spoken role of Papageno is particularly striking, sounding sufficiently pungent to remind us that the role was originally played by Emanuel Schickaneder himself. The tempi are, for the most part remarkably well-chosen. In addition, the Masonic gravity of the subject matter is constantly respected. The chorus of the armed men is properly alarming, the cantus firmus stridently insistent above the counterpoint of the strings. Even more uncommon is the treatment of the secondary scenes of Act II, especially the chorus Welche Wonne, in which the evocation of the candidate's future \\"new life\\" is infused with the trepidation inevitably attendant upon any trial of life and death. All too often, this work, which is gravely serious in its intent, is presented as a fairy tale.

This is equivalent to likening one of Shakespeare's comedies to a street farce. The book also suggests that Zauberfl&ouml;te was composed for purposes of pure entertainment, unless it is, perchance, a \\"work of profound insight\\" dressed up in the trappings of a \\"cartoon\\". Obviously, the writer is ignorant of the significance of the Egyptian setting in the time of Mozart, when it was a clear symbol for rational ideas and liberal politics. The details of the setting delineate the struggle which was then taking place in Europe, over the true nature of Masonry, philosophy and music, and which soon came to a terrible end, for that time at least, with the banning of Freemasonry in Austria, and the loss of much of the learning about ancient philosophy which had been so laboriously gathered in circles such as that frequented by Mozart. It is largely on account of Zauberfl&ouml;te, which alludes with precision to much of that learning, that it was not entirely annihilated in the chaos of the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. Rather than misrepresenting this vitally important work, those who have the privilege of coming into contact with it should do all in their power to contribute to the very difficult, vital, and continuing attempt to understand it.

Craig Russell's drawing style seems especially apt for stories of enchanted lands and beings. His lines are light and airy, and he sets a mood nicely with color. In other words, he is ideally suited to illustrate this story.He does a delightful job of it, too. He amplifies all of the characters theatrically beyond the believable, and has one small advantage over true opera - he is never at the mercy of the set designers, costumers, or other effects.I am very glad to see this classic of western culture (and the others coming soon) made available in this format. I confess, I have not fully acquired the taste for opera, or the ability to derive the story from the way it is sung. I do, however, want to know at least a bit of the story, and this is a very digestible form. Russell's drawing makes it more than digestible, it's a real confection. I also appreciate the fact that Russell has adapted the story, and not created a new one from fragments of the classic.Opera buffs - I hope you can accept this for what it is. One way to look at this is opera appreciation on training wheels, a painless entry into part of the operatic art. It's also a way to spread some knowledge of this classic across a generation that might not have been exposed to the story otherwise - certainly a good thing.If nothing else, it's a well-drawn comic by a very capable artist.

Needless to say, I have never been a fan of opera. However, I was surprised that I was actually able to enjoy this book and accompanying CD. The book begins with a brief biography of Mozart, and then offers a prose overview of the story (extremely helpful for understanding!). The second half of the book contains the libretto, or text, of the opera. The original German forms one column on the left-hand side of each page, and the English translation is printed on the right. This way one can follow along with the story while listening to the music, even if you don't know a word of German. Throughout the entire book there are pictures from different stage performances of The Magic Flute. The musical recording is of high quality, contained on two disks that fit into pockets on the inside front and back cover of the book.This would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning about opera, young or old. However, I must disagree with the reviewer who said this was geared toward children between three and seven. A 3-year-old would never be able to read the text, and a 7-year-old, unless very advanced, would no doubt struggle with it. The book is better suited for slightly older children all the way up through adults of any age. While I'm still not a fan of opera, I did gain some appreciation for it from this book and CD.

But the really annoying thing is that the German text has not been accurately reproduced. I noticed something close to 30 errors in the text in the first act alone. Some of the inaccuracies are simple changes that, though irritating, don't realy change much. There are a few places where it does: the Papageno/Papagena duet in the No 21 Finale shows the happy couple singing joyfully of their future progeny as Sorgen instead of Segen (worry/trouble instead of blessing). But most of the time words are given that don't actually exist in German: In the No. 1 introduction Prince Tamino cries out for help: \\"Zu Huelfe, zu Huelfe,\\" which makes no sense at all!As far as it goes, this isn't too bad a product, though if I were going to use this edition as a refrence for a performance, I would double check it against the Neue Mozart Ausgabe [...]."},{"Title":"The magic flute,","review":"All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote, of course.

A sizable glossary of Middle English comprises the largest part of the book. I already had a such a glossary, but am happy to keep this book, since I believe it will be very useful when I someday settle down to read more Chaucer in a serious way.

In spite of occasional little black specks on the page, the printing quality is acceptable and the text is easily legible. Because the copyright has obviously run out on this work, you can find it online for free. But it's certainly worth it to get a nicely printed and bound edition - printing out pages one by one usually doesn't represent any savings, and is inconvenient to say the least.So, if you want a book of solid early scholarship on Chaucer's works, and you don't want to print it out yourself from the Internet, great - buy this reprint.

Let the media, those in the universities, the United Nations ,European Union and the dictators club known as the Non Aligned Movement and all other critics of Israel be aware of this."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This is one of my favorites, a book to enjoy 4 real 4 real"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Although Donald Goines was first inspired to write by reading Iceberg Slim's life story book Pimp when he was in prison... fortunatley this is not a copy-cat book. Goines immerses you into the raw world of a pimp page after page, from a slightly different perspective. His story telling skills as usual are great. An enjoyable page-turner.I cannot rate Players five stars, because it does not reach the excellence of Dopefiend and Never Die Alone by Goines. However it's a good read if you are interested in the world of the Mack. Incidentally, the term Mack comes from/is the French word for Pimp!To those who are interested in the genre of pimp books I would suggest buying Black Players after you have read the elite genre masterpieces...Pimp: The Story of My LifeandIceberg Slim: The Lost Interviews with the Pimpand Black Players by Richard Milner."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Where can I begin...This book is my favorite. It came alive from start to finish. Not a dull moment. I recommend that anyone who loves black fiction read this book. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"One Hell of a book. Wish that there was a Part 2.This book is timeless.This is a must read. Donald Goines takes you to the heart of the Ghetto.. I loved it, The twists and turns and the love found in the end. Exceptional. I would certainly recommend. Language was a little crude, but when you engross yourself in the story you understand where it comes from. Don't miss out"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Out of all the Donald Goines books I have read this is still my favorite. Don't let the title scare you away it is a great read and I will read it again!!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book is to good to put down Donald was an awesome writer.This book keeps you in suspense of whats next I loved it in fact I went and bought everything Donald every wrote."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I've heard of him, but I never read any of his books. Until now, I decided to give him a try. My mother kept telling me I needed to read his novels and I kept putting it off. Well that's not going to happen anymore. Whoreson is the first Donald Goines book I've read, and I must say that I will definitly read all of his novels. These new comers that write about street life has nothing on him. I've read a lot of them and none have really impressed me the way Donald Goines has."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book is a classic. Donald Goines is dead more than 30 years now, but he knew what he was talking about. Just read this and his biography, and now I gotta get more of his books."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Wow, is all I can say. This book takes the reader on a journey that many readers will never experience. I personally didn't know some of the hardship you have to endure to be a pimp. I am not saying that its the best job in the world, but you must give credit where credit is due. Whoreson Jones is the best character of any Goines book. Again, the imagery that is provied makes you believe you are actually there. This is something that Mr. Goines and a few other authors have been ablre to do, but he is the master. This book is great from beginning to end. Its one of those books that you can finish in 1 day."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"The resounding sentiment made about Goines which comes from everyone I've talked to about his books is he's able to paint a clear, vivid picture in your mind. In this story, he took me there again. In the others I've read, I felt as if I was right there sitting down watching his characters do what they do in his stories. His style, use of words, and use of characters come to life in only ways he can make them. If you really pay attention to the story, there is a message which can be taken from each character, from Whoreson, to his mother Jessie, all the way down to Tony, his former best friend and many others."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"If you're a fan of Goines...get it.Gritty. Authentic. He lived it. Wrote about it.Not much else to be said."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Whoreson is the first Goines novel I have read thus far. I have to say the book was a very mixed bag for me. The characters were well written but many of the events that unfold seem very unlikely for me. The most outrageous was the dinner scene where a future prositute named Fatima just jumps from behind the counter and becomes Whoreson's prositute. I have never seen anything like this before[perhaps Goines saw this in his short experiance as a pimp]. Somebody actually naming their son[even if h is the product of a white trick] whoreson seem unlikely as well. Who knows maybe I am wrong?The saving grace of this book is Goines ability to paint a picture of life in a Detriot black bottom slum. The images were very gritty and hard hitting that makes you feel the gutter surroundings. His imagery alone saves his over-the-top storytelling.As with the other reviewers, I agree that Iceberg Slim's Pimp is a much better read and definately more realistic. Whoreson is not a horrible book but just one I could not recommend. It really does not matter because most diehard Goines fans will cherish every single book Goines wrote. Maybe when I read more Goines novels I can say the same."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Donald Goines has both a natural talent as a writer and ghetto sage who somehow found a way to transfer all of the suffering he's experienced into a classic among its genre. Ghetto life is vividly muraled from front to back with true ghetto imagery, never letting up on keepin' you wise on how pimps do. If you are interested in ghetto life the book will take you on a tale to real to be just a novel. The seed of a prostitute and son of a 'john' Whoreson embarks on quest to become the man his mother destined him to be."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This was the first book I read by Donald Goines and I was captivated by the title....on reading I loved every last page, Donald used every day language and situations that you see and know happen. Whoreson, who got his name from his mother, for obvious reasons, she's a whore, and he's her son, was born and raised on the ghetto streets. The height of his ambiton is to become a pimp.....pimping and getting dollars, so said so done but with lots of twists and turns....Whoreson had a hard life....."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Great book! I am into sociology and thought it would be nice to find out how a pimp's life is, or at least try to think like a pimp while reading a book by one. I bought &quot;A Pimp's Rap&quot; by Master Pimp, &quot;PIMP&quot; by Iceberg Slim, and of course this book, &quot;Whoreson&quot;. Whoreson was wittier, more intelligent and deeper in the mind of the writer than the other two put together. Pimp, by Iceberg was pretty good too. Please don't buy &quot;A Pimp's Rap&quot; cause I read about 3 pages and realized that it had to be a fake, a joke, published to see if anyone would buy it. I mean it was just terrible!! Anyway, this (Whoreson)was a great book and if you are thinking of getting it, please do, I know you won't be disappointed. :) -I'm actually thinking of getting some of his other books too because he is an excellent writer with a good sense of humor and of the ironic."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I read this book when I was 13 years old. I was so impressed with this book that I read his entire collection of writings.I am now an adult and have encouraged my teenage children to read them as well.All of his writings are highly recommended. It will make you cry and laugh and I guarantee that you will not be able to put them down."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"&quot;Whoreson&quot; is an authentic representation of life in the inner city. Donald Goines's characters are well depicted and thoroughly brought out. [You can almost see the charaters as you read the book.] The images are vivid and lifelike. [The book &quot;explodes&quot; with details.] And, the story flows from page to page. Donald Goines has an astounding ability to depict complex topics and issues in very plain prose. Spectacular!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book was the bomb! I consider myself a non-book reader. But, once I pick up this book. I could not put it down. In fact, I'm odering several copies to pass out to my friends and family members."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I finished this book in less than a day. It sure does not leave anything at ALL to the imagination and lays the story out for all those who would care to read it! I also recommend PSEUDO COOL for another powerful and mostly different read about the lives of African Americans! Goines' novels are about the toughness of life--and this one presents it in no uncertain terms!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I just read Whoreson like a week ago and could not put it down. Although some think that Goines is a bit harsh in his writings I think that he chose his words carefully. There were many times throughout the book where he could have been more harsh. I've never read a book that captures the life that I saw and still see in the ghettos of Nashville. You can't live outside the ghetto and completely understand this book cause alot of things are just understood as ghetto rules and he doesn't explain them.In the year of our Lord 2350(or just many years from now)Goines' work will be studied like Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book shows the lifestyle as glamourous as it can be viewed. It was pretty similar to PIMP by Iceberg Slim both stories were about pimps cut from the same 'pimp or die' cloth. I will admit that I had a problem with his name throughout the whole book but I'm sure there is a reason for this title. It was quite a vicious cycle back in the 50s and 60s of hos breeding pimps and pimps breeding hos. Add a jail sentence or two, a couple of slick 'con' ideas, a diamond in the back, sunroof top and dig in the scene with a gangsta lean!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This is the first Donald Goines book I have ever read and I am now a fan of his work because this was a great story. It was good enough for me to sit and read in one day. The only reason I picked up his book was because I had finished reading a collection of Iceberg Slim's book. Hands down I will have to give it to Iceberg but I can respect and appreciate Donald Goines writings. If you thoroughly enjoyed Goines then please buckle up and pick up Iceberg Slim. His books are the realest ever. U better know it!!!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago and I still remember how good it was. This was the first book that I have read written by Mr. Goines and it certainly won't be my last!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"The book takes you from his child hood, to the track. His writing style allows you to visualize his characters and their actions. Just based on his background its hard to believe he produced the books he did. Bottom line, must read, pick it up.

This book has to be the best of the his books. It really tells the truth ut pimp life. He does not cut any corners to describe the brutality of that life stlye. In anyone of goines books there in not a time where the end was good but at least in this noval I was able to think that after he was releaced from prison he would hook up with Janit. This should really be made a major-motion picture."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"&quot;This is a black classic. Much like the forefather of textbook pimping, namely Robert Beck (Iceberg Slim), Goines captures the essence of the game during that time frame. The language, the scenery, you can't beat it.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I don't know why I'm the third person to review this book, since it's one of the best books I've ever read. It is definitely a must read, and a must have if you are a book collector. The book starts off and it's hilarious. I found myself crying at how funny it was. It was also shocking and heart wrenching. It's either the best book I've ever read or second in line...Haven't figured out which one yet, but if you're going to read a Donald Goines book...Read this one, and you can't help but read the others...5/5"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer because this is also my favorite by Donald Goines and is much better than Pimp....although it is a very close 2nd"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book was great.

This character never had a chance, with a name like that. At least he didn't think so, being raised by a mother who was a prostitute who only wanted him to be a pimp. All in all, it was an interesting, jaw-dropping, head shaking read. If you want down and gritty, this is it, although not as gritty as Dopefiend. Now THAT book was just scary!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I was really excited to recieve this book - I love to read books about the underworld but at the risk of being unpopular I must say that although I enjoyed it I was a little disappointed with 3 things.Firstly - Some of the launguage was impossible for me to understand - I know that's not the authors fault but I would have liked him to explain it so I could learn something (and understand what was happening!)Secondly - Some of the events were unbelieveable he makes hardened, tough characters turn naive for no reason - makes no sense, in my opinion.Thirdly - Whoreson as a character is a contradiction unsure if that was intentional but all humans have the same basic thoughts and feelings and can be understood. Whoreson is vicious and unrepentant - not much internal struggle takes place within him regarding the violence he perpetrates and I accept that's what he is BUT then he goes on to say he can love and change hmmm - which is he? Loving and thoughtful or callous and vicious?I think his character's behaviour could have been explained in more depth to make him more loveable and better understood even when he is bad so that when he decides to change the process is smoother and more believable."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This novel isn't all that and I can't recommend it. I agree with the others who said it's pretty far-fetched, starting with the main character's given name. Everyone's personalities were inconsistent and the range of each character's traits was illogical. The square love story involving the annoyingly prudish Janet was unrealistic and left a very bad taste in my mouth. I was disturbed that the book's writer went out of his way to punish every person that crossed his cherished main character, Whoreson (shudder), but never gave Whoreson any poetic justice or even remorse for his many heartless transgressions.The storytelling surprisingly improves as it goes along: though it provides not an ounce of real insight about tricking other than the lingo and what anyone can naturally assume, it does display some average information about petty swindling and crime and punishment. The sex scenes are decent and there's never a truly dull moment in this novel. But none of that's enough for me to give it more than two stars due to the aforementioned problems, plus a few more huge flaws that I won't bother mentioning. Read Iceberg Slim's \`Pimp' instead for a much, much better effort."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Man What can I say After the first 3 pages I was hooked The tell of a misguided youth that turned into a pimp.

Amazon has a good selection of his books too."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"You won't need a dictionary nor thesaurus at your fingertips when you plunge into this ghetto classic. It's pretty basic. However...it fills all of my criteria for a successful narrative of criminal life. It starts fast and hard, and stays that way, slapping you around with ice cold reality. It seems quite authentic, but not having lived anything like the writer's purported \\"pimp'n\\" life, I can't say..it could be a large load of dung.It moves along furiously like a car that's late for an accident. The character has no discernible redeeming qualities, and makes no apologies for being a most unpleasant fellow. I found myself liking the guy, yet hoping that he would get brought down hard. I couldn't put the book down, and finished it in just a few hours.I had a hard time with the \\"hero's\\" name, \\"Whoreson\\". Do you pronounce it to rhyme with \\"Orson\\", or is it \\"Hoar-Sun\\"? I could not believe that anyone would ever name their child this way. That's really about the only false note I could find, aside from a strange bit of business toward the end. For overall impact and originality, I give this the coveted Five Stars, and will be looking forward to reading more from Mr. Goines."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book was in new condition, and it was a different type of story, broken english, kinda through me off, but other then the shock of this young mans life, great book."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I love all of Donald Goines books and this one is 3rd on my list of all 17 of his books!!!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old.

It reads fast and easy, and the best part is the details of the nitty gritty, at the same time summing up the larger story in much simpler generalizations (without giving away details)."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Reviewed by Zane for RAW SISTAZ BOOK CLUBThere are some books that seem partially real and then there are books that seem so real that they have you limbering somewhere between trepidation and awe. Such is the case with Whoreson. From the first chapter, I was hooked when I discovered that the main character's birth name was actually Whoreson. His mother, Jessie, a prostitute, selected that name after she gave birth to him less than an hour after turning a trick. Jessie, along with her mentor Big Mama, raised her son to do one thing: become a pimp. He studied it like an art form, learned from those he considered the masters, and got his Ph.D. in Pimpology. There are numerous women in this novel with low to non-existent self-esteem that allowed Whoreson to turn them into prostitutes when he was too young to even get a driver's license. Especially Boots, whom Whoreson meets while she is pregnant and still tricking for her rent. For those who have ever wondered what makes a person decide to stand on a street corner, whether male or female, and sell their bodies for money, this book offers a significant insight into their lives. This is not a pretty book, but being that the author lived the majority of it, makes it remarkable. Whoreson, a semi-autobiographical novel that Goines wrote while he was incarcerated at the Jackson Penitentiary, is a fictional masterpiece. In and out of jail seven times, Donald Goines was shot and killed in Detroit in 1974 while he sat at his typewriter working on his latest novel. Having sold upwards of 10 million books worldwide, even though he has been given very little recognition in American media, I truly believe that we lost one of the best AA authors in history too young and too tragically. I can only imagine how many other masterpieces he could have churned out, being that he wrote as many as eight in one year. There is no one to compare him to. To even attempt to compare him to another author would be an injustice. If you haven't been turned onto Donald Goines yet, you are missing a world of incredible literature.I give Whoreson a 5 on the RAW Scale."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Whoreson is a great book, it is however explicit and harsh. But that keeps the book real. I would say this is my favorite Donald Goines book but I'd be lying because I liked &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; and &quot;Dopefiend&quot; as much as I liked Whoreson. Whoreson was better though because it was a longer book. In the book Whoreson we get to see Whoreson grow up from a small boy into a &quot;Man&quot;, why he was named Whoreson and why he was born a Pimp/street hustler. And that he really had no other choice in life. Thats all he knew. Something about Whoreson's character makes you like him even though he is ignorant as hell. There are lots of twists and turns, excitement as well as let downs that makes you just want to keep reading. As I said before it is a book for a mature reader as the sex and violence is harsh. I really enjoyed reading Donald Goines books and am reading &quot;Black Gangster&quot; and &quot;Cry Revenge&quot; right now so far they are worth the money I spent and exciting reads as well."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"First of all I would like to say Donald Goines is the best author out there. I first heard about him listening to Bay Area Mobb Music. Then when I was in Korea I was put on to him. This book Whoreson is excellent. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story to read. All of Donald Goines' books are true to life. Anyone can relate to them, especially minorites. I recommend all 16 of his book. They are all 5 stars."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I have read all of Donald Goines' books, this one is by far my FAVORITE. The first time I read this book I was very young, at that time it was exciting because I knew that I shouldn't have been reading the book in the first place. (Kinda like sneaking and listening to Richard Pryor records when no one was around) I was amazed with the fast pace of the book and all of the underhandedness of the main character.Once I got older I was able to appreciate the author's writing style. In all my years of reading I have never read anything that was as clear and concise as Mr. Goines' novels. His writing is so clear, its like you are apart of the story. Almost like the story is unfolding right before your very eyes. Not only do you feel as though you know each of the characters, you get a sense of familiarity of the surroundings. I have never been to Detroit MI, a day in my life. But I can envision each scene, each street corner, each alley and every building that was mentioned in this book.I must say that not all writers have the capability of great story telling, nor do all writers have the capability of good writing style, well Mr. Goines had both.This generations of writers seem to be patterning after the same style of writing and the same story line. Every once in a while we should step back in time and take a look at something original. Read something from someone with ingenuity and originality, someone who definitely had a flare for writing. And from a writer who wasn't afraid of telling his story the way he wanted it told. Maybe I am a little prejuiced, but damn that man could write !!!!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This is the first and only book I've ever read by Goines. I had never even heard of him before. I just love to read books based on real life and how hard it can be. When I read &quot;Whoreson&quot; I literally did not put it down 'til I was finished (I was even caught a few times reading it at work). I was so impressed with Goines' work that I vowed I would someday have his entire collection of novels. I must say that I have read numerous books by various authors but Donald Goines is one author I will remember and speak about for yoears to come. His writing is absolutely excellent!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This is absoulutly the best book that I have ever read. I began to read it because I was bored and someone gave it to me. From the first page to the very end I found a new meaning to reading books. The characters and situations made it very clear like a movie going on in my head at the same time that I was reading. Whoreson Jones is a real person because who ever reads this book can actually live this type of life. Although to me it was un-realistic at times it was still very interesting and I could not stop reading.I recommended this book to everyone that I knew. My girlfrien also started reading more because of this book and now she reads more than I do. This book opened up a new world to me that I never knew much about, the world of pimpin'. If real or not this is a far more interesting book than alot of garbage being put on the shelves today.If anyone with some weight in the movie business PLEASE make this book out of a movie I would gladly pay my [money] to see the adventures and missadventures of one WHORESON JONES."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"This book was so mind blowing from beginning to end. I was hooked from the first page to the last. The characters were very real, and hardcore. But at the same time extremly sad and vulnerable. &quot;Whoreson&quot; depicted an aspect of &quot;ghetto life&quot; that manstream society still fail to admit that exist. At the end, Whoreson, may in one aspect lost as far as being sent to prison. But actually, he really won, because he finally came to grips with what he had become, how he had gotten to that point. As well as what he hoped for the future. I was also glad that he had gotten the right woman in the end. Lastly, I also liked how Goines showed the love that Jesse and Whoreson shared for each other. This displayed the bond between mother/child which weighs heavily in the black community. As well as the strong love between a black woman and a black man(Whoreson and Janet). Superb ending!!"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"I chose this book because a friend of mine recommended it to me. This was my first book by Donald Goines and I read it all in one day!!!!!!I opened this book and was sucked into the world of Whoreson,the half-white child of a prostitute.

His picture is vivid as you are taken on a journey through the poverty-stricken streets of the ghetto. I do not want to tell you the story and spoil it for you but I will say this: I GUARANTEE that you will enjoy this book and you will not want it to END. Do yourself a favor and purchase this book."},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","review":"Whoreson is a book that really allows us to look at pimp life in the real prospective. I mean you would never image living like this unless this was the environment in which you have grown up in. This book, however, touches all african americans if you take the time to read it you will be amazed of the trial nd tribulations he dealt with and then the survival tactics that were displayed. This let's you know we can do anything. Some of us have came from the slums and we are running businesses, becoming successful authors,and so forth.

Because I enjoyed them both so much I decided to try Whoreson which came highly recommended to me by my sister who got me started on Goines to begin with. I ordered the book and couldn't wait to get into it.It started out very interesting and got pretty mundane and predictable after some time.

Being from Detroit,I could relate and identify with the stories. Even though I was young, I saw a lot drugs,drug addicts and violence on the streets. Some of this is what he was saying. Well, alot of this was what he was saying. This is the reason why I say that all of his stories seem to hit home. The reason why I say that his stories hit hearts is because the truth is there. Even to this day,more and more of what was written in his novels are still accuring. More kids in this world are still being victimized,due to the lives that their parents,who are on drugs, are subjecting them to. I have read several of Donald Goines' novels.

This book, however, defies the odds and is truly compelling -- so much so that you can forget you're reading about a corporate legal battle and instead feel like you're following an Epic Drama of Good versus Evil.Actually, that's not quite true. This book reads more like a comedy than anything (laugh-out-loud funny), yet it also intelligently examines the more serious issues behind this bizarre tussle between art and (e-)commerce in a way that has yet to be topped. It actually attempts to avoid taking sides as well, though you cannot help rooting for the artists in the end because they are just more charming.A great and interesting read, and a must-read for anyone who had a pulse during the internet boom years.The humor in the book comes in large part to the insane antics of the etoy crew, crazy Swiss conceptual techo performance artists who provide ample fodder for laughs throughout the book. Orange jumpsuits? Check. Mirrored sunglasses? Check. Shaved heads? Check? Earnest 'etoy offsite meetings' in random Eastern European motels? Check. Contrast them with the comparatively dopey Lenk and his team's inability to ship toys in time for Christmas, and the struggle comes to life. The best part is it's all true, and that you begin to understand that the etoy group were more than a bunch of merry pranksters; they were truly insane and ambitious, as most great artists tend to be. (And what they did was certainly a type of greatness in our current age; once set upon as innocents, they turned round and fought back!)This book flows like a movie, a old-fashioned us-versus-them picture. Yet underneath the histrionics lie very serious issues which the authors explore with great diligence. The domain name system. The internet bubble. The arrogance of corporate America. The legal blow by blows. The spirit of hackerish subversion that governs the heart of the internet in almost pioneer fashion. There's a lot of very enlightening background information in this story, and it's treated with rigor.So there you have it. Highly recommended. Although it's definitely worth reading for fun, they should also make this book mandatory reading in business schools, as a warning to arrogant hot-shot would-be entrepreneurs and to provide thoughtful, diligent insight into the genesis of the New Economy."},{"Title":"Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & other battles to control cyberspace","review":"There was a time when people were just starting e-mail and the World Wide Web, and had no real idea what sort of life the internet was going to bring forth. In the early 1990s, there weren't many rules, and commercial use of the Web had not taken it over. In 1995, an anarchic group of seven Swiss artists started the site www.etoy.com. In 1997, a billion-dollar firm to sell toys via the internet started up, registering as www.etoys.com. Two years later, eToys sued etoy for damaging the eToys trademark. The resulting fracas is told in an entertaining story that is not just a dot-com bust parable, _Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & Other Battles to Control Cyberspace_ (Ecco) by Adam Wishart and Regula Bochsler. The earnestness and foolishness and greed herein described are universal; the contemporary surroundings of this tale, however, have much to tell us about the founding philosophy of the internet and its commercial future.The artists involved in etoy had worked on collaborative digital art projects, and developed their site as a parody of internet business. They issued shares, and strangely, the share certificates were art works on their own; etoy did not manufacture toys or anything, but it did sell shares, and the shares (or art) did sell. They mocked executive appearances, adopting orange flight jackets, black pants, and shaved heads as uniforms. They intended to be \\"the First Street Gang of the Information Super Data Highway.\\" Official company communications were signed, \\"etoy, leaving reality behind.\\" Of course, commercial dot-coms were leaving reality behind in their own fashion. The story of eToys is told just as fully in this book as that of etoy, and it is just as strange. eToys was one of the first companies that emerged from idealab!, a business that was going to produce businesses just like McDonald produced hamburgers. eToys was supposed to beat Toys-R-Us by making it easy to shop without the brats. In 1999, the all important Initial Public Offering of eToys stock was made, amid furious excitement built up over the previous months, but eToys was in big trouble. That didn't stop it from trying to crush the annoying etoy gang. Even after a judge granted an injunction to shut down etoy, etoy wasn't weren't going to give in, and netizens all over began a \\"Toywar\\" to \\"Save etoy now!\\" A year after doing all the bullying, eToys was bankrupt.Wishart and Bochsler not only have written a fun and rather exciting tale full of interesting characters, but they have also given a capsule history of the internet. There are detours here to explain the origins of the Web itself, and how different coding standards were developed to tie all our computers together. The first search engines are here, and the mechanics of the organizations who are supposed to control web names. This is an amusing story, and the book will be an excellent reference for those in the future who want to understand what the beginning internet was like and what the dot-com boom-and-bust was all about."},{"Title":"Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & other battles to control cyberspace","review":"In years to come when they're teaching the history of the internet in all its aspects at colleges this book will be one of a hand-full of books that will be essential reading.There have been lots of \\"I was there\\" internet books - some early ones like \\"Burn Rate\\" were truly excellent accounts of life at the coal face but more recent titles such as \\"Dot.bomb\\" were dull reads that neither entertained nor informed. \\"Leaving Reality Behind\\" is different in that neither of the authors are telling their own story but rather reporting back on the events that helped define and shape the evolution of this internet thing. Both funny and intelligent this book stands out for the thoroughness of its research (in the rush to get them out many internet books have suffered from sloppy editing and factual inaccuracies) as is witnessed by its excellent bibliography - probably worth the cover price alone for anyone serious about understanding recent digital history.Finally, in bringing together the European and American sides of the story there are deep insites offered in the differences and similarities that bind the two continents together - particularly pertinent at the moment."},{"Title":"Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & other battles to control cyberspace","review":"I'm going to be completely honest with you -I only picked up this book because I was bored, and it was the only thing I hadn't read at my local library.I LOVED IT.The entire idea of etoy was incredible, and I really enjoyed this book.And I'm not really into electronics and stuff.Like, AT ALL.So go read it.

Were we all really just lunatics?? You might think that so much has been written about the Internet boom, that nothing more could be said. But if journalism is the first draft of history, this is the wonderful second - as the book tells many stories that make sense of the era as a whole. I cannot recommend this book enough. I loved it."},{"Title":"Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & other battles to control cyberspace","review":"&quot;Leaving Reality Behind..&quot; is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting. Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet. In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old. Why is this interesting??

Erickson"},{"Title":"If You Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students!: Guide to Success for Administrators and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"Fashioned literally as a menu for administrative success, Neila Connors' If you Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students, is a straight talking street smart triumph that is a must for the library of every school administrator. It offers many clever and strategic yet practical suggestions that can be implemented immediately by administrators at all levels. In the savory first chapter entitled, \\"Whetting your Appetite-the Menu Please\\" Connors promises a book steeped in practical experience and not research, a promise she keeps throughout. Nevertheless, it should come as no surprise that many of her suggestions parallel current educational research, especially with regard to building relationships with staff members and effecting positive changes in organizations.Connors organizes the eight-chapter book to mirror the cooking and eating of a fine meal. From Chapter 3-\\"Creating the Ambiance-Preparing to Dine\\" to Chapter 8-\\"The Check, Please!\\" Connors' clever design is sure to ring true with those who enjoy both their meals and their reading material presented in tidy scrumptious portions. For example Chapter 4 discusses \\"Passing the P's\\", which, instead of asking for round green vegetables, provides a list of important attributes of successful administrators, all of which begin with the letter \\"P\\". The chapter goes on to describe each item in detail, but articulating these thoughts by a listing of \\"P\\" words is convenient and, dare I say, tasteful.Connors really gets cooking in the third chapter, where she sets the tone for the remainder of the book by articulating what seems to be her core belief. \\"The quality of employees will be directly proportional to the quality of life you maintain for them,\\" is the quote from Charles E. Bryan that begins the chapter, which Connors follows it up with passionate and detailed suggestions about how to set up and maintain a quality environment in a school. Along with trumpeting administrators' needs for a belief in yourself, your potential, and your ability, she describes the obstacles that often get in the way. Most comical is her discussion of the attributes of the \\"Climate Controllers\\" who exist in every school. Her descriptions of Climate Busters, Climate Manipulators, Climate Cruisers, and Climate Improvers, are sure to bring smiles to the faces of even the most jaded administrators. Ending the chapter is a list of ten strategies that contribute to a healthy and happy climate, a list that could easily go on a poster or in a picture frame and remain on an administrator's desk for the remainder of her career.While this book never claims to be something it is not, the large numbers of lists make it read much more like a reference book than a narrative. For those readers who prefer a cleverly worded vignette to help articulate a point, this book will fall short. However, if you're interrupted and put the book down, it doesn't take long to refocus when you start reading again. This may indeed be the book's most endearing feature for those administrators who try to read this book during the course of a normal school day.Even those serious readers who sour on its campy organizational theme will certainly agree that Connors' book is filled with enough excellent tidbits to make it reasonably satisfying. In fact, every administrator will find something usable in it that has the potential to make an immediate impact. An appetizing and quick read, this book is probably best used as a reference manual or for an occasional administrative literary snack. If a research article is the entr&eacute;e, this is certainly a most satisfying and memorable dessert."},{"Title":"If You Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students!: Guide to Success for Administrators and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"I am in my third year as an administrator in a public high school and currently enrolled in a doctorate program in educational administration. As part of my studies I have read several books and reviews on leadership and management, and even though Neila Connors offers a disclaimer that her book is not research based, focused on results of surveys, or theoretically driven, her information is line with current research. Her book takes a more humorous and lighter approach on the importance of an effective leader or administrator recognizing teachers and creating a positive school climate.The author has complied a list of characteristics for truly effective educational leaders through her numerous observations of successful leaders. The \\"head cook\\" must have a vision that others are willing to buy into and be wanting and not forced to follow. A short section in the first chapter allows the reader a chance to reflect on his/her current status as an effective school leader by answering a series of short questions and \\"Whetting Your Appetite\\" for further reading.Later chapters such as \\"The Need to Feed\\" and \\"Creating an Ambiance\\" give the reader a list of indicators of effective leaders that can be used as a measuring stick and as a guide to what to include in our everyday roles as educational leaders. There is also a series of yes/no questions that can help determine the hunger that your individual schools and teachers may be experiencing. The ambiance or school climate is seen as one of the main responsibilities of a school principal and there is a list of seven attributes a leader must have in order to have a positive school climate and help insure the teachers feel satisfied. Areas such as open communication, active participation by all, and human relation skills all come with suggestions and tangible applications.\\"Pass the P's Please\\" is a chapter that gives a list of actions exhibited by strong leaders within a school such as, positive attitudes, passion for their profession, and persistence. Not only do strong managers exhibit certain actions, but they also possess certain talents or skills. Prized principals are people oriented, prepared, problems solvers, and parent and public minded. Whether these are talents that must be sought in searching for potential principals or skills that may be taught to existing administrators, the book gives many examples of how these attributes are used in a positive school setting.Neila Connors adds additional insight by sharing meaningful experiences she has observed in great schools and offers suggestions in dealing with teachers who \\"Can't Stand the Heat, (and need to) Get out of the Kitchen.\\" She stresses the importance of maximizing the talents and potential of star teachers while working with, but not being consumed by, the negative quacking of low performing teachers. She gives strategies for working with the quacking staff, but more importantly how to prevent them from causing you and others to lose your appetite towards children and education. Feeding the teachers can go a long way in quieting the quacking and preventing it from even becoming an issue.The last section of the book gives 150 activities or \\"desserts\\" you can prepare and serve to your staff so they will not eat the students. The book addresses a very serious issue of teacher recognition and school climate in a time where teacher stress is increasing. Standardized testing/accountability and budget cuts are all having an impact on teacher satisfaction and school climate. We as administrators need as many resources as we can get that are written in concise and applicable forms to help us become great managers. Helping teachers grow and reach their goals is vital to creating a great school and recognizing and feeding them is a vital part of this process. The author has included a variety of inspirational quotes and stresses that the best teachers remember what it is like to be a student, and the best administrators remember what its is like to be a teacher. I found the book a great resource for applying researched based concepts that I have read about in other books and articles."},{"Title":"If You Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students!: Guide to Success for Administrators and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"There are many things Educational Leaders are unable to do because Education is so commonly plagued by inadequate funding. However, one thing that too many educational leaders can do, and too often fail to do, is to affirm their teachers. Affirmation and recognition don't require more money. With an ongoing mindfulness of \\"taking care of, and honoring teachers\\" a school leader can do tremendous things for morale and ultimately for student success.Studies of the reasons school leaders lose their jobs often point out that there are too many of them who are not present to their teachers,, who fail to include them in decision-making, who don't know even know their teachers names, and who far too often, treat their teachers as insignificant.While there is a lot of paperwork and other distractions n educational administration, the highest priority of a leader has to be the students and the teachers who work directly with those students! Teachers, by and large, are highly devoted individuals with a special calling in life. Yet, teachers are human too. They have the need to be respected, listened to, acknowledged and celebrated. This is where too many school leaders fall short.In, If You Don't Feed the Teachers, They Will Eat the Students, author Neila A. Connors, points out some simple and valuable ideas for letting teachers know that they are valued and appreciated. Humorous in tone, Connors illustrates a very clear plan for continuously addressing the affirmation of teachers.While educational leaders must continue to advance the salaries, working conditions and status of teachers in this country, they also need to pay more attention to the basic human needs of these vitally important people who most directly serve the kids -- the only reason school administrators have a job in the first place.Basic? Yes. Usual? No! Read -- If You Don't Feed the Teachers, They Will Eat the Students. High marks for Neila Connors!James J.

This is a book that every teacher and every administrator should read. It gives simple solutions that could and would make a big impact upon the current state of education today. I encourage every person involved in teaching students to read this book and think about the roles they currently play and the role they could play. THANK-YOU MS. CONNORS for humorously yet seriously pointing out both the problem and the necessary solutions."},{"Title":"If You Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students!: Guide to Success for Administrators and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for.

Connors. The book opens up with a feeling of eating at a cozy diner where one is able to whet their appetite with an appetizer to tasting a sampling of fat-free desserts in the educational world. Connors begins with a quote about how the best teacher NEVER forgets what it is like to be a student and the best administrator NEVER forgets what it is like to be a teacher. This quote sets the tone for the entire book. Connors emphasizes that her book is not research-based nor centers around data driven results but is more focused on practical real life tips on how to lead an extraordinary school.Outstanding leaders learn to use their teachers as resources for solving problems, for spreading the word or to even being school motivators. Successful leaders also identify and tap into every staff members' strengths. Everyone has strengths to bring to the table in a school setting.The power of positive deviance is sprinkled throughout every chapter of Connors' book. Whether the leader is encouraged to write a positive note, build time into a faculty workshop to acknowledge the \\"movers and the shakers\\" of the month or to inviting a staff member in to eat lunch with them, the key ingredient is to CARE.Neila Connors has crafted an easy read that is organized and insightful. Connors' rich experience of working with administrators and teachers sheds light on the fact that successful schools are led only by successful leaders. A mediocre leader will be the doom and demise of a building. If you desire to be a future administrator, Connors' artful educational cookbook provides a myriad of tasty real life practical tips on how to build a strong community of educators within one's school."},{"Title":"If You Don't Feed the Teachers They Eat the Students!: Guide to Success for Administrators and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"This is an excellent resource for administrators to turn to when trying to improve morale among teachers and students!

Obviously the pop outs are sometimes a little frail in these books but as long as your careful they can have a long life.I believe that our children need more critical thinking and scientific style books that bring up questions for them to ask. In that respect I would give this book 4 stars. As far as the actual text being understandable by the age range that kids enjoy pop up books I'd say it a bit too complicated in some areas and would give it a 3. But since our children tend to understand more than we think they do I'd still recommend this book to any parent that wants their child to have an early start on science and the beginning of our universe up through evolution and even a bit at the end about modern times.I would also have liked it to be a bit longer. Science and our universe is such a long complicated process that the faster you explain it and the more you have to skip, the less likely it seems. However I realize this is a primer and pop-up books are limited on size.I like the art because it seems like a 10 year old drew it and I think that makes my 4 year old feel a little comfortable with it."},{"Title":"Story Of Everything","review":"Great book for kids that adults will enjoy as well!

And the dinosaur lives in present day Los Angeles, disguised as a human, trying to earn his living as a private detective? And, further more, he is part of a whole dinosaur sub-culture that exists side-by-side with the unknowing human culture? Well, I call it very, very clever and funny!Our hero is dinosaur Vincent Rubio (VelociRaptor,get it?) a private eye whose partner has died (shades of Miles Archer), and whose business is headed straight for the toilet with various bill collectors knocking at the door. The insurance company Vincent works for from time to time gives him an arson case to investigate that, naturally, ends up being tied to the mysterious death of his partner. The story moves from Los Angeles to New York City to back again, all the while giving the reader typical detective story action, and untypical insight into Garcia's alternative world where the dinosaurs did not die out millions of years before the appearance of man on the scene. The reptiles have their own culture and society, have made their own accomodation to the present by going about in elaborate disguises (some of the funniest moments of the book occur when Vincent's current disguise goes haywire and threatens to expose him in more ways than one!), and keep strictly apart from the dominate human culture, which they view with contempt.The book is written in a style that will remind you in a vague way of the noir mysteries of the 1940s and 50s. Vincent Rubio is an appealing character: I finished this book wanting to read the sequel, and was delighted to find out that a new hardcover (&quot;Hot and Sweaty Rex: A Dinosaur Mafia Mystery&quot;) had just been released. My only real criticism of the book is that there is not enough &quot;background material&quot; on how the dinosaurs &quot;survived&quot; and evolved into creatures that could develop technology. Not all readers need a backstory; those who do will be spending some of their time filling in the blanks from the information that Garcia gives us in bits and pieces. If you are willing to suspend your disbelief, the dinosaur mystery books will be a real treat for you."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"I've rarely had more fun reading a story! Garcia takes an absolutely out-the-window bizarre premise (1 out of every 20 humans is actually a dinosaur in disguise - yeah, RIGHT!), and writes it so well that it works! This is only made possible by his total faithfulness in one plane to the private dick genre, while doing alternate reality s.f. on another plane, AND messing wildly with science-run-amok horror on yet another. This is an amazing feat of writing!Wryly humorous, thought-provoking, and steamy by turns, this tale (tail?) gets you right under this guy's (guise?) fake skin. Oh, so very well done, Mr. Garcia!"},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Not your typical private dick. The story is not new, but the characters are like nothing seen before. The writing is excellent and the humor sly and enjoyable. The perfect antidote for the tired and overused plots and heroes of a lot of the new detective novels. Bring on the next chapter."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"This is a surprisingly good compulsivly readable novel. Even though the structure of the novel at times seems to be a bit weak the world of Dono's is so well built and so fun to read that it is worth it for just a peek at this original alternater reality."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"I just wanted to make a few comments on this book.I read a lot of humorous books in this vein from Hiaasen, Chris Moore, Bill Fitzhugh, Tim Dorsey, and so on, but it would be hard to imagine a wilder premise than the one in Garcia's book. Dinosaurs didn't die at the end of the Cretaceous, as we thought, instead, they evolved into down-sized versions of their former selves and are now running around disgused in human drag, unbeknownst to us humans. The private eye main character himself is a dino, a raptor, if I recall, but anyway, a number of species have survived and are living among us.There are other quirky aspects to the story as well. In every detective story there is usually some gorgeous bombshell the hard-bitten detective falls for. But in Garcia's book he falls for a human female, and some hot sheet music (between the sheets, that is) ensues. Inter-species affairs are strictly forbidden, since it could blow their cover, but he can't help himself.There are more wild hijinks in this book I could tell you about, but as I just wanted to make a few comments, I'll let you discover them for yourself. Garcia has pulled off a little coup here by writing a very funny novel based on a wildly outrageous premise, and which he manages to pull off in style."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Eric Garcia has created an alternate universe of private eyes, dinosaurs and humans, where people are never quite what they seem and danger lurks around most corners. Clever and &quot;fiercely&quot; original, Garcia spins a highly unusual tale mixed with social commentary and satire. Highly recommended and four very big stars for originality. You will never look at a basil leaf the same."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"This is a wonderful detective story, as well as a hillarious book! I loved it!

BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!"},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"The Good:*The central 'conceit' was written well and incorporated into the novel succesfully (I didn't question anything about it once)The Bad:*The supporting characters were terribly written. If they weren't completely personality-less and flat, they were extremely annoying to read. Glenda, in particular, was really irritating...especially her dialogue. Which brings me to my next point:*The dialogue-there's really not much else to say about it other than it wasn't very good.*A lot of times I found myself wincing at the forced humor or cliched turn-of-phrases.*As the central mystery unraveled, I found myself caring less and less. For such a short book, the case developed way too slow and resolved itself way too quickly. Garcia spent a disproportionate amount of time describing the dino life than the case (which was way more interesting, anyways) so the plot suffers.DESPITE the negative points, I'd read another dino novel by Garcia simply because the conceit of the book is so clever and well-executed."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"The basic concept behind this book, that dinosaurs survived to the present and willfully evolved to be able to live among humans is original and clever, but the book focuses way to heavily on how they live as humans and ignores the story to a large extent until nearly the end when the author seems to suddenly realize he'll need to end the book and so everything comes together. Much too much time is spent buckling and unbuckling 'guises' and too little on the plot."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Dino meatsuit down and out PI disguise.No, really. In a humorous private investigator novel the main character is actually a dinosaur. Apparently they didn't die out and they live hidden among us, basically human sized.They stuff themselves into disguises, use scent etc. so no-one works it out.Once you can get past that basically Douglas Adams level of farce, you have a pretty fun book."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"If you're going to read Anonymous Rex then be prepared to not only suspend your disbelief, but to tie it to a chair,carry it to the basement. gag it and stab it to death with some kind of garden tool. Dinosaurs disguised as people? Give me a break. This isn't genre bending. It's absurd. The characters are not believeable and the plot routine at best. Save your money."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"This book is the first book in the Dinosaur Mafia series, in terms of publication date, but the 2nd one if you take the events of the books chronologically. The truly amazing thing about these books - in which the dinosaurs have NOT gone extinct, at least not all of them, but have evolved to a smaller size and live side-by-side with humans - with the help of a lot of latex, glue and straps to disguise them - is that while you are reading them you just go with it, because it is written so convincingly. This story is mostly about Vincent Rubio, a detective and the main character of all the Dinosaur Mafia books. Rubio's partner and mentor Watson has been killed - supposedly in a hit-and-run by a taxi in New York while taking part in a mysterious investigation. Rubio has gone on a serious bender with the basil (dinosaurs can't get drunk by drinking alcohol - their recreation of choice is with herbs, which get them \\"high\\") and is refusing to buy the story about what happened with Watson and as a result has just about burned all his bridges and lost most of his business. Things are looking really bleak when he gets thrown a bone by one of the big companies in town - which seems to lead right back to the case that Watson was investigating when he was killed. Although this story is a bit dark, it provides quite a number of laugh-out-loud moments as well. At its base, this story is a well crafted detective yarn. See Anonymous Rex/Casual Rex omnibus for my review of both books."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"The premise is simple. Dinosaurs did not die out 65-million years ago. They continued to evolve and become more intelligent (as well as smaller). About 1 in 20 people is actually a dinosaur in disguise. Vincent Rubio, a private investigator almost at the end of his rope is a velociraptor.Just as everything is at its worst for Vincent, a large PI firm offers him a simple insurance case; check if a nightclub fire was natural or planned. But Vincent doesn't like taking the easy way out. So when some clues point towards similar ground to the case that caused him all of his trouble, Vincent has to plunge forward.The case is an interesting one involving the death of a very rich dinosaur, the death of Vincent's partner, and more infidelities than you can wag a tale at. This is all told in a classic hard-boiled detective tale. Fans of Marlowe or Spillane will love the mystery.Garcia does a very good job of creating a plausible world but does not hit the reader over the head with the details. The details leak out in small amounts as they are necessary. But these details are not held as a sudden revelation to solve the mystery.I really enjoyed this one and look forward to the further, and previous, adventures of velociraptor PI Vincent Rubio."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"I read this book some time ago, but I am backfilling some of my reviews.Some books I buy based on the dust cover notes. This was one of those books. I am normally not much of a reader of detective novels unless they are very good. But the idea of a detective who was actually a dinosaur living disguised as a human was too intriguing to put down.I ended up loving it. Garcia gets it just right. He captures the tone of classic detective novels perfectly, but with tongue-in-cheek. Very few books make me laugh out loud, but this one did. He creates an intricate backstory of the secret world of dinosaurs that you really want to believe in. But it is more than just a gimmick. Garcia also has a suspenseful detective story woven in. I highly recommend this book to anyone whether they like the detective genre or not. I believe Eric Garcia will go on to great things beyond the dinosaurs."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"I wanted to like this book more because it has a lot going for it. It's a nice concept (completely ridiculous, but so what?), and the writing is good. Unfortunately, it just didn't keep me hooked all the way through.I think my problem was the dinos are so thoroughly integrated into human society that there's very little conflict. That's not a big deal, but the story itself just didn't catch me either. There were definitely some cool parts, and the end of it is pretty solid. But the fantasy elements don't seem as essential as they should be. This could almost be a conventional mystery, which isn't bad, but I caught myself wondering why we were even bothering with dinos, except near the very end of the story.I also think Garcia's writing is a little too \\"Jokey\\". He is funny, but it often seems forced. As if the writer is directing the plot toward a funny \\"bit\\" rather than a satisfying scene. Often the jokes, cute at first, go on way too long.I can't really fault this book much. I liked it more than I hated it. But, overall, didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Vincent Rubio is a down on his luck Los Angeles detetctive. Creditors are knocking on his door, he's mourning the death of his beloved partner and fighting an addiction to basil...Vincent Rubio is a velociraptor disguised as a human. I have to admit when I saw this book in my local bookstore I was both intrigued and skeptical. A secret society of dinosaurs living among humans?!? C'mon. But Eric Garcia pulls this unique concept off convincingly with wit, charm and sly humor, at the same time giving us a highly original, geniune detective story that you won't be able to put down!!"},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"At one level, classic hard-boiled detective novel: Vincent Rubio is a down-on-his luck private eye in LA, his partner was killed nine months ago (traffic accident *they say*), his car's been repossessed, he's into substance abuse, the whole drill. He's given one last chance assignment, to look into a suspicious nightclub fire. The investigation takes him to New York, into a mess involving jet-set financiers, forbidden medical experiments, and the death of Vincent's partner. There's even a sexy torch singer in a nightclub. Classic stuff, well written, true to genre. But there's another level.Vincent is a velociraptor. See, the dinosaurs faked their extinction, and live and walk among us wearing latex masks and complex body-harness disguises. Not a plausible conceit at all, of course, but certainly original! And it makes for a wonderful metaphor for racism, or homophobia, or other themes of The Masks We Wear and who should/shouldn't have sex with whom.It does bug me that Garcia misspells \\"Coelophysis\\" throughout, but I was a serious dinosaur geek as a kid and now a copyeditor in adult life, so it's just me."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Forget everything you know about dinosaurs. Not only did they not become extinct 65 million years ago, they currently make up about 5% of the \\"human\\" population. Rather than stomp all of us humans out of existence eons ago, they decided just to live in our world secretly, donning complex human guises and protecting their continued existence exceedingly carefully. You'd be amazed at just how many celebrities and power brokers are actually dinosaurs in disguise. All they want is to keep their secret, find the time and opportunity to really be themselves every now and again, and maybe get a good buzz on with basil or certain other herbs if and when the urge strikes. They live by two golden rules: never let a human learn their secret (and kill any who do) and never, ever, ever engage in interspecies relations with a human.With Anonymous Rex, author Eric Garcia first brought this strange new world to life, garnering critical acclaim and a cult following for his efforts. He is a brilliantly wicked author, packing loads of comedy into noir-ish tales of dinosaur private investigator Vincent Rubio. Poor Vince has had a rough nine months. It all started when his partner Ernie was run over by a taxi in New York; Vince went a little nuts after that, broke a lot of rules and at least one nose during his investigation of the accident, and got himself declared dinosaur non grata in both New York and back home in Los Angeles. He is in an emotional and financial tailspin now, nursing a major basil addiction and basically trying to find a reason to keep on keeping on. With little left to his name, he finally gets a case thrown his way, an insurance job investigating a fire at a local dino club. As luck would have it, the club owner had important contacts in New York, and before you can say Velociraptor, Vince is back in the Big Apple conducting interviews for a case that may well have some relation to his old partner's death.This thing gets pretty involved, as a simple case of possible arson soon leads Vince into a conspiracy of dinosaur-sized proportions involving human-dinosaur genetic experimentation (not to mention human-dinosaur relations of a much more personal nature). That is a serious no-no in the Dinosaur Council's notebooks. Slowly but surely, Vince starts assembling the pieces of the puzzle, but progress doesn't come without setbacks - a couple of attempts on his life, some inconvenient deaths of informants and friends, a serious lack of funds, and even a dangerous relationship with a singularly appealing human female. Danger is Vince's middle name, however, and in time he breaks out of his emotional funk, manages to stay away from basil long enough to clear his head, and relentlessly pursues a solution to a surprisingly complex mystery.The book is written in first person, in the classic style of ye olde detective mysteries from the golden age of Dashiell Hammett and Sam Spade. And make no mistake - aside from the unique dinosaur angle and the constant showcase of sarcastic wit and genuinely funny writing, Garcia knows how to construct and tell a good mystery. Anonymous Rex is a thoroughly engaging read from start to finish. There's an edge to this story, a fair share of surprises along the way, and all sorts of social commentary you can read into things or simply ignore. If you've been yearning for something different, Vincent Rubio, P.I., is on the case, and the game's afoot."},{"Title":"Anonymous Rex","review":"Other reviewers have summarized the plot. The book is intelligently ROTFL. You can't sustain that level of fantasy if you're not very, very good, and the social satire is deliciously subtle.

Here I am, a mere 5 hours after starting the book, completely finished. I had to know how it ended. At times, you almost forgot that it was anything other than an engaging murder mystery. The twists and turns of the plot are wonderful to behold, and the character development was phenomenal. If I have any complaints, it's that the concept of famous humans actually being something other than human is so, well, Men in Black. However, Garcia does not dwell on these revelations, so they are no more than a distraction. I am buying the follow up novel ASAP!

Here, after a thorough reading of Mr. Fernbach's poems, the reader comes away with insight into the poet's world, and can empathize with much of what he is feeling. This is a birds-eye view of Mr. Fernbach's day-to-day life: grappling with loneliness, the search for a soulmate, and how faith can ultimately save you. But, remarkably, these poems are richer in hope and joy than they are steeped in despair.One might assume that with poem titles such as \\"The Untouchable\\" with its first line, \\"I live in my own little world/trying to escape my private hell,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Chasing Windmills\\" and \\"Looking at a Van Gogh,\\" the poet is mired in self-pity but, surprisingly, he is able to pull himself up by the bootstraps in every situation in most every poem!The poet is at his absolute best when dealing with his familial setting. It can be gleaned from the scenarios depicted that Mr. Fernbach has grown up with both a father and a stepfather, a mother he loves dearly, and a tragic death in the family. While most poets hide their emotions behind obscure language, Mr. Fernbach is unabashadly honest. Particular examples are the last few lines of \\"Tribute to My Step-Dad, Max,\\" which state \\"Although you don't like my father,/He feels indebted to you/For taking care of the family.\\" Again, this poet takes you right into his living room and makes you feel welcome there.Mr. Fernbach is not without his whimsical forays. His exubereant optimism can be seen in \\"Loud Cloud\\" and \\"Angel Smoking Dope.\\" Also, he does what many poets don't dare attempt these days--rhyming--and he does it with ease, allowing himself to take risks with both form and content."},{"Title":"The building of character: Familiar talks on Christian living","review":"My copy of this book was given to a relative of mine in November 1901 - when I read it in 1999, it spoke straight into my life in an easy to read manner, convicted me on the areas I need to work on, but most of all, gave me a passion to build something meaningful and lasting and beautiful out of my life! Immensely relevant and beautifully written. 10/10!"},{"Title":"Tibetan marches","review":"I am indeed surprised that I am the first who has the honor to review this book, which is splendid and surprisingly for travel books, quite humorous, which is even surprising because the humor comes across despite translation. As one would have thought that the essence of a book, is always, lost in translation! The writer is conspicuous by making little things clearer, the aspect largely ignored in other books from that era (in 1930' and 1940's). For instance, the making tsampa or the famous tea bricks, which, although, we have read a lot about in other books, is almost graphically described about. I think Amazon, should come out with a special project that illustrates the work of relatively unknown gems such as this book."},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Boardroom: Venture and Misadventure in the People's Republic of China","review":"I found this book very educational. Purves' writting made it hard to put down. I finished the book on two plane rides between Cleveland and Austin. Purves presents his impressions in a non-judgemental way; this is just how things are. Excellent reading for anyone planning to have business dealings in the PRC."},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Boardroom: Venture and Misadventure in the People's Republic of China","review":"Bill Purves writes a clear and concise review of life in an old fashioned Chinese work unit. The real strength of the book lies in his descriptions of the lives of the Chinese workers of the factory. If you've ever been there and wondered why things happen the way they do, this book will go a long way towards answering your questions."},{"Title":"Confess Your Sins: The Way of Reconciliation","review":"John Stott approaches the topic of confession from a Biblical-Anglican perspective. Stott looks at confession privately to God, privately to another whom one has offended, privately to a priest (auricular confession) and publicly to a congregation.Stott emphasizes the need for Christians to daily (or more often) confess sins privately to God, the one who forgives us for our sins. He encourages Christians to believe the Word of God inviting confession for the forgiveness of sins. He also encourages confession privately to other people whom one has wronged that forgiveness might be granted for the wrong done. He also encourages Christians to rebuke other Christians when one has been sinned against that the wrong-doer may confess and receive forgiveness.Stott holds and argues the view that the Bible neither commands or suggests that confession to a priest is ever necessary for a person to receive absolute forgiveness from God for sins. He even argues that this type of confession is not helpful but hinders a person's developing relationship with God. He sees confession to a priest as a crutch that prevents people from walking spiritually. Stott suggests that auricular confession and absolution are only suitable for special circumstances when a believer is struggling overcoming guilt or shame for his or her sins and needs to hear from a priest the promise of absolution.Stott in no way diminishes those who advocate or practice confession, but he strongly disagrees with suggesting the practice is necessary or even good or helpful for most. He does state that when it comes to confession, \\"all may,\\" \\"none should\\" though \\"some need.\\" In this he differs from the traditional view of \\"all may,\\" \\"none must\\" \\"some should\\" approach to confession.In this book, he makes clear the traditional, evangelical Anglican view of confession. I think this book would be helpful to any Christian's personal relationship with God."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"This book mentions the singer for the now infamous punk rock band, Against All Authority. I have spoken to him about this and he tells some chilling tales about jumping their BMX bikes over the open grave that smelled of death, and trying to figure out what the puddle of stinky fluid was that leaked out all over the floor underneath where the bodies were stored. He and Dee's sons hid on top of the shed while they watched the hit men steal things. He spent many nights in the house because the boys were afraid to be in there alone. Apparently there was more to the story but at the time thebook was written the hitmen were out of jail and most of the people that new things were afraid they would be next."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"This book takes a good look at the serious and horrifying aspects of alcoholism, a must read for people with an alcohol problem or friends and family of an alcoholic. It shows just how far out of control alcohol can send a person."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"I read this book years ago - right after it came out. As a distant relative of one of the participants, it was of intrest. Well written, easy to read, informative, and more than likely accurate. If you like 'true crime' books, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"This book was a quick read and able to keep the reader's attention. I was rather taken aback by how reckless the protagonist was not only in the commission of her crime but in her failure to cover her tracks to avoid detection. More surprising was the author's assertion that she was intelligent? The book describes the relationship of a waitress, Dee Casteel, and her boss James Allen Bryant. Together they plan the murder of Bryant's homosexual lover. Bryant's motive is money while Casteel's is her infatuation with Bryant and the promise of continued employment as a waitress who will be permitted to drink on the job in order to keep her alcoholic jitters at bay. The author is quite sympathetic toward Casteel which began to get nauseating by the end of the book. This women is no better then the narcissistic,greedy,and manipulative partner she had in James Allen Bryant."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"I am in the Without Mercy book, mentioned...I have not read the book since 1989, as it brings all the horrors back to reality. I was a close friend to Art Venecia. I have written about this story, as it relates in a way, to the assault upon myself with intent to murder, by Miami City Commissioner, Marc \\"D\\" Sarnoff. Google, see the Cycling forums thread? Here, I just wrote, and Gary Provost is now dead; all are dead, but for me and some killers of Art Venecia. I will recall Art some other time in more detail. He was popular, generous, smart and too trusting.The late author, Gary Provost, came to this house and interviewed me in the Studyfor over an hour. I told him everything I knew of the character of Art Venecia.George Frietas, a mutual friend, self-employed accountant,who kept books for Art, myself, and others in our gay social circle,talked to Art a few days before, just before Art's murder.Art, who was having severe problems with his drug-addict, young lover,said to George, \\"He's crazy, he says he will kill me.\\" \\"Get out of there, Art\\", begged timid old George.\\"Nah, I can handle him. He's just a talker.\\" I asked George to testify, or at least, talk to the author years later.Even then, years after the murder, George was shaking, \\"Are you kidding, Reid? No way. I don't want to die.\\"You understand, that recounting just above, it is not in the book, because George did not want that to be known.Now, though, everyone important is dead and cannot be harmed,except for you, Marc...you rat fink killer. I hate bullies.I helped to put Art's killers into prison and I will now do the same for you.I will now try to recall something that has been mostly beaten from my shattered mind,beaten by physical assault and mental terrors. I wanted to witness for Art, I loved him very much,I say that a lot, I know, but Art was very good to me, and he was a great musician and affable personality.I attended one day of the public trial. The four defendants were tried together. I got to see them all,I was simply there in the public seating area, I did not have to testify. The medical examiner came into the courtroom.She carried a brown paper grocery bag. It was not opened. The judge did not want to see the content.It was the skull of my friend, Art Venecia."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"I have a lot of questions about the sentences of the people involved in the brutal murders of Art Venezia and his mother. Art who was in love in a disastrous homosexual relationship with James Allen Bryant who was the mastermind behind killing him for his money, property, estate, etc. Art even bought a restaurant for his lover to manage but he robs him blind. In the meantime, Allen falls for Henry Ramos, a Latino bisexual gigolo, while the waitress Dee Casteel, a troubled alcoholic in a bad marriage and mother of neglected children during this time, has feelings for Allen like a schoolgirl crush despite his homosexuality. Anyway Dee's ashamed face is on the cover of the book while the other three men are shown later. I have a trouble with reading this book because the writing is somewhat poor compared to other true crime books. I'm sure that I'll read it in a day. I do feel sorry for Dee but it was a no win situation for her. I don't have pity for Allen because I think he's just using Art for his own financial means. While the case is almost 25 years old, it's not incomprehensible that these crimes don't happen for money and it spins out of control just like alcoholism and drugs sometimes."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"Just finished the book; fascinating case study of a female alcoholic. I found some information about Dee Casteel on the web; her sentence was reduced in 1990 to Life In Prison. After that, the trail on her runs cold. Is she still in prison? Released? Dead? Anyone know? Tried to find out through the author, but apparently, he is dead now."},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","review":"This is an excellent book, could not put it down. I live in Homestead, I have never heard of this crime. Everyone I talk to wants to read this book. They have said to me, I can't put this thing down, it is so interesting. Of all the places they describe in the book, landmarks, people and place of business, I know them all. All of these places actually exist. You really need to read this book. I would like to get my hands on the re-trial book !"},{"Title":"Samurai Champloo, Vol. 1 (v. 1)","review":"(This review does not apply to the second volume of the Samurai Champloo manga. It was posted there by Amazon.com against my will. That manga, had I been able to rate it, would have surely gotten a 1 for going so far away from the original story and then ending quite suddenly with no promise to the future.)The manga starts out almost identically as the anime. Fuu is still searching for her Sunflower Samurai, and Mugen and Jin are still at each others throats. Beyond that, though, the manga goes in an entirely different direction. Instead of getting captured in the first manga by the feudal lords, and instead of doing a great deal of traveling and battling, most of what happens is slapstick comedy that takes place in cities and villages, and we never quite know the progress of the heroes because they rarely mention where they are at. It gets confusing at times.What makes this manga good, though, is that it reveals a lot about Fuu earlier than the anime did. All we know for perhaps half the series is that Fuu is searching for the Sunflower Samurai. The manga reveals a little of her history in the final chapter of this manga and why she's actually searching for this mysterious samurai. Plus, all of the separate chapters besides the first are entirely new. We can't have seen them in the anime, and they aren't jarring because the anime seems to jump ahead a lot, not to mention those \\"dimension\\" episodes, and these stories could easily be placed inside of those moments.I'm still waiting for a major enemy to reveal him/herself, as the heroes have yet to get into a serious confrontation, with the exception of Mugen and Jin's constant, chapter-ending feuding. All the chapters deal with the ways the characters go about getting money to eat and drink. I like to laugh, but that's not why I like Champloo.Still, it's difficult not to recommend this. Any fan of manga could pick this book up and find something inside worth reading, without any advance knowledge of the Samurai Champloo world. And if you are a fan of Champloo and want a new spin, pick this up. It follows the story in the anime but not in the same way."},{"Title":"Samurai Champloo, Vol. 1 (v. 1)","review":"Very exciting! If you are a fan of the Anime series that airs on [Adult Swim], A fan of Edo Japan & Samurais, Or you are into a good book with a unique style of art- You are in for a real treat!Samurai Champloo Volume 1 is a wonderful grab. Confronted with three characters- Jin [pronounced gene] who is a quiet and reserved samurai, Fuu [Foo] who is a waitress in a tea house thats not the brightest or most resourceful thing on the planet, and Mugen [Moo-gen]a samurai with no certain rythem or rhyme to his fighting techniques who can be called merciless and a womanizer at times-You are thrown into a freestylin', out of wack, crazy society, better known as the Edo Japan era -Just not the one you hear about in books..The Manga starts out the same as the anime, where Fuu rescues the two samurai from execution in order to get them to help her on her quest for the mysterious Sunflower-Scented Samurai. All though it braches out from the anime and doesn't follow it to a tee -it gives you a quicker ensight into Fuu's background aswell as the same intence action. It also still gives you the same anxious rivalry & want on both Mugen and Jin's part to beat the other in a battle!So Join this misfit gang on their journey for the Sunflower Samurai as they run into fights, trouble, danger, and...other peculiar incidences along the way. You'll enjoy this Killer sweet and satisifying Champloo spin on Edo Japan and the people in it with your soon to be favorite trio!-Winry"},{"Title":"Samurai Champloo, Vol. 1 (v. 1)","review":"This is a review for the 1st volume of the Samurai Champloo manga. It's starts out quite similar to the anime, but branches off from there.The stories are okay; they may seem too silly and outrageous. The complaint I have is the art. The art looks like it had been done either lazily or in a hurry. Most of the time the artist didn't care to use a straight edge to draw buildings, giving it a sloppy look.Also, the anime could incorporate music during the amazing fight scenes. The manga can just have numerous samurai getting their heads lopped off or getting cut in half.If you're a Champloo fan, you might want to pick it up, but if you don't you're not missing much. I'd stick with the anime."},{"Title":"Samurai Champloo, Vol. 1 (v. 1)","review":"A good anime, though not exactly what I was expecting - the quality of the episodes do vary. Some are truly excellent, and some merely watchable, with some even being boring.If it had continued the way it was going in the first seven episodes, I'd have rated it lower - but around episode 10 it picks up remarkably. The episodes have more substance and depth to them, the fights become more impressive, and it makes up for the dip in quality after the first episode which, despite some strange style choices, was still very cool.You can only have 'Lol, they're starving again' happen so much times before it gets irritating, so the fact that the series has finally gotten it out of its system is quite a blessing.So!

All the senseless killing turned me off, however. Mugen is a violent person who devours a hapless frog alive in the first three panels.

There is nothing likeable about this guy, until the last few pages of the manga.Fuu and Jin are more compelling characters. Jin is a handsome, old-fashioned samurai who is very skilled, but seeks a reason to fight. Fuu's quest is a simple but intriguing mystery: she seeks a samurai who smells of sunflowers.I will keep reading this manga, but the story and characters are average."},{"Title":"The Labrador Retriever : A Comprehensive Guide to Buying, Owning, and Training (Breed Basics, 1)","review":"Interested in Labradors?

I have three university degrees, including Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate in science, business, and economics. And I have taught at the university graduate and undergrate level for more than twenty years. I was astounded at the efficient and advanced technique used by the author, Stephen Hake, to gradually introduce most basic concepts of logic, arithmetic, alegebra, geometry,and other subjects to my 12 year old student in this book, in a practical manner with practical every day applications, so that he absorbed them as by osmosis, without actually knowing it. This will provide him with a solid foundation for the four years of mathematics he will receive in high school, and for his later studies at university level. Hake does this without muddying up the young students mind with such distracting technical terms as &quot;algebra, geometry, solid geometry, trigonometry, logic,and other subjects,&quot; by introducing the basic concepts of each subject with practical problems that require the student to, unwittingly, apply them."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"My 12 year old daughter is just completing Math 65. WOW!Although not produced with Special Learning students in mind, the incremental learning is ideal for slower learning or learning disabled students. My daughter has always struggled mightily with Math concepts. She has made tremendous strides using this program. New concepts are introduced slowly and previously learned concepts are reinforced at each lesson. Each lesson includes a practice, some mental math and problems. At the start it took an hour at school and up to an hour at home to complete the lesson. She now gets each lesson done in under an hour! (It is set up for one lesson a day). I highly recommend this book, and I'm looking forward to using the next books in the series."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"The Saxon math series kicked off with two wonderful books: 54 and 65. I was able to obtain 65 from one of my classmates because I needed some extra review in math. I LOVE IT! I used the book in 5th grade and had minimal struggle. The book starts with the simple concepts like addition and subtraction and slowly moves into fractions and missing number problems. Unlike the flop 76, rather than having surprise questions with no teaching, this book only throws surprise questions in after the concept was taught. The lessons are short making them relaxed rather than tense and the practices are short and to the point as well. Also, the mental math section at the beginning of each lesson helps students warm up on their addition, subtraction and whatever else skills they need to succeed. The appendix has a well written glossary and supplimental practice set for selected lessons to help endorse concepts. The books 150 lessons always have something new that'll help you; never an old concept. I highly reccomend this book whether you're just looking for some review or help or teach a class. Reccomended grade 4/5 for teachers. (Note: If you have to to get past the awful 76 for 6/7, use 65 and spare your students. You can always teach new concepts to keep them ahead.)"},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"I love it. It progresses at a better pace than Saxon 54 for kids who are comming off of Saxon 3 and excel in math. My daughter got frustrated with how much review of easier material there was in 54 and I was concerned with how little new material there was in 54 from 3 so we decided to skip ahead to 65."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"We homeschooled our kids over a period of years, and Saxon Math, including Math 65, was always our choice for math texts. I also teach in a classical Christian school where we use Saxon Math as well. I find that for most students, if they will take the time to read the lesson well, do all of the problems, and then rework any problems they miss then they will achieve a high degree of mastery of the material at hand.The greatest advantage of Saxon Math is that each lesson provides practice not only for the new problems but also built-in review for every kind of problem the student has previously encountered. Math 65 is no exception to the rule that Saxon Math texts help students learn math well. After Math 65, all of my kids who have taken it were definitely ready to move on to the next level.In general, Saxon Math, including Math 65, is highly recommended. It is especially ideal for homeschooling families."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"Our children used Saxon from 54 to 87, then moved on to advanced math, calculus and physics and they have excelled with this method. Although my background doesn't include an emphasis in math, my husband's education and professional life is steeped in mathematics. He's enthusiastic about Saxon because it creates a strong foundation in the subject.Admittedly, solving 30+ problems a lesson can be a challenge, however, this process increases one's speed and accuracy over time and as my daughter said, it helped her \\"to make peace with math.\\" Math is like learning how to play a musical instrument; it takes practice and self-discipline, but it's well worth the effort. Understanding math, like being proficient at reading and writing, is one of those practical skills that make life so much easier.Using this incremental method of learning made homeschooling through high school a breeze and our college-age children sailed through their college math courses as well. In hindsight, it would be easy to choose it again."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"We love Saxon in our house because it is so thorough and reviews regularly what the children have learned. No forgotten concepts here! One of my favorite parts is that next to each problem is the number of the chapter where the concept was covered.

The DIVE CDs that teach the Saxon books are outstanding as well."},{"Title":"Math 65: An Incremental Development","review":"I would highly recommend Saxon Math 6/5.

This year I have been using Saxon Math 3, 5/4, and 6/5 with my students. Due to the large range of abilities in my students and the need to diversify instruction, I have been using all three books.People with learning disabilities need to have more practices to learn a skill and the skill needs to be revisited frequently, Saxon Math products provide a systematic structure to allow students to progress.I am so pleased with Saxon math, I have bought used books through Amazon for my students. I have purchased these books with my own money when my school budget was cut to $75.00 last spring. This is the first time in my twenty two years of teaching that each of my students have a math book.

I am truly math phobic. One year (our boys were seven and nine) I was at a homeschooling convention and noticed the Saxon series on display. I bought it more or less on a whim. Wow! It was fantastic! I had tried other programs and media but poor teaching techniques can come in many forms. So after wasting mucho bucks on other books and videos, I was apprehensive. I won't bother describing the program as others have done a fine job. But allow me to relate two incidents.My mother was with me in the dining room trying to help me figure how to measure a half circle window so I could purchase the right amount of fabric. My older son, ten years old at the time, passed through the room to join his friends and stopped to see what we were so perplexed by. It took less than a minute for him to get the right answer using geometry. I had planned to spend a lot more for this project but saved a bundle after taking his figure to the store.My younger son decided to enter the navy years later and impressed the recruiter by passing the entry test with a ninety nine per cent on math.

This wonderfully written auto-biography invites us into the '70's world of sexual self-awareness, upper-class prejudices, free-spirited hippies, silver polishing, party crashing, toast, weed, and geodesic domes.Mr. Llewellyn manages to keep the reader trans-fixed from beginning to end. His &quot;tell it as it is&quot; writing mixed with copious amounts of humour makes for some embarrassing moments if you're reading this in public places.I highly recommend this book for true Llewellyn fans. It's a very revealing look into his youth and his background. From cartoonist to convict, from visionary to drag queen. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh some more, but all through-out the book you'll never stop wondering &quot;this guy is Kryten?!&quot;&quot;Thin He Was and Filthy-Haired&quot;, &quot;Man in the Rubber Mask&quot;, &quot;Man on Platform 5&quot;, &quot;Punchbag&quot;, and &quot;Sudden Wealth&quot;.

They're honestly quite good!"},{"Title":"Thin He Was and Filthy-Haired","review":"I love Mr Llewellyns books. &quot;Rubber mask&quot;, &quot;Punchbag&quot;, &quot;Platform 5&quot;- they are all first rate. I finished reading &quot;Thin he was...&quot; his teenage autobiography last night and I have to say its my favourite so far. The title is derived rather arcanely from a quote about aliens- &quot;Dark they were and golden eyed&quot;.The novel tells the story of Rob(the cartoonist) who in his teens went ever so slightly off the rails. He lives in a geodist dome, smokes weed and crashes Oxford balls in drag. A fantasy writer called Duncan finds Robs rebellious behavoiur extremely rich and makes a pass at him. Young Rob is flattered, but his hormones are too much raging for attractive females. He is also desparetly seeking a direction in life. His romantic and anarchic ideals seem to have no place in &quot;The System&quot;.Unlike anything else Llewellyn has written, this storys innocence goes straight to the soul. He perfectly captures the sights and sounds of the time and his characterisation is utterly charming. At one point he mentions having never read &quot;Catcher in the rye&quot;. This is interesting because his book has a similar engaging narritive with the wild excitment of &quot;On the road&quot;."},{"Title":"Thin He Was and Filthy-Haired","review":"Being of the same generation as Bob I shook my head knowingly between outbursts of hysterical laughter, whilst reading the book in only three days. Apart from being relieved to learn I'm not the only bloke whose early sexual experiments were about as successful as Kryten's attempts to tell lies, I also shared his frustrations in coming to terms with Straights and their bread-head world. But far from being self-indulgent nostalgia this book captures those years in our lives when events seemed to sweep us along by their own momentum. In the company of people who likewise challenge the secure world around them, Bob finds himself caght up in a conflict between easy middle class existence and trying to be a working class revolusionary. The gate crashing of the Oxford Ball is perhaps the hardest bit to believe, but any creative license is well justified. I liked the fact that he adds an update as to the present whereabouts of the main characters at the end of the book.

An updated version of this was published in 1997 as Children of Gebelaawi. The reason why there are two published versions is that after the threats to Mahfuz's life made in 1989 in the wake of the Rushdie affair, because of this novel, the translator (and author of this review), P J Stewart refused to sell his copyright to Doubleday for a world-wide relaunch, considering it more prudent to continue quietly publishing with the original American publisher, now renamed Passeggiata Press. The unsuccessful attempt on Mahfuz made in October 1994 confirmed the wisdom of this decision. The American University of Cairo Press, which owns the world rights, then commissioned Peter Theroux to make a new translation. However, Passeggiata continued to have the US paperback rights, which had been granted to it in 1981 (and in apparent violation of which Doubleday has published its paperback in the USA). As the translator of Children of Gebelaawi, I cannot decently comment on the quality of Theroux' version. Some people may like his use of English, which does not appeal to me. I have found various gross errors of translation of the Arabic, but no doubt a careful study of my version would find similar mistakes; neither of us is a native Arabic speaker. However, it does worry me that in some places he has made a mistake that was in my 1981 edition and which I have since corrected; at least one of these is such an improbable 'howler' that I cannot believe he did not use my translation. Theroux' version lacks an introduction, and I consider this a grave lacuna. The history of the book is deeply interesting in itself and needs to be told. The novel also needs some explaining: why did Mahfuz, the deep psychological observer, write a book so apparently lacking in subtlety; and what is the secret message of the book? All this is tackled in the extensive introduction to Children of Gebelaawi. One more point: Theroux, like all other translators, uses the Arabic text published, without the author's participation, in Beirut in 1967. It is full of typos, but also - mysteriously - it includes words and whole sentences missing from the original Egyptian serialization, suggesting that the publisher had access to the missing manuscript. Children of Gebelaawi is the only version in any language to be based on both the source texts."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"&quot;Children of the Alley&quot; (AKA &quot;Children of Gabalawi&quot;) is both a realistic and an allegorical novel that consists of two stories simultaneously. On the year the book began to be published as a serial in Al-Ahram, it was banned for ten years, after which it was published for the first time in book format in Beirut. The story, as I mentioned, has two faces. The first is that of an enormous family and its descendants. And the second is the religious history of mankind, with the prophets, the legends, and in the end, the scientific revolution. The background is the &quot;Gabalawi Alley&quot;, which has a unique role, just like the &quot;Midaq Alley&quot;, or the alley in &quot;The Harafish&quot;. I can say without a doubt that Mahfouz is &quot;Proust of the Arabs&quot;."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"Not sure if I read the politically correct translation but I was impressed by this book. The story is very strikingly told as a simple and hauntingly familiar fable. Historical references are fused with a miasma of religious inferences that manage to seem both biblical, Pharoanic, historical and modern at the same time. We are smitten with the book's stark similarities to Old Testament religious texts. One is then reminded of the vast amount of fabled material each of today's religions has pilfered from the papyri of the Pharaohs.A good read in English, but it is a book you can put down and pick up without chagrin.I am sad to hear of the death of the Author and wish him a good rest in the Heaven of his choice."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"Through a succession of generations and characters Mafouz makes a strong case for humanity's penchant for forgetting the lessons learned by historical perspective.In the beginning, an eldest son is cast from his father's house, and loses his inheritance, which goes to a son by a different mother. Like the serpent in the Garden of Eden, this next inheriting son is tempted, and also falls prey to his human failings. The two cast-out sons establish residence in the alley outside the opulent security of their father's house. They spend their lives waiting to be forgiven, for their &quot;ancestor&quot; (father) to call them and their families back into the fold. In this way, the sons and the son's sons live the life of the alley, a microcosm of the misery of mankind, where the strong feed on the weak and violence dominates.The story becomes an allegory for all of mankind seeking salvation and forgiveness, a return to the source from which we came. Some of the descendants claim to have visions of their &quot;ancestor&quot; (God), changing their lives completely, spreading a doctrine of love and renewal; as well, each generation in the alley produces a &quot;prophet&quot;. Life becomes so desperate that the people willingly change their ways and temporary peace settles on the alley. In each case, over time, all is forgotten and the people fall into despair again. And so the cycle repeats. The reader is left to look inward at his own role, his own small history, whether to choose the light or the darkness."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"I would like to thank fellow reviewer Bruce Kendall for bringing this book to my attention.Naguib Mahfouz is one of the most important of the modern Egyptian writers and this is a good place to start with his 20 or so current novels still in print.This is not a novel, but a series of five similar stories about life in a small area known as the alley. Each story involves the same members of a related group of people but each story is set generations apart in time.All the stories or the five sections of the book involve a conflict between the manager and his enforcer of a central and walled off estate and the rest of the members of the alley society who live outside the walls. It is a struggle for equality and human dignity by the peole in the alley versus the manager of the estate and his enforcers who want to control the wealth. It is a struggle between economic dominance and poverty.Each story involves a central male protagonist who struggles to find equality and justice in his own way starting with Adham, and then followed by Gabal, Rifaa, Qassem, and Arafa. Each protagonist - in his own time or era - follows his own aggressive or passive style to try and reach his objectives. After the first section on Adham, each main character feels an attachment back to Adham and his successors, and that attachment plays a role in the subsequent storiesThe story or fable is a brilliant work of literature. It is well written, entertaining, and it is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"On the surface Children of the Alley appears strange and of dubious intent. Five stories are set in the same place but at different times. Each generation reveres the wonderful deeds of their ancestors, celebrating them with art, poetry, and song. Meanwhile back in the present, people repeat the struggle for justice as if the earlier stories had never occurred. The struggle for justice plays out in the shadow of Gabalawi's mansion. Why is Gabalawi silent while his people suffer? Why do the Children of the alley achieve liberation, only to be discovered back in squalor at the beginning of the next story? What is history?Mahfouz writes in the style of his other tales of Cairo, a familiar landscape for those who read and love his novels. Each story echoes themes from famous stories from the Bible or the life of Mohammad. The author is saying something about religion as well as history, but what? Take Gabal, for example, a character who appears to be modeled on Moses. Gabal's solution to the problem of the gangsters is to lure them to run into a pit, and then to pelt water and stones down from the windows of the alley to smite them. It is not exactly the Red Sea, but we recognize the essential technique of drowning the creeps. Other recognizable figures - Adam, Jesus, and Mohammad - are given similar through-the-glass-darkly treatment, or so it seems. We are left to speculate who the fifth protagonist in the novel may represent.This novel is a fun read, and it is even more fun to read in a reading group, while doing enough background reading to compare the protagonists with their models. Lively discussion is sure to ensue, and we ask people to check their knives at the door, just in case it gets too lively.This is a great novel by a great novelist, a rare case where the Nobel prize should feel honored to have his name associated with it, rather than the other way around."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"This novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths, and underlying the story are indeed echoes, sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted, of ancient myths. God is allegorized as Gabalawi, the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the Children of the Alley are supposed to be his heirs. The central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters. The first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden and the story of Cain and Abel; the second that of Moses and Pharaoh; the third that of Jesus; the fourth that of Muhammad.Then there is a fifth story, in which the central figure, a \`magician', is presumably a scientist. He tries to discover the secret of Gabalawi He fails to find it, but in the process he is instrumental in the death of Gabalawi \`who had been easier to kill than to see'. It makes no difference: the scientist, who has invented a weapon of great destructive power, is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer, and the Children of the Alley remain as oppressed as ever, though they remain hopeful that one day \`magic' will put an end to their suffering.Subtle the book is not, either in content or in style; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive. The overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names, but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another. A large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent. They mostly \`shout', \`scream', \`shriek', \`yell', \`cry' or \`sneer', which becomes rather tiresome.The literary quality of this novel is, I think, greatly inferior to Mahfouz's rightly famous Cairo Trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only Arab to have been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. But it is a courageous book for an Egyptian to have written: it has been banned in Egypt; its allegories enraged the Islamicists and led to an attempt on the author's life."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"In 1993 Mahfouz was stabbed by a fundementalist for writing this book. If you read it you will see that it sets everyone under one spiritual saga. By everyone I mean all of the middle-eastren religons. Nonetheless it can be read as a novel about a family's journey throughout time starting with one family and stemming out into many conflicting families. It really makes you think of Adam as everyone's base root, the grandfather that humanity shares, weither you believe in that or not is not the point, because wherever we came from we all came from the same place. But Mahfouz goes deeper into why families split up, where does one family breake off into many families, and why. Don't try to take this into mind though, and don't go into it looking for arguments, if you find yourself doing that just put it down untill you've fallen in love with one from the enemy, whoever you are. This was a story not so much about love, but in its service."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"Having wanted to read a novel by Mr.Mahfouz for years,I was lucky to have selected Children of the Alley to commence my love affair with his stories.You can smell this novelist's passion for the streets of Cairo from half the world away.His stories somehow come to life despite the translational barrier,I found myself following each unforgettable character,feeling their agony,their success,their humiliation and their shame. The provocative predictibilty of this novel is what makes it a remarkable read,how can he easily and every so simply identify these worldly controversial issues and put them into such a flawless context? The book is a challenging gift for the minds.

All of Mahfouz's early writing is incredibly romantic yet serious and engaging at the same time. This book is among the best, and probably a must read for the following: religious fundamentalists of any sort, people curious about fundamentalists, people with any religious prejudice, people with no religion at all. In short, this is a seriously challenging work that will likely be moving to anyone that reads it."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"This is probably the only book over a 100 page long that I finished.

And he does an excellent job of showing how violence, pain, and thuggery manage to adapt to any system of beliefs. The prose has this really serene, gently contemplative aura about it. That being said, the translation I read of this kind of sucks. A lot of the sentences have this klunky, often stilted quality, and the dialogue is riddled with very contemporary American colloquialisms, most of which seem completely out of place in an Arab language novel written in the 1950's about religious history. There are plenty of beautiful passages in it, but you have to grind your teeth on the messy bits to get to them. Try and find the older translation of it if you can"},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"This is the story of the Gabalawi family. Gabalawi disowns his son Idris in favour of Adam and then puts the latter to the test. The children of the alley are all the people living in the Gabalawi Alley where Gabalawi is the ancestor who owns everything and everybody in the desert around it.We meet Adham, Gabal, Rifan, Quassem and Arafa who each in their own way fight the injustice and the gangsters in the alley in order to free their fellow citizens from bondage and tyranny. But after each individual victory it inevitably turns out that the children of the alley fall back again into greed, corruption, crime and poverty while just a few enjoy wealth and power.In this sense this is a powerful and daring narrative which teaches us a lot about the spiritual history of humankind. A powerful fable and a richly told story which embraces in its plot not only the world of the Middle East but the world itself."},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","review":"Naguib Mahfouz is a brilliant writer and a documentarian of an Egypt that outsiders rarely come to discover. He writes about folks of all classes in every kind of relationship throughout generations of time. Children of the Alley (also known as Children of Gabalawi) traces five protagonists who are are sequentially significant figures in the lives of their small precincts. He connects these related figures and explores the effect each has on life in the communities he describes. Each generation adds to our understanding of the intertwining lives Mahfouz depicts and helps us to understand what daily life must have been like in that setting. He is wonderful in his ability to get inside his characters and explore their joys and their loyalties and their pain.The progenitor of the series of powerful men who are at the center of this story serves as the constant reference point. His descendanta arrive one after another in Biblical fashion and we can sense Maguib's intention to parallel the great stories of our background. We are never quite sure if Gabalawi is still living or exerting influence on the scene yet without his existence in some form or other, there is little to hold the story together. I understand that an earlier translation of the Children of Gabalawi is more faithful to the intentions of the author so I recommend the reader attempt to secure that version.

Since that day I've been eagerly awaiting the hoped for final book. In brief 'Die if You Must' does not disappoint at all. It is clearly well researched, factual with a strong dash of humanity and crammed with stories and information that thrilled me, saddened me, horrified me and ultimately left me with feelings of hope. The accounts of first contacts with hitherto unknown, understandably wary or hostile people are incredibly intense and I found it easy to imagine the mutual terror and excitement felt by both the indigenous nations and the people seeking to contact them. Stories of tribal revitalization and resistance in the face of seemingly unsurmountable opposition are great to hear. We hear tales of honour, shame, morality, courage, grief and guilt in the very personal accounts of people both indigenous and neo-Brazillian in the wider scope of the book. It's a shame that like so many other pages in history, that of the indigenous peoples of Brazil is one that is sadly neglected by the media and writers alike. Thankfully there are still people like John Hemming determined enough to bring their stories and histories to a wider audience. A fantastic book, detailed maps and information, I could go on and on.

The course is extremely well structures and systematic. The chapters in the grammar book, conversational books, reading and writing books, homework books, and audio tapes are all poetically sychronized. The explanations and examples are clear and to the point. The language aspects covered are accessbile, relevant to modern Japan, and readily useful - albeit a little on the formal side, which can make you sound like a textbook sometimes. Thus, be sure to supplement this curriculum with lessons with a native speaker or a Japanese friend - if you have the opportunity - so that you may acquire the more colloquial expressions that will give you the nuance of a native speaker.If you do the course, I first recommend thoroughly learning Hirogana and Katakana . If you do, you pronunciation will be more accurate and you'll progress more rapidly. As I have a visually-oriented memory, I could often recall passages of dialogue or key expressions by reading them in Kana in my thoughts. If you don't learn Hirogana and Katakana, you'll inevitably fail this course as all the drills in conversational texts are written as such.After learning these basics, I suggest reading the grammar book first (repeatedily); and then listen to the audio tape(s). After, practice the material in the conversational text(s); and follow-up by re-reading the grammar book; and then listening once again to the audio tape(s) before doing the homework. It's a big time commitment, but this approach should help to consolidate the language in your memory. After, use, use, use the language as much as you can to the point where it's over-practiced. If you are lucky enough to live in Japan, you can really get some good practice in. But, be warned, you're native English ability is highly valued commodity here, so many Japanese may subtly try to conduct conversations with you in English only - it's really a matter of find a fair balance to avoid getting annoyed. I suggest organizing a language exchange with a native.Before attempting this programme, you may want to invest in the Pimsleurs course. 'Total Japanese' is really designed for those who are serious about learning this language. As such, it is used as a text by many universities and akin educational institutions. Lastly, I advise doing one chapter a week. With forty highly detailed chapters, you'll need this time to give your brain the time it needs to process the language.

Packed with examples of how movements have succeeded and failed, this extremely readable handbook will inspire through its analysis of strategies and tactics that can be used to accomplish what many of us desperately want. Most of us understand already that simply arguing for social justice will fail to achieve it, but -- as Shaw demonstrates -- Herculean efforts, if miscalculated, will just as surely fail. In this book, Shaw describes successful strategies for community organizers, effective relationships with elected officials, the use of coalitions, ballot initiatives, the media, lawyers, and direct action strategies. The most persuasive theme tying each of these discussions together is that the best defense is an effective offense, that a failure to aggressively pursue positive change is a strategy for worsening the status quo."},{"Title":"The Activist's Handbook: A Primer Updated Edition with a New Preface","review":"This book is highly readable and has GREAT examples and tips.

Particularly when I was reading a news article today, I had a better understanding of all of the implications of the State Department giving the green light to the Keystone pipeline.

But more importantly, he knows his subjects and places. Little Rock itself becomes a character in this book, as Lyons provides unusual insight into a city and society that few of us are familiar with.The story is by turns hysterical, astounding and gripping. It is peopled by some of the most decent, and some of the weirdest folks you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting. Full marks."},{"Title":"Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)","review":"This story recalling the early 80's murder in Arkansas of Mary Lee Orsini's husband and her one-time lawyers wife is quite complicated in it's narrative. (which is to be expected with over 100 \\"cast of characters\\" first listed for you in the book) The story isn't so much about Orsini's conviction on conspiracy to murder charges for her lawyers wife (and conviction - then overturned conviction in her husbands murder) than it is about the corrupt Arkansas political figures and a self absorbed county sheriff from Pulaski County Ark. and all his miss-doings. While the book gives many details involving the crimes, and Orsini's attempted coverup of her part in the murders, it gets into the local medias coverage of the trials and intimate details of too many of the characters involved in the investigation. I wouldn't recommend it for reading. A Footnote: The killer's of the lawyers wife: Hall & McClendon are still sitting in Arkansas institutions as of the writing of this review at the ages of 66 & 59 respectivaly doing life sentences. Mary Lee Orsini, who also received life in the woman's murder and was suspected of killing her husband, actually confessed to killing her husband to Pulaski County, Ark. authorities on 7/17/03 twenty one years after the fact. She said she basically killed him because she didn't want to get caught in all the lies she had told her husband over financial problems they were having at the time. (If you can believe her - she was a true narcassistic psychopath) Orisini died, of a heart attack, just a few weeks after confessing to authorities in 2003."},{"Title":"Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)","review":"Ron Orsini was murdered in his own home, while sleeping in his bed.His wife, Mary Lee, and stepdaughter, Tiffany claimed they heard NOTHING.Although many of the officers on the case suspected Mary Lee had killed her husband, there just wasn't enough of evidence to prove it.For all intents and purposes, Mary Lee had gotten away with murder.But she just couldn't let it be.For the next two years, Mary Lee would make wild claims of being followed on the dark rural roads of North Little Rock, of shadowy characters breaking into her home, of being victim of an underworld conspiracy.It was a witchhunt and she was innocent, she would loudly proclaim to everyone.Including her criminal defense attorney, Bill McArthur, that had earned a No True Bill from a grand jury on the murder of Ron Orsini.When McArthur's wife is brutally murdered in their home, police suspect Bill and Mary Lee conspired to have her murdered.Why not? According to Mary Lee, she and Bill were in the midst of a torrid love affair.Bill claimed it wasn't so. And there was very little evidence to prove otherwise.Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)by Gene Lyons is a true crime wild ride with a maniac at the wheel!

It's not one you'll easily forget."},{"Title":"Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)","review":"Gene Lyons' WIDOW'S WEB is a wonderfully intricate story of two murders in early 1980s Little Rock, AK - the separate executions of Ron Orsini, a part-owner of a heating and cooling business and Alice McArthur, the wife of a well-known Little Rock attorney.Among the story's numerous subplots are the rivalries among the Little Rock and North Little Rock, AK, police departments and the Pulaski County Sheriff's Department, the latter a thoroughly corrupt organization headed by an insanely out-of-control sheriff, Tommy Robinson. There is also a delightful cast of secondary characters.But the glue holding the whole mess together is a sociopathic greed-head named Mary Lee Orsini. Mary Lee, like many narcissistic sociopaths, thought she was smarter than anyone else and loved being the center of attention, even when she would clearly have been better off avoiding any limelight whatever. To accomplish her desire for continuing attention and stardom, she maintained regular contact with the Little Rock newspapers and TV stations as well as with the three law enforcement agencies mentioned above, making up and revising stories as she went along for a period of two years. The papers and TV were more interested in delivering scandalous material than investigating the truth of her claims, and - no matter how ludicrous they were - Tommy Robinson and the boys' sheriff's department ate up Mary Lee's ridiculous and continually changing theories of mob involved drug activity and violence, as well as of more locally oriented concoctions involving arson, infidelity, and anything else she could come up with.WIDOW'S WEB is a professionally written book; dense with detailed research, and containing enough twists and turns to thoroughly engage the reader from start to finish. There are no attempts at \\"creative writing\\" and only enough forensics and trial material to progress the narrative. And there is absolutely no filler.Lyons' book is an outstanding work of true crime. I can't imagine anyone who is a fan of the genre not thoroughly enjoying WIDOW'S WEB, and I want to wholeheartedly thank my friend in Ohio for sending me her copy."},{"Title":"Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)","review":"I love TC books where a woman goes crazy with the shopping and then guns her husband down to cover it up before the bills can arrive. This book is so reminiscent of Barbara Stager who shot two different husbands to cover up her wild spending.

Then there is the issue of the $40,000 she misplaced. I love how in these stories the femme fatale is never that good looking. This one is described with a weak chin and a huge behind.

First, I used it to prepare for the Western Civ 1 CLEP (I will be using it for Western Civ 2 CLEP, as well). I read once through with a hi-liter and then I did three practice tests from petersons.com. I passed the CLEP with a 70 (out of 80).Second, I found it to be very interesting!!! This author did such a good job of presenting a timeline, so that I could organize the ideas easily in my head. This is obviously necessary if you are to keep your facts straight. He did a better job than the history books I have read previously (high school mainly). He also took great care to regularly present the status of women, slaves and minorities (or oppressed majorities) throughout the book and even included very interesting blurbs of ancient writings to illustrate many of these things. I learned more about the status of WOMEN in the history of Western Civ, than I ever have in any other book before. And it was all there organized for me.I am a military history/studies major, and I have already used this book once to familiarize myself with the Punic Wars, for a project. It really helped me get a basic grip on it, and provided quite a bit of what I needed to know.I really like this book. ;)"},{"Title":"Western Civilization: Combined Volume","review":"If I could give this book three and a half stars, I'd rather do that, because the rating truly falls between \\"It's OK and I liked it.\\"The main reason for this less-than-steller rating is that the book effectively makes an interesting subject boring. Another reviewer from Barnes and Noble remarked that, though they loved history, they detested this book. That about sums up my sentiment. History had long been one of my favorite subjects, yet I found myself slogging through this book--while others held me spellbound. Of course, if your prof assigns this book, you really have no choice; the author does cover the ENTIRE history of western civ (from the homo erectus to Bush's Iraq war), but in a certain way.In this book, emphasis is placed on MODERN history, specifically the nineteenth century and the various wars of the twentieth century. Pre-history through the collapse of the Roman Empire is covered--but those subjects only get seven chapters, or less than 25% of the book's length (of 29 chapters). Before chapter seven is even finished, the author moves on to early Christianity and \\"the dark ages.\\" The Middle Age period continues until chapter 11.From chapter twelve on, the author focuses more on THEMES than time periods, though he tries to present these themes in appropriate chonological order. For a simple breakdown of the chapters:1--First Civilizations2--Ancient Near East3--Greeks4--Hellenistic World5--Roman Republic6--Roman Empire7--Medieval World8--Early Middle Ages 750-10009--Growth: High Middle Ages10--Rise of Kingdoms11--Crisis: Later Middle Ages12--Renaissance13--Reformation14--World Exploration 1500-180015--Search for Order: 1600's16--Scientific Revolution17--\\"Enlightenment\\"18--Wars and Social Change: 1700's19--Revolution--French and American Revolutions20--Industrial Revolution21--More Revolution and Romanticism 1815-5022--Nationalism and Realism 1850-7123--\\"Age of Progress\\" 1871-9424--Anxiety and Imperialism 1894-191425--World War I 1914-191826--Between the Wars 1919-3927--World War II28--the Cold War29--Modern World Since 1973As you can see, a full third of the book is devoted to the past 200 years, so there is clearly a modern history focus. My biggest critism of this book is that is author is much more concerned with themes than presenting the information in a logical way. For instance, the Reformation of the 1500's is covered in chapter 13, but world travel (which began in the 1400's) is covered in the NEXT chapter! When the author turns his attention to modern times, he's all over the place, going from Watergate to 9/11 and then going back and covering the stuff in between.To be fair, a survey course like the ENTIRE history of western civ is lot of information. However, I've seen this task much better handled by other (more organized) authors. Hopefully, you will be assigned one of THEIR books!"},{"Title":"Western Civilization: Combined Volume","review":"I used this text in my AP European History course. It is a great book.

I switched teachers for AP Euro halfway in the year. My first semester teacher had us read The Western Heritage by Kagan, and although Kagan is a relatively well-known scholar, the text was very difficult to comprehend, and it had too much information that I honestly didn't care about. Western Civilization is a great book for AP European History, or an equivalent college-level course in modern European history, because it is both readable and focuses on the information that's important for the exam.Of course, it's not possible to cover all of Western civilization in one book, but it's a great survey of modern European history.

Probably the best and fair book regarding Nixon from 1973-1990."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"This third volume of the Nixon series is dominated by the Watergate scandal, with Ambrose skilfully detailing how the great election victory in 1972 slowly unravelled, as the full weight of the media and Democrat-controlled Congress worked to expose the whole tawdry episode. During this era, there was also the bombing of Hanoi followed by the Vietnam ceasefire, and summits with the Soviet leadership, but Watergate overshadowed all. Ambrose makes it clear that Nixon reinvented the story over and over, and bears a large burden of blame for the predicament he found himself in. He also makes clear that this was the opportunity for Nixon's arch enemies in the media and Congress to go for blood. The descent into the nightmare of possible impeachment and eventual resignation reads like an inevitablity, that Nixon lasted till August 1974 said a lot about his tenacity and stubborness in the face of relentless adversity.The recovery of Nixon was never fully realized, although he was an authoritative elder statesman in later years, and Ambrose shows that Nixon had regained a fair amount of respect in his later years. Since his death the left has continued to disparage and villify his legacy, but as hard as it is to defend Nixon at times, he was still a statesman to be reckoned with, and his foreign policy record, especially with his China trip, is one of distinction. The eastern establishment despised Nixon, but he did not cater to them, it was the silent majority that was his constituency. One finishes this book wondering where America would have gone had the Watergate scandal not occurred."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"This is a book that really let you know Richard Nixon, one of the most fascinating politicans of this century.

The parts on Nixon's fall are thrilling, but as are the parts on his return.

My interest in Nixon and the whole watergate era was minimal before reading it. I just wanted to read \\"Ambrose\\". After reading it, I read 2 more books on Nixon/Watergate and neither compared to this book. If you have an interest in this topic, it is a must read. If you like reading about history, you MUST read anything written by Stephen Ambrose."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"Stephen Ambrose concludes his three volume work on Richard Nixon with a flourish. Watergate is an extremely complex and lengthy story which Ambrose details in fine detail. After the president's resignation, we are then treated to Nixon's final comback which is a sixteen year saga.In terms of the three volume set, Ambrose does a brilliant job with this nine decade life. But let's give his subject some credit as well. Richard Nixon (love him or hate him) is one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. A man of modest means who goes from U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, and a two term Vice President through 1960. At that point, he is dealt with devastating defeats in a presidentail election and the 1962 Governor's race in California. Some men would be left for dead but you just can't get rid of this guy. Wins the presidency in 1968 and a crushing landslide in 1972. Serving two terms would seem to have been the crowning achievement except for a little break-in at a hotel interrupts the fairy tale ending. As mentioned in the first paragraph, he makes his final comeback to re-establish his reputation. He does all of this with a personality that would seem to be an antithesis of a politician (moody, no close friends, distrust of people, awkward in social situations.)I read the entire three volume set (almost 2,000 pages) this summer and I am not sure if I will ever read about a subject so interesting done by such an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"To fully understand Nixon, I highly recommend first reading volumes 1 and 2 of Ambrose's work. If, however, you are more interested in the Watergate affair, this volume certainly stands on its own.This is the final part of Ambrose's definitive three-volume biography of Nixon. The destructive tendencies wonderfully described by Ambrose in the first two volumes come to a head in Ruin & Recovery. Ambrose takes the reader through the unfolding of the mess that was Watergate.Even though we all know the ultimate outcome will be resignation, the author manages to maintain enough tension and suspense to keep the reader engrossed. In the wake of resignation, Ambrose follows Nixon's remarkable comeback as an elder statesman.If an affordable copy is not currently available, be patient. Because this book is out of print, it will be more expensive than you might expect, but you can find it for $20 to $30 if you look around."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"Mr. Ambrose offers a sometimes charitable view of Nixon, but perhaps such generosity is merited in many respects. At the same time though, Ambrose places the brunt of the culpability for Nixon's downfall where it belongs. To maintain that balance in such a detailed biography had to have been as complicated and dichotomous as Nixon was himself.Too many biographies of Nixon end with the bizarre peace wave as he boards Marine One on August 9th, 1974. I especially appreciated learning more of Mr. Nixon's struggles during the first weeks and months of his post-presidency - a period of such humiliation and depression it would have killed most of us, one way or another. It nearly did Nixon in too. I marvel at the man's inner strength.A fascinating read - one I'd highly recommend."},{"Title":"Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990","review":"For a guy that didn't grow up during Watergate, I found the third volume in this series to be a real page turner. Ambrose does a good job of telling you what happened, why it happened, how the public saw it and all the ways Nixon tried to keep the public from seeing it all.Ruin and Recovery is a great subtitle for this volume because Nixon truly did recover. There were a few things he never lost... his ability to guage the American people and how they felt about candidates and the ability to breakdown foreign affairs. It was good to see that in the final years of his life he was called on as an expert on both.I'm going to say it...\\"I ADMIRE RICHARD NIXON.\\" Obviously I don't admire his Presidency or his decision-making during Watergate... but... for the most part I feel he was an idealistic, patriotic person that took a bad path and ruined his place in history at least when it comes to his Presidency. He did many things that Americans should respect though and it's high time we did.I am glad he has made a recovery in the minds of many Americans and as I read this final volume I think I saw Ambrose almost making a case for Nixon being a kinder, gentler person who should be slightly more respected in American history.Everybody makes mistakes and true Nixon made a big one, but I think in this final volume Ambrose almost makes a personal peace with Nixon and in a way advises Americans who resented Nixon to do the same.Really an enjoyable series of books that I would recommend to anyone willing to spend 1900 words delving into what made Nixon both good and bad as a person and politican."},{"Title":"DAY OF THE DINOSAUR (First Time Readers)","review":"A very poor effort from the point of view of a child.

Thompson, perhaps best known for his \\"The Making of the English Working Class,\\" and his posthumous book-length treatment of the poetry of William Blake titled \\"Witness Against the Beast,\\" planned a comprehensive - and possibly multi-volume - treatment of English Romantic poetry. Unfortunately, he only got a chance to sketch the plan for the project before he passed away in 1993. This volume, \\"The Romantics: England in a Revolutionary Age,\\" then represents not Thompson's complete vision, or even anything close to it, but is rather a compilation of some preliminary ideas collected by Thompson's wife (a fine historian in her own right, but not of the English Romantics), which constitute about one-fourth of the material of the book. The rest consists of extended book reviews that, while integrating a lot of the relevant history that certainly would have been included in Thompson's completed book, fail to contribute to the overarching thesis that Thompson seemed to set out in the first couple of essays.The weakest parts of the book were the reviews, which were really tied together by nothing other than the fact that they concerned the figures involved in the lives of either Coleridge or Wordsworth, and influenced their ideas about and reactions to the French Revolution. William Godwin and John Thelwall are two of the most prominent of these figures, who are of no small amount of historical interest. However, I would imagine that the average reader of this book would not likely be interested in reading Mark Philp's seven-volume edition of the \\"Political and Philosophical Writings of William Godwin,\\" and might feel genuinely miffed that reviews like these make up the majority of the book. To make matters worse, the words \\"book review\\" are mentioned nowhere on the inside flaps or back cover of the book.But there are a couple of pieces that save this book from being completely uninteresting to the average reader. The first piece, \\"Education and Experience,\\" is a convincing if somewhat truncated argument asserting that Wordsworth's poetry tried to bridge the gap between the educated gentry and the common man, elevating pure experience as the true metric of education. Thompson argues that education prior to the 1790s was practically synonymous with social control, and that a so-called classroom of experience could be liberating. Of course we recognize this viewpoint now as one of the cynosures of Romantic thought, but it was radically new in the last decade of the eighteenth century.In the second piece, \\"Disenchantment or Default?,\\" Thompson discusses the role of what he calls disenchantment (being critical of former positions, politics, and opinions generally) versus apostasy (the total and utter disavowal of said positions). He says that disenchantment can enhance poetry, while the completeness of apostasy ruins it, often turning the poet into a cynic, which is what I take it to mean when he says, \\"There is a tension between a boundless aspiration - for liberty, reason, egalite, perfectibility - and a peculiarly harsh and unregenerate reality. So long as that tension persists, the creative impulse can be felt. But once the tension slackens, the creative impulse fails also.\\" Thompson insinuates that this might have happened to Wordsworth, and that it certainly happened to Coleridge. The title of the last piece, \\"Hunting the Jacobin Fox,\\" refers to the political radical John Thelwall and his relationships with Wordsworth and Coleridge, and their subsequent repudiation of his political positions.During the years leading up to his death, Thompson was passionately involved in worldwide nuclear disarmament. I suppose some of us think that the eradication of atomic weapons is more important than 1790s England. While I too share this sentiment, I secretly found myself wishing that he would have used the down time between delivering polemics against Reagan's Star Wars program to sketch some crib notes on our beloved Lake Poets."},{"Title":"Construction guides for exposed wood decks (Agriculture handbook / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"This provides a good overview of deck construction albeit for the period it was written (1971).

In general, this is a fine reference text for 1970s era deck construction and for that reason I would recommend it. However, I am not sure if a deck built to print using this handbook would be safe by today's standards. The chapter on finish systems may be a little outdated and more recent guide to finish systems should be consulted (or go to you local hardware store). In addition, the baluster spacing and deck rail design probably would not meet the required building code in your area so check your local requirements.

This near hysterical feeling of patriotism, and maybe even hubris, is symbolized in Old Glory, our nation's flag- the fifty Stars and Stripes.I can see no other author doing the appropriate justice to the history of America's Flag, or breaking down its myths, the way Dr. Henry Moeller does with \\"Unfurling. . . .\\" For instance, we are all taught the myth (and yes, it is a myth) regarding Betsy Ross' alleged incarnation of the design of the American Flag. Moeller attacks this falsehood with exuberance, and has done the appropriate research to warrant such an attack. His gift of knowledge far exceeds the American Flag alone, and he is able to delve into this breadth of knowledge to present for the reader a thoroughly complete and enjoyable Narrative.-Sean Geist"},{"Title":"The Gaze of Love: Meditations on Art and Spiritual Transformation","review":"Sister Wendy helps us to use our eyes to find our way to God by looking at art - mostly modern. Her responses are always original and perceptive. For instance, she looks at a painting done in 1983 by Shanti Panchal. It is of a dark-skinned man, brooding in a sombre way, wrapped up defensively in a huge blanket, sitting on a sofa. She sees it as a statement about human dignity and privacy. She says:&quot; (This man) is a dark enigma. He is exposed to our view externally full in the front of the painting, darkly brooding in his purple shawl, ... No-one can take his privacy from him, no swathing can impair the interior freedom that makes him a man. ... Panchal shows us something of human dignity, its independence of anything but God. ... We may always feel straitjacketed by our personality ... hemmmed in by our environment or heredity, imprisoned by our past weaknesses and sins. How we feel is unimportant. God is a God of soaring freedom but He can only lift into His peace a heart that allows itself to be still before Him, and trust, to be afraid and helpless and yet at peace, because what is deepest within us knows that His Presence is Salvation.&quot;That is essential Sister Wendy. Every word is chosen with crystal precision to glance the light at us in just the right way. And she always points through the painting and past her own perceptions to God who is waiting to meet us in prayer. Dip into Sister Wendy's book so that you can dip into the well of Living Water within yourself. You will never be sorry that you did."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"&quot;I Malavoglia&quot; is one of the most beautiful novels about the life in South-Italy in 19th century. I personally am grown up on the countryside in South-Italy and, even if I live a century later than the Malavoglia, I still can find in the place where I live some of the colours and sounds that I love in this book. Someone may find the style disturbing, because of the lack of participation by the writer, but it is something Verga purposedly tried to achieve ( it is the Realism ), and it should not prevent you from enjoying the story told in this book ( even if it is a sad story, like are all the stories, that try to be truthfull). If you really want to get nearer to the heart of such a beautiful country like Italy ( and especially South-Italy)is you really should read this book."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"How many times have you heard a story recounted, not gotten as excited about it as the teller, and had them say &quot;You had to be there.&quot;Verga's novel was a classic in it's day. It's stark portrayal of life in the small fishing town of Aci Trezza at the turn of the century is considered to be groundbreaking Italian fiction. The translation and Verga's own pacing may not appeal to the average modern reader. When it was written, it was in the vanguard of neo-realist fiction. It is laudable for that fact alone. But it has a deeper hidden treasure that can be spirited out to a select few.If you're one who has actually been to southern Italy or Sicily and witnessed small fishing villages on the beautiful coasts, this book is for you. I lived in the small town of Aci Trezza where this book transpired and can honestly say the sights, sounds, people, and rituals are still intact as they're described in the book. If you have been there, this book will rekindle memories of places and sights you've seen before, though now personified. If you have not but plan to, either read this book before you go or take it with you and read it while eating a briosche from Eden Bar in Aci Trezza. The walk down to the rocks off the coast that night will have a different and more beautiful meaning.You had to be there!"},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"This novel was written in 1889 and set in 1863 in a Sicilian fishing village within walking distance of Verga's native Catania. My paternal great-grandparents spent their lives in a similar village on the northern coast of Sicily. Reading this novel brought back my Grandmother's voice telling stories of the fishermen with variations on the proverbs, superstitions, Catholicism and village gossip of Verga. In Verga's novel, ownership of the house is lost through payment of a debt to preserve the Malavoglia's family honor. In my family, the two fishing boats were sold to protect the family honor from a false accusation. In the Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel, Verga is written about extensively in a chapter about realism. This book is a delightful validation of social history in post-unification Sicily. These peasants were hard-workers whose family and religion gave meaning to their lives."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"If you wondered what life was like in Southern Italybefore our relatives all decided to leave, read this book.In a non-maudlin manner, the author describes life in this little town, social mores and attitudes from a long ago time.Well translated, easy to read. Very touching book. An interesting study in family dynamics and the life of a small community."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"This is catalogued as the most representative work of Italian \\"verismo\\", the reflection of Zola's and others' French Naturalism, that is, an extreme form of Realism, depicting hard facts with no concessions to sentimentalism or a wish for a happy ending. It tells the story of three generations in a family of fishermen in a miserable Sicilian vilage. Their family name \\"Malavoglia\\" means the \\"ones with bad blood\\", and it shows. Constantly facing bad fortune, with some brief periods of respite, the Malavoglias suffer sudden and steep descents within their society's narrow bounds of status. Blow after blow, they fall further down in their neighbors' estimation. One character to highlight is the patriarch, an emblem of the dynasty, who keeps his family united after each adversity, deseperately trying to retain some sort of dignity and pride. However, after each blow they sink more and more into debt, discredit, and heartbreak. The hardest setback is the loss of the family house, the one by the meddlar tree, after a bad business deal. Decadence becomes inevitable then.This novel is the crude portrait of a miserable and unmerciful world. It denies the claim that, among poor people, there is more solidarity and humaneness than among the better-off. The cast of characters is exhaustive: every social role (in a very small, simple community) is portrayed and plays a part, revealing the meannes and cheapness of it. Certainly noy a beach-read nor an uplifiting one, it is however a good book that manages to handle some poetry within the bounds of a depressing situation."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"A tale of the decline, fall, and at last, rebirth of the unlucky Malavoglia family in a small Sicilian hamlet by the sea, Verga's novel of Sicilian village life in the 1860s and \`70s is told with considerable warmth, some humor, and a fistful of proverbs. No individual is the focus and psychological depth is completely lacking. Rather, we read about a number of villagers---relatives, suitors, neighbors, town characters---and the story itself dominates. Though I've visited Sicily, I can't claim any real knowledge of the place. After reading Verga's novel, I felt I'd re-visited the island, seen behind the tourist facade and gotten a historical picture. I don't think we can say Verga ranks as one of Italy's or the world's great novelists because we never get inside anyone's head, nor is there much philosophical outlook. But, on the other hand, the story is interesting, with many twists of Fate. It is very realistic, if not deep. The inhabitants of Aci Trezza fill the pages with romances, intrigues, dark deeds, life and death, but because the author refers to them interchangeably by name, nickname, profession (\`the barber'), or family title (\`aunt, son, daughter, cousin'), it took me a long time to sort out who was who. The house by the medlar tree of the title is the Malavoglia's home, which stands for stability, tradition, and comfort---owning a house gave place and status to the family. Moving away from it was fraught with disaster, and the disaster was the loss of that stability and comfort. What happened to the family, and whether they ultimately repossess the house by the medlar tree is what you will find out if you read the novel. I can't say it is the best novel I've ever read, but as a picture of village life Sicily in the 19th century, it's probably hard to beat, picturesque and full of detail. If you read the book in conjunction with Danilo Dolci's \\"Sicilian Lives\\", di Lampedusa's \\"The Leopard\\" and Charlotte Gower Chapman's \\"Milocca\\", I think you would have a very rich picture of Sicilian life."},{"Title":"The house by the medlar tree (A Signet classic)","review":"The book is about a family's misfortunes in a small fishermen's village in Sicily at the beginning of the XX century. The book opens with a tragedy that undermines the financial stability of this big family of poor people. It is about their struggle to cope with it, and their failure because of misfortune. The original title &quot;I malavolgia&quot; could be translated as &quot;the indolent family&quot;; the title is a pun because the family is not indolent at all (well, maybe except for one component), rather they work very hard to solve pay their debts, but when destiny is against you there is nothing to do. In the end the last member of the family manages to regain possession of the house they lost because of their debt, but their social and economic condition is definitely lowered. Because the family tried to ameliorate (although only a little bit) their economic condition, they are punished by fate that makes them struggle to regain less of what they had before. This moral of the story and the feeling of sorrow that pervades the book are the reasons why I did not like it and I give it only two stars. But the book received much praise as one of the highest examples of Italian realism."},{"Title":"Manufacturing Knowledge: A History of the Hawthorne Experiments (Studies in Economic History and Policy: USA in the Twentieth Century)","review":"Gillespie's _Manufacturing Knowledge_ illuminates an important chapter in the history of early 20th-century theory-driven empirical social science. This concerns the Hawthorne experiments of the 1920s and 1930s. They influenced industrial psychology, sociology and political science. Except for those already converted to the extreme version of Gillespie's central claim (he waffles), the author's style may drive away some readers unwilling to make the effort to read the book. _Manufacturing Knowledge_ neatly and valuably reveals the public relations involved in convincing academics and corporate leaders of a single interpretation of the Hawthorne experiments. That achievement and Gillespie's exposure of political power in the research networks underlying earlier and later Hawthorne experiments nicely show how corporate and academic biases affected the research of the Hawthorne researchers.Gillespie's tediousness in repeatedly claiming that all knowledge is imposed makes some chapters very dry reading. (Indeed, he seems unaware of his apparent ambivalence, backing off the extreme version of his claim more than once.) Although chronology is important in his narrative, Gillespie will sometimes leave the reader unsure about the point in time to which his examples and claims refer. And more than once, Gillespie leaves crucial findings from his extensive archival research half-digested. That's unfortunate.Gillespie assumes a lot: The more familiar one is with U.S. social history during 1900-1940, the more one will benefit from this unevenly written book. References to Japanese workplaces have potential but come across as an afterthought - attached but not deeply integrated into the rest of the book. More than one reading will be necessary. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Manufacturing Knowledge: A History of the Hawthorne Experiments (Studies in Economic History and Policy: USA in the Twentieth Century)","review":"The historical look at the Hawthorne Experiment is especially important to me as a relative of one of its participants.

No words to describe the feelings and emotions I had reading this book"},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"While Shakespeare was producing much of his work hundreds of years ago, he belongs to the Early Modern era of the English Language. This particular period started approximately 60 years before he was born.Many of the comments seem to think that the stilted grammar and flow (that only occur to current speakers of the language)determine whether a work is written in Old English. Some have mentioned Beowulf, which very few have likely read untranslated. If you can't understand a translated work, blame the person who authored IT and not the original work.Old English approximates a German sound. If one were to hear something read in OE, they may guess the language was an older form of German. Middle English, the sort you'll come across reading UNTRANSLATED Chaucer, is much closer to what many would recognize as an English sounding language. It was highly ornate and approximated and Irish sound.Early Modern English is basically what we are provided with when encountering Shakespeare. The language isn't as difficult to navigate as the references, especially in Shakespeare, which are historical as well as contemporary.When considering the importance of Shakespeare or works that came before him, it is useful to consider the endeavor as trying to find one's cultural heritage. Many of today's popular literature is founded, deeply, in what has come before us. Irreverance and often the backdrops surrounding our most beloved characters have references much older than many can imagine. Even Harry Potter closely resembles elements of Beowulf, Chaucer, and Shakespeare to name the 3 of the more recognizeable.Literature that has come before our time does tend to get treated with a little too much reverance, but the reasons people consider these classics to be important can't be denied.This volume, lacking footnotes and perverting line structure, is still nifty in it's economical purpose, and is worth owning if you can make use of it.LL."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"What can I say about the Bard that hasn't already been said?

Well, the Modern Library edition of the Royal Shakespeare Company's Shakespeare has a lot to recommend it. The text is beautifully set in single column format, making it easier for actors and those who wish to read the text aloud to scan the poetic lines and to distinguish between poetry and prose. Jonathan Bates's General Introduction is comprehensive, engaging, and lively. As with the introductions to the individual plays, Bates gives special attention to the performance traditions from which these plays emerged as well as those which would shape their interpretation over the centuries. This concern for performance issues is also addressed in the \\"Key Facts\\" boxes that follow every play introduction. Here the editors summarize the plot, identify the major parts (with percentage of lines and number of speeches assigned to each character, etc.), take a stab at identifying a dates of composition and first performance, and discuss the plays' sources and state of the texts available. There are ample, but not an overwhelming number of footnotes. And these notes, Bates assures us, do not shy away from discussion of Shakespeare's bawdier puns (something that may not be true of your old college textbook). Another real plus is the inclusion of a fragmentary scene from \\"Sir Thomas More\\" based on the only manuscript known to be in Shakespeare's own hand.But the best reason to buy the RSC Shakespeare is because the editors have gone to great lengths to preserve the First Folio (1623) edition of Shakespeare. They have modernized the spelling and punctuation and have read (and corrected) the text against Quarto texts where these exist, but have not recklessly blended Quarto and Folio texts, something most previous editors have done with impunity for generations. The editors make a strong case for the Folio texts being the best versions available and respecting their \\"purity\\" makes it possible for readers and those preparing new stagings to grapple with textual variants in a thoughtful and respectful manner. It seems that Shakespearean textual critical work is finally taking on the discipline of biblical criticism. Let's hope the results will be equally illuminating and revolutionary."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"The idea behind this edition is brilliantly simple: produce a modern edition of the First Folio. The editors do not attempt to produce a \\"definitive\\" text of Shakespeare. Their goal is more modest: to reconstruct, as closely as possible, the material that Heminges and Condell brought into the printing house in 1623. It is, they say, a snapshot of the playtexts at one stage in their evolution.The various quarto and octavo editions are used to correct the Folio text (where that is obviously corrupt) but not to supplement it. Passages excised from the Folio are printed here in appendices and textual notes. Plays that didn't appear in the Folio appear in a different format in the back. (So too with the poems and sonnets.) If passages vary in wording between the early editions, the Folio receives precedence, as long as it makes sense.The notes are also quite extensive about vocabulary and are franker than usual about sexual matters. The notes about historical events are not as extensive as those in the Riverside, but the chronologies, introductions, and other supplementary materials do provide the basic background. The introductions, by Jonathan Bate, are concise and steer a middle course between dramatic / thematic issues on one hand and developmental / textual issues on the other.Like the Norton Shakespeare, the plays are here printed in single-column format, which greatly aids readability. Unlike the Norton, which prints the plays in approximate chronological order, the plays are printed here in the order they appeared in the First Folio.

Attractive cover hides printed pages that appear to be facsimiles of archaic, crammed-type pages from some bygone era.Perhaps you think, 'Well, at least it's a cheap way to get a copy of the complete plays.' A few months of reading modern, respectable editions (e.g., from Routledge/Arden, Cambridge, or Oxford) for any popular Shakespeare play will help a newcomer realize that for almost all Shakespeare plays determining what is 'the text' is a vast conundrum; nay: an oxymoron. As with many aspects of Shakespeare study, 'tis not so easy: for most plays there are multiple alternative *original sources* - differing in important ways from each other. What sources did the editor of the Gramercy edition use? Well, if the publisher does not deem it necessary even to credit the editor's name in this volume or to acknowledge how outdated the editorial work is...A better use of your money is to buy a modern edition of single plays.

(A used copy of a Bevington edition from the 1980s is worth a truckload of these 1900ish Gramercy printings.)I regret spending even these few minutes to review the most INadequate version of Shakespeare available, but am aggravated to it by the high Amazon sales ranking for this edition - which suggests that thousands of unsuspecting buyers are throwing money away. Worse yet, once they have their copies they will be discouraged from exploring the grandeur of the plays because of this archaic, alienating, barren reprint.

They have a point, but I still disagree with their criticism. The edition's lack of these materials does not render it useless. On the contrary. I own several Shakespeare editions (among them Bevington, Riverside, and most of the Ardens), and I have used them to study the works in depth. For me, this edition fills a real need: direct, unmediated access to the text analogous to hearing it read out loud. Having the Bard's complete output in one physically manageable volume (the Riverside is much too big - try putting it in your briefcase to read on the train!) unencumbered by any extraneous writing such as footnotes allows me to focus completely on the text and avoid getting distracted by the footnotes. Reading Shakespeare from this book has really changed my perspective on many of the plays because I can enjoy the uninterrupted flow of the narrative, similar to a reading out loud. One might object that I could simply skip the footnotes of the other editions. But it's not that simple. By their very presence, footnotes have, in my view at least, something disempowering. It's not me encountering the text; rather, it's me respectfully approaching something of which I'm not quite worthy. That's a fine attitude, and I'm all for it when you get to know the plays. But having dug through them, I find it a wonderful experience to encounter the \\"pure\\" text (I know that's ultimately an illusion) and enjoy it without someone trying to teach at the same time. If there's a textual crux or a term I can't understand or some historical background I want to brush up on, I can always look it up in one of my annotated editions. This edition, by its very simplicity, has really rekindled my enthusiasm for Shakespeare. Last but not least, having all of Shakespeare's texts in one small volume allows me to flip quickly to another play to look something up or spot cross-connections. That can be very interesting. In short, this admittedly simple and perhaps not completely reliable edition has truly enriched my reading of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"To would-be purchasers: At the library or bookstore, see for yourself if you can really deal with all the physical drawbacks of this book, if it will really meet the demands of how you read and for what you intend to use this book. It should hold up okay for occassionaly pulling off the shelf for a point of reference. But if you need to handle it often, if you really want to get into the text, then I don't see how this book can hold up.The 1 star is for the publisher of this edition. My complaint is to the person (or persons) who gave the go-ahead for the production specs. They are unworthy of the words of Shakespeare and the work of the editors. The production and printing are truly paltry. All the other review negatives are legit -- cumbersome size and weight; toilet paper thin paper, subject to easy tearing; ink bleeding through recto/verso pages (and in my copy, there's an ink splatter on p. 1438 and several splotches throughout); as well as the binding, which is a non-signature fake sewn binding, glued together like a softcover. As such, this book cannot endure much handling, and over time, as we know with such books, no matter how careful we are, the glue will stale, the spine will crack, and pages will dislodge like rotten teeth. This is absolutely not an edition you can hand down the generations; and depending on your use, it may or may not last even a few years. This edition purports to be a study/working edition, but the book as a physical object precludes any of that. I can't imagine a student or actor lugging it to class or the theatre and trying to recite with a nearly 5-lb 3-inch thick book cradled in his/her arm. Let alone making notes in the generous margins -- the low-grade paper causes text on each side of a page to seep through often clearly enough to be read so that would make scribbling notes difficult; and this paper could not possibly properly absorb notes in pen or highlighter (either would mark and indent right though the other side; light pencil or post-its might work though).After purusing a few essays and notes, I give the editors 3 stars so far. The scholarship may be serious and exemplary (per other reviewers), but I've read better insights and more extensive notes elsewhere (with etymology, cross-refs, annotations). Here, the footnotes are rudimentary (for example, \\"fearful\\" is \\"frightened\\", \\"false\\" is \\"dishonest, disloyal\\", \\"maim\\" means to \\"wound, damage\\") -- perhaps the target audience starts at age 8. Stage directions of sorts are added here and there; they seem to clarify what's already rather obvious in the text proper. The \\"Key Facts\\" are easily digestible, but I can only trust that the editors got all their facts and dates correct, as I have yet to come across any sourcing or even a ref list.But the main thing is that I simply can't get around the physical inadequacies of this book, so I'm returning my copy for a refund. Instead, I'll check out my public library's copy because I still want to know what all the introductory essays have to say.I have all the works in various single-volume Quatro-based editions, so I thought it would be interesting to have a volume with the Folio-based text intact. Hopefully, the publisher will come to its senses and re-issue this edition based on previous Modern Library editions, that is, dividing the works into 3 or 4 volumes at a paper size and quality that can be used by human hands and read with human eyes -- even at a higher price, that I would purchase and keep. By the way, I own the two-volume 1938 \\"Complete Greek Drama\\" (also published by Random House). Those 70-year-old used books have held up far better than this 2007 new complete Shakespeare ever will. Perhaps this Shakespeare edition is a prime indication of the state of the book publishing industry today -- the bottom line served Will ill."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"The very idea of reviewing or giving stars to Shakespeare in this format is superfluous: he is the epitome of English literature. The source and inspiration for many subsequent classics, the well from which many popular expressions have sprung, the basis for many brilliant (and not-so-brilliant) stage and film renditions of these classics -- Shakespeare's literary greatness lies universally ackwnoledged and unquestioned. In reviewing any edition of the man's works, then, the reviewer's task is not to comment upon the work itself, but the presentation. This Gramercy edition of The Complete Works (yes, that's all 37 plays -- comedies, histories, and tragedies -- as well as all of the poems, sonnets included) is the most popular and widely-available -- and inexpensive -- version available. Is it the best? Well, no. Other reviews of this edition have commented upon its shortcomings -- extremely small print; very tight and hard-to-read layout; no margins for notes; no footnotes or annotations; no background information on the plays; errors, typos, and generally questionable editing. That said, this edition may have what you're looking for. It does indeed contain the complete works; it also has a few other small incentives: a hard cover that looks great on a bookshelf, a built-in bookmarker, and various illustrations. Clearly, this is not an omnibus for the Shakespeare scholar. If you want an edition of the bard for in-depth study or for academic use, you are better off buying more expansive editions of the individual plays themselves, with plenty of background info, notes, annotations, and space for your own writing; or else one of the more expensive editions of the Complete Works. That said, if you are just looking for a Shakespeare book that has all of his works in one place, that is convenient and, above all, inexpensive -- or you just want a Shakespeare tome sitting on your dust-ridden bookshelf to impress friends -- then you could do worse than picking up this."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"I am a professional actor and teacher of Shakespeare. This is a vastly inferior edition of Shakespeare's complete works. There is no room in the margins for making notes. There are no footnotes to aid the reader with antiquated language and references. The binding is insubstantial and the gilding sticks to other pages. I picked this book up at a bookstore once and thought I would enjoy such a pretty and portable copy of Shakespeare's works. As soon as I opened my copy of the book, I immediately returned the book to the bookstore. I found misspellings and errors and the type was so tight, I found the text difficult to read. Try to save your money for the Riverside Shakespeare (a book you and your family will enjoy for years, mine is 25 years old) and use the Folger if you need to by one play at at time, but go to the library for your Shakespeare before wasting your money on this piece of junk. The notes are helpful and aid in the enjoyment of the text. Avoid this book!"},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"I'm going to be the naysayer among reviewers of this book. While the edition is interesting, and the concept of only using the First Folio is certainly something to be applauded, the publishers have opted for perhaps the poorest readability of any complete edition. (Ok, there must be worse, among the really cheap ones...)First, the paper is too thin, meaning that you read one page while seeing the outlines of the text on the other side. The text is printed in a single column, which is good for the parts in verse, but prose sections then have very long lines, which hinders readability. Finally, the footnotes are small and hard to read. Also, while some editions have numbers on lines that have notes, this one doesn't, so you really have to check all the time to see if there are notes. Perhaps real Bardologists don't need the notes that clarify word meanings, but I'm not at that stage yet.On the plus side, each play has a useful, though brief, introduction, with a \\"key facts\\" box, containing a plot summary, roles, dates, and more.I find it surprising that publishers have to skimp on paper to force these editions into single volumes. Better paper would mean two volumes, and perhaps a higher price point, but they would be so much more readable (not only for the paper, but for each volume having fewer pages). In fact, why not three volumes: comedies, histories and tragedies?I find that the Pelican edition is far more readable. Naturally, most purchasers of this edition are interested in the comparison between First Folio texts and other texts, so they'll probably buy this anyway. If this does become prescribed in courses, I feel bad for the students who will find this paper shoddy and prone to tears. The book deserves 5 stars for content, but much less for its bookness."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"I originally bought this book used and later discovered that this was the ideal situation. It is handy to have all of Shakespeare's works (plays and sonnets) under one cover, but there are several drawbacks. Each page is split into two columns, causing the plays to be read like a newspaper. Since linebreaks are important in Shakespeare (remember the iambic pentameter), some lines are too long for the margins, causing the remaining words to hover like ghosts away from the sentence.Also, this book contains no footnotes. This is mainly how buying the individual play is superior to the collected works. Olde English isn't always intuitive, and this particular book leaves you to find out a word's meaning for yourself.But this book certainly looks pretty on your shelf. :)"},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"There are, obviously, pros and cons to buying any book. This edition of the complete works of Shakespeare is no different. Of course, Shakespeare is great no matter what the binding of the book looks like, but I would really hesitate to purchase a single book containing the complete works, if you're buying for everyday reading. I find that such large volumes are awkward, hard to hold and really thick. My personal collection of Shakespeare's works consists of single-work paperback volumes, not lovely to look at, but functional. Someday I hope to buy a set of the complete works in hardcover, but when I do, I'll look for a set, not a single book. However, if you're looking for the complete works in a compact package, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"I say it's good and not great because in this particular volume the print is rather small and the plays are arranged in the &#34;traditional&#34; sequence (&#34;traditional&#34; = the sequence found in most editions of Shakespeare) rather than chronologically which is what I personally prefer.

So I can read it on my laptop, on the plane? While eating dinner, so to avoid yet another banal sex-shoot-'em movie or video?I love every feature about this book. Clear introductions, clear footnotes, nice bolded text glosses for the words in question at the bottom of each page, doesn't interrupt the reading, SINGLE COLUMN FORMAT for the play's lines, great analyses and introductions, executive summaries, the works. The handy posting of line counts is wonderful. In short, this edition is quite useful. Very readable typeface.Above all, it aims at FIRST FOLIO LOYALTY. Your favorite gramma's letters: you wanna read what a third party THOUGHT she said? Or what she actually said? Ya wanna hear Jesus talk, as if you were THERE with Him back then? Or, someone's alleged MEMORY of what He said? Bible's claim to fame is that GOD caused the writers to exactly reproduce conversations, events; that their communication is DIRECTLY from Him, no go-betweens. Straight from the horse's mouth. No 'spin'. Oh, and Translations? FORGET IT. Now you got 'spin'. Don't want my Bible or my Shakespeare 'spun'. This Modern Library edition has that same goal. Back to the original.Is it perfect? No, of course not. Others complain about the thin paper (can see but not read the print on other side, kinda like a palimpsest). Best to get colored pencils for highlighting, use a superfine ballpoint pen like Zebra F-301 BP. Write lightly, and the ink won't bleed through.Really happy with this purchase from Amazon.

And \\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"The way that long lines end is a little confusing at first, and makes reading with a group somewhat awkward, but for the price this is a great book."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"Shakespeare has irrefutably influenced contemporary American literature with his preponderant literary skill and ingenious flare for words and characters. Shakespeare had a great ability to connect with the common layman and the aristocrat with his use of the vernacular and colloquial phrases that were considered in vogue at the time. His scope for comedy and comic relief is still evident even today-- the audience still gets the joke and still understands the situation and emotional content of the characters and the events in their lives!Shakespeare still has an impressive appeal on the modern actor and playwright because he was made famous by the very same kings and queens of England that translated the King James Bible and proliferated the propagation of the English language throughout the world.Shakespeare's enduring legacy is his invention of the English language upon the stage and in print that far out reaches even the Elizabethan era in which he was made both famous and infamous.What many people don't realize about Shakespeare is that his way of speaking was considered modern and innovative at the time of his popularity.

Yecch. Now, Top Gun, that's something worth seeing!,\\" I thought I would post these comments as their own review. Just writing these comments has rekindled my enthusiasm for the great Bard, not that it needed rekindling.By the way, I think this edition, as several have pointed out, has a real place on the bookshelf of the Shakespeare lover. One way I enjoy reading Shakespeare is while following along with a recording, of which fortunately there have been many good ones, going back at least as far as the wonderful Argo series back in the 1950s and 1960s, and completed in time for the 400th anniversary of the Bard's birth in 1964. When following with an annotated edition, I am way too tempted to keep checking the notes. When following with this or another bare-bones text, the temptation is automatically gone.Now, on to my comment:I deleted my original comments some time ago, having realized that I couldn't respond to Jmark's lengthy remarks about Shakespeare in just a few pithy words, and so I only ended up misrepresenting myself and Shakespeare (not that he needs me to defend him). I resolved to make a lengthier, more reasoned, and less personal response to Jmark's diatribe at a future date.Having re-read Jmark's review and his responses to my remarks, and deduced what I must have originally said in the comments I deleted, I still am of the opinion that his arguments don't hold water. His essential argument is that \\"I don't like Shakespeare and therefore he deserves to be relegated to the trash heap.\\" Certainly Jmark is entitled not to like Shakespeare, just as I am entitled not to like Michael Jackson; it's the \\"therefore\\" part that makes no sense. To answer his assertions one by one:1) If Shakespeare were not a vital author, nobody past the age of being influenced by the educational system would pay any attention to him. Certainly he would have been forgotten ages ago since the teachers who had been forced to read him when going through the deluded educational system would have rebelled against the idea of teaching such claptrap when they joined that system.2) \\"Silly romances,\\" \\"boring dramas,\\" \\"improbable plots,\\" \\"vulgar jokes\\" are all value judgments and relate back to Jmark's \\"I don't like Shakespeare\\" thesis (well, some of the jokes *are* pretty vulgar). If Jmark finds the romances silly and the dramas boring, he certainly has a right to. I doubt I've ever judged a play, movie, opera, etc. (especially opera) on the probability of its plot. I love Crank also and it's probably fairly improbable, although I don't expect folks to be watching Crank 400 years from now, assuming that civilization hasn't self-destructed by then; as for Crank 2, well once was enough given the level of its violence. I look at how well the story is told; Jmark and I will have to agree to disagree on this one.3) Actually, the \\"nuts\\" do get to have it both ways. On the one hand, Shakespeare does deserve to be approached with a certain degree of reverence, which doesn't take Jmark's comments about \\"no one must dare question\\" out of the realm of hyperbole. And on the other hand, the plays themselves *are* entertaining, enormously so. As two examples, and these from a couple of the lesser-known plays, I offer the scenes in Much Ado About Nothing where Beatrice and Benedict are tricked into believing that the other is in love with her/him or the ending of the Cymbeline where all the plot twists are more or less straightened out to the hilarity of the audience; actually, these are both pretty improbable which doesn't take away from their entertainment value. I have kept to comic scenes here, although Cymbeline is usually classed among the tragedies or more recently among a new genre called the romances. It would be just as easy to find entertaining scenes among the tragedies or the histories, and I'll let each person do that for him- or herself. Actually, the comparison with Crank 2 is not completely off the wall; Titus Andronicus is at least as violent as Crank, but Shakespeare's poetry and the strength of some of the characterizations raise the play way above the level of Crank 2.4) The comparison with Beowulf is patently unfair. When reading Beowulf, one would need to have a glossary of every word in order to make sense of it at all. In Shakespeare, only some words need to be glossed and, with a little experience, one will not need to check all of the glosses because a lot of the phrases and constructions are used over and over again. Likewise, most members of a Shakespeare audience will not have read the play in advance; it doesn't matter because, with a little attention, one can follow the story even without understanding every single word because the inflections of the actors and the stage business make it clear and carry the viewer along. The same could not be said of a performer presenting Beowulf in the original English.5) The \\"intriguing\\" and \\"entertaining\\" arguments are once again personal opinons. However, looking through Jmark's other reviews, I can see that he is mostly into relatively modern stuff. I think we can easily take his opinion about Shakespeare with a grain of salt, given his comments about \\"what was entertaining even twenty years ago\\" and \\"last year's fashions\\"; old = bad, new = good (except when what is new gets to be twenty years old and then it = bad as well).And finally, I would love to see Shakespeare \\"freed from the support of the educational system,\\" just so I could watch him still be considered one of the most vibrant authors (yes, my opinion, just as Jmark believes just the opposite). And I'll leave out Shakespeare's influence on more modern authors.I've probably spent way too much time responding to this post. I will not be doing a follow-up, even if Jmark responds. My intent in responding was to defend my beloved Shakespeare whom I discovered several years before I even reached high school and so my admiration of him has nothing to do with what the academics think."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"This book (even if it isn't the best quality) is absolute genius.

I was eight. Enthralled by Puck's magic, moved by Cymbeline's plight, and frightened by Caliban's perverse nature, I thirsted for the real thing. Wading into the lush depths of the plays themselves a few years later, I grappled with the unfamiliar prose. Guides, in the form of teachers and my drama teacher, parted the veils imposed by the passage of centuries -- and soon I was able to venture forth on my own, discovering the treasures that lay in scene after scene, act after act, play after play. When those strangers became friends, it was time to seek new acquaintances -- and thus did the sonnets enter my life. Page after page there are lessons in human nature. Heroes and villains alike teach us about ourselves and the hurly-burly of life itself. And the more one matures, the more one discovers. Like a fine wine, Shakespeare's works get better with age. Like a potent tonic, they nourish the soul. And like a mirror, they reflect to us the very mystery that lurks beneath our collective existence."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"I know-I have never read this particular edition of Shakespheare. But I got sick of reading &quot;THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER...BORING.&quot;I act Shakespheare. I memorize passages and I savor them. It's boring, huh? Pick it back up-Turn to The Tempest or The Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespheare even had the guts in Midsummer Night's Dream, the last scene, the &quot;Play Scene&quot; to make fun of himself-some say he may have been even making fun of Romeo and Juliet. The story of Pyramous and Thisbee is awfully similar. Read each speech as a poem. Emphasize stress. Read out loud. Why The Tempest? I picked that-not only because it is a great comedy, but to prove the depth of the characters. Calliban is a monster, a possessive evil, and yes drunken wise man. He shows more sense about his schemes than the two drunks, which fit in perfectly, proving Prospero's power.Shakespheare made mistakes in his plays. Some of them are not good, but there are aprox. 40 of them, so try them. Nevertheless, each mistake has a jewel. I don't particularly think Romeo and Juliet matches the wonderful romance of Trolius and Cressida, but I can't help thinking about Mercutio, the wise man who makes up Queen Mab to mock Romeo, or the nurse who loves marriage so much that she becomes a poor advisor to Juliet. Look carefully-and you will love the characters that do sound clear after 400 years. If you don't beleive me, go out and buy the paperback edition of one of his plays or click to it. You can also view them all online. With that all said, The Riverside is great, and the individual Arden's and Oxford's are great. Get one with footnotes.

His tragedies illustrate the paradigm shift from feudalism to capitalism that was occuring in England. Furthermore, his comedies are always fun to read."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"William Shakespeare is the classical master of words on whom our entire foundation of literature is based. The stories of human nature and everyday people within the guise of princes, sailors, tinkers &amp; soldiers,noble and common men and women transcend time and the archaic language the stories are in. There is a message in each story and it seems to be that as humans, we all are more alike that we believe, that we all share a bond that is a soul bound within a mortal shell. William Shakespeare speaks to all of us across time, tells us that we are not alone and that we all share a common thread of existance in this mortal toil."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"A great book, it includes all the famous plays such at Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet, and all of his others.

I am contacting the supplier now."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"A reviewer below states that Shakespeare's literary value is unquestioned. This is patent nonsense. Every year, untold numbers of people (students, etc.) are forced to read him by trained teachers and they still end up questioning his value. Let's examine the Shakespeare cult:1) Any author who needs an interpreter, explainer, or support from the educational system to keep readers is simply not a vital author. If Shakespeare was a vital author, people would love him without the brainwashing and spoonfeeding of a vast educational system that insists on teaching these tired plays year after year because everyone has done so year after year.2) Silly romances and boring dramas driven by improbable plots and vulgar jokes are not great literature. These plays are the work of a man who spent far too much time on scandal and trivial junk to be taken seriously.3) The Shakespeare nuts want it both ways and they can't have it either way. On the one hand, they insist that Shakespeare be regarded with the reverence one would give to holy scripture. No one must dare question its greatness, truthfulness, or entertainment value. If you do so, you will be attacked as a philistine. On the other hand, when people believe this nonsense and stay away from Shakespeare because they do not want to be bored, the cultists insist that we are taking it too seriously and that Shakespeare is simply great theatre (when it is nothing of the sort) which can be enjoyed with as much gusto as a rock concert or a stand up comedy act (which is a lie).4) Any book that needs a glossary for the reader in order to be understandable must either be abandoned as dated or translated into modern English. The Shakespeare nuts wouldn't insist that anyone read Beowulf in Old English or argue that its Old English language is so beautiful that we all must learn what is now a foreign language to us but they do this when it comes to Shakespeare. This is beyond irrational. Imagine being forced to read a viking saga in Old Norse with only a glossary to assist you because the professor happens to love the cadences of Old Norse. This is no different from the nuts who do the same with Shakespeare.5) I judge literature on two, and only two, criterion: Is it intriguing? Is it entertaining? I don't give a fig about some academic telling me I need to read something because it is historically important. I doubt that Shakespeare's audience paid to see his plays because they had historical importance and neither will I. Alas, what was entertaining even twenty years ago seems dated and boring today, nevermind what may have been entertaining hundreds of years ago. Old jokes lose their punch, old romances become foolish and insipid with time, old dramas about historical figures become irrelevant and sleep inducing, old concerns no longer concern us. Shakespeare is dated, unfunny, boring.And no amount of forcing the issue will change that. Free Shakespeare from the support of the educational system and watch him become forgotten as quickly as last years fashions. And I say, \\"good riddance\\" to an author who should have been relegated to the trash heap at least a century ago."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"Guess what!

WHERE ARE FOOTNOTED/ANNOTATED EDITIONS OF SHAKESPEARE FOR THE KINDLE??"},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"To buy an unannotated Shakespeare volume like this, where even the quality of the text is in doubt, is a pure waste of money. Anyone who feels it is good enough to buy an unannotated text should at least make sure to get a good, well-edited one: for example, a second-hand copy of Peter Alexander's edition (the so-called \\"Tudor Edition\\", originally published by Collins in 1951). The text prepared by Alexander remains one of the very best.It really does matter what text one buys, as various editions differ greatly in the quality of what they produce. It is by no means the case that all editions of Shakespeare offer the same text, as one would expect if one bought a work by a modern author. Furthermore, it is impossible to read Shakespeare - even if you are a specialist in Renaissance literature - without plenty of help, none of which is supplied in this edition. A good edition, like that produced by David Bevington, or the Riverside, will contain the following helpful components as a minimum: a comprehensive introduction to Shakespeare and his work generally; reasonably full analytical/interpretative introductions to individual works; lists of further reading (referring the reader to other helpful commentators); and above all - most essentially - useful explanatory notes on words, phrases, and sentences difficult to understand. Of these there are a great many. Anyone who approaches Shakespeare as a modern reader without knowledgde of the language of his period will soon find all sorts of words and grammatical usages that obviously are no longer current. But even more treacherous are those many instances of words that LOOK the same, but MEAN something very different, as a result of the fact that the meaning of words changes over time.For all these reasons, then, readers should spend their money on a value-for-money buy, whether new or second-hand, and not waste it on a worthless volume of this nature. If you don't want to buy a well-annotated one-volume Shakespeare, buy well-annotated editions of individual works - e.g. those belonging to the Arden series, or the Oxford Shakespeare, or the New Cambridge.These reflections are not, of course, criticisms of Shakespeare as an author, but purely of a useless edition like this. ..."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"THE SOUR:The other reviewer who complained about the thin paper was right! I am literally afraid to turn the pages. Think of the flimsiest, cheap-motel toilet paper you've ever encountered. Slice it in half. It's about that thin. And you can, indeed, read what's on the next page right through the text you're scanning.These mega-collections of Shakespeare exist for two reasons -- either for those who want it to look swell on their shelves or for those familiar enough with the plays that they don't need the more utilitarian Arden or Folger editions as tutors. For the latter, we want a useful, all-in-one kit for quick reference. In that case, it should be relatively rugged. I don't want a fragile, expensive book that I'm afraid to open. Given the highly competitive nature of these Shakespeare anthologies, this design flaw really overshadows the merits.THE SWEET:The book comes with a useful introduction to Shakespeare and an exciting section of photos of RSC productions. The photos are so interesting that I'm disappointed that they don't run throughout the book. (Given how flimsy the pages are, they have the room.) Essays introduce each play, and every show receives a \\"Key Facts\\" rundown listing a plot summary, a list of the major parts (with the percentage of their relative line load, number of speeches, and number of scenes), the verse-to-prose ratio, the presumed authorship date, and notes on the sources. The plays themselves have running, footnoted location notes, \\"translations\\" of archaic language, and illuminating stage directions.OVERALL:An interesting addition, but I'll make sure that I have the proper time to handle it delicately before I take it off the shelf. As my quick reference, it probably won't replace the Oxford, Wells/Taylor-edited collection, controvertial though it is."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"In one sense I think almost every person feels a special pleasure in having a complete edition of the world's greatest writer. The special experience of knowing that one can turn whenever one wants to such great works of literature, and explore them again is a very real one.However my long experience with reading has taught me that reading the plays in smaller single - volume more heavily annotated works gives more.I notice for instance that my own ' complete edition' goes largely unread, and that when I need to read Shakespeare I always go to the single- volume works."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"As a translator of Shakespeare's plays, I use every edition I can get my hands, so I was thrilled to see that the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has added a newly edited and glossed collection of all the plays, drawing mostly from the First Folio. As a complete works entry, the RSC version has a lot going for it.True, the paper is thin and a bit too transparent, but this is also true of the recentThe Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition. If that bothers you, choose theThe Riverside Shakespeare, 2nd Edition, which has less transparent paper. But recognize that the Riverside is about 500 pages shorter and crams the text into two columns, with character names abbreviated and no room for your notes. It tires my eyes quickly. The RSC is very comfortably laid out with lots of white space and a nice font of school-book clarity. The bold-faced sans-serif font for the characters stands out clearly from the serif font for the lines. The extra stage directions help comprehension, and their location in the right margin rather than in brackets in the text removes clutter.I also enjoyed immensely the General Introduction by Jonathan Bate. Usually, I find myself daydreaming and wanting to skip ahead through these formalities, but I could not put this one down and wished that it were longer. I particularly enjoyed his efficient rebuttal to the Oxfordian authorship claims. In the blogosphere, Oxfordians have convinced each other that Shakespeare was no more than an illiterate grain dealer, but Bates expertly displays why almost all scholars accept Shakespeare as the author. The blogosphere should take note.The text itself offers a generous number of glosses. I hold that the more help modern readers get the better. So I did a spot check of how many words or phrases were glossed in a famously difficult passage from King Lear (often left out in performances because of its difficulty). Here is the passage:KENT.Sir, I do know you,And dare, upon the warrant of my note,Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,Although as yet the face of it be coveredWith mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;Who have--as who have not, that their great starsThrone and set high--servants, who seem no less,Which are to France the spies and speculationsIntelligent of our state. What hath been seen,Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes;Or the hard rein which both of them have borneAgainst the old kind king; or something deeper,Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings...The RSC offered 12 glosses while the Norton and Riverside both offered 9. And thankfully, the gloss uses both a line number and a bold-faced repetition of the word or phrase in question to make it easier to reestablish your place in the text.All in all, the RSC is a friendly, helpful edition. Naturally, at nearly 2500 pages it is difficult to hold in your lap, and the flimsy pages mean durability problems. So for intense study of one play, opt for one of the many paperback versions of individual plays. But as a single source for someone with a spontaneous urge to read a play, the RSC edition fits the bill."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"For anyone who wishes to work with Shakespeare's plays (actors, directors, students), this is the edition to own. The single column format makes it extremely easy to read. It also means there is no wrapping of iambic lines like in many two column editions.Annotations are plentiful and more verbose than most. The generous whitespace means plenty of room to add your own notes as well. I have been shopping for an updated text to replace my old Complete Works and found this version to be a joy.The thin paper is a downside, but necessary to maintain some usability in a book this size. It is, however, surprisingly durable."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"To the person who said Shakespeare is over-rated, I don't think the person knows how to read it while understanding his work.

The first class I took with him, we used the Bantam paperback editions of the plays (this book was in press at that time). The second semester, after a long wait, I finally got to compare the Bantam editions with the RSC edition. Though the Bantam Shakepeare, edited by David Bevington and David Kastan, is excellent in its own right as student-friendly version with lots of helpful notes, I found the RSC Shakespeare to be the superior choice. I first agree with the editorial decision to use the First Folio text as the basis. The First Folio was produced by the actors who worked with the Bard himself. The scripts were meant to be a blueprint for what happens on the stage. So those who argue that the Quarto texts with more lines are the authoritative versions need to let go of the notion that more is better. With ample notes and insightful introductions, RSC Shakespeare serves its purpose well by providing the readers a context for Elizabethan theatre life. I would whole-heartedly agree with those who are not satisfied with the paper quality - it sucks. This book is not meant for abusive use - highlighting, underlining, dog-earing, etc. - it is far too expensive for that. For heavy use in classrooms as text, I would recommend to go with Arden or Bantam editions. They are easier on the wallet, and kinder to the faint of heart who cannot dare to put a highlighter to such delicate pages. But if you want some serious scholarship and quality you can count on, do invest in RSC Complete Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Complete Works of William Shakespeare","review":"Brian Kendig's previous review says it all, but I wanted to add a caveat to a still-potential buyer: the text is so incredibly condensed that the endings of some of the longer lines are scrunched up in awkward brackets in the white space above, making for a disjointed reading of an already unapproachable edition.

With a very impressive output (37 plays, 4 poems and 154 sonnets, all of them beautifully written), he has rightly been called \\"Not of an age, but for all time.\\" This, coming from a rival poet (Ben Jonson) is high praise indeed. The plays, poems and sonnets are very difficult to review individually, as they are well written. Shakespeare brilliantly captured the essence of human behaviour in his works. Of course, Shakespeare is not for everyone. Regarding film versions of his plays, I strongly recommend Sir Laurence Olivier's three self-directed Shakespeare films (\\"Henry V,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Richard III\\"), Kenneth Branagh's growing output of Shakespeare (\\"Henry V,\\" \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Love's Labour's Lost\\") and faithful stage versions of Shakespeare (The Merchant Of Venice [an out-of-print film starring Laurence Olivier and directed by Jonathan Miller], \\"King Lear\\" [starring Laurence Olivier and filmed as a movie in 1984], \\"Othello\\" [starring Laurence Olivier and filmed as a movie in 1965]). I also recommend Oliver Parker's 1995 version of\\"Othello,\\" starring Kenneth Branagh as the villainous Iago and Franco Zefferelli's 1968 version of \\"Romeo & Juliet,\\" as well as West Side Story,\\" a classic musical featuring music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim (in his debut; he would eventually write \\"Sweeny Todd\\") and masterful choreography by Jerome Robbins (he choreographed the dance sequences in \\"The King & I,\\" \\"Fiddler On The Roof\\") which uses the tragic storyline of the play in a modern setting without the dialogue (unlike that idiot Luhrman, who had the c----es to COMPLETELY MODERNIZE the play; \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"Love's Labour's Lost\\" is as far as you can get to modernizing Shakespeare, the God of playwrights).His plays, poems and sonnets are rated PG for some violence (\\"Titus Andronicus,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet\\") and mild vulgarity (sexual references gracefully obscured in Elizabethan English; \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Othello,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" \\"Venus & Adonis,\\" \\"The Rape Of Lucrece,\\" etc; though the language of his time was bawdy, Shakespeare DID NOT condone sexual licence). Profanity was also non-existent at the time. He used the words (\\"Damn,\\" \\"Hell,\\" \\"A--,\\" and \\"B----\\" [once; in \\"King Lear\\"]) in their original definitions. Hell, as a place of torment, damn as in eternal banishment from God, a-- as in the animal also called a donkey and b---- as a female dog.

Although the elapsed time, his influence and absolute domain of the drama, his delirious visions about the greed, ambition, and power 's thirst seem to revive the glorious splendor of the unbeatable Greek tragedy.There has not been any other writer who had retaken with such vigor, intensity and unrestrained realism the core of the tragic spirit. As the great visionaries, he introduces in his works and obligates us to be part of it. You cannot avoid it. Passion, luxury, betrayal, murder are fundamental factors that support the most diverse complexities of the human soul.The extended range of aroused emotions we experience show us the mastery of his genius. Humor ( The merchant of Venice, Merry wives of Windsor, The comedy of errors) the eloquent passion exhibited in Gerona 's lovers, the sublime exquisiteness of A midsummer night \`s dream, the egregious domain of the feminine psychology (The taming of the shrew) and his portentous vision of the last consequences of the power (Richard III, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear) reveal such penetrating knowledge of the human being that may be considered a continuous and always renovated source of analysis and febrile investigation for all those who had decided to get inside this kaleidoscopic universe.His radiant brightness endures and increases through the times. Reading him we understand and even anticipate a good part of the past story of the last Century. That is why Albert Camus defined the XX Century as the Fear 's Century, he was thinking and talking in Shakespearean terms.Perhaps the most distinguished and remarkable aspect to underline resides in the fact his characters are so emblematic by themselves; that frequently defies any logic or defined ideology.

This is not an in-depth book about any particular topic, but provides just enough detail to keep a kid interested and get them introduced to a huge array of scientific topics - ecological, biological, meteorological, geological, linguistic and too many more to mention! Friendly, casual tone, well written, and accurate."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology, Volume 43 (Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology)","review":"Here, I am also commenting on the Supplements to this book, which the publisher periodically issues.The encyclopedia is excellent for a broad discussion of the hardware and software in computing. It has to regularly come out with Supplements because of the ongoing improvments in the field. All the major contributors to computing are discussed, with a good synopsis for each, explaining his or her bailiwick. The treatment is about 50-50 between hardware and software. The articles tend to discuss the main ideas, and the encyclopedia and its supplements should not be seen as even an attempt at a summary of vendors' offerings.If you are new to computing and want a general introduction, try consulting articles here. Professionals in computing will already have specialised texts in their subfields, and may not really need this book."},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"Excellent resource for all ASP.NET AND C# beginners. as well as a quick reference for C# and some ASP.NET basic configuration. These guys did a great job in putting together a logical sequence of chapters that will help the reader successfully learn to code basic ASP.NET web pages using C#. I especially like the general overview of the C# language and Object Oriented programming.Know what you are buying, because some readers commented it was \\"A bit too basic\\" and that is probably a technically correct statement however relative to your level of expectation.I used it to first phase into ASP.NET for which it was extremely helpful. Later in the development cycle of my initial application the book lost its use but I keep coming back to it for quick reference.A must for anyone coming from a classic ASP development environment into ASP.NET, C# and Object Oriented Programming. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"Firstly if you own this books predecessor (Beginning ASP.NET using C#) then you don't need this book. The two books are practically identical. The only real difference is that this version includes a security chapter in place of the three appendix sections included in the previous version. There are some minor differences in many of the code explanations but I actually found these slight changes confused the issue as opposed to improve it. To be honest I don't see how Wrox Press can justify the different authors on the cover of this version, it really is 95% identical to it's predecessor, I get the impression this was a tactic to fool the customer into thinking it is a totally different book. They told me the two books were different and that I should buy the latest version, I did, they aren't, and I feel deliberately cheated.The book itself has many problems, and it's difficult to know where to begin. First there are bundles and bundles of errors, far more than documented by Wrox (as usual). Interestingly many of the errors in this version existed in the previous version, so clearly Wrox quality control (if it exists) failed not once, but twice to identify these errors; that's inexcusable. The errors aren't just in the code, or in the explanations, but they are also in the author's knowledge of .NET. For example, they claim shared members can be accessed from instances of a class as well as the class itself, this isn't the case in C#. You can only access shared members via a class, and not an instance. This error is repeated several times, they even make a special point of it for you to note; very embarrassing. Also, there are times when examples don't work, as important information has been left out (writing to an event log springs to mind). The book is disjointed, you get a code example and then you're told an explanation won't be provided at that point as it is covered later in the book, so you end up jumping back and forth, this occurs far to often for comfort. You're also left hanging time and time again as crucial information is left out.Although this book does attempt to teach C#, the coverage is a bit limited, and in some areas examples are clearly required but are lacking. As another reviewer suggested, it would be better to know C# before using this book, alternatively you may get by if you have a good C# book to hand to help you through (as I did).Although there are questions at the end of most chapters, there are only answers to about 5 chapters available from Wrox, the answers to the questions for all the other chapters don't exist.Another big problem is that examples lead you through a mish-mash of classes with no explanations on what the classes are or what they do; no single class within the entire .NET Framework Class Library is covered properly, many are used but not given any mention. The coverage for the classes, that are mentioned in the explanations, is always grossly incomplete. I found that time and time again I had to go to the .NET documentation to find out what the book was leaving out, I honestly spent far more time in the documentation than using the book, as the book kept raising so many questions. Just remember that for each method or property covered there are 20 times that much not covered for that class.Chapter 14 on server controls tried to get you to run before you could walk (actually it was more sprint before you could crawl), you'll spend hours in the .NET documentation trying to work out the final two big examples in this chapter, what a mess!!! For me this was the worse chapter in the book. For a beginner you need to show small examples, covering the concepts first, before showing a big example, well this chapter skips smaller examples and just chucks two huge and exceptionally poorly explained ones at you. This is really the most idiotic approach when dealing with a beginner.None of the form controls were covered properly. For instance they give you a small grossly incomplete list of attributes for the label control and then just say the other controls generally use the same ones. When you go to the .NET documentation you find that each form control has a huge volume of very useful attributes you really should know about, they should have made an effort to cover form controls properly.The different writing styles of the authors does cause confusion, you also realise that some authors aren't as sure of their coding as others. For instance for a Page_Load event some authors include the object and EventArgs parameters but others don't. As a beginner I was wondering if there was a reason why, and which way was correct, but of course you're not told as it's just the authors own style. Wrox should have picked up on the glaringly obvious like this, but unsurprisingly, failed to do so.Operator overloads has exceptionally poor coverage, no working examples. I actually got the impression the author didn't really know it that well. Chapter 9, which covers 'shared members and class relationships' is pretty poor as well, this is a very important and powerful area of .NET and the author didn't know how to convey this information at all. The examples are useless, the author even states things like 'this example is way off perfection', and, after giving an example that isn't actually the way you should do something would state, 'what we ought to have done'. It leaves you not knowing when you should apply a particular concept or even if you applied it correctly. I could go on and on about the failings in this book, there really are so many issues to raise, but I won't completely bore you.So much is left out of this book that was required, and would have taken very little effort to include. Unfortunately being first to press seems to be more important to Wrox Press than quality. In all honestly the whole book feels more like an overview look at ASP.NET rather than a tutorial. Should you get this book you better download the .Net Framework SDK as you're really going to need it.It amazes me that others have given this book such good reviews. The mind boggles as to how they approached this subject. Did they bother to research each class properly? Did they study this book thoroughly, or did they just read it like a novel? Did they actually try the examples bearing in mind many don't work? I never expected this book to have complete coverage, that would be silly, but I did expect the coverage to be much better than this. Ultimately all this book will succeed in doing is giving you a very basic foundation in ASP.NET, and a shaky one at that. The book should have been bigger and far more thorough. I gave the book two stars as opposed to none as you could argue, from time to time, that it might be the nature of the beast rather than the failure of it's authors. The book does have its good points but sadly they're hard to remember as the bad points stand out more.Finally, when will Wrox Press wake up and release that 'to many cooks spoil the broth'?"},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"The main target audience of this book is the complete beginner. As a result, this books lays out the fundamentals better than any one of half a dozen ASP.NET books I've tried. If you are experienced with ASP and have already learned C#, then you can start reading this from Chapter 10. You will still probably find it a bit basic even then. It's a bit too gentle! Nevertheless, I think it's nearly required reading for all would be C#/ASP.NET developers, because it nails down all the major fundamentals with crystal clear explanations.I have a couple of significant criticisms though. VS.NET is essentially ignored. With the exception of a few pointers here and there, there is virtually no VS.NET involvement, which I think is purposeful so that Wrox can sell more books. Also, a couple of the examples I came across never followed up with an explanation, not even of the highlighted code - strange. So I'm giving it 4, instead of 5 stars.Regardless, if you intend to work with ASP.NET using C#, this book should be your first read after learning C#. I've searched high and low for a good one that targets experienced ASP developers, and still have not found a great one. All too often the content goes from general overview to details without much in between. At least this one clarifies the fundamental conceptsvery well. I found that invaluable, especially since I can always get the details from MSDN. Add a good &quot;How To/Show Me&quot; and another &quot;Design&quot; book to this and you are all set."},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"Not having written code in 6 years, this book was the perfect coding refresher and ASP.NET primer. After sifted through a dozen titles, I finally settled down and worked through this ASP.NET text cover to cover. It was the only book that didn't have gaps in explaning fundamental concepts and C# syntax.As someone who programmed in java a lifetime ago and who has not had much web development experience, this book was perfect. In other books, authors often skipped fundamental concepts that are not obvious to novice web developers. Despite the slew of authors, this book manages to stay cohesive and anticipate newbie questions. At times the book is pedantic to people who can code. But that's the price you pay for completeness.The general approach of the books is to focus on funcationality. You start with small applicable concepts and work towards the greater understanding. For some people, this will be unsatisfying because you don't get to the more powerful aspects of ASP.NET until later in the book (ex: code-behind and the separation of the data, logic, and presentation layers is not explained until the final chapters, whereas this topic is dealt with early on in most other books). But I found the approach effective.Conclusion: if you don't mind a refresher on coding (e.g. re-learning how hash tables work or 'value vs ref passing'), you have little web dev experience beyond playing with HTML, and you know nothing about ASP.NET, this is the best book on the market! The book stays focused on core topics and leaves the bells &amp; whistles of ASP.NET to other books. You can work straight through and develop the understanding you need to build ASP.NET pages."},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to ASP.NET and would make a good text for a ASP.NET101 class. It assumes no prior knowledge of ASP. It assumes no prior knowledge of any programming language. It does not make use of the VS IDE. There were 13 authors plus 4 other contributors, even though only 7 persons are included in the photo printed on the cover (I wonder who got left out). However, the editor and technical reviewers did a good job of bringing all the material together and providing a remarkable degree of consistency. Some others found the style to be choppy. I thought it was fine because of the disjointed nature of the topics. Each chapter is pretty much independent of the other chapters (see the list of chapters at the end of this review).A reader should finish this book with a basic understanding of C#, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, OOP, Event-driven programming, data structures, components, assemblies, custom controls, error handling, debugging, web services, and security. Highly recommended for someone starting from scratch -- or with only a brief introduction to programming. Someone with programming experience will find about one-fourth of the book to be too basic. Someone with prior experience using an OOP language will find about one-third of the book to be material they already know. Still, it provides a useful introduction to ASP.NET; especially in regard to the structure of ASP.NET and the use of server side controls. Many bits of wisdom can be found throughout the book -- such as on Page 141, \\"DataStart and DateEnd are better than StartDate and EndDate, as these two related methods will then come next to each other in an alphabetically sorted search.\\"The Index is 28 pages and very useful.Here are the chapters:1) Getting Started with ASP.NET.2) Anatomy of a ASP.NET Page3) Forms and HTML Server Controls4) Storing Information in C#5) Introducing XML6) Control Structures and Procedure Programming7) Even-driven Programming and Postback8) Introduction to Objects9) Shared Members and Class Relationships10) Objects in ASP.NET11) Objects and Structured Data12) Reading from Data Sources13) Manipulating Data Sources14) ASP.NET Server Controls15) Reusable Code for ASP.NET16) .NET Assemblies and Custom Controls17) Debugging and Error Handling18) Web Services19) Configuration and Optimization20) ASP.NET SecurityJim HollomanAtlanta, GA..."},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.0 with C#","review":"Normally I am a big fan of WROX press books, until this book, it has actually made me stop and think about any wrox book on .net.

However, I &quot;personally&quot; think if someone knows only a bit of html (probably used WYSIWYG tools for all his/her life), and then jumping directly into stuffs like, server-side language, loads of programming &quot;concepts&quot;, .net vision, event-driven programming, xml, objects orientation and C#!!!... WOAH, it just seems WAY too much. (Maybe it's just my opinion).The first half treats you entirely like a baby (yeah yeah, i know what the title is ... &quot;beginning&quot;...), explaining every single bit of code.

It's all the basics with very simple examples -- first showing you the entire code, then a screenshot of the output, breaking the code into pieces explaining.

One problem I had was that when I got puzzled over something, it was hard to find the right reference material to figure it out. This is a tough issue that the book's authors should have put more thought into, but its not just their challenge, its kind of the nature of the beast. There is a lot of material and topics, and the coverage is shallow, so you better get used to looking long and hard for answers.

It is a good book for an intermediate programmer, since this book does cover all the bases of what you should know about ASP.NET. What I didn't like about this book is that it gives a basic explaination, but never builds it up to something difficult. It explains something basic and keeps the example basic. It should build up to examples that are a little more real world and difficult. If you are a newbie however, I would give this book 5 stars.

While White's focus is the Australian identity and the images associated with it, what he has to say applies to the rest of us, as well. His argument is that national identity changes with different ages, but that the images which become those identities, for instance, the World War I &quot;digger&quot; or the &quot;convict&quot; identity which have at different times been seen as &quot;Australian identity,&quot; are really the constructions of people in power who believe a particular identity will further their own or the country's aims. The image, then, of the Australian &quot;digger,&quot; the tough-minded, uncomplaining and stalwart soldier of World War I, is an identity that was necessary and helpful to those in power as they tried to convince people that Australians had a duty to fight and were good at it. The book may not be as interesting to those who are unfamiliar with these Australian images of themselves, but it is not hard to apply it to American identity. Our own images of ourselves as an &quot;immigrant,&quot; &quot;wealthy industrialist,&quot; or &quot;pioneering&quot; society are just as vital to our perception of our own history, and just as challenged by White's thesis. However, the book may be most interesting to those who have spent time outside of their own culture or have had experiences being stereotyped because of their nationality.

Anyone who has read this book will agree. It is totally disjointed, one chapter does not quite follow the other in places, crooks appear and are never mentioned again. One is renamed and unbelievable things occur - such as Mr. Hardy's sudden appearance in a cave in the woods with the Hardys. What are the odds??? In this regard - the book was horrible. Having said that - As a child I could not put this book down. It drew me from page to page and it was among my favorites. It has always crossed my mind that these books are geared primarily toward children and youth and perhaps therin lies some genious at work. While an adult can pick the book to shreds, it fascinates it's intended target audience. Anyone who has read the volume will tell you how horrible it is in one breath and then tell you they loved it in the next. I am no different. It is full of imagination, creativity and brings to the table all the elements associated with a Hardy Boys book: Ghosts, Haunted House and a graveyard. No other book among the first 58 can make this claim! So it is horrible in one respect and brilliant in another. I rate it a weak 4 star. RATED BREVISION: The 1964 - Don't even compare it to the original. In places it was better - in places it was worse. Strangely it made more sense - but lacked the \\"punch\\" of the original. A good book certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"This review concerns the original 1940 edition. Frank and Joe help their father track down a gang of vicious bank robbers and stumble upon a crazy man's mysterious, old mansion filled with his strange inventions. This is easily the most imaginative of all of the Hardy Boys books, with all of the interesting gadgets that the author included in the book; however, it is not a very well written book. There are a number of cases of people meeting in the most unlikely of areas, plot points that are totally irrelevant to the book and never explained (Frank and Joe find an envelope with a $100 bill in it at the beginning of the book, it is never mentioned again until the end of the book and it is never explained to whom the money belongs) and, at one point, Frank, Joe and Chet are at the mansion, Chet becomes frightened, runs off and is not mentioned again until Frank and Joe return to Bayport. The whole side of the book that concerns the mansion is not that important to the story, even though it is the most interesting part. It seems as though the author had a great idea for this weird house and then had to write in the bank robbers to provide bad guys for the story, because the first 80, or so, pages, until Frank and Joe first arrive at the mansion, drag on a bit. From that point on the book is pretty good. If nothing else, though, the book is interesting enough because of the strange gadgets and most Hardy Boy's fans would not think the book a waste of their time."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"Hardy Boy books are God-awful! Read them as a kid, but I don't know why. The characters are thinly drawn. The cut-and-paste story lines are not true-to-life. If you've read one Hardy Boy book, you've read them all. Chet Morton--their foolhardy, STOUT sleuth in waiting--portrays porky adolescence in a disturbing fashion. The Hardy Boy series portrays a world steeped in conservative values which does, I admit, offend my more bohemian sensibilities. The banter is humourless and predictable. The characters are stereotyped and leave no lasting impression. We learn very little about them apart from the cut-and-paste descriptions which seem to span the series. Believe me. I read the entire series as a child. The heroic qualities found in both Frank and Joe--their athleticism, and their scholastic aptitude--are so stupendous that it sends mixed messages to young impressionable readers. I'm not even sure if the &quot;author,&quot; Franklin W. Dixon, is not just the pen name for the publishing company who manufactures this heap of cow dung. Why doesn't the author occasionally plug his books on Larry King? Ironically, fleshing out the author presents the same complications posed by fleshing out the characters in these books. If I could convince just one Hardy Boy fan to turn to Agatha Christie and other more modern mystery writers--ones who tax both the mind and the soul--my work, I believe, is done."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"This book is easily my favorite Hardy Boys book. It has jewel thieves, cool gizmos (of that time period), an old mansion full of mysteries, and an old man with an unknown purpose. Hardy Boys fans, check it out!"},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"The Disappearing Floor has always been one of my favorite Hardy Boys stories. A thrilling mystery about unscrupulous jewel thieves who are using a mysterious old mansion (which has a long-kept secret) as a hideout. It has excellent plot twists and the several intriguing storylines are woven together deftly. Awesome story!!!! I read it again for the first time in 15 years. This is one of those Hardy Boys titles where the revised text version is vastly superior to the original."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"There was a fascination in the 30s with science fiction. The original Hardy Boys book which was revised into this book was originally written in the early half of the last century, as you can tell by the improbably gadgets described in this story.This mystery is one of the most bizarre of the early Hardy Boys' books. There are supposed ghosts, a mysterious death, secret passages, missing documents, and a host of other unusual circumstances, including an eccentric scientist, missing diamonds, and a possible source of amethysts.One of the most difficult aspects of this book is its complexity. Numerous elements are woven together from the very beginning of the book that leaves you hanging until near the end. As one example, there is a floor that seems to come and go and for a good portion of the book the Hardy boys have a difficult time knowing whether the disappearing floor actually exists.I found the eccentric scientist and his gadgets humorous. While his devices might have seemed possible when this book was written in 1940, we are reasonably certain today that some of the devices described are unlikely to exist. However, I found it enjoyable to think back to an era when anything seemed possible.The complexity of the story does make it a bit difficult to follow. This Hardy Boys' book would benefit from an expansion of the story, or a revision to eliminate some of the elements. I found myself re-reading portions of the book because I missed a detail. However, at the end the author does explain all the details to clarify what happened.As complex as this story is, I enjoyed it. Much of the story is so incredible that it throws the story into another reality that allows you to ignore the dire danger that the Hardys find themselves in. This other reality also allows you to overlook the coincidences and the complexity of the story. This book is one of my favorites in this series.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"Personally, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty exciting. There are many exciting things that happen, like a car chase, a smoke screen, a dying man, mysterious robberies, a hidden tunnel, an errie ghost, a disappearing floor, a plane crash, a sabotaged boat, and a strange message. All in all it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"I didn't quite get this book in the begining, where the floor part occurred, but the rest I understood and was interesting, I think everyone would have to say. The secret tunnel would have been a fun part, but uh-oh when Chet hit the phone! But that happens. The house is interesting, especially the lab, since I like labs and those things. The rest of the parts, well, are okay. Still if you like a classic don't miss this book."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1964 edition. Mr. Hardy gets Frank and Joe to help him track down a gang of jewel thieves. The trail leads Frank and Joe to the old Perth mansion on the outskirts of Bayport and into another mystery: what caused the death of Clarence Perth, who died in the mansion shortly after inheriting it from his uncle. This book wasn't bad, but with its appealing title and spooky mansion, I expected it to be better than what it was; although, most often, the books with the very appealing sounding titles don't live up to my expectations. This book is average; the mystery is interesting enough, there is a moderate amount of action and at least this edition wasn't confusing, unlike the original edition which was hard to follow at times. Some fans, like myself, might feel that this book wasn't as good as they had expected, but I don't think that any Hardy Boys fans would be bored reading the book."},{"Title":"The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys, Book 19)","review":"First it starts with Chet, frightened like a baby pig by the disappearing floor, then it's various visits with the old mansion.

It is filled with over 3,00 films and videos. I found movies that i had forgot about in this book. The book is filled with Directors, Themes, Stars, and photos. I would recommend it to EVERYONE. I will have to say though, most rescent titles arent included. It was published in 1996 ."},{"Title":"Images in the dark; an encyclopedia of gay and lesbian film and video.","review":"I agree with the reviewer who stated that this book needs to be updated. As the other reviewer noted, the book was published in 1996, which makes it a very dated. Regardless, that does not diminish the usefulness of the book in any way.The book is broken up into chapter sections and then listed in alphabetical order. You may want to get tabs for the individual sections in order to make it easier to locate what you are looking for specifically. For instance, if you are looking for gay directors, it is the first chapter in the book. However films of \\"Gay Male Interest\\" begin on page 375. By putting tabs in the book, it makes it a much quicker reference guide.Each film has a small blurb discussing what the film is about and how it relates to the LGBTQ community. Not all of the films in the book are gay or lesbian but it may have a gay or lesbian, etc. character, theme, or whatever in it that contributes to the study of the sub-cultural genre. The reviews also tell whether the LGBTQ portrayals are positive or negative, in most cases, which helps guide whether or not we want to see the particular film. Unfortunately, by 1996, most portrayals of Gays, Lesbians, etc. were negative portrayals, with notable exceptions. This was a period where cinematic perspectives about the LGBTQ community was only beginning to change. That is something to keep in mind when considering many of these films.All in all, the book is wonderful and a great reference for the film buff, film student, auteur or anyone interested in the art form to refer to. The book is great for LGBTQ studies.As previously noted, the only downfall for the book is that it has not been updated in 15 years. That is the only limitation of the book. Otherwise, the reviews are clear and concise. It is worth purchasing this book and keeping it near your film library.4.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"Images in the dark; an encyclopedia of gay and lesbian film and video.","review":"My only regret is that this book has not been updated in years. We need a new edition."},{"Title":"England in the twentieth century, 1914-63 (Pelican history of England)","review":"This is a political military and social history of England in the twentieth century. It however covers only the period from 1914-63. Thomson is a very good and clear writer. In his opening chapter he explains how the sudden transformation of the world which occurred with the outbreak of the First War was the result of processes set in motion in the seemingly ideal period before. He wants that is to stress the continuities in history even while recognizing that there are turning point- years and events. For him the turning point is 1917 with the Bolshevik Revolution and the U.S. entry into the War.The story of Britain in the twentieth century is a tremendously fascinating one. One of the central themes of course is the decline of Britain from being the world's first industrial and military power to being part of a European coalition which in a sense was outpowered by the Soviet Union and the United States.Thomson makes it clear that the transition in these years for England was not wholly or even primarily negative. For these were also the years of movement toward affluence, for a more socially just society. The decline in power that is , is balanced by an increase in general prosperity.I was surprised at the breakneck speed in which Thomson told the story of the Second World War. It is not that he was 'wrong' but that great and important events and processes are treated very skimpily.This is again a well- written book from which it is possible to learn much. But it just does not explore deeply enough much of what the century brought England in order to be regarded as truly satisfactory."},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People","review":"Wow! The contributions to this anthology are breathtaking and thought-provoking. Travis Hunter makes a solid impression with his contribution -- a touching and honest family-type story that keeps it real, and provides a future and a hope. Tanya Marie Lewis paints a vivid description of prison and a certain shocking way that a man seeking forgiveness breaks out, and Margaret Johnson-Hodge plants hope inside those who might be ready to give up. This anthology is filled with strong and important writings; it's a must-have and should be added to your book collection pronto!"},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People","review":"I really enjoyed this book. All of the stories are wonderful and the connection to the proverb that they all wrote about was simply masterful! I particularly enjoyed the story Franklin White gave us. His proverb dealt with &quot;no matter how long a log stays in the water, a log it will remain.&quot; His story about a black actress in Hollywood who did everything under the sun to become more mainstream was brillant. I will not spoil it for others but the story really made me think about all the black actresses who have to jump through hoops to finally get a part in a mainstream movie.

Each story had a moral from an African proverb or saying and the stories were woven magnificently around them. These stories helped me relive some lessons I have learned in my life and also opened my eyes to a lot of things that have yet to happen to me. The people who breathed life into these characters should get a standing ovation.Well Done! You will not be disappointed. By the way, I am a 20 year old college student so age doesn't matter. This is a book for everyone."},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People","review":"I really enjoyed Proverbs for the People. The diversity of the authors and the stories they wrote with strong lessons that jumped from the pages was nothing short of amazing. My favorite stories were &quot;Women Drive Buses too&quot; and &quot;Consequences.&quot;I recommend this anthology and applaud the efforts of the authors and diversities."},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People","review":"We have all heard proverbs at some point in our lives; little truths that teach morals, tell stories, or teach us how to live. In PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE, authors take insightful African, African American, and Biblical proverbs and utilize them to create extraordinary short stories that depict truths and leave marks on the heart.This unique anthology contains stories from well known authors such as Travis Hunter, Omar Tyree, Margaret Johnson-Hodge, Pearl Cleage, and others, as well as stories from up and coming authors. Like the proverbs they represent, the stories are diverse and full of emotions. Although all of the stories were wonderful and touching, some of personal favorites were Gwynne Forster's \\"First Thing Monday Morning,\\" which taught the morals that actions speak louder than words and to be careful what you wish for, because you just may get it, and Robert Fleming's \\"A Crisis of Faith,\\" about a man who is wrongly incarcerated.PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE is a wonderful novel that will teach, inspire, and entertain. It has a story that everyone can relate to, and will make a wonderful addition to any book collection.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

For example, one of the most phenomenal stories is by a 15-year old recently published, young lady named Tierra French with \\"A Difficult Lesson\\". I read each story and the ones I really dug include: \\"Something Special\\", \\"Flimsy and Raggedy\\", \\"Not Tonight\\", \\"A Crisis of Faith\\", \\"Senseless\\", \\"Queen\\", \\"First Thing Monday Morning\\", \\"If He Didn't Go\\", \\"A Difficult Lesson\\", \\"Back Then\\", \\"Dancing at Esperanza's\\", \\"The Consequence\\", \\"Young Ballers\\", \\"Panhandling\\", \\"John Q's Blissful Journey\\", \\"Trick Dice\\", \\"The Cycle\\", \\"Pass It On\\", \\"Felicia and the Prodigy\\", \\"Ultimate Forgiveness\\", \\"Dead to the World\\", \\"Detour\\", \\"Colours\\", \\"The Day Chano Died\\", \\"Charitable Roy\\", \\"The Fire This Time\\", \\"The Willow Tree\\", and \\"She Planted Faith in her Dream\\". You may be thinking that I liked every story in here, but believe me, there are quite a few I didn't care for. One example would be the very twisted \\"The Bag Lady\\" that I did NOT appreciate the humor about killing a dog because I am crazy about dogs the way most are crazy about babies. I thought \\"Sink or Swim\\" was an excuse for women to not lose weight. Yeah, the husband's explanation was rude but the theme behind this story is why the black community has such bad health now--we try to excuse everything. And \\"My Momma Said...\\" was a great story for golddigers. A prize is a man with money? It's like the main character didn't learn a damn thing. I hated that story. \\"Death of a Salesperson\\" needed the editor to catch that the main character said she worked at the company thirty-two years (twice!) but then switch to thirty years. And I don't know what's on Omar Tyree's bird but the use of the n-word really bugs me regardless of whether he switched it up in the end and \\"Playin' the Role\\" EMBRACED the word. Guess some people still got a lot to learn!Anyway, I ended up joining a book club so I could buy books from each of these published authors. Thank you for all the hook-ups and the people to avoid. And Travis Hunter's story was the best of all, but I'm not surprised because I'm crazy about this author's work."},{"Title":"Beginner's Guide to French","review":"\\"Beginner's guide to French\\"(Fun Fax) is a nice little(very little) pocket book that is meant as a supplement to anyone taking a course in the French language, or for just times when you need a word or two, or a phrase to help with a writing project, directions, or maybe even ordering in a French restaurant. It's a very beginners level guide, that will give you just a little help in understanding the very basics of the langauge.The book is sectioned into Grammar, Phrases, Names, Numbers, Accent, and Description. There is also a couple of pages of pronunciation. You won't get a complete course in these groupings, just a bit of everything. Grammar will give you an idea of which nouns are feminine(la) and which are masculine(le), when you hear the words spoken. Commonly used words and phrases for asking questions are presented. How are you?, Very Well..etc. Family members, things around the house, asking the way, and at the airport and cafe might be pages that will come in very handy. Colors, days, dates, shopping, weather and several other events are covered.Illustratins of people having various conversations are shown, with translations, and pronouns are touched on as well. As for the pronunciation, the basics are given, vowels, \\"eau\\"..like the 'oa' in coast, and some others, but the best way to learn this is to try and find a French person and copy their accent.The words and phrases are shown with the proper accent marks, which is nice if used for writing, and the pages have holes punched and may be removed and used in a Fun-Fax OrganizerRecommended as a nice little item to get you started, and to have at your fingertips when needed, but don't plan on having any major conversations.

The Sesquicentennial Edition (which will hopefully be re-issued) reproduces almost all the recipes of the original edition, using the original text, but adds marginal annotations showing modern measurements, suggestions for ingredient substitutions, and other information about the recipes that make them accessible to contemporary cooks.

For a female Irish writer to write a book that even hints at a lesbianism was probably beyond the ability of the Irish Catholic establishment to deal with in that era. However, that is such a minor part of the novel, that it is really mistitled with this new title &quot;Talk of Angels.&quot; Discussion about the sexual orientation of a minor character greatly distorts the stark beauty of the characters, Spain, and the inner story which O'Brien tells so well. I understand that the new title replaces the originally published title of &quot;Mary Lavelle.&quot; But the angel passage and the lesbian angle are so minor, that I would probably opt for something associated with the climax like &quot;Spanish Love Dance.&quot; The strength of this work is the exploration of the inner characters. The main character of Mary Lavelle, her beauty, her vulnerability, and the options between uncertain romance and unromantic certainty. We root for Mary to make love a romantic choice rather than simply an ecomonic security issue as so many women over the last centuries have been forced to make. The characters of the father and her lover are also well drawn and filled with their own special quests. As important as any of the characters is Spain itself. How lovingly is it described, more alluring than a travel trailer or vacation brochure. The society of the other nannies with their squabbling creates a strong reality in which we can see these women operate. The ending left me wanting more in the story. I wanted to know what happened after her return to Ireland. Perhaps that is what a great novel does, leaves you so connected to the characters that they last with you long after the book ends. I believe this book will connect with romantics of both genders, simply because the writing is so fine."},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"This lovely coming-of-age story set in the 1920's is beautifully written. I must confess it did take me a bit to get into it (it was somewhat boring until about halfway through), but I'm glad I stuck it out as the story seemed to grab me and stick with me night and day. Mary and Juanito's love story reminded me a great deal of The Bridges of Madison County - hopeless, unrealistic and doomed from the start. A great romance in all respects. Now I must add Spain to my travel wish list!"},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"This was a great book for so many reasons. I loved the emotional changes that the protagonist went through and the colorful people that she interacted with. I also liked the excellent descriptions of Spain and the romantic/political atmosphere. A great read for anyone who is a romantic."},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"One can browse racks of books in our modern bookstores, but from the past come books of wonderfully insightful, deeply sensitive and concerned writers. In our age of easy violence and indifference to the pangs of divorce, etc, suddenly we are brought to our knees through the story of a young woman, driven by her unnamed lust for life, to an illicit and adulterous meeting, which is connected with another's untimely death. One can feel through the young woman's innocence that she perceives the import of her trembling, hesitant sin: she knows she will never forget it. No doubt the writer O'Brien experienced something similar; she wrote this in her own 30's back in Ireland. Enjoy the sweet and urgent, yet fuzzy uncomprehending mind of an Irish country girl as she blossoms in the hot Spanish sun."},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"i loved traveling through the adventures of this woman's life - especially during this time period. the &quot;blossoming&quot; in spain - what a WONDERFUL place to be in spring!! - brought an interesting perspective that needed to be understood before appreciated. i'd love to hear thoughts on any of her other books."},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"The lesbian character of Agatha Conlan, although a small role, is better drawn and more visible than in most modern novels. The heroine, Mary Lavelle falls in love with a married man. Even though, she is an innocent in affairs of the heart, she controls the relationship."},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","review":"I watched the movie Talk of Angels several times before I knew that it was based on a book. I watched it primarily because I think that Polly Walker is a great actress, but then I got hooked on the story. The story in the movie involves the historical context (precursor to the Spanish civil war) and better explains the characters' motivations. The book is lacking this context and reads like a cheap romance novel at times. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"No Man's Land Vol 1","review":"This is what I have so far, it is a work in progress I will mention more about the artwork shortly, but is this sound okay so far?It is my belief that what some of the other reviewers are forgetting about No Man's Land is the story itself. It is the very story told in No Man's Land that drew me in from the first few pages and now has me eagerly awaiting the next volume's release. It is a story which brings to mind the classic westerns, holding all the hallmarks of those classic western stories that people have watched over again in movies and read over again in novels. However, it does hold a slight twist which for me was a further hook to this story, and what makes it unique within the hallmarks of classic western stories it holds.Many of the classic western elements have been mentioned in the editorial review, a Civil War veteran, a man who has had everything taken from him, a man that as a result has turned into a type of bounty hunter and mercenary, whose tortured by memories of what he lost and whose only true peace comes from hunting some of those that brought such loss to his life. The twist comes through what he is hunting, various demons and monsters. The same ones he was duped into freeing and setting lose upon an un-expecting world.As to the artwork itself, it fits perfectly with a style and flair of the story matching both the story's pacing and the action of the story. It is also reminiscent of the western style movies and covers of old western novels. Never once did I find the artwork to be overwhelming but in fact found it to help further assist in the telling of the story. It brought further to life the words which were being spoken and told, and for me helped to make No Man Land's that much more enjoyable.No Man's Land is one, which I very highly recommend, by encouraging you not to compare it or judge it without first trying it for yourself. Upon trying No Man's Land I think you will find a brand new story that is by far one of the most enjoyable stories with an \\"Old West\\" setting to be released in any format recently.Lastly, I do not desire to enter into a debate over what is and is not manga in review, nor is this the place to have such a debate, so I also encourage any future reviews not to try and bring about questions of what is and is not manga at present."},{"Title":"No Man's Land Vol 1","review":"First of all, let me make it clear that I have absolutely nothing against OEL manga. Some of my favorite manga happen to be OELs. I am not a purist. On the other hand, I understand that not all OELs are perfect and brilliant. They're a mixed bunch, just like Japanese manga. Alright, now that I've made that clear, let me move on to the review.If you are to believe the blurb on the back cover, No Man's Land is about John Parker, who was a decorated sharpshooter in the Civil War, had a promising career ahead of him, a wife, and a newborn son. The blurb continues that John lost everything after getting embroiled in a conspiracy engineered by the Bakerton Detective Agency. Now John reinvents himself as \\"No Man\\", a gun-for-hire who hunts and kills demons.If you read the blurb, as I did, you would probably think that this sounds like a fascinating series. Unfortunately, I can recap the entire first volume in one sentence: John Parker is a Civil War veteran who fights demons in the Old West. Actually, that's a bit too sophisticated. The real blurb should be something like this: A dude with a big gun shoots evil stuff and gore spatters everywhere. That's much closer to the atmosphere of the first volume of No Man's Land. The Bakerton Detective Agency is never introduced (although a character named Bakerton shows up at the end of the volume); the conspiracy subplot makes no appearance at all.The art, like all Seven Seas' releases, is beautiful. Unfortunately, the panel layout is often confusing and the artist uses speed lines far too much. There were several action scenes where I couldn't tell what was happening and I had to re-read the page several times.Another major problem with the volume is that I wanted to vomit just about every other page. The volume is rated Older Teen, but I doubt that it would be rated anything less than Mature with another publisher. One of the early scenes in the volume features a small child eating the innards of a naked woman. Yum. One of the most graphic scenes in the volume features a naked woman (why must they always be naked?) who has had her left leg ripped off, her intestines ripped out and thrown all over the room, and a large bite taken out of her breast. Feeling sick yet? If not, don't worry. The volume also features plenty of decapitation, limb-loss, and many, many gunshot wounds, all beautifully drawn, of course.The story is, as I have already said, non-existent and the characters are cardboard cut-outs. The volume has one of the most stereotypical Mexicans I have ever seen. He seems incapable of uttering a sentence that doesn't include some random Spanish phrase. He's supposed to be comic relief, but the only relief that came from him was when he finally shut up. The main character is supposed to have a tragic past (as indicated by the heart-warming flashbacks featuring his wife and child), but none of that is actually present in his personality. He seems to be there simply to fill the role of protagonist, not to be an interesting and original character.If you want to see a guy shoot stuff and some pretty art, you might consider buying No Man's Land. However, if the idea of seeing a disemboweled woman disturbs you, this is definitely not the book for you. If you're looking for an engrossing story or unusual characters, this is not the book for you either; in fact, I would recommend avoiding No Man's Land like the plague."},{"Title":"No Man's Land Vol 1","review":"It's a little confusing at first. Dark, disturbing, and yet wonderfully drawn, the first few pages had me convinced this was some sort of Zombie Western. (It isn't.) However, I have to admit, those first few pages hooked me long enough for the plot to kick in and further capture my interest. Set on an Alternative Earth, a young man attempts to eradicate monsters he blames himself for creating. The whole backstory comes out in Vol. 2 (which I also recommend). Here, we meet the main character, get the basic plot line, and find the villians are real villains. (The author even invents a set of unique monsters.) It's a set up that manga readers will recognize. In this volume we find the major players, their skills and personalities, and are drawn into the story which is developed through further volumes. Unfortunately, there are only 2 volumes.The only major problem I had with his manga was the lack of backstory. I would have enjoyed just a bit more. It would have added to my already growing interest in the series. As it was, the characters were a bit two-dimensional. Not enough to spoil my enjoyment, but just enough to be somewhat distracting."},{"Title":"No Man's Land Vol 1","review":"I didn't know it was a soap opera story. I grew up with Western and Spaghetti Western movies. I have never seen them act very dramatic, to me Westerns are more of a \\"Man of action with his pistol.\\" No Man's Land didn't seem to have that and the idea of devil worshipping and demons coming out to be like people, Pres. Lincoln geting killed by that actor who turns into a demon, John Wilkes Booth, seems sort of ridiculous."},{"Title":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart?: The Positive Side of Temptation","review":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart: The Positive Side of Temptation is unlike anything I've ever read before. Ms. Knox has revealed a world of which not many would dare to speak.Ms. Knox's ability to weave a story of love, hate, intrigue, salvation, and ultimately redemption is nothing short of sheer genius. The reader is drawn into the world of Kennedy and Angel, a world of sweet subtlety, uncertainty, and finally, total submission to one's own desires. Yet, in the midst of all that is forbidden, the merciful, and gentle hand of God is ever present, tugging at the heartstrings of the two women, forcing them to make hard decisions; decisions that will not only affect them in this life but also in the life to come.The journey to salvation is long, and at times, extremely hard. Ms. Knox shows us that, in the human condition, frailty and strength, more often than not, go hand in hand. And no matter what the struggle, whether it be homosexuality, fornication, adultery, drug addiction, or simply an inability to forgive, How Can an Angel Take My Heart: The Positive Side of Temptation reminds us that our choices, for better or for worse, will have eternal consequences."},{"Title":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart?: The Positive Side of Temptation","review":"First I would like to congradulate Ms. Knox on her success. I read this book in 3 days and absoulutely felled in love with every character. Even though the book was about fighting the temptation of the human flesh and your love for God, it also was about unconditonal love. Unconditional love between two individuals who were not just in love with each other's flesh but in love with each other's heart, mind, and soul. In my opinion Christians believe that when you engage in homosexuality you are going to hell. Me being on the otherside do not believe that. That do not mean I do not love the lord almighty. I know who the lord is and what he stands for and that's love. I pray to him, I feel his presence, I thank the lord every morning for letting me see another day. NO one can judge me but the lord himself and when he's ready to show me what he want's from me, he will. Yes, I love differently but I also love the lord. You can love the lord unconditonally and love someone else too. Be it male or female. The book was great, it will change some peoples live and some it won't. But don't criticize, hate, or judge someone you know nothing about. Remember, they say that's also a sin. Get the book and happy reading!"},{"Title":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart?: The Positive Side of Temptation","review":"I enjoyed reading How Can an Angel Take My Heart. Ms. Knox has really captured alot of the issues that the world is facing today. People who stand in judgment of others will have to deal with someone else judging them one day. No matter what a person chooses to do in their life, we as people don't have the right to judge them. There is not a perfect person on this earth, therefore we need to inspect and clean up our own lives before passing judgment on others. I was able to draw alot of positiveness from the book. In the end, doing what is right doesnt always feel good but it allows you to grow and see a brighter tomorrow with time if you just stay optomistic. Ms. Knox has confronted some very real issues that people deal with today. I can't wait to see her next book. I'm sure she will continue to have a very strong voice in the world and continue to be a light at the end of some tunnels. I hope her book continues to help others."},{"Title":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart?: The Positive Side of Temptation","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Their struggle between pleasing the flesh and pleasing the Lord is a real one that every single human has to deal with. Love is a beautiful thing and these women share a deep and true love. But sex is an action we can make a choice to partake in, or to forego. According to the Bible, homosexuality is wrong. However, love is never wrong. I feel for these characters and for all the real life people who fight this physical vs. spiritual battle. The book is full of action and the passion is explicit, but this is definitely a time where the message is even more interesting than the story. How can you choose between love and God, when God IS love? It's hard sometimes.I think I'm more anxious than anyone, other than Ms. Knox, to see this become a movie so it can be seen by the world."},{"Title":"How Can An Angel Take My Heart?: The Positive Side of Temptation","review":"First of all, the story was great!

My stomach tightened as I recalled living many of his stories of hard work on the farm: making things yourself and doing without modern amenities, caring for animals and eating what you produced yourself, haying and harvesting, milking and attending a little one-room school. There are oddities in his stories, things that may have been unique to his family's experience, but most of his stories have a rough equivalent in other families' experience. Examples: The practice of witching to find graves that even determined the sex of the person buried. A white rock that was special. A woman who practiced brauche and healed his ringworm.Books like this have proliferated--thank goodness--as many sit down to pass on the story of a way of life lived during days that have vanished. So you might ask, why would I want to read this book when I know (or have read about) others who have experienced a life similar to the one the author describes? Because Mueller projects an unusually powerful sense of family, of connection to his forebears and relatives, and to place. He listened carefully to oral histories passed by his family concerning the very earliest settlers of his family who came from the Russian steppe to the plains of North America. He also visited the site of the old home place and identified the old clay house and the other buildings where his pioneering forebears homesteaded. Mueller includes biographical sketches of family members and the local country doctor and describes a 1903 wedding dinner. He doesn't have \\"women's work\\" very well in focus, but he has proved to be a much better writer than he dreamt he could be when he started writing these essays, and he has made a fine contribution to the personal-reminiscence literature of the Germans from Russia."},{"Title":"The Last Link: Dakota Territory, Logan County, 1887: Old North Dakota Memories: The Weispfennings and Muellers: Our Early American Experiences in Dakota Territory","review":"First, many thanks to Tom. It was amazing to read the stories of my family in print. Finally, someone had the patience to sit down and put all of it down in one place. I cried as I read the stories retold by my great-aunts and uncles, my grandfather, and cousins. Not because they were sad, but because I was so happy to know that all of the stories of their love for each other and the family, hard work, struggles, and triumhps can never be forgotten now.

Like Fluke equipment, the book is top of the range. However, while it does make some allowances for the less technically savvy, it's not really for beginners. (If you are new to networks but have an electronics background I do not classify you as a beginner but if you have some computer skills and have plugged a cable into a hub a few times, I do.)The only fault I can find with it is that it assumes you use Fluke devices for maintaining and trouble shooting...but maybe that is Allen's subtle way of saying &quot;to troubleshoot use Fluke&quot; - advice that is probably as good as what is said explicitly in the text.Although the book has many useful appendices, it is light and reasonably small, so it can easily accompany you on the job. If you are a professional network engineer I think this is a must read.

(And he's right.)The book is beautifully illustrated, and neatly written as well.This edition does have \\"Mom\\" at the end instead of \\"Mum\\".

The book has a strange, soothing effect on me as I join the Birdwells, who, as Quakers during the Civil War, face moral dilemmas and everyday hardships, yet manage to maintain a thoughtful serenity. The author has the rare ability to paint a picture *economically* with her words, and this reader has no desire to see a movie based upon the book, for fear it would ruin the images already stored in the mind. I was delighted to discover that there is a tremendous amount of subtle humor woven into the pages, which makes reading the book a truly bittersweet experience that reflects real life.

Now their world comes vibrantly alive once more in Except for Me and Thee.Here are those gallant Quakers, young and in love, meeting the challenges of nature and man as the growing family travels westward, then encountering the bitterness and savagery that explode into the Civil War, later guiding their children through the confusing aftermath, and , finally, looking at their world with bittersweet maturity. For all its fascinating differences, their world confronts dilemmas strikingly contemporary - youthful rebellion, racial intolerance, social inequity, and warfare's misery. To each, Miss West brings deep and meaningful insights.And she brings more in the many moments of spirited comedy and gentle humor that are equally a part of living and so natural to this appealing couple and their family.Here, then, are full measures of joy and sadness, tenderness and brutality, hope and despair - a sweeping spectrum of human experience ranging continuously through this compelling story.

Nadeau and Quinn, including this one. It is primarily an in-depth guide for clinicians who treat women with ADHD. But, in my experience, clinicians' guides often provide the most helpful books to read before you begin the search for an ADHD specialist. Once you know the recommended protocols, such guides provide a benchmark by which to judge a potential therapist's or doctor's expertise.Quinn and Nadeau are highly respected pioneers in the detection and treatment of ADHD in women and girls. And if you've found that most healthcare professionals are undereducated on ADHD in general, wait until you learn how little they know about the unique angle gender takes. ADHD not only might manifest differently in females, but there are also other psychological and physical issues, such as hormonal cycles and pregnancy, to consider. And this information is found literally nowhere else.I also recommend their other books on this subject, including \\"Understanding Women with ADHD,\\" \\"Understanding Girls with ADHD,\\" and \\"When Moms and Kids have ADD.\\"That said, their expert knowledge extends well beyond female ADHD into all aspects in both genders and throughout the lifespan. Together or individually, they have contributed many helpful standouts to the ADHD library and are popular speakers at national conferences.Gina Pera, authorIs It You, Me, or Adult A.D.D.?

Though the book may be intended for professionals, the setup of the book is very ADD Friendly and the language is easy to understand.I think reading this book will be very benefical to women with AD/HD and family members of females with AD/HD. It may put females ahead of the game when they seek treatment for AD/HD. It may give them a better idea of whether the professional who is treating them acutally understands AD/HD.Females who are currently in treatment for AD/HD should consider asking the professional treating her if he or she has read this book.

It was a total eye-opener."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"As a newcomer to literature (which now covers 2+ decades) on the history of immigrant border crossing between Mexico and Arizona, I found Urrea's account of the perils of the Devil's Highway absolutely spellbinding.Though some have suggested that Urrea's Latino origin tends to bias this nonfiction account in favor of the immigrants, it was easy for me to look past in search of a better understanding of the human condition this unforgivable stretch of Arizona desert land succumbs its prisoners to.The story of immigration, from its modern day mob bosses to its sleaze coyotes, all the way down to those who search a better life across the border, based on rumor or faith, is a fascinating one. You can't help but be drawn in by Urrea's writing and the plight of not just the immigrants, but the Border Patrol, who risk their lives daily in the name of justice.Take the few hours required to read this book. No matter your position on immigration, you at least deserve to be informed of the who, how, and why of those that cross the Mexico/US border each day."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This book details the fascinating story of twenty-six men, who left their country in search of a better life. However, between their nation and the United States lay a desert wasteland; a stretch of earth so barren and unforgiving it has earned the title The Devil's Highway.In the spring of 2001, these men, most of whom were family men with jobs that simply didn't pay enough to make ends meet, obtained loans from men who capitalize on human suffering and trafficking. One of them was Don Moi Garcia, who operated in Veracruz. Garcia had contacts with a number of men who knew the land between Mexico and the States. Because of the rugged nature of leading a group of people through the desert, these guides, or guias, are often referred to as \\"coyotes\\".Antonio Lopez Ramos was the guia for this infamous trek. The Guadalajara native had made the trip many times before, but never in this particular region and without the aid of another guide who knew the land. This is the first factor that seals the fate of the men as they head for the great north.Urrea writes in a style that gives us enough detail without drowning the reader in details. His opening chapter reads as a \\"day in the life\\" account of Border Patrol (BP) agents. A later chapter introduces the reader to the Mexican walkers, giving us a brief glimpse into the life of each man. These overtures are fair on all accounts. There is even a bit of humor in some of the anecdotes told by the agents of the BP.I was most fascinated with the techniques used by the BP to catch the walkers. One is the practice of smoothing the sand. Every few days an agent chains a drag - a bundle of car tires attached to a frame - to his truck and runs it across the desert floor. These lines run east to west since the walkers are heading north. Not to be outdone, some of the walkers have taken to taping Styrofoam to the soles of their shoes so as not to leave footprints. Apparently, this tactic often fails as the foam wears out over the long miles, leaving strange marks on the ground.The account of those fated days in the desert wouldn't be complete without some graphic detail of what the men tried to do to survive and an account of pitiful condition under which some of them were found. It's not pretty, but it's a part of the story that has to be told. The author doesn't belabor on these details needlessly though.In sum, The Devil's Highway is a solid book that will appeal to many readers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Urrea employs great writing skills and techniques to tell the story of a group of Mexican immigrants who get lost in a trek from Mexico to the United States in search of a better life. The details of their journey are gruesome and described with terrifying clarity. This book is not for the faint of heart. But it reads like a good novel.Each character is well described; Urrea masterfully paints a human face on the victims we so easily ignore. The victims are not limited to the pollos. Even border patrol agents suffer trying to implement our nation's ill-conceived policies on the front lines of this war. Right and wrong get discarded and all participants are left in an insane struggle for survival.This book should be a wake-up call to those who write immigration policies in this country. And to those who foolishly think we can isolate ourselves from the rest of the world and its problems.We are all in this together."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"&quot;Mr. President, tear down this wall.&quot;Some day, perhaps, an American president will have the courage -- or a Mexican president will have the honesty -- to go to the wall between Mexico and United States and demand its removal in the name of freedom.Until then, the Sonoran Desert will continue to be the site for hundreds of unbelievably agonizing deaths every year. Within the last 10 years, more people have died here than those who tried to cross the Berlin Wall. Until then, as Urrea makes abundantly clear, Mexicans will continue to create networks that in a few years will be the great criminal syndicates of the United States and Mexico.It's happened before. Prohibition was a great &quot;holier than thou&quot; movement, and it generated many vicious criminals. It took the courage of President Franklin Roosevelt to end its rampant hypocrisy. Some day, if Americans ever elect another president with the courage of Roosevelt, a border solution will be found.It's agonizing to be slowly baked to death in the sun. Thousands of desperate people risk it every year; this book tell of 14 who didn't make it in May 2001. The reporting is excellent, the writing is superb. Don't read it unless you have a strong stomach; the deaths of &quot;Los illegales&quot; and the pure greed of Mexicans who recruit and deliver then to the US is a gruesome story. (Keep in mind, this is also a major route for deadly drugs.)It took a man from Chicago to write this book. Few in Arizona, where people hire illegals with the casual unconcern of buying a drive-through taco, care about the human cost. Arizona cities actually run drive-by labour centers to facilitate the hiring of illegals by homeowners and business people. The media generally ignores desert deaths unless it is groups of a dozen or more; &quot;big&quot; news in Arizona is the opening of a new shopping center or the latest exploits of a Britney Spears.But then, who ever wrote a book exposing rum runners?John Steinbeck immortalized Okies in 'The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; but they had a cakewalk compared to what Mexicans now risk to get low wage US jobs. Urrea has done a superb job citing facts about one of the world's deadliest border crossings; read this book, and you'll cry in sorrow and rage at what people endure to reach the US.I've hiked the area where these men died; three hours without water, even in the cool (only 85 degrees F) winter, is enough to produce the first signs of dehydration. It's a tough, unforgiving, brutal land. Mistakes are seldom forgiven. Few, if any, Arizona writers know the desert well enough to describe it as accurately as Urrea. For most Arizonans, illegal aliens -- like federal spending -- makes their state cheap, easy and lazy.It took a man from &quot;the city of big shoulders&quot; to write this book. As you read it, keep in mind that a child or grandchild of any one of these migrants could well become another Urrea (provided they get out of Arizona). It's what America is all about, and it is why people will literally &quot;walk through Hell&quot; for days on end, even when they know the only job they'll ever get is scrubbing toilets.Read it, and you'll scream in anger, rage, sorrow and frustration. Of course, if you're from Arizona, where chain gangs are still policy and jail inmates are housed in surplus army tents during summers which easily reach 115 degrees, your only reaction will be, &quot;So what? That's the penalty for breaking the law.&quot;Maybe it's time to reconsider the Gadsden Purchase.Read it. This book will shake anyone's conscience.Read it. Learn what courage and greed mean in today's world."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"After reading this book you will watch illegals crossing the border on the nightly news with a much deeper understanding. The author follows both the immigrants and the border patrol and does his best to give the most accurate and balanced view possible. A very good story and one that you will never forget."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is a factual book that reads like a novel. Once you start, you will not be able to sleep or eat or-- well, you may have to take a break for some essentials-- but you will have a hard time putting it down for anything. The writing is excellent and the information presented is timely and provocative. What is really impressive is how he shows all sides of the story. This is not another diatribe against the heartless gringos who force immigrants to die in the desert. He makes clear Mexico's blame for putting people on the &quot;devil's highway&quot; through corruption and stupid politics. But he also shows how misguided U-S policy has been and he reveals enough about the victims to make you truly mourn for them."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Urrea has an undeniable gift. And it is on full display here in his book that *nearly* won a Pulitzer for journalism. The most amazing thing about this book is the fact that Urrea manages to remain objective in the face of unspeakable horrors as he unearths the stories of the men involved in this fatal desert crossing. Where most writers may have been tempted to judge his subjects (most certainly the Coyotes and the Border Patrol agents), Urrea lets these men's actions speak for themselves, and the result is that we realize all of these people involved in this botched immigration attempt are people like us: they want to make a buck, they want a better life for themselves, and they want to just survive the difficulties of being alive in this tumultuous time. It's an even more timely book considering the SB1070 law in Arizona, as well as the national movement to repeal the 14th Amendment and lock up our borders once and for all.Other than the fact that--oddly--the phrase \\"plying their trade\\" comes up a few too many times, the book is nearly flawless. The prose is gorgeous, even in times of sheer unspeakable tragedies (as in the moments when the men are being found, one by one, along the path they took). The manner in which Urrea unpacks the stories of all the players involved is a feat unto itself. It's obvious that Urrea took his work seriously, and he should be commended for a work that is simply stunning in its honesty, heartbreaking in its depictions of human frailty and desperation, and moving in his ability to let the story unravel patiently. I loved the book and cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The conflict of the story is there are 26 Mexicans from different parts of Mexico that cross the boarder illegally. They cross the boarder into a desert they call hell. The desert is the Sonoran desert and is part of southern Arizona. In this desert there is no water also there are deadly animals and spirits. Some are left behind waiting for the return of others.I liked the book because its real and I could never picture myself going threw the desert with no food or water. I also liked the book because it described the surrounding and face to face things in that Arizona desert. I didn't like it because it made me think about people starving in the desert. I would recommend this book to people that like reading long stories. I also recommend this to people that like the setting of a harsh place."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I had to read this at University and it was terrifically entertaining.

It is life-altering, mind changing, perhaps life saving.I never imagined what a horrible world these migrants go through. I'd always assumed Mexican crossing was one guy trying to cross the Rio Grande, getting caught and &quot;oh, well, better luck tomorrow! &quot; NO! This is life and death!Urrea did such a wonderful job of bringing this issue up front.He discusses the politics/economics behind the crossing on both sides and doesn't place blame on any one group.We are ALL guilty here!I felt the heat, often wanting a glass of water while reading, and wanted to hug every Mexican I saw after reading this book.Like the quote on the back of the book says&quot; EVERYONE should read this book!&quot;."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I knew the story would be gut-wrenching: 26 illegals walked into the Arizona desert in mid-May. Less than 4 days later, 12 would be found alive. What was their story? Who were these men, and what drove them to undertake such a devastating journey? And what sort of evil would even conceive of taking them there?Mr. Urrea sets up the book in 4 parts, and unfortunately, the story of the Yuma 14 (or Wellton 26) doesn't really begin until part 3. Now, some of this is to be understood: Mr. Urrea does give some history to the region, which I didn't know that much about. But he seemed to go off on tangents quite frequently, and weaved in and out, until I wasn't quite sure how the information being relayed pertained to the story at hand. It was more than confusing at times.The story of the Yuma 14/Wellton 26 actually is told fairly quickly, in relation to the rest of the book. It seems Mr. Urrea really wanted to write about the politics of the Mexican/American border, and used the guise of this story to draw more people to it. That would have been fine with me, had Mr. Urrea at least been unbiased in his reporting. He was quick to lay blame on the men funding the coyotes, the Border Patrol, the Immigration Policy of America, American talk radio, American conservatives - however, he leaves out any mention of Mexico's part in all of this. What's up with that?At the conclusion of the book, Mr. Urrea (who informs us this isn't about numbers) gives the readers nothing but numbers, which are heavily skewed to his bias. He states this is a story of the heart, but seems to forget (or ignore) that when an American citizen's Social Security Number, and therefore identity, has been stolen by an illegal immigrant, it can create a specific kind of hell. If one is going to report the facts, at least report ALL the facts!I was also appalled at the veiled, unsubstantiated allegations Mr. Urrea makes against the Border Patrol and \\"vigilante civilian border watcher groups\\" regarding rapes and murders. If Mr. Urrea wants to be taken seriously as a writer, he needs to back up his claims with facts (he seems to be able to find them when they suit his bias), or not pass off his work as \\"truth.\\" (And no, I'm not some \\"right-winger.\\" I just like honesty) And his animosity towards the Border Patrol was something I did not understand at all. Even though he ultimately presented the Border Patrol as compassionate and sympathetic, he was not hesitant to hold back mild disgust for an agency of men who do not set policy, but simply enforce it and sometimes put their lives on line while doing so.In the end, this book lost direction for me. For the story of the walkers: 5 stars. For way in which Mr. Urrea attempted browbeat his opinion into his reader: 1 star. Therefore: 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through. Not to make light of the level of human suffering the author was attempting to expose but I found it repetitive and exasperating. The author felt it necessary to wallow in the details and belabor the point by taking each individual involved and describe their role in the account or suffering separately and in meticulous detail. I wanted to shout at the author &#8220;I got it already&#8221; now get on with the story or as my daughter is fond of saying &#8220;WTMI&#8221; (Way too much information)"},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"If hell really existed, it would likely look like the Devil's Highway in southern Arizona - an area so harsh and unforgiving that even the Border Patrol is afraid to travel through it.In May 2001, 26 Mexican men attempted to cross the Mexican border after gifting the Coyotes - human smugglers - with just about every peso they have. And then their journey goes terribly wrong as a few missed turns and scorching conditions literally fry and mangle this woeful group. \\"They didn't carry enough water. Can there ever be enough water? Probably not. But the Popielas carried a couple of those little plastic twenty-ounce bottles with them, the kind you buy cold in the Coke cooler at the Circle K...\\"Luis Alberto Urrea writes so powerfully that there is a sense of immediacy and tragic intimacy in just about every paragraph. Take this opening paragraph: \\"Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass so sunstruck they didn't know their own names, couldn't remember where they'd come from, had forgotten how long they'd been lost. One of them was barefoot. They were burned nearly black, their lips huge and cracking, what paltry drool still available to them spuming from their mouths in a salty foam...They were drunk from having their brains baked in the pan, they were seeing God and devils, and they were dizzy from drinking their own urine...\\"Illegal immigration is an issue that has been used reductively - good versus evil - and Mr. Urrea refuses to fall into that trap. He is well aware that illegals make up 23 percent of unpaid bills in the Southwest's ER's and care centers for example, but this book is written to show Americans the face of the undocumented.In an aftermath, Mr. Urrea writes, \\"It was a chance to introduce Americans to the Border Patrol agent - a law enforcement officer who is disrespected, insulted, and demeaned by both the right and the left. Finally, it was a chance to reveal the complexities of the international crime syndicates that are now selling human flesh as if it were bags of marijuana.\\"The entire book rings with the authenticity of an eyewitness; it is obvious that Luis Alberto Urrea has done massive research into this tragedy. The richness of language, the empathy, the tragedy of the horrific trek through the Sonora is sometimes elevated to sheer poetry. It is an epic book that illuminates the nature of men at their most desperate and it will likely haunt my dreams. Devil's Highway was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. It is a tour de force."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Living near the border there's always talk of concern for the country with illegal immigrants crossing over.

That is an average profit of over 300 millions dollars. Which by the way they will not be able to claim. I must also say that this book is really heartbreaking. But the truth is told!

Urrea's style is both lyrical and brutally blunt as he combines poetic imagery with the stark realism of the damage the desert can do to an unprepared traveler in the course of mere hours. His approach is objective until the point when objectivity is impossible. He portrays all of the players in this ill-fated drama with an even hand--the Border Patrol agents, the walkers, the Coyotes, the Mexican gangsters who engineer (and profit from) the trips, the families left behind--and he leaves the inevitable conclusions to the reader. Although this book is no political diatribe, the story Urrea tells reveals the cruelty and the inhumanity behind current immigration policies and laws. And while there are no easy answers to the immigration dilemma, there are certainly ways to improve the sorry state of US immigration policy."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I'd heard about The Devil's Highway for years but just never seemed to get around to reading it until just the other day. Once I started, I found the story so gripping that I couldn't put it down until I finished in the wee hours of the morning.With this book, Luis Alberto Urrea masterfully weaves a tale that takes one central event, the gruesome deaths of 14 illegal aliens in the merciless, broiling desert sun, and builds for the reader around that event the stories of the principal and peripheral actors without whom those men would never have made their fateful journey north to seek a better life. Urrea's investigative and narrative prowess is such that the intrepid reader will digest and integrate into the main story the author's seeming digressions which some have found impertinent but which in fact are crucial to a deeper understanding of the borderlands, the desert, and what really happens to the hapless souls who enter it unprepared.Much like the English author Thomas Hardy, Urrea takes his time painting the reader a mental picture of not just the forbidding countryside but also engages in character building to the point that you feel that you know the protagonists and understand their motivations. And all this before he cuts to the chase. By the time the 26 men begin their fateful journey, you have an idea of who may make it and who won't.In my view, the book flows easily guided by Urrea's sharp, irreverent sense of humor and his astute observations. He is fair, but does at times show his anger at the system that creates the northward flow of the desperate. Special contempt is reserved for the criminal gangs trafficking in and abusing the poor souls who have often signed themselves up for years of servitude in order to go north.Not all readers will agree with the conclusions or opinions of some of those who are quoted, but The Devil's Highway is a brutal story that will give every reader a lot to think about. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I intended this book as free-time fodder in airport lounges and train compartments during a recent trip. As it happened, I didn't start reading it until last night--but once I started I couldn't put it down until I finished it this morning. It's a real page turner: both engrossing and heartbreaking.The thematic focus of the book is the infamous Yuma 14 incident, when 14 Mexican nationals died (while another 12 came close to dying) while being smuggled into the US across the Arizona border in early 2001. The book begins with a brief history of the geographical area around the so-called Devil's Highway desert crossing and the litany of death to which the landscape has laid claim since the mid-1500s. It then reports on the personal lives of the smugglers and their victims, trying to understand what motivated all of them to sign their various pacts with the devil. The bulk of the book recounts the tragic crossing itself and its aftermath, exploring along the way the various agencies, economics and politics implicated in the sad affair. It all makes for horrific, if fascinating reading.Unfortunately, the story itself fares much better than it's telling. Urrea did an admirable job researching the book, and the many tiny details he unearthed contribute to a suspense story that outpaces most suspense novels. But the pedestrian and often awkward prose really makes you appreciate the likes of Larry McMurtry and Jon Krakauer. Part of the appeal of \\"The Devil's Highway,\\" at least for me, was the geographical context of the tragic events it chronicles--the desolate deserts of the American West, at once beautiful and unmerciful. And no one brings those spaces to life as evocatively as McMurtry (unless it's Cormac McCarthy, whose writing is so stunning it demands its own category). I cite Kracauer as well because his work shows that engaging and effective prose is not to be found only among writers of fiction. Sadly, Urrea is no Kracauer, and certainly no McCarthy; he is a far better investigator than he is a writer. In fact, some of the book is so poorly written you wonder whether an editor was even involved.But if you're willing to wade through writing that's sometimes as sodden as desert sand after a rainstorm (and suffer through a good share of untranslated Spanish to boot), then this book is a stunner."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Jonathan Miles of MEN'S JOURNAL wrote this of Urrea's sublime tribute to the immigrant's journey, \\"A tour de force account of an adventure unlike the ones you're used to reading.\\" And it's true. What makes THE DEVIL'S HIGHWAY shine is Urrea's ability to lend his novelist's eye to a story more true than most of us would like to imagine. For whatever side you hold in the Border debate, Urrea will make you believe in the people who walk. Even if he doesn't pull you toward empathy for those taking this journey, he will at least illuminate for you what happens to a group of men who feel like crossing the infamous Devil's Highway is the only option. From their first step into the desert to their rescue just short of the U.S. border, you will not want to put this book down. Urrea takes the magnifying glass that is the Border Control Issue and focuses that hot sun down to a small group later called the Wellton 26. Literally. Every step through this Pulitzer Prized Finalist will force you onto the desert with these men : walking with these men, following with these men, thirsting with these men, and dying with these men. Urrea has made me want to keep going. Luckily, in the rear of the book, he's given me more with suggested readings to further my lusty desire to ingest all I can about this issue."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I've read several books by this author. This book was unique for him, but the research he did was excellent, and the writing was easy to read.A story about a group of migrants in the Arizona desert who are overcome by heat. Many died. But the author did extensive research in telling the story and conducted interviews with people involved in the story on both sides of the border. It is well written, detail oriented, easy to read and opinionated.The book also touches on the subject of why these people put their lives on the line to seek a better life. It's a touching heart-wrenching story about those less fortunate struggling to make a better life."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"A horizontal version of \\"Into Thin Air\\". Only a little warmer.Urrea tries to explain what the illegal journey across the border of the US and Mexico might be like, but he wasn't there, so it falls flat in the \\"experience\\" column. There are some testimonies from survivors of the trip. It's pretty gruesome, and if you like gruesome, read the book. It's an easy-to-understand page-turner.I'd be hard pressed to call it \\"a story of human will and survival\\"...the survivors were just plain lucky. The Devil's Highway is one mean place that takes on an unwelcoming character, thanks to the author. Good job there.Urrea also makes a good effort at mapping out the network of individuals needed to make this journey happen, and that it's a business of humans-as-commodities. Doesn't focus on the impact on the US other than the Border Patrol's role in \\"picking up the garbage\\". This doesn't affect the book's storyline. It's not intended to go that deep, and the narrowness of the \\"supply\\" of Mexicans reaching their destination (read, delivery point), makes the story all that more viscious. You wonder what's next for the journeymen.Yet another story of greed preying on the desperate. Only this time in a hostile climate. Scary thing is it's probably happening again as I write this."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I live in southern AZ and checked this book out because I was curious to see what the rest of the U.S. and world is reading about this desolate land. I have had numerous interactions with \\"undocumented\\" crossers as well as many people in our daily world who are Border Patrol/ICE, etc. It is a way of life here. My take on this book is that the author chose this sad incident to illustrate his personal views on the border situation. It is not representative of most crossings. People cross all day, every day, and rarely is there news attention like there was for this ill-fated group. Of course it is nasty conditions that they are crossing and of course people do die, but this tragic tale is romanticized so that the average reader (without firsthand knowledge) is led to believe that it is representative of ALL crossers and their travel experiences.I suspected that the author was biased toward the immigrants and against the \\"pinche migra\\" early on, and my suspicions were confirmed when at the end of the book there is a QandA section where he is asked point blank about bias, and answers in the affirmative. So the reviewers who praise him for being unbiased, I can only assume have a bias of their own that agrees with his. In the QandA section he reveals his own surprise at having befriended one or two B.P. agents. What I found disturbing is that no one in this book is really portrayed favorably. He romanticizes the lives of the dead and yet gives them no real credit for being intelligent people. A gang boss drives into town and cons them into the long, expensive journey in three sentences. While he mentioned \\"feeding their families\\" as one of the reasons people cross, there are no examples of people in this group who really were in hard times. They wanted to buy more toys for their ever-growing number of kids, add on a room to their mother's house, etc. Not exactly life and death forcing them to cross the desert. He also leaves out the example of the convicted criminals (perhaps there were conveniently none in this group?). I worry every day about my children playing outside when there are convicted felons walking though the hills, and sometimes hiding in vacant houses, nearby. I'm not saying all of them are, of course, but he neglects to mention a single example of criminal records being a major reason why people choose to risk their lives to cross, rather than apply for a work/student/shopping visa. I see Sonora plates at our shopping center every day. You don't have to be a citizen to come here for the weekend. But you can't have a criminal record. The B.P. is portrayed as giant Aryan soldiers who are hated by all. And the gangsters/coyotes got mixed up in a world they didn't understand. I think the author believes the world to be full of idiots; those in the story and the rest of us reading about it.I also find it interesting that one of the statistics the author uses to illustrate the \\"undeserved American bias\\" toward immigrants is one study stating that there would be a surplus of jobs by 2008 (obviously stated before 2008) and in fact unemployment was at record highs and I have many friends and neighbors who could not find even the simplest job (that Americans supposedly won't do). I can only assume that employers saw their work history and worried that they would not stick around for a low paying job, therefore they got no job at all.I would have liked to see a true to life portrayal of the border, rather than this romanticized version, but it was interesting none the less."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"i had high hopes for this book. unfortunately, what started out so beautifully and lyrically written along the lines of a garcia-marquez quickly deteriorated into a mess. terrible writing style, disjointed, fractured, pointless drivel at times. this story has already been told many times in print and movie (the 3 burials of melquiades estrada)...it was obvious early on that the author is trying to push his agenda on the reader but forgot that to get someones attention you have to drive the point home with lucid, poignant, vivid narrative. the factoids in the end were downright nauseating. that map was pitiful for following the journey and setting. the characters without pictures of some type or tangible connection to their familes fell flat. very disappointing and wonder where the 5 stars come from...???!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This story about the 26 men who attempted to cross The Devil's Highway, a section of the Arizona desert, in early 2001 should be required reading for any politician attempting to repeal the 14th amendment. This non-linear narrative explores the various reasons people choose to come across - from those in need of a job, to those who are trying to make a quick buck, each has a story to tell. This is a worthy addition the the discussion. It places blame equally on the US and Mexican governments, greed, poverty, ignorance, and coyotes, among others."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is the true story of a group of needy Mexican men who decide to cross the U.S. border in order to earn more money to help their families. It is also the story of the people who trick these needy people, steal their money, and lead them to death, or close to death. It is also the story of the men and women who patrol the Mexico-United States border, and provided me with a much greater understanding of how they feel about the people who try to cross the border.Urrea's writing is very descriptive. He researched this story very well, and gives the reader the kind of details that help you feel the hopelessness of this march in the desert. He describes, in great detail, what the body goes through when it is deprived of food, shelter, and water in a scorching, hostile environment.As the reader gets to know the \\"coyotes\\" (the people who are paid, very little, to lead Mexicans into the U.S.), and the \\"wets\\" (the Mexicans who try to enter), you find yourself rooting for these poor souls who gave up so much...so that their families would be better off.Anyone who wants to understand the Mexico-U.S. border should get this book. It is heartbreaking, but beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"As a person who lived and worked in Mexico for 2 years, I have seen the poverty first hand.

The author Luis Alberto Ubrea is an excellent writer. This was an excellent e-book, and very well written. I will buy and read another e-book from this author. Unfortunately it is a brutal true story about the unsuspecting Mexican citizen illegal immigration north to the United Sates. It is extremely eye opening to the size of this enormous problem. Minor formatting with spacing issues with some of the words but not enough to distract me from enjoying the e-book. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I reside in Texas and have personal knowledge of the immigration situation from a different view than that reflected in the book. It very much humanizes this situation and makes one aware that these are real people with families and a history."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is an amazing work of immersive and investigative journalism--crossed with poetry, for the physical descriptions of the desert and of the illegals' sufferings are stunning. Truly inspired, this book is the product of great insight and work. It reads like a novel but is thoroughly documented. The author earns his imaginative flights but largely writes from the point of view of the Border Patrol and of the lost and dying illegals. The research and work are palpable, but so too is the author's deeply informed perspective. This book really conveys what it's like to try to enter the U.S. illegally from Mexico through the prism of one extreme and tragic incident.Whatever side you stand on in the border wars, this book's insight and compassion for all sides, illegal Mexicans and Border Patrol officers, make it required reading."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"We read this book for our book club a few years ago and everyone was deeply moved by it. My son now has to read it for his high school Language Arts class so I am reading it again. The insight that this author has to the challenges, grief, and sadness to make it from Mexico to this country is daunting, to say the least. The book moves along like a novel until you remember, oh wow, this is NONfiction! I highly suggest this book!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I really enjoyed the book.

It made for some very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The Devil's HighwayByLuis Alberto Urrea\\"The Devil's Highway\\" by Luis Alberto Urrea is the true story of 26 Mexicans crossing the United States border in Arizona illegally. This happened in 2001 and 14 of the 26 died during the attempt.In the late 1990's the border patrol clamped down on illegal immigration in Arizona, California and Texas. The migratory traffic was funneled to much more remote areas; one of these areas is the \\"Cabeza Preta National Wildlife Refuge\\" in Arizona. Within the refuge is what is known as \\"The Devil's Highway\\", a desolate route that has been claiming lives since the 1500's. The refuge is almost 900,000 acres (about 1,406 square miles) and is composed of desert, mountains and 110+ degree temperatures. The most common cause of death is to be \\"cooked\\" by the extreme heat.Mexicans yearning for a better life or, simply the wish to earn enough money to house their families (and many other reasons) are recruited by organized crime, charged money, loaned money and put together with \\"coyotes\\" who are supposed to guide them across the border. The coyotes are other Mexicans in search of a better living who will guide migrants across the border for so much per head. In organized crime hierarchies, coyotes are sort of \\"middle management\\".That's the plan; however, it doesn't always work out.Mr. Urrea tells this story through the eyes of the migrants, coyotes and the border patrol. He does this with an amazing ability to relate the events graphically without demonstrating a political bias (an amazing feat considering the sensitivity of the issue and his Mexican heritage), however, does demonstrate the broken immigration systems on both sides of the border despite the best intentions of those migrants and the border patrol.Mr. Urrea also explains the economic impacts (bottom line) to Arizona and Mexico from \\"illegal aliens\\". Arizona profits approximately $8 billion annually from these migrants, while Mexico profits approximately $5.5 billion annually. Please note, that is just for the State of Arizona. Interesting. Mr. Urrea provides the breakdown.Whatever your views may be of this salient issue, it will be hard for you or your views not to be affected or reinforced by this book. Mr. Urrea's own views may be determined by the dedication of this fine book, \\"For the dead, and for those who rescue the living\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I just want to add my voice in recommending this book. As others have said, Urrea writes like a lyricists and masterfuly alternates plain exposition with poetry to tell us the saga of 26 (more or less, nobody is sure of the exact number) men who made their way from Mexico in search of work and found death and disolation instead. The book indeed reads like a novel, a pageturner (I read it in about a day, I couldn't put it down), but it never allows you to forget that it is a real story, that those people dying in the sun are human beings, and that others - whose names and faces we'll never know - are following in their steps and dying their own desert deaths."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Isn't an illegal immigrant, by definition, a criminal? Until that definition changes, I would answer in the affirmative.And, while I found Mr. Urrea's not so subtle plea for open borders entertaining, I find it hard to muster sympathy for criminals who knowingly and willingly embark on a dangerous enterprise. I mean, if it was easy, would there be anyone other than Carlos Slim Helu left in Mexico? What about the hapless masses who attempt to immigrate legally?O.K., I do not possess the traits of the heartless, John Birch Society member that you might ascribe to me. I do, however, find Mr. Urrea's tone to be semi-offensive. Why should our nation receive a black eye for protecting it's borders, while Mexican politicians assert that they've succeeded in their mission by inserting 12 million illegals into our society?The specific circumstances of the Yuma 14 are, of course, tragic. But the incident is an outlier that has been seized upon in an attempt to make heroes out of criminals, gin up the sympathies of the US electorate, and ultimately alter our immigration policy. Who knows, maybe those are good things, but somehow I doubt it."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This story of the Yuma 14 had the potential to be one helluva of a story, as it does read as though it is fictitious. The fact that it's true is the driving force behind the story, only to be marred by the author's sloppy and at time irreverent writing style. He uses repetition of words and phrases in extremis, and he for some reason feels compelled to stick one-liners at the close of all his sections. The material is interesting enough without the reader having to be bludgeoned by tongue-in-cheek punchline passages. It really got annoying and detracted from the larger story of struggle."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"One reviewer described author's Luis Alberto Urrea's style in this book as &quot;...controlled, righteous rage&quot;.This is an apt description. Urrea is fair-minded and searching in his appraisal of the tragedy which beset a group of 26 men in the Sonora Desert in May 2001 most of whom were from Vera Cruz and Guerrero. While remaining suspcicious of American and Mexican immigration policies and the border officers who apply them, he nonetheless does not fall into kneejerk stereotyping. They, like most who work in or for government bodies, are caught between festering popular political rage, skewed immigration policies and the reality of the people's lives with whom they must contend each day. In Urrea's depiction many of the border officials are far more humane than those political or economic actors who are responsible for designing the policies in the first place.Urrea's true rage is unleashed towards the conclusion at the international economic actors and the forces they unleash, political leaders for whom immigration is simply another issue to score cheap political points and univocal America firsters and their ilk who fail to comprehend the depths of the problem. Measuring the tragedy of human lives lost in mere dollars (and inaccurate figures on top of that!) is profane in the true sense of that word.Reading &quot;The Devil's Highway&quot; only leads me to support responsible efforts to find common ground on institutional levels which lead to the demise of &quot;the border&quot; as a meaningful political entity."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The book did not deal with what I thought it would. A little boring to read. It was very repetitive in chapters."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is the story of the desert passage illegal immigrants make between Mexico and the U.S. Many die en route because of lack of water and the heat. More specifically, it is the story of the Yuma 14, when fourteen men from one group died in 2001.There were parts of this book, especially at the end, where it was painful to read. Mr. Urrea described the final hours of the dead in vivid, personal detail. One description particularly stands out for its horrific sadness. A survivor reported: \\"One of the boys went crazy and started jumping up and down. He started screaming, 'Mama! Mama! I don't want to die!' He ran up to a big cactus and started smashing his face against it. I don't know what his name was.\\" The boy was 16 years old.About another who died, Mr. Urrea wrote: \\"Nobody knows the name of the man who took off all his clothes. It was madness, surely. He removed his slacks, folded them, and put them on the ground. Then he took off his underwear, laid it neatly on the pants. He removed his shirt and undershirt and squared them away with the pants. As if he didn't want to leave a mess. ...He lay on his back and stared into the sun until he died.\\"I like how Mr. Urrea spoke for the dead as they rode in their body bags in the air-conditioned hearses.Mr. Urrea's description of the Border Patrol's activities seemed nuanced and even-handed to me. He offers thoughtful notes in the last chapter regarding the financial costs and benefits of illegal immigrants, of other violences perpetrated in and around the desert border.It's difficult to describe Mr. Urrea's writing style other than to say it is personal, often in second person narrative. His portrayal of almost all of the players in the illegal immigrant universe is empathetic. Exceptions are the drug gangsters and the coyotes they run, plus certain aspects of the Mexican government machine.Whatever one's position on illegal immigration, this book forces the reader to acknowledge the immigrants' humanity. At least for a day or two."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The story humanely chronicles the true story of a group's fatal search for a better life, ending in the Arizona desert. While describing the stages of hyperthermia in awesome detail, providing a survival guide for desert hikers, it also provides a profound understanding of the complex relationship between emigrants and the border patrol. The journey proves not to have been made in vain but with the development of vital safeguards to prevent tragic recurrences. The book offers a highly commendable entry point into the immigration debate in the Americas."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Ahhh, such a good book!!! Full disclosure though, in my work I serve low income clients, a large percentage of whom are immigrants and refugees. This of course includes people who crossed the Southern Border illegally. Now when one of my clients exclaims, \\"I almost died when I crossed the border,\\" I have a much clearer understanding of what he/she means.The narrative style of Urrea is entertaining and the details of the story itself kept me from wanting to put the book down. I cried. I worried over father and son. I had nightmares after one night's read. The aspect that I most appreciated, however, was the fact the Urrea made no one a complete a**hole or complete angel (well, maybe Rita Vargas was complete Angel). Everyone was a multi-faceted human being. The people crossing the border are simply trying to make a life for their families. The border patrol agents are simply doing their jobs trying to protect the border. Sometimes they can be jerks (the root of the word \\"tonk\\") and sometimes they can be heroes (the rescue effort described in great detail would make any American proud).Everyone should read this book; it could help temper prejudices on all sides."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The Devil's Highway is a stirring story of twenty-six men who crossed the Mexican border into the harsh Devil's Highway of Southern Arizona. Through Urrea's in-depth investigative work, the reader is able to enter into the deadly, desolate region where only twelve men were able to make it out alive after being abandoned by their coyotes. Urrea's work is a well-crafted combination of interviews and 'rst-person testimony, history, culture, and immigration policy. The Devil's Highway was a 'nalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for general non'ction. This is an excellent book for use in a high school classroom and would allow students an opportunity to closely examine illegal immigration."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The Devil's Highway is a harsh, but relatively even-handed account of a dark chapter in US-Mexico history - the death of fourteen Mexicans trying to make their way on foot through the Arizona desert in an attempt to immigrate illegally into the U.S. So many grueling deaths would seem like a prime subject for blame assignment, but Urrea's reportorial approach attempts to tell all sides of the story. The immigrants are for the most part well-meaning providers trying to make a better life for their impoverished families in Mexico. The Border Patrol on both sides (especially the U.S) make a sincere effort to enforce its nations laws while respecting the lives of those who try to cause. Even the coyotes, young Mexicans who lead the crossings, are portrayed more as incompetent guides than murderous exploiters. This last sobriquet probably fits best on the bosses who organize the trade and hire the coyotes. To them, the immigrants are primarily sources of revenue, and once fees are collected from them the immigrants' lives are of little consequence. Policies of both the U.S. and Mexican government regarding immigration and economic policy don't come off much better.Through much of the narrative, The Devil's Highway is about as grim as Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic The Road (Oprah's Book Club), and even scarier when you realize that the events happened in real life as opposed to the author's imagination. Now almost 10 years old, the book can still serve as a cautionary tale about policies that fail to respect human life.
