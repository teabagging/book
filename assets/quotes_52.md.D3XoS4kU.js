You may even find it offensive.The book is entirely founded on literal, Biblical standards with two parts: The Biblical family and Biblical child training.In the first part the author outlines in detail God's design for the family. He includes the headship order, the role of the father, the wife and children. There is a chapter on serving together as a family. Although the author points out in the introduction that \\"this section is not intended to be an in depth study on the husband wife relationship. (There are presently many fine books written on this subject.) Rather the principles important to laying a proper foundation in the home that are vital to the successful training of happy and obedient children are covered.\\"The second part focuses on the author's four part training box: Love, discipline, teaching and example. The author also comments on this section \\"no one chapter in this section is the key to training happy and obedient children. The chapters must be taken as a whole.\\"In Love he highlights the biblical love and natural love that is needed by children. Discipline part one goes over the when and why a child needs discipline. Discipline part two discusses the how and where a child should receive discipline. He uses Bible verses literally in reference to spanking and gives the reasoning behind it. The teaching chapter encourages parents to have formal and spontaneous teaching from the Bible. Lastly, he illustrates the vital role parents have as Biblical examples to their children.For someone looking to shape their family after the literal design from the Bible this book gives clear, understandable instruction."},{"Title":"How to Be the Parents of Happy And Obedient Children","review":"This is NOT \\"another whipping book\\". It was and still is the best book on training children that we ever read. Spanking is not meant to be the focus of this book. If the readers would balance the 4 sides of the training box, which are LOVE, TRAINING, EXAMPLE, and then DISCIPLINE, they would find that the \\"whipping\\" (which is really spanking administered only when called for and administered in a loving, godly way) is very rarely necessary. Our children were, and now our grandchildren are being raised on the principles of this book, which, by the way, are the principles of the Bible. We never seem to go anyhwere that some stranger doesn't comment on what sweet, well-behaved children we have.This book taught us the importance of loving and training our children and to be consistent, fair, and timely with discipline. So, after being taught what behavior was expected from them, seeing us model that behavior, and loving them in a way that caused them to always feel secure, they received necessary discipline and were and are truly \\"happy and obedient children\\".If used properly, the training methods in this book will cause you to realize what a gift your children are and allow you to enjoy them every day.

The brain is not a fully developed organ at birth and the synapsis between the neurons, the brain cells, are built mostly during the first 4 years of life. As the human brain is a use dependent organ that learns through experiences, violence and fear do terrible damage to a child's developing brain brain and a human being's potential.If the beating of small children remains allowed, we must face the fact that most people will continue to live with lesions in their brains, creating violence, chaos, terrorism and a mad society, unable to make healthy decisions. Bruce Perry and Martin Teicher have written much about their discoveries and research and are spreading this scientific knowledge. Nobody can today can ignore these facts and recommend barbaric, inhuman and devastating violence to \\"raise\\" children. The truth is, their chances to become healthy and well-developed human beings will be greatly affected and diminshed as they learn violence as their parents' tool against them. The truth is also that every time an adult strikes a child, trust is betrayed, the child's well-being, health and safety are not protected and cared for -- and even his/her life is being put in danger."},{"Title":"How to Be the Parents of Happy And Obedient Children","review":"This book should be titled \\"How to Be the Parents of Sad and Messed-Up Children\\".

What went wrong with this author in his child hood? The author is manipulating the Holy Bible to give support for his sick child abuse and own dysfunctional childhood. Child abuse is NOT a way of raising children, and certainly NOT what God wants. Nowhere in the Bible does it say to strike a child! Children are God's gift.

She meant well and truly cared about me. She didn't raise her voice at me or spank me \\"in anger.\\" However, I was spanked with a dowel rod for every infraction, including refusing to hug after a spanking. No \\"disrespect\\" was tolerated which meant I had very little avenue for the expression of negative emotions except stuffing them down. This back-fired when I became violent towards other children for a time around age ten and as a teenager when I had episodes where I would violently hit myself and destroy any possession I cared about that was breakable.Because of the emphasis on perfection and because of the constant drumming into my head that all the spanking was out of love and done for my own good I believed I had an idyllic childhood and a mother worthy of sainthood and that my depression was all my own fault for not being \\"cheerful\\" enough. When I had children things just got worse. I didn't want to spank them but I had been trained that if I didn't I was disobeying God and I didn't love them. I did not spank as early, as hard or as often as I had been spanked but I felt horrible inside when I did spank. I found myself getting unreasonably angry with my children when they disobeyed because I dreaded \\"having\\" to give them a spanking. Finally, I found help for a different way of parenting at a website for gentle Christian mothers. My children and I still have a ways to go in healing our relationship but we have already come so far. It has amazed me how much I learn about them and how much more I can help them when I take the time to look for the WHY of their behavior instead of masking the problem with a spanking.People often use the argument that spanking doesn't work. I haven't found that to be true. Consistent spanking does work in the short term if your goal is a smiling little copy of yourself who does everything you say and who doesn't know how to say no to anyone who plays the authority card. Long term, it leads to depression, anger, fear, lack of personal boundaries, and if healing is not sought, violence.I know this review is very personal but this book is seeking to influence people's lives in a very personal way. I want readers to see the dark side of the spanking fairy tale. There is no magic formula for parenting. It's about love, persistence, empathy, boundaries and admitting mistakes.If you are considering raising your children by this book please look into their little eyes and commit to breaking the cycle of violence. If you were raised this way, please get help and healing so that you don't pass on the violence to others.This book may raise obedient children but it doesn't raise happy ones."},{"Title":"How to Be the Parents of Happy And Obedient Children","review":"This book teaches what 99% of Christian parents don't bother to learn: Biblical discipline and respect for children and adults. Spanking is mandated in the Bible but without proper reconcilation with the Lord and the child's parents, spanking is simply child abuse. This book helps distinguish between abuse and spanking and what parents should consider important and Biblical when deciding on how to raise their children. My husband and I are giving the books to our parents so that they understand what we're trying to do. I highly recommend this to parents who are interested in what the Lord has to say about childrearing. The principles in this book are all pulled from the Bible."},{"Title":"How to Be the Parents of Happy And Obedient Children","review":"We were given this book over 20 years ago when our children were very young. While most of the reviews focus on the spanking and discipline sections of the book, the parts that I remember are the ones that focused on the behavior and attitude of the father as one who must relate to his children in a Christ-like fashion, not provoking his children, but raising them to revere, trust and obey Christ. As a young father, I had barely a clue how to raise my two children. I am the first to admit I was far from perfect, but the principles that I found in this book helped to fashion my behavior and attitudes toward my children. I can count on one hand the times that I spanked my children - combined. It was never done out of anger, for childish behavior, etc., but only for persistent willful disobedience. One must know his/her children; their \\"bent\\", their personality, their individual nature. One must be as Christ to his/her children - children are ultimately responsible to God for their behavior. God will hold me responsible for how I treated my children. If that treatment included inappropriate discipline, I will be held responsible for that.

I don't agree with all the points in this book but I think parents today have one main problem: They are scared of their kids. There is an epidemic of bratty, disrespectful children. It is in part to guilty parents who work and don't want to spend the time they do have disciplining their children. Most parents don't know what to do so they don't do anything. We often see these kids in the stores screaming (and usually getting) to get what they desire. I have heard just as many parents lose control of themselves as their children. They start by saying \\"no\\", then yell \\"no\\", they threaten the kids then just give them what they want so they will shut up. That is just as destructive to children as beating them. You teach them that they should get what they want, when they want and make a total brat out of them. I have found that whatever means of discipline you choose, you should be consistant. We use spanking for outright defiance and other reality type discipline for lesser offenses. If a child defiantly disobeys you, you must act or you lose the respect of your child."},{"Title":"How to Be the Parents of Happy And Obedient Children","review":"If your God really condones beating innocent babies and children who are only acting their age, this is the book for you!

This book is based on the same biblical misinterpretations that all the other child beaters in fundamentalist christianity, like Fugate, Pearl, and Tripp, so confidently and foolishly use to support their cases.My wife grew up in the horrors of the Independent Fundamental Baptist/Independent Fundamental Church circles. The effects and damage is nothing short of staggering. It was a regular occurrence at her church for children to be dragged out, begging for mercy, only to be savagely beaten by their parents, with dozens of lashes. The effects on the souls and bodies of my wife, Mrs. Fenimore, and other children is akin to the damage to Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bomb.Before some might accuse me of being a liberal or not knowing the bible, nothing could be further from the truth. I am a hardcore christian conservative who believes God's holy word, and does not consider a couple swats on the bottom to be child abuse. But what Lessin promotes is not spanking, but SEVERE BEATING! To also suggest that the bible MANDATES this type of treatment in order to bring up a child is nothing short of a ludicrous misinterpretation. Are we to cut of our child's limbs, gouge out their eyes, stone them, or grind them up in threshing wheels if we took certain passages the wrong way? HARDLY. Without the holy spirit and careful, correct interpretation of scripture, it can be used as a tool of evil, rather than the infallible, perfect word of God that it is meant to be.Fundamentalists are so big on being saved by God's mercy and grace alone.

It helps one to understand that there really is a purpose to our life on earth!"},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"I got this because I was curious what co-author Joe Fisher had to say after I read that he went on to commit suicide by hurling himself from a cliff, and also to see what may happen after death, if there should happen to be some kind of afterlife. However, I was disappointed as this book consists of 100 pages of pro-reincarnation propaganda followed by 6 \\"Karmic Case Studies\\" and a guide to visiting the \\"Akashic Records\\". With regard to the \\"between life\\" state, all that would appear to happen is boring stuff like some nice music and nice lights followed by an interview with a panel of 3 characters who review your life before telling you to go back for another incarnation with fresh Karmic lessons to learn.Anyway, this book convinced me that the theory of reincarnation is an absolute joke. For starters, all the \\"past lives\\" experienced by those mentioned in this book were lived on Earth. A simple glance into the night sky might hint as to the vast number of stars there are. I would expect, just occasionally, that someone would have had a past-life on a different planet, but no. I've now started to read Joe Fisher's Siren Call of Hungry Ghosts and he mentions a past-life regression there in which an English seamstress who gave birth to 13 children before dying in 1796 was reborn in India where he/she died before the age of one in 1802. Now, according to \\"Dr\\" Joel Whitton, \\"PhD\\", \\"MD\\" before someone's reborn they are given some kind of challenge to balance their Karma. If someone dies before the age of 1, what chance have they got of doing that?! After dying as a baby, this person was later reborn in Czechoslovakia before World War 2 and was executed by the Germans as a teenager after serving in a Nazi labor camp. So, if people like \\"Dr\\" Whitton are to be believed, then presumably this unfortunate person didn't balance his/her karma before dying as a baby in India?!\\"Dr\\" Whitton's \\"past-life regression therapy\\" techniques sound quite traumatic. For example, during one session mentioned the \\"doctor\\" became concerned that his patient's contortions during the process might have caused a heart attack. Other symptoms include feelings of nausea and of being \\"severely shaken\\". One subject is mentioned as emerging from the trance state overcome with feelings of guilt for having murdered someone in a \\"previous life\\". In one case study, \\"Dr\\" Whitton dabbles in the controversial area of recovering \\"memories\\" of abuse suffered by someone from earlier in their present lifetime.To back up their claims for the veracity of \\"past life regression therapy\\", the authors state that during \\"regression\\" the subject started talking in another language and that because they didn't know that particular language then it can't have been their imagination. Maybe not. The possibility exists then that what people like Whitton are doing is a some kind of voodoo work, in which the subject goes into a trance state and becomes possessed by a \\"hungry ghost\\". So perhaps a more appropriate term for the kind of activity in which people like Whitton engage would be spirit channeling or demonology.I think what I found especially odious about this book was the way that it sent the message that if anything bad happens in a person's life then it's because of \\"karma\\" and that people should follow the advice of \\"Jesus\\" and \\"love one another\\". Brief mention is made of a woman who saw a \\"past-life\\" \\"therapist\\" after being raped and was told that this had happened because of a \\"karmic decision\\" made during her \\"inter-life state\\". Still, I suppose this is one way of keeping a population docile. If anyone complains about his of her lot in life then the advice is that it was their karmic destiny to be in this situation and that they should be like \\"Jesus\\" and \\"love one another\\"."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"This book is fine for people new to the topic.

Just as &quot;Life After Life&quot; brought us multiple descriptions of near-death-experiences and demonstrated their common elements, so &quot;Life Between Life&quot; does forthe bardo experiences of their clients, providing us a glimpse into our own potential for greater personal and spiritual understanding.For those who seek practical, concrete information regarding the phenomena of reincarnation, as well as tips on how to access this knowledge in their personal lives, this is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"As someone who deals in life, death, and quality of life issues on a daily basis...

This book took me deeper than I have been before and led me to think about issues in a different light.I have always wondered why some people are born into luxury, and others famine- some into health, others in bodies that can't even last through childhood.In seeing that these circumstances could be the result of our own choice, for a spiritual goal, It helped me to deal with my everyday frustrations about the inequalities we see around us.This book was fasinating, and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"This is the first book that deals extensively with life on the other side between reincarnations. I also admire the authors' writing skills: the stories told in this book are very touching. I am wondering why the authors did not write more on Whitton's valuable research.This book is deeper than many other books on reincarnation. But the two recent books by Dr. Michael Newton &quot;Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives&quot; and &quot;Destiny of Souls: New Case Studies of Life Between Lives&quot; are much more comphrensive and unbelievably revealing. Another first-class book is Bryan Jameison's &quot;The Search for Past Lives: exploring reincarnations's mysteries &amp; the amazing healing power of past-life therapy&quot;. Even though it does not deal with life between lives, it is really fascinating and a must-read for anyone who is interested in reincarnation."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"If you want to get an interesting and informative account of what everyone's always wanted to know, then you should definately read this book.

The responses from his hypnotized subjects in this book has emphasized that when the soul enters the body is varied: some reported it more towards the beginning of the pregnancy, others just before the birth, few right after the birth. This tells me that there is no experience as being the exact same, but there are certainly some similarities in some aspects. Also, it also talks about how our past lives can affect or influence our present lives, with some good examples provided.Personally, I have discovered this book to be quite thought-provoking about the meaning or the purpose of our lives. It is certainly a good book to have in hand. It's well-written, easy-to-read, and brings the reader to question about our lives and our purpose: to learn."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"\`Life Between Life' makes the reader explore the meaning and experience of life. Why are we here? To what purpose? Can we through study and working on ourselves gain a better understanding of these questions? Through techniques such as past-life regression and an overview of what religious teachings have to say on the subject, the authors show that despite no bulletproof evidence for past lives there is a body of evidence collected in the recent past that points to the conclusion that we are born many times into this world. Many topics are discussed, but the one I found most interesting is that this experience we call life is a classroom to learn and through this learning we work out karma and other lessons.None of what is mentioned in the book is mainstream knowledge, yet I think rejecting this material is foolish and that a person should keep an open mind and explore the topics at question. To not do so is to fall into the dogma of western culture that sees life as linear with man and consciousness as nothing other than the source of mechanical evolution. Nature shows us in many examples that life and existence are cyclical. Although this mechanical nature and conscious \`sleep' seems to be the default setting for man as explained by G. I. Gurdjieff and Boris Mouravieff in books such as \`In Search of the Miraculous' and the \`Gnosis' trilogy and more and more by present day psychology in the study of the adaptive unconscious as laid out in the book \`Strangers to Ourselves' by psychologist Timothy Wilson, this default setting doesn't trap individuals into living a life as a machine and an end to existence when life ends. I think that individuals can transcend this state of sleep and break the bonds of materiality through conscious effort and many lives spent learning lessons."},{"Title":"Life Between Life","review":"This book is the definitive one.

I feel this book will be a classic some day, if it is not already."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"This translation is far superior to any other that I have seen. The Analects have always been a difficult and opaque work for me. I have read it several times over many years and have always found at least half the sayings completely incomprehensible. The Waley and Legge translations are dry and dated. Lau and Dawson are easier to read but still leave me puzzled about the meaning of most of the sayings. Some of their notes are useless and distracting, while others merely fail to inform. I was always left thinking of the Analects as a few clever and witty proverbs scattered throughout a strange and impentrable work.The Huang translation, on the other hand, is clear and easy to read. It is easy to follow the structure of the book. It has just the right amount of notes and they are located just underneath the analect itself--not at the bottom of the page or end of the book where you have to interupt your reading and look for them. The sayings that are easy to understand have no notes. The other sayings have notes that clarify the context and meaning. They are brief and to the point so that they don't get in the way of the text. Things that were impossible to understand are now clear. I find that I am no longer burdened by trying to decipher the meaning. As a result I am now getting to know the character and personality of each of the students, and enjoying their interaction with the Master. This is something I was never able to do before with other translations. Reading the Analects is no longer a chore but an enjoyable journey to a distant, but accessible, culture."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Granted, I haven't read other translations of the Analects, so my rating is for the book itself more than as a comparison to other translations.The fact that Confucius lived thousands of years ago is amazing to me ... the things he says apply to people throughout the ages, and they're full of wisdom. Having read the book, I find myself trying to be a bit more of a Confucian gentleman than I did before reading it. Confucius' teachings about humanity and being a gentleman span across the ages.I'm very glad I read this book. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I can't compare it to other translations, and it seems a little improper to rate a translated book without comparing it to other translations. But I personally found Leys' lines to be easily understandable and interesting, even if I have no way of ascertaining their accuracy with the original text.**7/31/09 UPDATE** I was looking to buy a copy of the Analects for a friend when I came across my own review when trying to decide between versions ... which is a somewhat strange feeling! I'm still not an \\"expert\\", but having read several more Chinese classics in the meantime, including a few versions of the Analects, I thought I would update this review. I think the Leys translation is a very good introduction to the Analects for someone who is looking for a starting point in Confucian thought. The translation is a little bit loose but flows well in English, the introduction gives a good amount of context without going overboard, and the notes are nicely situated at the end to prevent clutter. This makes it a good version for the Confucius novice, a comment I mean in earnest and not a backhanded compliment. That said, I have yet to find a translation that surpasses Waley's in its rigor and thoroughness; the copious notes and detailed introduction are excellent as well. However, Waley is likely to be a little more difficult for the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point. As always, different translations work best for different people. Read the first couple of pages of a few versions and you'll quickly have an idea of what suits you. No matter which version you end up with, the Analects is a wonderful work, worthy of the praise it receives!"},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"The review above is uninformed. Even if he knows that the main Chinese phonetic system is called pinyin. If one reads the copious notes that back up the research in this translation, one would realize that every character is philologically proven. Whether by the lexicon Shuo Wen, the sea of words or other. This translation is the epitome of scholarly work. There is an unpresedented wealth of information in this book. There has been no one near the ability of Chichung Huang in understanding the ancient cannotations of Chinese characters. He has achieved a far more scholarly level in classical Chinese than any other Chinese scholar and translator that I have ever read. The amount of clear concise research proves it. His work is fluid, concise and true to the original exactly because the translator has the ability to be literal. His contemporaries are lacking in this regard. Ren does translate to mean humanity, as in the founding principles of humanity and rightiousness. Read the introduction please."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"As I bought this book as a gift for my daughter who cannot read Chinese, I compared this translation with the Chinese versions that I have. To understand the original analects fully, most Chinese books provides explanations and definitions. The author has done an excellent job in providing translations and explanations of the analects at the same time."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"This book is delightful, irritating, and utterly sui generis; the personality of its author is on every page. As a translation it is sometimes inspired--Leys has a knack for avoiding the very un-Chinese verbiage with which Lau and, sometimes, the generally superior Dawson clutter their lines. But it cannot be relied upon as a translation. In the first book the words \\"Rich but loving ritual\\" become \\"Rich but considerate.\\" Ritual (li) is one of the great themes of the Analects and it is either dishonest or shockingly clumsy to conceal its key presence in this important passage. At other times we descend from translation to mere paraphrase: \\"a state of a thousand chariots\\" becomes \\"a medium-sized state\\". I often found myself wishing that Leys had taken to heart Dawson's words: \\"I do feel that one should get as close to the original as possible....I do not think that it is entirely virtuous to produce a version which reads as if it were written at the end of the twentieth century.\\"The notes, to the degree that they comment on the text itself or on the translation choices, are illuminating only for someone who has read other translations and has something to compare them to. But what quickly becomes apparent is that, under the guise of a translation with notes, what we have here is something like an anthology. Borges, Pascal, Stendhal, C. S. Lewis, Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, even Pancho Villa and many others are given long and full quotes. Sometimes they shed light on the original. Sometimes there is only a tangential relationship; one gets the impression that Leys was simply reminded of something and decided to share it, as in a conversation. They are always very interesting: this is the delight of the book. It is as if a select dinner-party full of eccentrics and geniuses were having the Analects read aloud to them and invited to comment freely. Clearly we cannot recommend this version for someone new to Confucius! If you've never read Confucius before, you want to get into the China of the fifth century B.C. and stay there for a while, not constantly get pulled back into modern Europe. There is some danger that these quotes will shed too much of their own kind of \\"light\\" back onto the Analects--which is a very elliptical, minimal, suggestive text--and that the new reader's mind will come permanently to associate some of the ideas of, say, Pascal with those of Confucius. But if you are already familiar with Confucius (preferably through at least two or three other translations) and if you have a healthy interest in and knowledge of Western civilization, this book, taken for what it is, will be a delight.A couple of reviewers have commented on the anti-gay prejudice which comes up, I believe, twice in the notes. These passages really do vitiate the work. It is not only the prejudice itself; after all a good dish needs some spice and Leys is entitled to his opinion. But the whole issue is so obviously foreign to the Analects, the passages in which it comes up strike so discordant a note, that one wonders what they were doing here. And they are not, even in themselves, good or interesting: the ideas are banal and the tone verges on the mean-spirited. Leys constantly writes as if he were taking a friend into his confidence, and assumes that the intelligent friend will feel the same way he does. He gets away with this because his views are generally intelligent and because usually there is some fig-leaf of connection to the Analects to support it. But in these and a few other passages we are suddenly pulled up short by the realization that it is not wisdom but mere cantankerousness that we have on display. It is bad style, bad taste.I am giving this three stars because it is being sold as a translation of the Analects and that is what, as a translation, it deserves. As an anthology of quotes suggested by the Analects it might get five stars, with perhaps one taken out for the fault mentioned above.If you have never read Confucius and are looking for a good introductory translation, I recommend Raymond Dawson's."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"The importance of the historical use and misuse of the teaching of Confucius throughout the centuries in China can hardly be understated. While Confucian thought was on the outs with Communist intellectuals, others such as Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore point to Confucius' principles as the secret to the Asian economic tigers' success. Leys, the translator of this volume, notes that Chinese familiarity and historical misuse of Confucius prejudices many, but taken without these prejudices, Confucius is thoroughly modern in his application today.Confucius is known for being a great teacher, but it was politics and government that was his passion. Today, Confucius is a good source for leadership philosophy. Far from promoting authoritarian despotism, the teachings of Confucius point to a higher calling of leadership through service, character development, and self-abandonment - all sorely lacking in Chinese leadership today.To learn was Confucius' calling. He said he did not have much innate knowledge and studied literature and history to learn (6.27). The responsibility of learning was on the learner not the teacher: \\"I enlighten only the enthusiastic; I guide only the fervent. After I have lifted up one corner of a question, if the student cannot discover the other three, I do not repeat\\" (7.8). While that may sound harsh, Confucius practiced what he preached. \\"Put me in the company of any two people at random-they will invariably have something to teach me. I can take their qualities as a model and their defects as a warning\\" (7.22).Learning was to be put into practice; this showed integrity. The first verse of the Analects says, \\"To learn something new and then to put it into practice at the right time: is this not a joy?\\" (1.1). Again, \\"Learning is like a chase in which, as you fail to catch up, you fear to lose what you have already gained\\" (8.17). Here we see the high value of action resulting from learning and not only study. He valued doing what you say. \\"There was a time when I used to listen to what people said and trusted that they would act accordingly, but now I listen to what they say and watch what they do\\" (5.10). Doing what you say is the heart of personal integrity. \\"A gentleman would be ashamed should his deeds not match his words\\" (14.27).Learning was his way of improving himself in order to govern well. Three major themes surface in Confucius' teaching regarding those who govern: be a gentleman, keep the rites and maintain your humanity. A gentleman was a moral superior, someone worthy of leading. A person becomes a gentleman not through birthright but through learning and right actions. These actions are called ritual, which is similar to courteous behavior, and maintaining humanity which is treating people with respect, dignity, fairness, justice and generosity to name a few of the qualities that Confucius praises. Ritual and humanity develop character in a person, and a person with character is the one whom Confucius calls a gentleman.Confucius and his contemporary political and intellectual leaders wanted to make a name for themselves. In a way, they could live on through that reputation. \\"The Master said: \`A gentleman worries lest he might disappear from this world without having made a name for himself'\\" (15.20). However, in making a name a leader must not do evil or act without virtue.Official position was an obvious choice for ruling and making a name. Today, position is the most highly regarded form of authority all over Asia. Hear Confucius: \\"Do not worry if you are without a position; worry lest you do not deserve a position\\" (4.14). Again, \\"It is not your obscurity that should distress you, but your incompetence\\" (14.30). This is a powerful lesson for Chinese leaders to hear. Today too much emphasis is placed on leadership position, and not enough placed on competence and character. The results are personal empires, corruption, and incompetence that oppress those without power (position). \\"Before he gets his position, his only fear is that he might not get it, and once he gets it, his only fear is that he might lose it. And when he fears to lose it, he becomes capable of anything\\" (17.15).The wisdom available to contemporary readers goes on and on. I found this book extremely helpful for finding ancient Chinese cultural leadership principles that back up the principles of transformational leadership theory and servant leadership theory. I would like to read and reflect deeper to find Confucian principles that are not yet apart of contemporary models of leadership, but are consistent with it. This is a deeper task.Recently I have begun quoting Confucius during my leadership seminars. Although, a feel a bit dubious doing so - proof texting largely Western leadership principles with Confucius - the reaction from the participants has been enthusiastic. While many leaders are attracted to Western leadership theories, many also feel these theories are foreign. Many theories based on egalitarian social structure are foreign and are not appropriate for most cultures in Asia. However, some theories, working inside hierarchical social structures, are helpful but still smack of American \\"one, two, three\\" optimism. We are sometimes too brash and not mysterious enough, too left brained, in our presentations. Confucius has helped my audiences to embrace the principles I try to get across.I was surprised how readable, useful and contemporary the writing of Confucius is to me as a leadership consultant. He had a good grasp of humankind, and set the bar very high regarding how leaders should govern from character and justice. He encouraged people to higher traits of humanity, that if followed would make the world a much better place. We would do well to study and apply the teachings of Confucius."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"Confucius was born in approximately 551 B.C. Considered by many as a master; he was a teacher and political advisor in pre-imperial China. He lived in a time of transition. He saw his world sinking into violent behavior and barbarity. Confucius believed that he was chosen by Heaven to become the spiritual heir to the Duke of Zhou who had established a universal feudal order five hundred years before him, unifying the civilized world. In addition to his interest in politics, Confucius was also skilled at outdoor activities, such as handling horses and archery and was fond of hunting and fishing. While he is best known as a teacher, Confucius' true occupation was politics. He advised government officials on foreign affairs, diplomacy, finances, administration, and defense.In his introduction to the book, Simon Leys writes, \\"The Analects is the only place where we can actually encounter the real, living Confucius. In this sense, the Analects is to Confucius what the Gospels are to Jesus.\\" Confucius promoted humanist ethics and the universal brotherhood of man, inspiring many nations. Chinese emperors have promoted the official cult of Confucius for more than two thousand years. It became a sort of state religion. The Analects became the spiritual foundation of the Chinese world. This classic book gives the reader an understanding and appreciation of a philosophy that has survived throughout the ages and is just as pertinent today as it was when it was written.The word analects is defined as a collection of excerpts from a literary work. The Analects of Confucius are a collage of short dialogues, anecdotes and brief statements, mostly attributed to Confucius. Some of the statements are attributed to his disciples or rulers of the time. They were compiled around 400 B.C., about seventy years after Confucius' death, by two consecutive generations of his disciples and became what is considered the teachings of Confucius. The general intent of the text is to aid the reader in self-improvement so that the one might become a moral example for others. One might find the proper way to live and behave by practicing various virtues, thereby becoming a humane person or a gentleman. Confucius says that humanity is an accomplishment; one is not born humane, but one must learn to become so. Another definition of humanity is to love others. The practice of ritual action is the best way to express one's human kindness. Ritual action is not limited to state and religious functions, but covers the spectrum of human behavior. The book is organized into two parts. The first part contains the quotes of Confucius and others. The second part contains notes written by Simon Leys that explain words and concepts presented.Perhaps the true strengths of The Analects of Confucius are evident in the examination of the Confucian themes. The ideas of ethical behavior, moral conviction, self-improvement through education have stood the test of time and are evident in many other religions. As one reads the dialogues and anecdotes of this master, one gets the impression that he is speaking about the very problems of our day. The Analects are intended for an audience seeking, what Confucius called, \\"the supreme virtue of humanity.\\" In that sense, the book is intended for all of us.Walter S.

This book does the latter and avoids the former, and thereby gets my unqualified recommendation.

But, despite Simon Leys' beautifully written short introduction and his section of explanatory notes which is longer than the actual work, it escapes me why the Master should have gathered around himself such a band of devoted followers or why this book should have had such an enormous influence. Simon Leys and others claim how modern it is, i.e. how timeless. Much of what he says - that one should be righteous, just and courteous, should not show off, should practice what one preaches, should show self-control, should be aware of one's limitations - is indeed timeless - but that is because it is obvious.Those of his sayings which are not timeless - for example the huge importance he attributes to ritual (even given the glosses which Leys gives to the word), or the obedience due to the old - do not inspire much respect these days.Anyone who practices all these things is a gentleman, irrespective of birth. Anyone who does not is vulgar. Being a gentleman also involves a love of learning for its own sake, but Confucius shares the view of the philosophers of Ancient Greece that a gentleman should leave technical knowledge to others.He had a lot of fairly general things to say about politics (Aristotle is much more specific and analytical). Leys says that politics was \`his first and foremost concern' and that he hoped in vain to be called upon to be called upon by a ruler to reform a state, particularly the morality of politics. He had the naive view that if the ruler is virtuous, his people will be virtuous also.I apologize to the devotees of Confucius for my undoubted presumption in giving this classic only two stars."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"well i bought this book back in college I was getting around to see what i have not review and i can tell you this book was horrible (i got an A in my class) but the book is very crude and I stop reading it past page 15.

Well done"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"First things first: this is a book designed for use by the DM, atleast for the most part. In the beginning of the book there's a couple of pages detailing a new Ravenloft-specific prestige class called the 'witch-hunter'. A fun to play class, especially for people who enjoy role-playing rather than roll-playing.The rest of the book describes a great variety of villains from various domains. The villains (mostly 'Darklords') are described in great detail: stats, background, current sketch, etc. are all covered. Special rules are also presented, such as how a 'Talon' (an elite troop of Vlad Drakov) differs from the ordinary soldier, and how a vampire can feed without exhausting his 'cattle'. The background stories are nicely done, and are very likely easy to follow even for DMs new to the Ravenloft setting.A DM screen comes with this book, which is quite obviously a very handy tool. Typically for a setting which focuses more on character interaction than on combat, two of the four panels of this screen present easy to look up DCs for all skills. Ever wonder what the PC must roll to pull a nasty splinter without causing more damage? Or how difficult it is to convince a vampire to let you go? With this screen it's all right in front of you.So why only four stars? Well, basically, there are some rather inexplicable typos...but these can be forgiven. What is a bit painful is the fact that the progression table for the witch-hunter prestige class is not complete. Due to a miss during layout, half of the table was cut. Not much of a problem if you have access to internet, really, as you can download the complete table at the sword & sorcery website (...).Besides this small flaw, it is worth the cash."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"In all honesty I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this book, because the book bills it as &quot;nasty tricks to use on your players&quot; when it really should have been... &quot;The semi-complete list of darklords.&quot; I have no idea why the witch-hunter prestige class was in this book, as it was completely out of place, but the rest of the book was actually very well done, with a map (albeit small) showing which domains were controlled by which darklord and then a listing of the darklords.These listings make up the meat of the book and are definitely worth the price of admission for those who do not have the older 2nd edition info. They tell you the history, personality, looks, powers, current position, and weaknesses of the darklords. Every single entry was done to my satisfaction and merited 5 stars for that information alone. The reason the last star dropped off is that the information wasn't complete. They show you the list of all the darklords in Ravenloft and then give you info on only half of them. I would have paid for another hardcover overpriced S&amp;S book if it had just listed them all.The only other issue I have with the book is the stats on the darklords themselves. As a DM I have been running Forgotten Realms campaigns for many years now and have become accustomed to incredibly powerful NPC characters that the PCs are in mortal fear of. No player is going to bum rush Elminster, even if he is wielding a +5 sword. Forgotten realms contains epic level characters using the WotC Epic Level handbook to full effect. The Secrets of the Dread Realms lists Azalin as an 18th level lich necromancer. Perhaps I am just jaded from my other campaigns, but isn't that a tad weak? Why didn't they bump up the power level of the darklords to reflect the new source material from WotC?In any case, it was well worth the money I spent, but it could have been much better. The DM shield was actually quite handy as well, and definitely more appropriate for a Ravenloft campaign."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"I really liked the d20 Ravenloft book, but this one fell short. It only covers about half of the lords and includes a prestige class that should have been in the first book. Here, the class just takes up space that could have been better used with more darklords. Or, better yet, they could have made the book bigger to include more of the lords. I would have gladly paid more for a more complete work.On a positive note, the updated stats for the lords are useful and necessary for a Ravenloft game. And we do get new artwork for Azalin and Azrael . . ."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"I must admit that perhaps I expected too much from this product. On the one hand, I really didn't think much about the advertised DM screen, but after looking it over I think that it was the major play aid (particularly the examples of typical dc's for skill checks). Maybe general combat modifiers would have been useful too.As for the book? The book itself is pretty thin, considering what WotC is charging for the non-Core books I am not too surprised; I just expect more from White Wolf. I am, also, baffled as to why the witch hunter wasn't in the first Ravenloft book. I don't see what advantage the DM has over player's not knowing about this prestige class.I guess what I was really looking forward to, though, was some more detail of particular realms. What I got was personal details on specific dread lords. Unfortunately the realms that struck my imagination most; Bluetspur and Forlorn were omitted. The fact that Forlorn is a core realm makes this doubly dismaying.Most of the dread lords are interesting (particularly Richemulot, Nova Vaasa, and Dementlieu's), but I am interested in Ravenloft because I am, frankly, too lazy to create my own campaign world. Therefore I am much more interested in the details (organizations, perhaps realm specific prestige classes, etc.) of the specific realms and was left looking for the promised DM tricks to give me adventure ideas. (I don't, particularly, see my players going up against any dread lords for some time.)If you, like me, are interested in D&amp;D 3E because it seems a little more flexible and realistic than the original D&amp;D (Yeah, I know its a fantasy game) but not the massive dice roling fest that is GURPS and you are intrigued by the ravenloft setting then this book will probably come in handy, eventually. But if you have all the old 2nd ed. D&amp;D stuff you might be happier just translating it into 3E terms. Actually, possibly the best thing is to bypass this and get Denizen's in March and make up your own Dread Lords."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"I've had an ongoing Ravenloft Campaign now for over 10 years. We started with the old Realm of Terror boxed set for AD&D; when it came out in 1990. When 3rd edition came out, we decided to look at the Ravenloft twist and what they had done with it. The core book was decent, yet it left out the darklords. Upon reading through the book, we found out that we would need to purchase this book to get information on those darklords.We never did buy the book. After all the reviews we read it doesn't appear to be money well spent, more like money wasted. To hear that not all the darklords are even described is disheartening, as that was the only reason we looked to buy this book.For those of you that are simply looking for information on the darklords, this product wouldn't be worth it. Not enough of them are described. In the transformation from 2nd ed. to 3rd ed., the basic lands all but stayed the same. Only one or two from the Realm of Terror failed to reappear in 3rd edition. And those that did make the transformation still have the same basic lords. There are a few new ones that \\"took over\\", and if they're depicted then it might be worth it. But on the whole, I'd advise something more.If you can get your hands on the old Realm of Terror boxed set, do so. It has the description and personalities of the darklords. Of course, Realm of Terror is 2nd ed, so you'd have to do a little of your own work to transfer the darklords stats into 3rd edition playability.And if you can get your hands on the 2nd ed module, \\"When Black Roses Bloom\\", you'd also find stats for Azreal in that adventure packet.Just some alternatives, else you'd have to get this thin product."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Dread Realm: Plus Gamemaster Screen (Ravenloft d20 Campaign Setting)","review":"They didn't send me the Gamemaster Screen, and I wrote some times but I haven't it yet.

Besides helping me stay out of trouble, it's such a fun read that I sometimes pull it down from the shelf to read like a novel.This isn't really a numerical analysis textbook per se--you won't learn how to code the conjugate gradient method, or analyze a SVD routine for roundoff sensitivity, but reading it and making its attitude your own will make your programs better and (if you're like me) save you from lots of painful blunders."},{"Title":"Numerical Methods That Work","review":"Forman Acton lucidly describes basic numerical methods.The only topic not covered in this book is the solution ofsystems of linear equations, although to some extent this istreated in the sections on PDEs and eigensystems.Generally speaking, he covers the concepts behind thealgorithms before introducing the algorithms themselves,and does not confuse the reader with sophisticatedderivations.For getting acquainted with numerical methods generally,or as a starting point for deeper investigation, or as acookbook enabling the reader to quickly implement a methodin his program without becoming a numerical analyst, thisbook is ideal."},{"Title":"Numerical Methods That Work","review":"I am an engineer and years ago I needed some crash training on numerical methods. A former teacher of mine recommended this book for self-study.

Fortran and the IMSL library of subroutines were kings of the day. G&W helped me do what I needed to do as an undergraduate engineering student. Acton is different. Acton's book \\"Numerical Methods that Work\\" is different. When I started graduate school, I needed to automate some real numerical methods as part of my research. Trying to write to anticipate troubles with root-solving, numerical integration and curve fitting was hard work. Then, I found Acton. His chapter on strategy vs. tactics was very helpful (Ch. 7). His chapter on what not to compute (Interlude at the end of Part I) was enlightening. Taken as a whole, Acton does a great job of teaching the art of the approximation. Perhaps, in this world of high performance computing and parallel processing, the art of the approximation has diminished. But I don't think so. Acton's \\"Numerical Methods that Work\\" coupled with the Cambridge Press text \\"Numerical Recipes\\" are go-to books for me. However, Acton and the NR text are best served after a first course in numerics. Acton is not written at a graduate level, but I think it is more for \\"mature audiences\\" than the G&W class of numerical texts.

I think it's also the only one of her books to feature her picture on the cover - if we saw her before, she was always on the back. Kael had taken a year off the magazine to work in Hollywood and her essay Why are movies so bad? sums up her expereince. This collection is remarkable for the wealth of good movies she writes about. Her picks include E.T., Tootsie, Dressed to Kill and Blow Out, Atlantic City, My Dinner with Andre, Shoot the Moon, Diva, The Stunt Man, Pennies from Heaven, The Elephant Man, The Devil's Playground, Melvin and Howard, Personal Best, Diner, The Night of the Shooting Stars, Local Hero, Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean, Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, and Fanny and Alexander. As always, Kael is fearless and not afraid to go after industry heavyweights like Scorsese, Woody Allen, and Meryl Streep. Her pans here include The Shining (&quot;Jack Nicholson is so grinningly rabid that he seems to have stumbled in from an old A.I.P. picture), Ordinary People (&quot;It's not likely that Mary Tyler Moore turns into a hot pixie at night: there are military-looking stripes on her bathrobe&quot;), Stardust Memories (&quot;If Woody Allen finds success very upsetting and wishes the public would go away, this picture should help him stop worrying&quot;), Raging Bull, Heaven's Gate (&quot;I thought it was easy to see what to cut, but when I tried to think of what to keep, my mind went blank&quot;), Altered States, Nine to Five, On Golden Pond, Reds, One from the Heart, Meryl Streep in The French Lieutenant's Woman, Still of the Night, Sophie's Choice, Gandhi, The King of Comedy, and Return of the Jedi. There is a long essay on Abel Gance's Napoleon. Some quotes. Deathtrap felt like one to me. In The Competition Amy Irving and Richard Dreyfuss have acquired ebough bad acting habits for a different kind of competition. In Bladerunner Rutger Hauer seems a shoo-in for the Klaus Kinski Scenery Chewing Award. Ben Gazarra could be the survivor of an ancient (and untrustworthy) race. When Jack Lemmon puts his finger under his stiff collar and twists his neck - that familiar tic of his which he uses to show that the character he's playing is writhing in discomfort - he puts me in mourning for the lost evening. When homosexuals were despised, there was a compensatory myth that they had better taste than anybody else. Their enthusiasm for Victor/Victoria should help debunk that myth.

What was really important to me about Thurber was that he came from the same part of Ohio that I did, and actually had had relatives and attended family reunions in Sugar Grove, Ohio, where I grew up. That meant all the world to me, because it showed me that someone who had ties to Sugar Grove could be a famous writer. Now, I love Thurber's work more than ever; as an adult, I can better appreciate the nuances of a story like &quot;The Catbird Seat.&quot; Thurber's work is a precise, funny, yet deeply serious portrait of an America which had just recently completed the transition from a frontier to an urban society. Women, having just won the right to vote, were flexing new-found muscles; men, divorced from the need to wrest a living from the soil, felt suddenly unmoored and emasculated; a new breed of self-help authors arose to make a quick buck from the newly uncertain populace; and oceans of alcohol fueled the newly stirred resentments between the sexes.Thurber recorded it all, in a prose style as elegant and lucid as any in the history of American literature. &quot;The Catbird Seat,&quot; &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; and the self-help parodies of &quot;Let Your Mind Alone!&quot; are every bit as fresh and pertinent as when Thurber wrote them 60-odd years ago. Unfortunately, some aspects of his work--most glaringly his portrayal of African-Americans--have not stood up so well. But one can only say of Thurber what the Duc de Saint-Simon said of Louis XIV: &quot;His virtues were his own, his faults were his times'.&quot; The best of James Thurber ranks with the best of Mark Twain, Ring Lardner, Woody Allen and any other American humorist you can name."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"A few years back I used to travel to work (some 15 miles) by bus. As is the custom with commuters just about everywhere, my fellow travellers and I seldom spoke..a nod and a half-smile would be about as much communication as we managed. One morning I unwisely picked up a copy of &quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot; to while away the time on the journey: unwise because about halfway through &quot;Travels With Olympy&quot; I let out such an unrestrained hoot of laughter that I startled myself and everyone else on the bus. For a moment it seemed that the driver was about to stop and come back to check on the commotion. Things got back to normal, however....but I couldn't help noticing a few puzzled looks in my direction when I found myself choking back the tears while reading about Thurber's dog Rex: I don't even like dogs much, but such is the punch of Thurber's writing that I was howling my eyes out over the demise of this pooch. As the passengers were getting off the bus one kindly lady stopped by my seat and asked what I had been reading. The next day I got it into my head to buy a bicycle and started cycling to work each day. I recall one morning as the bus hurtled past me, seeing the kindly lady reading a book and smiling...I can't be sure, but I like to think it was the Thurber Carnival. These days I drive to work."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"THE THURBER CARNIVAL is an excellent collection if only because it contains the complete MY LIFE AND HARD TIMES. In the early seventies, when my grandmother gave me a respectful and wonderfully brief biography called THE CLOCKS OF COLUMBUS, I became a THURBER fan. I was in Junior High and Thurber, dead more than ten years already, was enjoying something of a vogue. Most of his books were back in print. Today, we're down to about a third or less of what he wrote. The Library of America's collection looks fairly complete, but THE THURBER CARNIVAL was his own selection of greatest hits, if you will. In both cases I miss the separate volumes from which these stories and cartoons are culled. If there are concept albums, Thurber had concept collections. You don't get the sense of a Beatles album listening to bits from different albums. This is true with Thurber. You need all of LET YOUR MIND ALONE, which you can only get used now. You need all of THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE; his most representative collection.He tried writing a novel once or twice, but found he could only write short stories. This bothered him. The chief thing to remember as you read him is that he was deeply ashamed of being a humorist. His literary hero was Henry James. During Thurber's time at the New Yorker (and he arrived there about a year after its founding, staying until his death more than three decades later) the magazine was a showcase for humorists. Think of the original cast of Saturday Night Live and you'll have something of an idea of the atmosphere at the magazine in its first ten years or so. Competitive humorists travelled from all over the United States to work for THE NEW YORKER. The Algonquin Roundtable was largely a haven for NEW YORKER staffers. James Thurber learned from E. B. White and a few others and then outstripped them. If you read E. B. White's forays into humor, you'll see his clean prose shining, but you won't feel you know him. Thurber, on the other hand, leaves you with the impression that he wishes to God he never left Ohio. There is a sense of loss in Thurber's rhythms.He is as dated as a Studebaker. If you're not willing to put yourself back in time, Thurber's not for you. But, if you notice his pain, you might notice how mightily he strove against it. Thomas Wolfe once met him at a party. Someone said, \\"This is James Thurber, the New Yorker writer.\\"Wolfe shook his hand and said, \\"You call those little, tiny things writing?\\"All Thurber had was his writing. He was a mess otherwise. Even when his writing practically barks its bitter sentiment, Thurber turns a phrase as if he owns it. The actual content of the stories is immaterial. He should be read outloud, because he was essentially a poet."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"I grew up with this book. First published in the mid-40s, it lived in the center of a built-in bookcase over my father's desk in the family room, and I was drawn to it time and time again during my childhood.At first, I was convulsed by Thurber's uniquely hilarious cartoons. His dogs and his women are priceless...drawn in a style that nobody has ever been able to duplicate or capture.It was only later, as I grew older, that I could appreciate Thurber's written humor. The &quot;Thurber Carnival&quot; (and it is) is a compilation of essays and excerpts from &quot;My World--and Welcome to It,&quot; &quot;The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze,&quot; and others. These were Thurber's earlier works that were very much a product of their times, but oh, so funny! Thurber was one of the great commentators on the vagaries of everyday life. Along with Robert Benchly et al., he set the tone for an entire generation. I still have this book, and I absolutely cherish it. It's hard to do Thurber justice in a review.

Thurber's imagination and wit have an appeal all their own.This anthology brings together a number of his short stories as well as selections from amongst his modern fables and cartoons. 'What Do You Mean, It Was Brillig?' and 'The Night the Bed Fell' are two excellent and hilarious tales that serve well as an introduction to Thurber's surreal world. Don't read these in public unless you are prepared to draw attention to yourself - they will have you laughing out loud. In his fables, modelled after Aesop, but with a twentieth-century bent, Thurber delights in catching the reader unaware with his own particular brand of irony.The cartoons are ingenious. Sometimes you will read a cartoon in a newspaper and it will make you laugh. Go back to it again and it no longer has the same effect. Thurber's cartoons, on the other hand, are so utterly inspired (I do not exaggerate), that they will improve upon a second and third look. You will discover subtle nuances you didn't perceive before. His funniest offerings draw on the theme of marriage, and frequently involve the chasm between a husband and wife trapped in a marriage out of which the love and romance has long since disappeared. You will be left baffled as to where exactly Thurber came across such a natural talent for finding (and exploiting) the absurd in everything."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"One night my wife read to me from one of her textbooks, &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;.

The Thurber Carnival is a hodge-podge of essays, stories, and drawings culled over several decades and from several other collections. Some are better than others, of course, and quite a few of them are very dated--unsurprisingly, since the book was originally published in 1945, and compiled at that time from earlier sources.It doesn't really seem to matter. Even though I can't really relate to the early days of the automobile, it didn't stop me from laughing aloud at \\"Recollections of a Gas Buggy.\\" Human nature hasn't changed all that much in the past 60 or 70 years.There are quite a few classic stories in here, including \\"The Catbird Seat,\\" which is a delicious story of revenge, and \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" which I hadn't even realized was Thurber's.His drawings are just as entertaining, which is even more startling after reading in the biography what poor eyesight he had. With just a few lines, he manages to do the same thing he does in the stories and essays with just a few words.Most of the humor has to do with human nature--specifically, with the way people communicate, or don't. One of the best (i.e. most hilarious) examples is \\"What Do You Mean It Was Brillig?\\" in which he lampoons both his housekeeper's accent and his own misunderstanding of and reaction to it. There's also a darkly humorous story, \\"The Breaking Up of the Winships,\\" about a couple who divorces over a disagreement about Greta Garbo. Change a few minor details, and these stories are as true today as they were when they were written.I'm really happy I bought this.

It also includes a nice selection of his drawings and cartoons.I purchased this particular copy for a friend of mine who has *gasp* NEVER READ THURBER. I think this is a great introduction to his works for those who have never read them, while being great for those who are familiar but want a sampling."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"Before David Letterman and web blogs, there were syndicated columnists.James Thurber's observations and musings represent this genre very well.Middle America in 1925 is delicately, whimsically, irreverently and familiarly portrayed in this series of columns and drawings taken from his broad body of work. Thurber writes at a time when the mass media, common culture and common sense of a melting pot nation were shared by most citizens of all classes. Racial minorities were not truly included. A growing awareness of misunderstanding between men and women was a familiar Thurber theme, mostly from a man's perspective.Setting aside modern views, this collection is a treasury of wit, psychological insight, humor, irony and shared experience. Everyman is portrayed in the small town and big city from the perspective of one raised in Columbus, Ohio. The picture of middle class socializing, striving, fears and wisdom captures a time and place, but resonates today. The long shadow of small town/ farming culture in the modern, progressive, urban world shapes daily life.We're missing this world of shared experiences and shared meaning today."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival (100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature)","review":"This sampling of Thurber's genius is a must for every library.

The characterizations of these strange adults from long ago stayed with me, causing me to wonder about them, the aunt afraid electricity was leaking through the empty light sockets was one.

The books were in hardback and of course very cheap in those day. I sampled one and then bought the rest. Thurber is very witty, very funny and is easy to relate to. His drawings are wonderful - simple and look so easy. I liked the essays and I loved the cartoons - the one I like best is a chap introducing his wife to a friend 'That's my first wife up there (she is crouching on top of a bookcase and this is the present Mrs Harris.' Another lovely one is a couple in bed with a seal above the headborad and thei wife is snarling 'All right, have it your way -you heard a seal bark.'Thurbers dogs are so evocate.

Even though the stories are fictional, this is a great read. It is so interesting to read a story from every member of the troop over time. You get to see the characters from many points of view (sort of like the movie \\"Ran\\"). Some of the stories make you laugh and some make you cry. An all round touching book."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"This edition of &quot;Company K,&quot; by William March (a native of Mobile, graduate of The University of Alabama's law school, and WW I veteran), is one in a series called The Library of Alabama Classics, and it warrants its status as a classic. It's a beautiful little book, nicely typeset in a somewhat nostalgic manner, and deserves to be better known than it is--as does its author. Kudos to Alabama's UP for making this book available in paperback for a wide audience.The book, first published in 1933, is a collection of short first-person narratives by the members of a company caught in the frontline in the first World War. Remarkable is March's ability to place himself (and the reader) in the positions of a great many very different characters--the company is a cross section of American society. This, his first novel, shows that March is an intelligent and sensitive storyteller.More remarkable, perhaps, is how easily this book might be hypertexted--since all the narratives intersect, and various characters appear in various guises in other's narratives, it would lend itself easily to an HTML version in which a reader could click their way through the book without having to follow the book's order. Surely March must have seen this as a possible way of reading, since the chapter headings are the characters' names, allowing a reader of the book to easily flip from one character to another. The book, which seems to be suitable more for a spatial than a chronological way of reading, disrupts the boundaries of its printed format. I don't mean to call March a post-structuralist avant la lettre, but it is a feature that enhances, in my opinion, one of the themes of the book: the horror of war recognizes no hierarchy; war disrupts the human order.As for horror, there is plenty of that. The point of view March has chosen is excellent in that it allows for multiple readings of the same event (for instance, the unnecessary and criminal shelling of a recon party); some of the voices come from beyond the grave and are particularly chilling.One final note on the edition: it is introduced (not designed, as the Amazon heading states erroneously) by Phil Beidler, a professor of American lit at U of A. Beidler has shown a great interest in and loyalty to the literature of Alabama (see, for instance, his anthologies &quot;The Art of Fiction in the Heart of Dixie&quot; and &quot;Many Voices, Many Rooms&quot;), and his introduction to this book is insightful and touching. Beidler obviously knows his stuff; he knows both war and Alabama.I believe that this book, as has been noted by others, is of the rank of Remarque's &quot;All Quiet,&quot; and it is a wonderful and chilling read. Like most good war novels, it says &quot;don't let this happen again,&quot; while realizing that it probably will, knowing human nature."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"Slaughterhouse-five, and Catch-22 both borrowed from a powerful predecessor. Company-k is a simple read, short chapters each one a character of many narratives. Each one an insightful and heart-rending tale. It would be easy to ignore Company-K and most don't know it - except that it's written by a man who was there. Hemingway glorified war made it seem almost fun - March tells it as it was. Only Johnny Got His Gun, and All Quite On the Western Front come close to this passionate and shocking book."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"March makes a compelling case in this text that he should be well entrenched in the second tier of American authors, if not the first. His WWI recollections do a fine job of bringing out the terrors and guilts of a war long forgotton and little remembered, except for the short period of the Twenties. If there is any shortcoming in this fine work, it is that it draws far too much from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthologies. My guess is that March, who was trained as a lawyer like Masters (a former partner of the unethical (...) Clarence Darrow) grasped onto Masters' then-current work . It's not a heroic idea, but one that's occurred to me. In any event, Company K is a work that ought to be read far more than it is a century later. WWI [is] seldom remembered as the great trauma that it was in the US. Here's a book that tells how bad it was, and more importantly, why."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"Do not take it from me, Graham Greene, one of the most respected names in Twentieth Century Fiction hails March's \\"Company K\\" as the greatest of all anti-war novels, while Hemingway thought it superior to almost all other WWI novels. This novel is not an almost-classic, it is a classic, borrowing the format made popular by Edgar Lee Masters, March expounds on the concept of individual soldier stories encompassing the full breath of the war. This novel is as appropriate now as it ever was in the post-WWI era. This novel is a must read for anyone remotely concerned with WWI and the impact war has on the survivors."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"Old Men Still Send Young Men to War.This is the story of those young men who fight those wars. Their stories, not of officers and gentlemen, but of the Dough Boys themselves.Written as fiction, Company K is, in reality, the true life stories of author William March and his fellow soldiers in Company K. Stories of courage, valor, of fear and cowardice,needless sacrifice and in one case outright murder as enemy soldiers are gunned down in a ravine rather than go through the trouble of getting them to the rear.This is not about a John-Wayne-war; it is about Sherman's war, the \\"War-Is-Hell\\" kind of war, told by men who actually fought it.It is about American soldiers, but it could be about any soldier under any flag representing any country. It is universal in nature, and could have been written about any and all wars.It is a masterful piece of work. You may never look at the glory and valor of war in the same way again...And that's a good thing!"},{"Title":"Company K","review":"So glad to see this book again. I lent my copy to a Marine buddy many years ago, and after the trouble it was to get a copy back then (pre-internet days), I didn't think I'd ever find another copy. Looks like it is in print and I'm not the only one who thought so highly of this book. A college Prof recommended this as one of the best to come out of the first World War and he was correct. As I recall it opens with a comment from the fictional author's wife/or the actual author's wife commenting that he should have taken out the part where they kill the German prisoners, as if that would change the fact that things like that had happened. That really showed the disconnect between the returning combat veterans and their families and friends who really could never understand what they had seen and done. The only other good WWI fiction that had as much of an impact on me would have been All Quiet on the Western Front or some of Hemingway's short fiction such as Soldier's Home. This is at least on par with those. And I'm glad to see it is still in print or at least some copies are out there so I can replace my long lost copy."},{"Title":"Company K","review":"Outstanding narrative on observations and memories of the author's experiences before, during and after WWI that should be available for all history students and readers. Well worth the time reading these short vignettes that really bare his soul. Find it and read it!"},{"Title":"Company K","review":"Excellent book! War presented as it really was by a gifted author who experienced it! I started reading and was completely captivated, finishing the whole book in a single evening! The book consists of many short vignettes, each narrated by a soldier in company K, in which the soldier relates a particular experience. Some soldiers describe the same experience from different viewpoints. By this means the story is advanced from the beginning of the war to the end, and war itself is presented in all it's ugliness, cruelty, banality, and stupidity. American officers order the murder of prisoners, an exhausted enlisted man murders an officer just so he can rest (and gets away with it!), and mortally wounded soldiers lie screaming for hours in \\"no man's land\\" with their guts hanging out. As powerful as All Quiet on the Western Front!"},{"Title":"Company K","review":"You can probably read this book in one sitting. I want to read it again because I kind of zipped right through it. It's a book I know I will come back to like SOME DESPERATE GLORY. It leaves you with an after taste that you can't get rid of not good or bad just something that won't go away and you don't know why.

I felt compelled to write my own review after reading the negative one given by the man before me. The author of this book does not claim to know everything. At times, she states some things, such as religion contributing to the Dark Ages, as being a theory. In fact, I have read of this theory in other places and don't find it so difficult to believe. After all, didn't the church become a bit unfriendly with people who proposed that the earth was round rather than flat, that all of the planets and the sun didn't revolve around us? What, pray tell, happened to Gallileo when he challeged the church with his ideas? Even today, picking up a Christian based science book for children I have found writings that go blatantly against scientific discoveries, things that are being denied because they go against traditional Christian doctrine. It isn't so difficult to believe that the church during the Dark Ages would have had the same issues. In fact, the Dark Ages were a time of intellectual darkness, which contributed to the stunting of scientific advances in fields such as medicine. Much of learning came from the Greeks up to this point, with thinkers such as Aristotle and Plato weilding a heavy influence. By the time the Dark Ages had arrived, many people couldn't read the original Greek these documents contained, it had not been translated to the Latin they did speak, and, in 529, the Christian emperor forbade studying anything written by such philosphers and teachers because they contained Pagan ideas. In fact, no one who professed to be Pagan was permitted to teach at all. It does seem possible to me that the heavy hand of Christianity did play some role in the construction of the conditions which created the Dark Ages. They weren't single handedly to blame, but were probably contributers.There are other writings contained within this book which reveal ideas I've read before in other places, such as the story of the Garden of Eden being taken from an earlier story in which the Queen of Heaven stumbles upon the Tree of Knowledge, minus the idea of sin being attributed to knowing too much and the scary serpent. At one time, the serpent was associated with various Goddesses as well as fertility. I too, read quite a bit and am interested in the history of various religions in particular. Studies of various cultures, such as Egyptian culture, show the way religion has been transformed to fit the needs of different periods in time. It isn't \\"New Age b.s.\\"; it's historical fact. Within this book, I don't find a great deal of the aformentioned \\"b.s.\\" Rather, I find one person's interpretation of historical writings which she has studied. The thing about history is that it's always going to be colored by those who record it. Human nature dictates that we tend to write from the point of view of our own beliefs and culture. This is part of the reason why I've gone to synagogue and heard a Rabbi relate some Biblical story or another, then gone to a church and heard a Priest talk about the exact same passage with a different spin. Both came to different conclusions with regard to the meaning of a story based on the point of view from which each approached it. Such is the way of life as well.Keep an open mind with regard to this book, and if you think it looks interesting, pick it up and read it. I'm disturbed when someone who seems to think he knows everything because he reads a lot shreds a book because it doesn't gibe with his interpretation of historical fact. As with any book, one should read it and then read other books about the same or similar subjects and form your own opinion."},{"Title":"Women Healers: Portraits of Herbalists, Physicians, and Midwives","review":"A Fascinating Insightful Read Of The History Of Women Healers.

It would take too long to delineate all the factual blinders of this terrible piece of garbage, so i will start with a quick and easy one:Page 17 the author cites Walker that the reason for the \\"darkness\\" of the Dark Ages was Christianity; that the Church was against educating the public because that would turn them away from Christianity. False.Christians (Charlemagne notwithstanding, but his rule lasted just over thirty years - a fraction of the five centuries we call the \\"Dark Ages\\") by and large controlled nothing during the Dark Ages. During those centuries the Church frantically tried to organize itself into a cohesive unit. So busy was it with itself it had no time to \\"oppress\\" the laity.Further - the only REAL medical attention that peasants received came from none other than the Monks themselves (you know, those evil Christians). Most medicine came from the monasteries because the \\"women healers\\" that this uninformed author speaks of were by and large charlatans selling quack medicine.Also the idea that if a person is educated than they will automatically turn away from a religion is stupid. Look at Franis Collins, Reza Aslan, and many more. You might not agree with them, but they are far from \\"uneducated.\\"Let me also say that i do not agree with any religion at all. But to portray the Church at a time is just BAD HISTORY. What the moronic author should have done was simply change the title and scope of her book to Women Healers during Medieval Times. That's when the Church ruled life and persecuted women healers. This author is an idiot with no concept of European history. She uses popular feminist myth to advance an argument she has no credits to make.I sincerely hope she isn't a teacher anywhere - those poor kids!"},{"Title":"The Trouble With Money (Larger Agenda Series)","review":"The Trouble with money is a thin book. It seems to have resulted from a lecture that Mr. Grieder was asked to do for the banking and investment community. As usual it is very good and economically informative. Mr. Greider seems to have the problem nailed. And today we see it all happening over again. This book is well worth reading but SECRETES of the Temple is a much deeper analysis. I know Mr. Greider is not a history writer but I wish he would write a book entirely about the concept of money. Like Galbraith's MONEY FROM WENCE IT CAME AND WHERE IT WENT. I think Mr. Greider could do a bang-up job on this type of work.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The Trouble With Money (Larger Agenda Series)","review":"There are more than a dozen full-page ads throughout this, showing in pictures the enormous capacity at \\"1:29 AM, Memphis, Tennessee. Fleet ready for loading at main hub\\" (p. 9) and other aspects of \\"the largest all-cargo air fleet in the world\\" (p. 9) that reinforce the feeling that everybody needs to have lots of money or this country's bankers won't be the only unhappy people in the world. In a *GO JET* world, the final picture, with a caption, \\"working to meet the needs of business throughout the world,\\" (on the page after 94), might even be uplifting after a text which urges, \\"People had better start to find their voice for the emerging debate\\" (p. 94) about regulating our financial institutions again, so this \\"Larger Agenda Series\\" text seems like a hardcover magazine with one long article at times. William Greider is still a top reporter on the state of the economy. THE TROUBLE WITH MONEY is mainly about the American economy. Written in 1989, when the dollar was incredibly strong due to high interest rates, which brought in the flood of foreign investments able to finance growing trade deficits and federal deficits by furnishing an increasingly speculative market for debt, banks were failing at record rates. The price of oil was too low for people with huge mortgages to pay their loans in Texas, while manufacturers paying workers American dollars suffered from a decreasing ability to sell their products in the rest of the world. I'm so stuck in 2003 now, only 14 years later, that complaining about anything in this book is like a drunken bat out for blood that dried up a long time ago. But I'm as upset over the current news about any predictions of improvement in the global economy, a constant hope of those who are looking for the next big spurt of growth that would prevent the kind of collapse that I will attempt to provide in a factual analysis of this book, though at this point, the effort is as much psychiatric anamnesis as the entertainment value of the question in the form of an offer: do you want to bet?Every percent of something is different from a percent of something else, and this applies mainly to the U.S. Department of Commerce chart on page 70, \\"Inflation-Adjusted Interest Rates.\\" With a positive 4.42 percent in the 1980s, Greider thinks \\"the bloated interest rates of the 1980s were rivaled during only one other period in this century--the Roaring Twenties, when similarly distorted social values were in full play.\\" (p. 71). Those who check the numbers at the bottom of the chart will discover a whopping negative 5.13 percent for the 1940s, showing that lenders had little chance of getting their money back at the same value, as time was changing the situation greatly in favor of those who could use money productively. Today's interest rates might seem small to us, \\"but, historically, 0.35 percent represents a generous rate of real return on short-term T-bills.\\" (p. 70). These numbers were from \\"Alan Greenspan, the new Federal Reserve chairman, in the fall of 1988 provided the Senate banking committee with some stunning economic figures that, curiously, the press ignored. Greenspan's numbers described the bedrock reality of the 1980s and explained much about the turbulent era--the lopsided prosperity at the top, the periodic financial crises, the erosion of corporate balance sheets, and other unsettling developments . . . plainly about the true cost of money.\\" (p. 69). When the government needed money for World War II, \\"The Fed, in those years, kept nominal long-term rates at a steady, stable 2 percent, and federal deficits as a percentage of the gross national product then dwarfed the deficits of the Eighties.\\" (p. 71). Constantly comparing things to a drunken bat might not make our situation much clearer, but the federal deficit for the fiscal years ending in 2003 and 2004 might seem large when they are compared to the numbers which this book has preserved.\\"The ingenious politicians had found a way to commit upward of $160 billion in public money to rescue the S&Ls--with; only marginal impact on the reported federal deficit.\\" (p. 4)\\"The New York Fed itself, for instance, served in 1986 as a clearinghouse for a daily flow of financial transactions exceeding $1 trillion . . . Roughly speaking, that meant that each day Wall Street was buying and selling and swapping pieces of financial paper with a presumed value equal to one-third of the U.S. gross national product.\\" (p. 5).\\"During 1984, First Boston, one of the world's leading bond houses, itself transacted deals totaling $4.1 trillion--exceeding the nation's GNP. . . . The market in interest-rate swaps, an esoteric investment that hardly existed at the beginning of the decade, then exceeded $150 billion in outstanding volume.\\" (p. 6)As of 2003, Pentagon plans to operate a financial market in terrorist events, with anonymous traders allowed to bet on when things would happen in the Middle East, as a reliable way for the Pentagon to learn about undercover operations that might or might not be controlled by geopolitical forces capable of operating from within the United States, have been kicked in the shins by a Congress which doubts its ability to provide proper investigations of those instances in the future when the smart money had the unexpected pegged long before intelligence reports made it to the upper levels. The attempt to set up a web page to allow internet activity by the end of 2003 on such bets says as much about the financial activities in which the American dollar is involved (bets could have been for or against, ending the kind of one-sided interest in the economy that this book is about) as the weird kinds of speculation that end up in Chapter 4, \\"Moral Hazard.\\""},{"Title":"Divine Nepotism","review":"In 'Divine Nepotism', Ms. Lewis has given us her truths, baring her soul and emotions.

It implies a misunderstanding of what corporations are--they are machines, as Rowland says, and therefore incapable of moral judgement. We should not be surprised when they behave in immoral and inhuman ways, but we need to regulate them carefully.I though the analogy with the military was a good one.

But it is a very very good and unusual kind of self-help book. Yes, the book is NOT about military strategy, but is is about strategy in personal life. I thought it was better than a ton of other popular history or self help books. It helped me understand how to be more successful at figuring out how to get what I want.

The author repeatedly calls Napoleon the &quot;emperor of europe&quot;...gag... he was &quot;Emperor of France.&quot; And the author misses entirely the most important the issues of his battlefield genius, and totally misunderstands the 1812 campaign and WHY Napoleon went for Moscow. Hummm...perhaps he should have expanded his shallow source reading on Napleon's campaigns to far better works than the lone, vastly-overrated military work listed in the back. His information on Patton and Joan of Arc is also very superficial and lacking any meaningful depth (and the dust jacket touts the author as currently writing &quot;a forthcoming scholarly study of strategy&quot;?).In retrospect, I understand what the author is trying to say and how he wants to convey the concept of &quot;coup d'oeil&quot; to folks for their use in everyday life.

Mas ler Clausewitz &eacute; acima de tudo um exerc&iacute;cio de pacincia. Obra densa: no vocabul&aacute;rio e fisicamente tamb&eacute;m, ultrapassa as mil p&aacute;ginas!Em 'O Estalo de Napoleo', o autor - William Duggan - mostra apartir do caso de Bonaparte, como o segredo da estrat&eacute;gia no est&aacute; necessariamente na criao de coisas novas, mas na combinao de coisas existentes. E que essas combinaes so frutos de \\"estalos\\" ou \\"golpes de vista\\" (do francs coup d'oeil) no \\"calor do combate\\". E Napoleo era mestre em explorar esses \\"estalos\\".Interessante que inicialmente, a estrat&eacute;gia de Napoleo foi mal-interpretada. O primeiro a teorizar sua estrat&eacute;gia foi justamente um traidor ex-subordinado seu, o suio Antonie Jomini, que bandeou-se para o lado dos russos contra Bonaparte, e diferente de Clausewitz, escrevia com muita objetividade e clareza. Durante muito tempo ap&oacute;s as Guerras Napolenicas, Jomini foi estudado e seguido em suas estrat&eacute;gias, de linhas de avano est&aacute;ticas, cercos e trincheiras. O &aacute;pice desta estrat&eacute;gia foi a 1a Guerra Mundial, a guerra est&aacute;tica.No desenrolar do livro, Duggan passa comparando a estrat&eacute;gia Jomini x Napoleo.Postulados por Von Clausewitz posteriormente, os princ&iacute;pios da estrat&eacute;gia de Napoleo seriam:1. Combinaes da Hist&oacute;ria.2. Presena de Esp&iacute;rito.3. \\"Estalos\\" ou \\"Golpes de Vista\\".4. Determinao.Combinaes da Hist&oacute;riaNapoleo sabia muito bem que a hist&oacute;ria das guerras sempre se repete. A t&aacute;tica pode mudar de combate a combate, de tempos em tempos. Mas a estrat&eacute;gia no muda muito. Ou pelo menos os princ&iacute;pios no so tantos nem mudam tanto. Portanto estudar a hist&oacute;ria de \\"guerras\\" passadas ajuda a entender as atuais e poder aplicar a estrat&eacute;gia correta. Profundo conhecedor de Alexandre e provavelmente de Sun Tzu, Napoleo era &aacute;vido por estudar guerras. No &agrave; toa, fez muitas ele mesmo.Presena de Esp&iacute;ritoComandar as tropas da retaguarda no lhe tr&aacute;s vantagem alguma. Fica totalmente dependente das informaes que chegam do front e no lhe permite ver com os pr&oacute;prios olhos. Afinal, para se ter golpes de \\"vista\\" precisa-se ver de perto! E Napoleo, ao contr&aacute;rio de seus contemporneos comandava do front.

For several years I chose to skip over the original series stories where she's written most of her original stories, something of which I corrected a couple years ago.I found this story to be, while not extraordinarily original in theme, well told with an excellent premise, plot setup and execution and, in combination with Kathleen O'Malley's writing, an extremely well paced novel that borders on the horror genre, which is rather different but enjoyable for the Star Trek genre. Of special note is these authors characterization for Deanna Troi, which was dead on accurate.The cover art is just a cut above the standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.The premise:Some eighty years ago on the planet Vulcan, bodiless entities plagued the Vulcans bringing a wave of violence and bloodshed, something of which had been unheard of on that planet for more than a millennia. These entities were finally trapped inside special containers. In the present day twenty fourth century, during a scientific exposition, the containers have been opened, freeing these entities that immediately start possessing whoever they run across, to include the crew of the USS Enterprise. As the majority of the crew becomes possessed it is up to Data to save the day and recapture these entities before they're able to spread throughout the Federation.I highly recommend this numbered STNG novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction for it is a true gem among the numbered novels. {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Possession (Star Trek: The Next Generation, No. 40)","review":"If you read and liked Dillard's earlier &quot;dark&quot; Star Trek novels, then this one will be right up your alley."},{"Title":"Possession (Star Trek: The Next Generation, No. 40)","review":"This book presents a well established storyline that I haven't seen in any other book.

Finally, the more mundane explanation given for the creation of the artifacts undermines them considerably.That all adds up to this being a three star novel.At best.But, the last line of the novel is so absolutely ominous, chilling, foreboding, and ultra terrifying that it serves to elevate the novel by fully two stars.

The depiction of all the characters is excellent, with the scenes of Picard fighting the influence of the aliens the best of them. The main character of the book is Deanna Troi, and this is one time when she really gets to shine. Picard, Worf, Alexander and Data also have many great scenes.

This book is much better-written than that one, though; I suppose that Dillard matured some as a writer in the intervening years.It would have been nice if that continuity had been more specifically referenced, although in retrospect I can see that it was hinted at.

That was a time that the name Ring Lardner was well known in sports writing and literary circles. The sports writing part was easy because that was his beat. The literary part is much harder to recognize but clearly the character of Jack Keefe has become an American classic. Does one need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this work? Hell, no. We all know, in sports or otherwise, this guy Keefe. Right? You know the guy with some talent who has no problem blaming the other guy for mistakes while he (or she) is pure as the driven snow. That is the concept that drives these stories told in the form of letters to Al, his buddy back home.The language, the malapropisms and the schemes all evoke an early more innocent time in sport and society. I do not believe that you could create such a character based on today's sport's ethic. They would all have a spokesperson \`spinning' their take on the matters of the day. The only one that might have come close is Nuke LaRouche in the movie Bull Durham but as that movie progressed Nuke was getting \`wise'. Read these stories. More than once."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"\\"You Know Me Al\\" consists of a series of rather detailed letters written by a bush-league ballplayer named Jack Keefe. Keefe has been called up from the Terre Haute team to join the Chicago White Sox. He is writing to one of his former bush-league teammates in Bedford, IN.Keefe is truly a country bumpkin, a rube, a bumbling fool who does not understand the more sophisticated world of the major leagues, but who still succeeds based on the strength of his pitching arm. The reader gets a kick out of seeing the world through his eyes but really understanding the situations he is in, similar to 'Forrest Gump', except that Jack does not have a disability - he is just ignorant.The audio version I heard (Book of the Road's version) is wonderfully performed by veteran Shakespearean actor Barry Kraft. Kraft captures his self-confidence, hoosier country-boy accent and innocence perfectly. To me, he will forever be the voice of Jack Keefe.Overall grade: B+"},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"The book profiles a talented fictitious baseball pitcher whose primary limitations are his shallowness, arrogance and bone-headedness. Certainly the character is a composite of all the knuckleheads Lardner must have encountered in his beat as one of the premier sportswriters of his era. Elements of the main character can be seen in many of today's sports stars. The book is an easy and amusing read."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner's place as one of the United States' most underrated fiction writers may be from producing almost exclusively short fiction. There, his gift for colloquialism, narrative voice, and an ironic distance between creator and character shines brightest.Even his one well-regarded novel, 1916's \\"You Know Me Al\\", speaks to Lardner's strengths as a short-distance writer. It's an engaging but thin first-person narrative about a headstrong rookie pitcher, Jack Keefe, who makes it to baseball's American League as a starter for the Chicago White Sox. Talented as he is, his selfish attitude puts him in several tight fixes which he wiggles out of with the blissful ignorance of Inspector Clouseau.It helps the busher is too dense to pick up on the ridicule he draws when getting off to a bad start, like in this sly, characteristic exchange with his manager:\\"I says Why don't you get a catcher? He says We don't need no catcher when you're pitching because you can't get nothing past their bats. Then he says You better leave your uniform in here when you go out next inning or Cobb will steal it off your back. I says My arm is sore. He says Use your other one and you'll do just as good.\\"Mention of Cobb, as in Tyrus Raymond, is important because it cues one of Lardner's most successful devices in \\"Al\\", as read at this remove in time. A number of real-life players, managers, coaches, and club owners put in appearances, sometimes in extended episodes. Keefe clashes with parsimonious owner Charles Comiskey over a couple hundred dollars and hangs his losses on teammates, including Buck Weaver, who ironically is blamed by Keefe for throwing a game for a friend. [The real Weaver would go down in history, three years after this was published, as the one \\"Black Sox\\" player who wouldn't do precisely that.]One wonders how Weaver, Comiskey, and the others reacted to \\"Al\\". They must have read it; it was the most popular thing Lardner, a famous writer, produced in his lifetime, first in magazine serial installments and then as a novel. Did they enjoy reading of themselves and get the joke was on Keefe?\\"Al's\\" format, as series of letters written by Keefe to a hometown buddy, allows for a good deal of hilarity in its deliberate unconsciousness, much of which holds together today. But as a story and a character study, it's quite thin. It boils down to this: Jack is a jerk, he's vain, and he's cheap. This last point gets pushed many times, especially during the book's creaky second half, where the now-established pitcher must share the wealth with a wife and son.Lardner's validity as a short-story writer includes the way he holds true to the voice of his central character, no matter how limited or blinkered. Here, it's a liability as the longer investment in Keefe doesn't pay off. I found myself tiring of this guy's company before long, and wishing that Lardner had traded him for Alibi Ike, not my favorite Lardner character either but a more interesting one, more amusing and sympathetic.Even reading this as a collection of short stories is unsatisfying, as the sections don't so much end as trail off. When we leave Keefe, he is getting ready to sail \\"a round the world and back\\" on a baseball tour. He is the same guy we met at the beginning, perhaps a realistic treatment of his fellow man by Lardner but not an arresting one."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"The travails of the boastful, blame-shifting, naive-unto-the-point-of-stupidity White Sox rookie first went into print 85 years ago. It's one of the miracles of 20th century fiction -- or a comment on the eternal childishness of America's national pastime -- that the bush leaguer's absurd confidences to a friend back home are still fresh and funny. &quot;I have not worked yet Al and I asked Callahan to-day what was the matter and he says I was waiting for you to get in shape. I says I am in shape now and I notice that when I was pitching in practice this A.M. they did not hit nothing out of the infield. He says That was because you are so spread out that they could not get nothing past you. He says The way you are now you cover more ground than the grand stand. I says Is that so? And he walked away.&quot; Yeah, this is clearly the same sport where the portly John Kruk turned aside a question a few years ago about conditioning with the Bartlett's-worthy, &quot;We're not athletes. We're ballplayers.&quot;Lardner does more than get laughs at the expense of his dense protagonist, though. He gives an intimate picture of baseball in its first classic era -- the busher comes face to face with Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker and Walter Johnson with interesting results. But it's not a sentimental depiction of the age: Among those with whom the busher crosses paths is the famously parsimonious and autocratic White Sox owner, Charles Comiskey. The book gives a hint of the resentments that led his players to agree to throw a World Series (as they did a few years after Lardner wrote &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;) and illustrates the indentured servitude that all but the best players endured before free agency arrived in the mid-'70s."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner was a newspaper sports writer in the early 1900s.

The book contains real teams and stats, but is a fast-reading fictional look at the lives of players. With everything from front office negotiations with Comiski to on-the-field trash talk, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; is a must-read for baseball fans who miss the game of yesteryear."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"This book was a real hoot to read. Ive always loved the language that revolved around the game of baseball. Ring Lardner does a credible job of creating this youthful prospect trying to make big in The Show. The format of writing letters gives it a touch a realism. The language and grammar of this semiliterates lend it a charm that is slightly reminiscent of Huck Finn. His delusional arrogance is more humorous than offensive in the long run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the literature and journalism that surrounds this great American game."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Not being much of a sports fan, but for many years standing close beside one, I knew nothing of Ring Lardner until I visited Niles, Michigan, pursuing a story of my own. In a quaint hometown treasures museum, we discovered the local author gone national, with a first edition of \\"You Know Me Al\\" under glass. Intrigued, I purchased a modern day copy soon after for my sports fan, but I had to read it first myself.In full agreement with Virginia Woolf in the book's Introduction, I can say you do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy Lardner's humorous portrayal of Jack Keefe, a bush-league pitcher who writes frequent letters to his best pal, Al, about his adventures on and off the baseball field. The letters are filled with hilarious misspellings, misunderstandings, and general bumblings. Jack may be a good athlete, but his mind, shall we say, is his least athletic muscle...All of which adds to the slim book's charm. Jack writes to Al about his fortunes and misfortunes in pitching, forever blaming others for his own obvious failures, never missing a chance to boast, thumping his manly chest with threats that he will beat up this guy or that for some imagined slight. His arrogance is in high form, but just about the time it approaches the point of no return, Jack charms with his naivete. One can't help but laugh at him again, much as one laughs at a child or a wildly bounding puppy.The letters are not just about baseball, however, but just as comically illustrate Jack's romantic flailings, as he imagines Violet is ever so smitten with him, then decides to marry another, only to drop her for another, only to long for the first again, only to marry Florrie. With whom the threat of divorce comes up again and again in similar cyclings. Jack waffles with all decisions in his life: team trips, moving from one city to another, borrowing and repaying funds to the silent and surely most patient and near saintly Al.It is the lack of hearing from the other side that keeps me from adding a fifth star to this review. We have only Jack's view of himself and his world, charming bumbler that he is, and I found myself often wishing for Al's side in response. Nonetheless, this is a classic that can obviously be enjoyed even over a great passage of time since its original writing some eighty years ago, and with or without a penchant for sports."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"I had not never heard of Ring Lardner until a visit to his home town in Niles Michigan right near outside of Kalamazoo.

These letters are written in a special colloquial style and include the spelling and grammatical errors of the young pitcher, and also his quite surprising startling and humorous language.

This was all before World War I, the Black Sox Scandal & even Babe Ruth."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"This amusing look at baseball circa 1914 by sportswriter Ring Lardner (1885-1933) remains among the sport's top fiction. The story is told through a series of letters written by pitcher Jack Keefe of the Chicago White Sox to his buddy Al back home in Indiana. Keefe is a modestly talented pitcher finally getting his chance in the big leagues. Keefe is naive and immature, he has an excuse for every failure, and his childish emotions range greatly according to how his last game went. The author uses many real baseball figures in this story (Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, manager Nixie Callahan, etc.) and that lends an added layer of authenticity. This book also mixes readable prose with down home wit, and the result is a highly amusing novel in the style of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"This is a print out of the Internet Archive scanned version of the book from a copy held by the University of California Library. For some reason it is in large print, with large margins and they didn't even bother to orient the page numbers properly, all they would have had to do is select \\"left bind\\" in the advance tabs in the printer options. If you just want the text you can get it for free on Google books."},{"Title":"You know me Al: A busher's letters","review":"Baseball a hundred years ago wasn't really much different than it is today. Only the names have changed. Talented pitcher Jack Keefe tells this story in the form of letters to his friend Al back in their hometown. Jack begins below the major leagues, but gets there with the White Sox. Jack shows his personality by his own descriptions of actions and events. Don't expect him to spell well or use the finest grammar, but frequently laugh at his choices and apparent delusion about who and what he really is. It may help if you know names like Cobb, Lajoie, Matthewson, and Comisky, and have some rudimentary knowledge of baseball, but this is an enjoyable book about Jack's life changing as his circumstances change. He faces baseball issues, management issues, women issues, and general life issues as a young man who shows himself to be nave and not completely honest with himself about who he is. Good fun, well written in a voice that seems genuine for Jack, and definitely standing the test of time."},{"Title":"Consumer Behavior","review":"Very informative book, full of useful information.

Apparently John Stott never received the memo. Why I Am A Christian is not Blue Like Jazz or a story the Emergent crowd would support. Instead it is a logical, biblical examination of the claims of Christ and the reasons John Stott is a Christian.The book was inspired by a public address delivered by Bertrand Russell's in 1927 entitled \\"Why I Am Not A Christian.\\" While the book does not directly interact with Russell's arguments, it does provide the opposite perspective. Through seven chapters Stott provides seven reasons that he is a Christian and an invitation for the reader to join him in the kingdom. Here are the six reasons Stott is a Christian:1. Because the Hound of Heaven relentlessly pursued him. He did not find Christ; rather, Christ found him.2. Because he is convinced that the claims of Christ are true.3. Because of the cross of Christ which gives Jesus His credibility.4. Because Christianity best explains the paradox of our humanity.5. Because Jesus Christ is the key to freedom.6. Because only Christ can fulfill many of the most basic human longings and aspirations.The book concludes with \\"the greatest of all invitations\\" - an invitation for the reader to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior.The book is well-written and generally theologically-sound. It is, on the whole, consistent with a Reformed understanding of the faith. The only real concern I had was with several references to Malcolm Muggeridge whom Stott refers to as an example of another man (along with himself, the apostle Paul, Augustine and C.S. Lewis) who was pursued by the Hound of Heaven. This choice seems inconsistent with much of the theology taught within the book, as Muggeridge was, of course, a devout Roman Catholic. I suppose this is consistent with Stott's recent ecumenical leanings. It is too bad as it calls into question what Stott really believes.Why I Am A Christian is a good book and one I can recommend with only a small amount of hesitation. It is well-suited to provide to a friend or family-member who is interested in learning more about the Christian faith. It is a good \\"giveaway\\" book. I can't say that it would be my first choice, but you could certainly do far worse."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"The guy believes in God but technically the only reason he believes in God is because Bible says so. It is called \\"circular reasoning\\" and that kind of discussion never takes you to the result. Most of the examples and paragraphs are based on Bible.I don't believe in Bible that's the reason I am reading a book about religion, what makes you think I believe in this time ?Summary of the Book;-Is there a God?-Yes.-How do you know?-Because the Bible says so.-How do you know the Bible is correct?-Because it was inspired by God."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"The prolific evangelical author John Stott has provided a down to earth discussion of why he believes in Jesus Christ as lord and savior. This book is a balance between reason and faith, clearly fulfilling Anselm's dictum. \\"I believe in order that I might understand.\\" The present work is an indirect response to Bertrand Russell's case against Christianity and with logic, insight and faith Stott offers the reasons for his faith.He develops his basis for convictions in six chapters, with the first being the most intriguing. Chapter one begins with Stott recalling why he became a Christian. He offers the familiar reasons for becoming a believer: he was born into a Christian home and accepted Christ around the age of 17; however he is quick to point out that he could have rejected this heritage and walked away. But he didn't. Stott then focuses on Francis Thompson's poem, \\"The Hound of Heaven.\\" Stott relates this poem to the Apostle Paul, Augustine, C. S. Lewis and then to himself. In a few words, Stott relates how God pursued him as a hound on the trail of a hare.From this juncture he then shares in the next five chapters the claims of Christ, his cross, humanity's flaws, freedom in Christ, and the fulfillment that only Christ can offer. Stott's book ends with chapter seven, a look at Matthew 11:25-30. Stott relates from this passage two of Christ's affirmations and two of his invitations. The book concludes with the sinner's prayer.For those familiar with Stott and his writing, this is undoubtedly his work. It is well thought out and clearly written. He is well acquainted with many sources and includes many timely examples to prove his point. If Stott is one of your favorite writers (as he is of mine) this book well peel back a layer of mystery and reveal a person who isn't all that different in his conversion to and journey with Christ. If one is a nonbeliever this work may not convince you to become a Christian (though it can surely present a \`reasoned faith' for the skeptic). But, I see this book especially opportune for the seeker, one who has serous interest in believing in Christ but may wonder if Christianity is able to offer something to our pluralistic and postmodern society. To this last group I think Stott will most definitely speak."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"This is another terrific book from John Stott. In his short write-up and expansion of 4 sermons preached at All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, Stott refers to Bertrand Russell's 1927 public address at Battersea entitled \\"Why I am not a Christian\\" which 30 years later became a collection of essays with that title. However this book is not an answer to Russell, but does make the case for Christianity, making points that Russell never considered.So why is Stott a Christian? In the seven chapters, Stott gives 6 reasons why he is a Christian, and finally an invitation to the reader to respond to \\"the greatest of all invitations\\" from Jesus Christ himself.Stott's six reasons?1. Not because I found Christ, but because he, the Hound of Heaven, pursued me.2. Because I am convinced that the claims of Jesus are true.3. Because of the cross of Christ.4. Because Christianity best explains who we are, both our weaknesses and our glories.5. Because Jesus Christ is the key to true freedom.6. Because human beings have aspirations which only Christ can fulfil.There are less than 140 pages of text, but the book packs a lot into those pages and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"Again John Stott has captured the subject of Chritianity in a simplified and yet most dignified manner. Although not a long book, this 'essay', explains all of his reasons that should be easy to understand by the readers, and then inspire more than a few minutes thought and real consideration for praying as he did on the final page. As well as being inspirational to Christians it provides answers for evangelists who often have to debate the basic challenges to Christianity which are often challenges to their own understanding of their faith. Tears of joy were there when I read it and I can truly say it is the best reaffirmation of why Christianity not only makes the most sense, but the only sense in man's search for freedom from the everyday pressures of our modern lifestyle that lead to temptation and sin and leading to salvation or as John Stott explains 'true freedom'.For all readers, it has so much truth in it that is all based on the bible's teachings. It covers love and forgiveness and explains the trinity in the most subtle of ways by telling us how God made it all possible. Please read it, share it and get a rejuvenation of life as God wants us to have. It will really challenge non-Christians to reconsider.In addition to pastors and preachers, there is a real treasury of sermon material in this book."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"Awesome book by John Stott.

I commend this volume to anyone who wonders about his or her faith and how precious and valuable it might be. If you are second guessing, read this volume."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian","review":"Pastor and teacher John Stott puts his own personal thoughts together on the reasons that he is a follower of Christ and it makes for a very easy and enjoyable read. Stott begins with the concept that he is a Christian not because of his own desires to be so, but because of the love of God for him through Jesus Christ. \\"The Hound of Heaven\\" is the first chapter and sets the stage for the rest of the book by putting the reader in a proper perspective to understand the true nature and character of God. Stott reminds the reader, that if they are a follower of Christ, then they, too, were first pursued by God and it was because of the grace of God, not their own works, that is the cause and crux of their salvation.Stott then moves on to six other reasons that he is a follower of Christ - from the typical \\"claims of Christ\\" arguments that Jesus is either who he said he is or is not worthy of our adoration and worship - Stott concludes that Jesus is, indeed, the Son of God. He also reasons that the sacrifice of Christ shedding his blood on the cross in payment for our sins makes Christ worthy of our very lives. The next chapter, \\"The Paradox of Our Humanness,\\" was excellent - Stott put forth the concept that the very existence of man is quite a paradox of creation - both light and dark, good and evil are so evident throughout human history - Stott asks how these seemingly low creatures can rise to such high ideals and ambitions and at the same time sink to such depravity and debauchery. Christ and the concept of sin and redemption are the solutions to this inquiry into the nature of man, claims Stott.He finishes the book with chapters stating the Christ is the key to our freedom, the fulfillment of our aspirations and offers the greatest invitation for man - to literally be a child of the Living God. Only through Christ does man not only know himself, but also becomes who he is created to be. Only in Christ does our soul find rest, as Augustine wrote. Stott has experienced this peace and fulfillment in his own life and this book would be an excellent gift to share with another seeking to find the true meaning of life - Stott is pointing them in the direction of the cross - the symbol of suffering and deliverance together by the work and sacrifice of Christ."},{"Title":"Gay and Lesbian Rights in the United States: A Documentary History (Primary Documents in American History and Contemporary Issues)","review":"This book goes behind the headlines of current issues like same-sex marriage, gay rights controversies, and religious attitudes, to give a comprehensive understanding of the history of the gay and lesbian rights movement. It includes a comprehensive selection of documents, from the early colonial period to the present, tied together with historical explanations that put these sources into clear perspective. Clearly written and astute, this book helped me learn more about the Native American respect for same-sex relationships, the roots of Christian opposition to same-sex love, and the conflict between those values and the American ideology of individual freedom and liberty.The authors show that the modern gay rights movement began in the years after World War II in Los Angeles, rather than in the commonly believed 1969 Stonewall uprising. They argue that this movement built upon and is a continuation of the larger movements for freedom and equality as applied to people of color and to women. For a comprehensive understanding of the most important human rights struggle of contemporary America, this book is required reading. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Dominican diary","review":"Here, in powerful eye-witness prose, is the provacative, on-the-scene account of the Dominican crisis - including minute-by-minute accounts of frenitc rebel outbursts as well as detailed reports of the round-the-clock vigil in Washington.Cutting through all the predigested propaganda and white-washed reports, Tad Szulc, Latin American expert and correspondent for The New York Times, brings the entire chaotic conflict into stunning focus - probing deeply into the frightening implications it holds for the future and creating an electrifying portrait of a Republic in trouble.---from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Why the sun was late","review":"A story told in rhythmic language about how we (as animals) react to each other emotionally, presented as an African folktale.

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books. A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.The good news is that if you want a book that really explains the possibility of how the Rapture could really occur and the events that may lead up to it, then this is it. Although not as good as Kirban's other books - I'd recommend &quot;Guide to Survival&quot; or &quot;Revelation Visualized&quot; for a starter book, &quot;Countdown to Rapture&quot; explains what events will happen before the rapture of the saints, and a few that will occur after..There's a great section of charts near the center of the book - when they say &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; they obviously had this book in mind.Kirban tells why certain things are the prelude to the Second Coming of Christ, including air pollution, world disasters, destruction of ecology, world famines, the population explosion, increase in amusement activities (and why this is a sign of the end times!), decline in education, rise of computers, increases in crime despite increases in law enforcement, and a very good section of details of world areas and what should happen in these areas before the close of the Christian age.This is a good effort by Kirban, but it's not one of his best. Only recommended for Kirban completists."},{"Title":"Countdown to rapture","review":"It's unfortunate that many of Kirban's books are either out-of-print or hard to get.

My reports run between 40 and 100 pages. So, switching over was going to be a big project.I purchased the book because it was a four star book as rated on Amazon. I must say it is comphresive and very verbose. However, what I find is that on probaby 50% of the issues that are somewhat complicated, the book does come through. Examples: I use bullets in the reports. Word generates some sort of \\"box\\" when you attempt to use a bullet and that box has limits so after a while it will not let you enter any more text. The book never mentions the box (or describes it in any way I can understand that is what they are talking about) in conjunction with bullet points. Another example: There is an explaination of how \\"sections\\" work so you can change a header for different sections. I could not get it to work.

It does not work and there is no troubleshooting on what might be happening.Those are examples of the major problems I have with the book. Another annoying problem is that the index is very poor. What I mean there is that it is extensive but the page reference is wrong about half the time and sometimes the \\"indexed\\" word might be mentioned in a sentence, but it is really not a topic. For instance: Unit of measure. My Word seems to be stuck on CM's as unit of measure. The book gives a specific page to talk about \\"unit of measure\\". However the page just states that Word uses inches as a standard but does not tell you how to change it.Covering everything about this complex progam is a big task. But, I think this book, in its present form, disappoints."},{"Title":"Word 2003 Bible","review":"I have to admit my bias up front; Wiley Publishing produces quality books, and I always give them the benefit of any doubt. Likewise, their \\"Bible\\" books on Microsoft software are as good as one can find anywhere, and I would include Brent Heslop's, David Angell's, and Peter Kent's effort on MS Word as being as close to the definitive standard as one can hope for. Unfortunately, MS Word has more glitches than authors have time to write about, so troubleshooting Word takes much longer than a quick reference to this book might seemingly require. In fact I bought the book with the idea of establishing a dialogue with the authors about Word's disfunctionalities that they do not address, and perhaps may be unaware of. On the other hand, reading the book and practicing what it teaches is the best way to become proficient, and to be able to converse intelligently with others about the nagging, intractable issues that prompted some of us to buy the book in the first place. At something over 900 pages, users should expect to spend a great deal of time absorbing the knowledge that the authors impart. Even though I have been a Word user for more than ten years, I'm confident that this book will be a constant reference on my desk, either until I retire, or, more likely, a new version of Word comes out, and, Sisyphus-like, then we start all over again.What I would like to see is a book along the same lines that addresses trouble-shooting Word, in its various manifestations. With its multitude of ways of accomplishing specific tasks, Word, to me at least, resembles a house with many doors and passages linking its various rooms, but with a leaky roof, and various other structural anomolies that make using it frequently difficult. For example, on page 746, the authors discuss trouble-shooting peripheral devices, such as scanners. Not much is said about the primitive scanning program that Word includes in its suite of tools that may, or may not, interface will with scanning software. Now, one could say that's a mere quibble, as practiced users can generate Word documents very nicely. Well, true, but some of us do need to include non-Word pages in our documents, and store them along with our self-created ones in the same file. What to do. In the past I was able to import those materials as graphics onto blank Word pages; but keeping them in place can be problematic and often tenuous at best. I think authors of practice manuals like this one should be our advocates as well, someone who can grab Microsoft product managers by the collar and say to them, \\"Fix this! And while you're about it, do this or that also.\\"Another glitch, and one that I live with every day, is Word's tendency toward corruption in its Normal file, so that customized toolbars do not last beyond a particular session. Why this happens, I have no idea; but others experience the same problem, and they have no answers, either. I pray that the Authors will see their way clear to addressing this issue, because without it, all their good advice about how to modify toolbars and templates goes for naught. Another well-known Microsoft critic, Woody Leonhard, does just that, and I'm ever-hopefull that Messers Heslop, Angell, and Kent will pick up the cudgel, and beat Microsoft out of its mediocre ways."},{"Title":"Word 2003 Bible","review":"I haven't rated it 5 stars because I've only read two complete chapters.When I started with Word I thought it was such an intuitive contraption that I'd sail through it like playing a video game. None of it!, you'll never be proficient in any Office application unless you study it in depth. Perhaps Microsoft should include a full reference book inside their Help (I don't think it'd be that difficult), but until it does, you'll need a good manual and this is one.I've studied a couple of advanced chapters from this book (those dealing with Styles and Section Breaks) and these are my conclusions:- In principle, it seems intended as a reference book (that is: one intended to be looked up when you're in doubt about some of Word's features); nevertheless, if you intend to have a complete knowledge of all Word's features (like me), you can study the full chapters: the writing style is pleasant, so you will never get bored if you're interested enough in the subject. This isn't of course a literary work, but if you are curious enough about all the clever engineering of this extremely sophisticated device that is Word, you'll have a rewarding experience.- The book's level is: Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced; that is: a beginner will understand it because it's very clear and an advanced user will benefit as well because it covers (as far as I can see) every nook and cranny of Word 2003.- The explanations are articulate, meticulous and exhaustive without being overlong (I hate authors that, fearing to be long-winded, don't explain themselves clearly).- The writing style is pleasantly conversational.- The book doesn't mince its words when it comes to criticising the shortcomings of Word (this is a good aspect of books written by corporate outsiders).- The book is well structured, the chapters in the first part are introductory, the rest of the chapters are very thorough.- Very Important: There book comes with a CD containing a fully searchable .pdf format e-book version of the book, which is what I always use; I find it annoying having to look at a paperback and at the screen when you can easily toggle between the e-book and Word with the Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut and I have no space on my desk to place any such fat book.If you have a basic-intermediate knowledge of Word, you may be in doubt as to whether to move on to an advanced method book in the style of the beginner's \\"Microsoft's Step by Step\\" or study a fully-fledged manual like this one. I'm studying this reference book because I actually couldn't find any reliable advanced method. I've searched Amazon thoroughly and the only one I found, judging by the reviews and ratings, may be: \\"Advanced Microsoft Office Documents 2007 Edition Inside Out\\", but this is an Office 2007 book (not 2003) and it deals with the main Office 2007 programs and how to combine them to create first-class documents (it comes with a pdf format e-book too). There are other advanced books that deal with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming for Word and other Office programs, but you may better study Word in depth before going into adding on any programming. This book introduces VBA programming too.I couldn't disagree more with the reader who wrote that the book doesn't explain clearly how to enter different headers and footers in separate sections. The book explains itself very clearly in page 309:\\"The new header or footer applies to the current section and to all of the following sections. Later, if you want the new header or footer to be the same as the preceding header or footer, you can relink it. If you change one header or footer without unlinking it, all the headers and footers in all linked sections change. To create a different header or footer for a section, follow these steps...\\"."},{"Title":"Word 2003 Bible","review":"I like the fact that it was an easy experience.

However, about halfway through the book, Mr. Ingram steps up to the pulpit and is sidetracked by a excessively-long rant on sexual purity and the \\"Second Sexual Revolution\\". Only a scant few paragraphs are dedicated to addressing that which the author proposed in the front half of the book. In short, Mr. Ingram builds a nice head of steam but vents it off too soon. In fact, it almost seems as if halfway through, the author forgot about the book he started to write and starts writing another one."},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"The reader was not credible in presenting the subject matter because the inflection of his voice never changed. Therefore, it was difficult to take his words seriously. There was no fire in his words. This presentation was very bland. The narrator had no enthusiasm or zest in the tone of his voice. He may be fine narrating a book of fiction but this was an instructional, self-help subject, and he just didn't cut it. The term, love, sex and lasting relationships was definitely overused and overstated throughout the CD. I found it insulting to my intelligence that he would feel the need to use this term over and over again. Evidently, the author must also lack in his written presentation of the subject matter. I have never heard him personally so I can't compare his oral presentation to the written..... however, this really lacked sustenance. It was presented in an impersonal manner and I, for one, could not relate to what the author or narrator was trying to impart."},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"It takes patience and discipline (so if you don't have those qualities maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship to start with)...but it truly works...."},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"I gave it a shot...I really did...and once again I was disappointed...Perhaps it works for some and the book was intended for those people, but for those of us who don't have the energy to keep breaking our hearts over and over again by \\"hoping\\" it just won't work."},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"I read this book at the request of a woman who has profoundly impacted my life on all levels. This book focuses on society's very real issues in relationships. These issues have always existed, however today we see a steady increase in divorce, STD, abortion, etc. Why?\\"The Hollywood Formula\\"This belief instills into current society \\"fast love\\" concepts, love as a 100% pain-free experience, and the love/sex identity crisis. It centers on looking to another person to complete yourself. \\"You complete me.\\"The God formula emphasizes that you become your true self in Love, and by consequence you will draw true Love to yourself.Chip explores what profound love is, and what it is not. Paralleling the holy trinity, he explains the 3 loves as the Greeks knew them:agape - Love that is selfless, without condition, without judgment. (Spirit)phileo - Love that begets beautiful friendship (Mind)eros - Love that is erotic, passionate, and physical. (Body)Profound, True, Love, is rooted in all three of the these.Today, eros obviously reigns supreme. However, living only on eros is robbing you of the fullness that you could otherwise experience. Human being is mind, body and spirit. You cannot satiate the needs of mind and soul with what satiates the flesh.Chip includes 12 salient points to consider in evaluating your relationship (which I recommend everyone consider before marriage if you truly seek a love that lasts). He provides 5 non-biblical arguments to avoid sex outside of marriage - again, to consider if you wish to find a love that lasts.I do not agree with everything Chip presents here, most of which because I think mankind has misinterpreted much of what God communicates in the Bible. Many of the stories he relates seem to equate with experiencing the \\"wrath of God\\", but they are actually people experiencing the ravages of guilt. Perhaps guilt is a form of God's wrath... Regardless of those misgivings, I do fully agree that most people today have a warped perspective on love, sex and relationships.If you take nothing from this book, try as hard as you can to \\"Walk in Love.\\" And I would like to add to Chip's work and suggest we should all learn to:Love everyone agape.Love as many as possible in phileo,Love one in eros.If we could learn to do this, we would attain a far better understanding of God.I leave you to ponder the meaning of this statement:\\"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\\"Substitute \\"me\\" with the statement of \\"I am.\\"\\"No man cometh unto the Father, but by the way, the truth, and the life.\\"You will truly know God when you live the way, the truth, and the life.

What Ingram writes sets a good foundation for healthy connections. The tone of the book is very preachy. The first chapter begins with him asking if you've read the introduction and reprimanding you if you haven't. He doesn't leave any room for moral ambiguity, often equating love/righteousness with his community's social/cultural standards. His interpretation of certain Bible verses is really stretching it at times, and his personification of holy, ineffable, Alpha-Omega God and what God \\"wants\\" set me on edge at times.

Otherwise its a great book!"},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"I've read some things by Chip Ingram in the past, and always enjoyed his views and insight into different matters of belief. A little while back, I got out of a bad relationship, and was left wondering why I wasn't finding \\"the right one\\". Being a Christian, it can be hard to find someone who views things the way you do, so I was a little disheartened after it all happened. My youth pastor, and some friends suggested I read this book. Always open to new books and devotionals, I figured I'd try it out.Within the first chapter, I could pretty much decide this book was for me. In fact, it's really for anyone, in any step of relationship. Single, married, divorced... there is valuable lessons and information for everyone. However, one of the major points I took away from it is how Chip says \\"it isn't about finding the right person, as much as it is being the right person\\". His description of \\"Hollywood's\\" formula is pretty much spot on. He describes how we shouldn't focus our efforts on finding someone in a \\"fate\\" sort of view, as is often depicted in movies and tv shows. Instead of building our foundation on things we see, and waiting for fate to happen, Chip suggests building a spiritual foundation on our relationship with Christ first and foremost. If we put God at the top of our priorities, and serve Him whenever and wherever we can, we are walking close with Him. And when we walk close with Him, others see that we are doing so, and thus become appealing to them, assuming their goal is also the same. When you both put Christ first, your foundation is strong, and all choices and decisions are based on that solid foundation.Since reading this book, I have become much more at ease over my relationship status. In all honesty, I don't think about it much anymore, as I've chosen to focus more of my thought and energy on serving God. He has opened many doors for me, and has used me so greatly in the past few months, I really feel he is building my foundation. So when he does bring me and someone together, we will have a strong foundation to build our relationship on. Which is exactly what I want from her... I want her (and God wants her) to love me for my faithfulness to serving Christ first and foremost. The rest will fall in line...This book is a must-have for anyone, but particularly Christians who are caught up in the world's view of relationships... those who have lost hope of finding someone, even if you feel you are doing everything \\"right\\". This book gives you hope, and and may even give you some thought into what you can do different within your life."},{"Title":"Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships: God's Prescription for Enhancing Your Love Life","review":"This book is one of the most compelling and Biblical approaches to Christian relationships that I have ever read.

I decided to buy it because the author was awarded the Noble Prize.The translation is bad and there are typographical errors, i.e., \\"Tm\\" for I'm. The subject matter is mostly food, not wine. I became physically ill reading the description of the \\"all donkey\\" meal, which decribed every part of the donkey being eaten, and I do mean ALL!I understand that some cultures find it exciting to eat every part of every animal on earth, but to me, its disgusting. And if that isn't bad enough, the protagonists is an inspector investigating reports of a group of people who eat little boys."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"Mo Yan well-deserves his reputation among those in the know as one of modern China's most wonderfully wry writers, as this discomfiting yet compelling novel attests.Republic of Wine's strength is in its evocative, viciously funny descriptions and depictions and in the symbolic social implications they raise. Centered around a fictitious province in China named Liquorland, the novel portrays China's obsession with food and drink and skewers the extremes to which it is taken by the wealthy and the politically connected (which are often one and the same). There is an expression in Chinese &quot;Chi-he-wan-le&quot; literally &quot;Eat-Imbibe-Play-Joy&quot;. In ancient China, the landed and the literati had elaborate rituals and cultures surrounding the consumption of delicacies and fine liquor, which were mingled with the higher arts such as poetry composition, calligraphy, painting, and music. The Cultural Revolution attacked such traditions (among other things), and in its aftermath the finer points disappeared, leaving only its cruder translation: gluttony. Many Chinese know of few entertainments besides food and booze. A Chinese banquet is a grandiose affair, aimed at wasting expensive food and flaunting one's wealth. The higher level the revelers, and the bigger the favors the host is trying to earn, the more obscenely wasteful the dishes. Especially in the 1980s, when government corruption peaked, wining and dining was a popular form of bribery that took a chunk out of the Chinese treasury to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Republic of Wine is beautifully biting in its spoofing of this food obsession, which includes a craving for ever more exotic and expensive foods to impress ones guests with, here taken to the frighteningly logical extreme of serving up braised infants. Mo Yan also mocks the farcical attempt of Chinese men to prove their dubious machismo by &quot;bottoms-upping&quot; toast after toast: the last one standing is the &quot;real man&quot;.Mo's winding, rambling narrative is the book's only shortcoming, which may be deliberate as it flirts with assertions that it was written under the influence. In some ways, the surrealism and sarcasm are overplayed to a degree that makes it difficult to become very involved in the stories. In that regard, it reminds me of the stories of Wang Shuo; the similarity may be partially due to the esteemed Howard Goldblatt, who translated both of Wang's English versions as well as Republic of Wine."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"This has been an excellent book. He is by far the best writer in China today and I hope he receives his deserved acclaim from the international literary world one day.Mo Yan is a great and creative talent...this is an absolutely bizarre book where he displays his profound imagination. He completely condemns the ostentatious consumption of China's corrupt ruling elite and their total, chilling disregard for the lower strata off which they consume. I see the book as a metaphor of the unchecked growth in wealth and power of this elite since the economic reforms.The main reason I admire Mo Yan is because he is an absolutely fearless writer. He is never afraid to take creative risks; he does so in each book and this gives him a style truly his own. The scatological humor, references to dogs, reptiles, apes and donkeys; through the ugliest specimens of nature he alludes to the human condition. Li Yidou's fight with his wife in the chapter 'Cooking Lesson', where in his eyes she degenerates into an ever more grotesque series of images is a case in point: 'her stumpy little fists, which looked like donkey hooves'; 'like a footless person wearing shoes, she was actually wearing a bra', etc. Hilarious, yet nauseating.I can't wait for his next novel.Oh yeah, and the translation by Howard Goldblatt is dead on. Truly excellent, and you can tell he is completely in tune with Mr. Mo's agenda."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"&#34;The image of the lady trucker's face stuck in the investigator's head for a moment like dried hops, frothing briefly before vanishing like the foam on a glass of beer. The narrow road twisted and turned like an intestinal tract.&#34;This is one of thousands of sophomoric similes that fill these pages to the point of distraction. A few sprinkled here and there can be humorous; having one in every other sentence is just bad craft. While the story is interesting, and the political overtones colossal, the writing is simply lousy. Mo Yan deserves recognition not for his writing per se, but for his storytelling and willingness to write the truth. The sad humor in Mo Yan's success is that the Chinese government has lauded one of their greatest critics. For in his unique way, Mo Yan has been more critical than any modern author about the Party and their oppression of the Chinese people. If the leadership actually read his works, they would probably treat him in the same manner as other dissidents. Three cheers for Mo Yan. If he could only write as well as Mr. Orwell, he would endure in literature forever."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"2012 Literature Nobel Prize Winner, Mo Yan, stated somewhere that he was influenced by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a-Marquez, winner thirty years ago. Though I was curious about how his works brought about the latter's characteristics once translated into English or Spanish.I must admit that the some of the metaphorical similarity between both authors' works seems to be there, as well as creating fantasy to expose social irregularities.Mo Yan combines wine and literature to create very original metaphors, which are described while going into first, second and third person quite craftily.The e-book version does have quite a few edition flaws, especially towards the ending chapter, where all punctuation is lacking. If this was intended I must admit that a Nobel Prize Literature has earned the right to re-invent punctuation, even though it made reading a bit strenuous."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"I find it tremendously difficult reviewing a work for which I was clearly not the intended audience. Mo Yan's The Republic of Wine is satirical, comical, critical, surreal and at times absurd and even obscene. Underneath it all the reader can detect a vitriol directed at the current state of Chinese society and bureaucracy, but I believe one needs a deeper understanding of the culture to fully appreciate what the novel is trying to accomplish. The Republic of Wine follows the story of Ding Gou'er, a special investigator sent to the fictional province of Liquorland to investigate claims that government officials have been eating basted little boys at their lavish banquets. The narrative construction of the novel is quite unique. Ding's story is interrupted with a fictional exchange of letters between Li Yidou, a doctoral candidate of Liquor Studies from Liquorland, and \\"Mo Yan\\" - the fictionalized and possibly caricaturized version of the author himself. Included with the letters are short stories written by Li Yidou, that feature some of the same characters and situations as appear in Ding Gou'er's adventures. The narrative blurs the lines between dreams and hallucinations and reality, and the magical and fantastical often is in direct contest with harsh realities. Sometimes it almost feels like the narrative itself is drunk, fitting quite well Liquorland's obsession with all things alcoholic. What I found very distracting were the characters - most of the time, their actions were used as metaphors rather than illustrations of their motives and personality. I believe almost nothing in The Republic of Wine should be taken literally. The essence of the novel is not the story itself, but what the story is trying to convey, and I unfortunately did not have the cultural background to fully appreciate what that was. It was quite difficult to read, and in the end, I was glad it was over. But strangely, I was also still glad that I had read it. I believe a contradiction quite fitting to the twisting nature of the book."},{"Title":"The Republic of Wine","review":"I must start by stating that this is my first Mo Yan book read. I liked it a lot, but it has to grow on you ( kind of like Umberto Eco). Not an easy read at times, but worthwhile nevertheless. Strongly recommend it.

The book was filled with images that often I would rather not have in my brain but I think that was the idea. I've traveled to China and I love the food and I really have enjoyedtrying to get to know the people. Reading a novel that takes place in China (yes it's a big place)gives me perspective I might not have otherwise.I have read other Chinese authors who write fiction but so far none can compare to how Mo Yan writes.

A writer, an actor and a playwright, he is perhaps best known for his novel \\"Flight of the Doves\\" - which was adapted for the cinema - and his \\"Irish Trilogy\\". \\"Flight of the Doves\\" is one of the two children's books he wrote, and was first published, posthumously, in 1968.The Doves of the book's title are two orphaned children, Finn and Derval Dove. They live in England with their \\"Uncle\\" Toby, who is actually their step-father. Toby, once the family's lodger, married the children's mother after their father died in an accident. Unfortunately, as the book opens, the children's mother has been dead for two years - and Toby has not been treating the children at all well. When Toby comes home from work, he expects the house to be clean and tidy and his dinner to be on the table. Once eaten, he'll head out to the pub and won't return until the children are in bed. He appears to have a particular dislike for Finn - a twelve year old boy with red hair who regularly gets beaten by his step-father. Derval, the younger of the pair, is a seven year old girl with blonde hair. When Finn becomes afraid that Toby is going to start beating his sister, he decides it's time to run away. Although he does have a destination in mind - his Granny O'Flaherty's home in the west of Ireland - he isn't too sure exactly where she lives. The journey across the sea isn't made an easier by a notable lack of funds - but the children take off as soon as Toby goes out to the Red Dragon.When Toby discovers the pair missing the following morning - and realises he'll have to make his own breakfast - he falls into the depths of despair. Nevertheless, he believes the children will soon return of their own accord and doesn't notify the police. However, things change when he arrives at work and discovers the children are due to inherit a tidy sum from relatives in America. He realises Finn and Derval may have gone to Ireland, and soon the runaways are being hunted onboth sides of the Irish Sea. Although the children aren't long in making friends, their journey to Granny O'Flaherty's isn't going to be easy - not with the newspaper coverage and a bounty of their heads...A very easily read and enjoyable children's book."},{"Title":"Southwestern riparian-stream ecosystems research design, complexity, and opportunity (SuDoc A 13.78:RM-299)","review":"On the surface, this book appears to be the standard 'orphaned kids with the mean step-uncle run away to grandma's' but it is much more than that. With MacKen's laying this tale subtly over the Irish rebellion of the 1920's, we see England-born Finn also rediscover his Irish heritage. On his journey, we find ourselves realizing along with him that sometimes what is 'right' and what is 'legal' don't always coincide. [Note: sometimes this book is compared to Disney's 'Escape to Witch Mountain'.

This story delves into the painful world of divorce after 20 years and how life does indeed go on and how sometimes people are regretful but hate and anger cloud their judgement. The most touching moment in the book that really got to me was how in the end sometimes you get exactly what you thought you wanted and then find out its nothing like you thought and all you want now is to stop time, but you can't. Life can be cruel, but its only as bad as you make it. And sometimes people can't admit their wrongs and can't deal with their mistakes and find other ways of dealing with them...~Margaret Crane is envied by alot of people.

I really enjoy Belva Plain's books and this one was really well written and very interesting, you keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. Margaret is a realistic and sympathetic character and it is interesting to see her progress and get stronger through the divorce process. Adam is the perfect example of &quot;Be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it!&quot;. I believe that the author demonstrates a realistic view of divorce, &quot;step&quot; situations and what it does to the children and the family and how each person's feelings are raw with emotion. I definately recommend this book, it will make you think."},{"Title":"Promises","review":"Adam has a fling with Randi back in college days. He was being pressured by family and friends to marry Margaret. He meets up with Randi and believes he is in love. She seems to want him to break it off with Margaret but of course he doesn't. He acts as though he feels like he must marry Margaret because it is what his family and friends want. Yet later on in the book he claims to have fallen in love with Margaret.Randi tells Adam that she is pregnant but that she is going to get rid of the baby because she is going to marry someone else. It seems like she is letting Adam go since he won't break off the relationship with Margaret. However I was a bit put off by her wanting to get rid of the baby especially if she loves Adam. We are not privy to Randi's thoughts though.Years later Margaret and Adam run into Randi in New York. Randi tries to start things then when Adam searches her out. She knew he would. He is fascinated with her. She moves to Adam's home town which seems suspicious given that she never wanted to move there when they were messing around during their college days.Adam and Randi start an affair and it seems to last a couple of years and then Margaret finds out about it. So Adam and Margaret split up and Adam has the nerve to tell his children that it has nothing to do with them. It has everything to do with them. This will affect the rest of their lives! He tells them they can count on him. But later he finds it is very difficult to maintain two households on his income and his family starts getting the short end of the stick. Only two of his children visit him the oldest doesn't want anything to do with them. She was on to him when she caught Adam and Randi out having lunch together.Adam gets downsized at work and one could see the parallels between his job and his marriage. He had started slacking off with his work because he was spending so much time with \\"free spirit\\" Randi (coming in late and basically not carrying his wait at work). He wasn't putting much effort into his relationship with his wife when he started getting together with Randi. It was like his employer was him telling his wife he was moving on.He buys jewelry for Randi, helps to take on her mortgage, and they go on a trip while his family is struggling to eat, run around in a beat up car that is falling apart, having to sale the family home, and being unable to do other things.Randi doesn't seem to sympathetic for some reason she thought he was a big shot. That he had more money or something. Then she decides that he would have more money if that \\"bloodsucker\\" ex of his would keep her hands out of his pockets. The children hear her say these things and she doesn't seem to care. She knew Adam had kids and responsibilities when she hooked up with him.He finally opens his eyes up about Randi when she lets some things slip. He couldn't seem to handle the things that he did. He gave up his children his home life for her and he was sorry. He felt contempt for himself as well as for Randi. He felt that Margaret had moved on and he didn't seem to know how to get back what he threw away for what he believed was love. So he did something that seems very weak and just finished it."},{"Title":"Promises","review":"The story of a woman who faces an ugly truth - her husband's betrayal, as her happy marriage is eroded.

As always with Plain, it's well written, with good character depth as she pulls you quickly in, and you come to really care what will happen to the individuals involved.Belva Plain's books are always great drama, hard to put down, and make good summer reading; this is a good selection to take to the beach.

This author truly writes from the heart."},{"Title":"Promises","review":"How can a book about such a painful topic as divorce be such a page-turner, and I'm tempted to say, entertaining? I have no answer to that, but can only say that I found this book totally absorbing and almost impossible to put down. Clich&eacute; it may be, but it kept me awake till early morning the two nights it took me to finish it.No two relationships are the same. No two divorces are the same. So also in this case. Margareth and Adam have known each other since childhood and are, so to speak, destined to marry. Adam, finishing university before they are to marry, meets Randi and falls in love. But Randi does not want to wait for Adam to pick up the courage to break it off with Margareth, and leaves him.So the wedding between Margareth and Adam goes forward as planned. They move into Margareth's childhood home, get three nice children and seemingly enjoy a perfectly happy family life in the small town of Elmsford.Until one day on a trip to New York, Margareth and Adam meet Randi. Recently widowed, Randi sets out to win Adam back. She moves to a small town close to the family and of course, manages to entice Adam into an intoxicating affair. Totally different from solid, kind, pretty Margareth, Randi is an exciting, alluring, sexy, rather crude woman, who knows all Adam's weaknesses and has little regard for his responsibilities toward his wife and young children.A parallell story takes place in addition. Nina, orphaned at an early age, has grown up with Margareth as a combination of mother, sister and friend. Nina is a striking and talented interior decorator who goes to New York where she gets involved with a married man.Belva Plain gives a very detailed picture both of Margareth and Adam's divorce and Nina's experience of being the - if mislead - intruder. Marriage, duties, temptation, unfaithfullness - and healing. Life goes on, but will never be the same.As always, Belva Plain writes extremely well. The characterization in this book is very strong. How Margareth suspects but chooses to trust and even protect, her husband. How Nina believes completely and needs proof, the naked truth, in order to see.As the saying goes: \\"Everyone is blind when maddened by love\\", or rather, \\"when maddened by falling in love\\". And the cost may be excruciating."},{"Title":"Promises","review":"This book takes a look at the destruction of a marriage like no book I have ever read before.

This book is very realistic - about a man who makes the decision to have an affair and the after-effects of his decision.Adam meets Randi when he is in college, and begins a relationship with her. At the time, he is already engaged to Margaret. Randi seems to have him spellbound, though, and he thinks about breaking off his engagement so that he could be with Randi. Randi leaves him for another man, leaving him heartbroken.Fastforward to years later : Adam and Margaret are married for many years. They have children and are very happy. During a trip together, Adam runs into Randi for the first time after all these years. Randi seduces him again, and he struggles to be faithful, eventually giving in to her and beginning an affair. During the affair, Randi pressures him to leave his wife and be with her. Adam struggles with the choices he has to make.

Adam, on the other hand, surprises you... he has an affair with Randi before his marriage to Margaret but ends up breaking it off then he spots her years later in NYC and all his feelings about her come back. You can actually feel the magnetism between Randi and Adam, I sometimes found myself even thinking, \\"stupid, don't go meet her you have a wife!\\" The twists and turns in this book get you hooked and the ending?!? It's shocking. Like I said, definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Promises","review":"For some reason, I'm drawn to Belva Plain's books.

They have a crisis, they get through it, everyone meets a new mate immediately with whom they fall madly in love. I don't buy it, and believe me, I don't. I'll borrow it from the library first"},{"Title":"Promises","review":"I don't understand how the author could think it could be believable that these three &quot;perfect&quot; children could be the product of such selfish, self-centered parents. Neither Margaret, nor Adam ever consider their children when they make decisions. Yet supposedly, while they were married, they were wonderful parents. I work with people every day who have gone through greater loss than either of these two parents and still have thought of their children before themselves. It is a fantasy to believe that these parents were ever good parents. In addition, I think it is a lazy author who instead of dealing with emotion simply gets rid of someone.

I had finished the two books I brought for the cruise, and I was in a state of panic. I found Promises, and I thought it would be a quick interesting read. To my surprise I found a jewel and as realistic an author as I have ever read. Can it be believed that I was comparing her to Balzac for God's sake? I have since calmed down, but I shall find another of her books and read it sooner rather than later. A huge fan of Anne Tyler, I find some similarities, but uniquely to Belva, I find total realism -- How can Belva possibly understand what could go through a man's mind when faced with an irrestible urge to cheat.

It is a clean, straightforward look on marriage, morality, and clearly outlines what is right, what is wrong. It has a strong, clear message about love, its illusions, and what divorce does to children, and to me at least was far more realistic than what is out there. It clearly points a finger at who is right and who is wrong, and doesnt attempt to make anyy excuses for the \\"other point of view\\". What a breath of fresh air. I needed something like this.Someone mentioned that she was a feminist.

The first time I read it I couldn't put it down. The story got me in suspense abput what was going to happen to Margaret and Adam and Randi. Randi is such a powerful woman who came out of nowhere to find Adam and take him away from his family. Adam, being married to Margaret, knew that having an affair with Randi was wrong but he let Randi lead him on anyway. My favorite part of the story is when Adam and Randi are too fallen in love with each other and Margaret is still trying to ignore signs that Adam is with someone else. And Margaret is such a great caracter, having a great recovery after Adam leaves her. It really makes me think what I would have done in her place. I know it is not easy dealing with something like that, when a husband or wife leaves you for someone else. The end is also great.

John C. Waugh, in a most easily read fashion, will in less than 100 pages set you on what may become a lifelong passion. He shows how this 1400 Day War brought forth all that is important about the human drive to define its civilization, how so many could risk their lives for idealistic causes (including protecting their own homes and hearth, to paraphrase Cicero)....The reader will easily see how this short 4-year period turned the nation into the great object of desire for peoples world-wide, because it defined a nation of people in which anyone could aspire to accomplish as much, to define life as broadly and grandly as imaginable.True, this conflict did not resolve all conflicts, but it brought the underlying conflicts left unresolved in our founding documents out from behind the curtain for all the masses to see, and the blood shed, the pain endured for lifetimes by many more, really set the course we saw America follow for another century to come and more.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Fragile Miracle of Martin Gray","review":"This man went through hell on earth.

Stanley Jevons some years previously) that the former may have been the major inspiration for the latter. The previously-accepted interpretation has been that the Utopia was based primarily upon Plato's Republic but was also impregnated with the Christian idealism of the Book of Acts, the rising spirit of democracy, and the humanistic revival of Greek learning under Erasmus, Linacre, and Colet. The use of the suppositions country of Utopia (Nowhere) and of the narrator Hythloday have been regarded as fictitious devices to enhance the artistic effect of the work and to permit the author, as a rising politician, to disclaim responsibility for the doctrines advanced, should they later prove to be embarrassing.Morgan, however, suggests that Peru may have served as More's actual model and in support of this possibility he brings forward a considerable amount of circumstantial evidence. The writings of Prescott and the less well-known accounts by Markham and Means do show a striking similarity between life under the Incas and that described in the second book of the Utopia. Thus, in Peru, each couple upon marriage was given the use of a plot of land sufficient to maintain themselves, and were expected to work for the state, the church, and the community. The aged, the sick, and the widows and orphans were maintained on equal terms at public expense. The men practiced two or more trades in addition to agriculture, and work was rotated. The economy operated without money. Extensive public works were carried out in the form of roads, terraces, and irrigation canals. Goods were balanced between regions to prevent shortages, and populations were transferred in order to maintain substantial equality of income. The administrative hierarchy was very similar to that outlined in the Utopia. As a final bit of circumstantial evidence, the type of boat described by Hythloday in the Utopia is a close description of the native craft used both then and now on Lake Titicaca in Peru.But can these parallelisms be regarded as anything more than coincidental in face of the fact that More wrote the Utopia in 1516 while Pizarro did not land in Peru until 1528? In an interesting Appendix, Morgan points out that, while the explorations and foreign trade of the Portuguese were carefully shrouded in secrecy, they had clearly made several trips to the east coast of South America before 1515 and probably had made many more. He also shows that the overland route to Peru and the west coast of South America from the east coast of that continent was well known to the Indians. Morgan, therefore, suggests that More might well have learned about Peru on his mission to Antwerp in 1515-16 and that the supposedly fictitious sailor Hythloday may have been a real member of Amerigo Vespucci's expeditions. Hence, the description of Hythloday's travels in the early part of the first book may have been the actual account of the overland voyage from Brazil to Peru, which was, indeed, somewhat similar to what the traveler encounters today.This is an interesting and important study of the origins, types, and meaning of utopias. Of special significance are the chapters on the \\"Characteristics and Use of Utopias,\\" on \\"Why Utopias Fail,\\" and \\"Beyond Utopia.\\" Wide room is given to all forms of utopias in all stages of human history, from the primitive down to the present day. The Chinese and the Greek philosophies are, of course, drawn upon heavily. Morgan is especially concerned with establishing a parallel between the experience of Peru and the ideals presented in More's Utopia (pp. 14-88). His discourse on this topic occupies perhaps a disproportionate amount of space in a volume of very limited compass, and the conclusions are not wholly convincing. Nevertheless, the analogy supports the main principle which the author is laying down.Morgan's main thesis is that most utopias are not highly inventive but are based largely upon existing institutions and patterns which their \\"dynamic but none too original-minded leaders find lying about ready for use\\" (p. 13). These leaders add whatever they can of \\"creative originality,\\" and abundant illustrations of this are given. Morgan's idea is strongly reinforced by illustrations from many periods of human history.Many other treatises have been written on utopias, notably those of Hertzler, History of Utopian Thought, and Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia, but Morgan's acute analysis of the bases of utopianism has not been surpassed or equalled. By way of illustration, he finds that one of the causes of the failure of utopias is overemphasis on certain selected values as over against a larger number of other values and also overemphasis on the principle of unity and proportion in the light of these special values. Another is the failure of the utopians to sacrifice themselves for their own cause. At this point Morgan seems to be unduly influenced by Don Marquis's The Almost Perfect State (1927).Another difficulty with utopias is pointed out by Morgan, namely, the likelihood of boredom. \\"For every hundred who can stand adversity, there may be ten or only one who can stand utopia\\" (p. 181). \\"Terrible as world conditions are, the great problem of mankind today is not to achieve utopia, but to be prepared to survive it\\" (p. 182). If men were transported to utopia, they might well revolt against it. For this reason the approach to utopia should be gradual so that men may be tempered to its unprecedented demands.While the student of Mises, Hayek and the Austrian school may (rightly so) roll his eyes at the typical utopian economical and political ideals, this is a stimulating suggestion; and which, while it is by no means conclusively proved, gives weight to Morgan's thesis that reality provides a basis for ideals and that ideals in turn help to shape reality. For the student of the history of ideas this is an interesting book."},{"Title":"The theory of education in Plato's Republic,","review":"The reissuance of R.L. Nettleship's book on the educational meaning of Plato's Republic is a most welcome publishing event. In the few lines that follow, I want to justify my insuppressible exultation. I will confine my remarks to the Republic itself, on the assumption that the value of Nettleship's contribution is by now so well appreciated that it hardly requires further elaboration. A full-blown critique is, anyhow, beyond the scope of this review.The Republic is a wonderful book. In this book, Plato explicates the idea of education. He takes a somewhat circuitous route though. He begins by inquiring into the nature of justice and asking why justice pays. Finding himself having a hard time answering this question directly, he adopts the strategy of tackling it by inquiring as to the nature of a just state. In the course of his deliberations, he is led to the suggestion that, to be just, a state has got to assign its inhabitants occupational roles that are consonant with their respective abilities. At this juncture, he is faced with the challenge of delineating the scope of occupational roles that need to be filled. As one such occupational role, he singles out state guardianship - suggesting that, to be effective, a state has got to reserve a place for people who will serve as its guardians. They are to be saddled with the responsibility to protect the state from incursions from its neighbors. They also need to prosecute certain offensive campaigns. Ultimately, this role is indistinguishable from statecraft.Plato is keen on making the point that this job is more arduous and formidable than all of the others. It, therefore, takes a particularly well endowed individual to properly qualify for it. Such an individual will, after all, be called upon to perform tasks that are exceedingly taxing. Plato now engages in a protracted discussion on how best to assure that the best qualified people will wind up serving in the capacity of state guardian - which has by now been elevated to the status of rulership.He adopts the twofold strategy of: a) devising a system whereby, in each generation, the best qualified crop of young citizens are channeled into the rulership pool; and b) delineating a training process that will make members of this pool fit to assume leadership positions. In other words, it is to provide them a proper education. For the better part of the remainder of the dialogue, Plato finds himself occupied in a deliberation of the basic constituents a guardian's education. What kind of education must one undergo in order to qualify for a state leadership role? It needs to be borne in mind that the state in question isn't any old state but a perfectly ideal one. It is to exemplify justice; and its leader has to be capable of making sure that it does. It follows, therefore, that Plato is not inquiring into the nature of education per se but, rather, into the elements of an education that render it superior to any other education. The task with which this education is charged is nothing less than producing an unusually good and well integrated person.It may thus occur to someone to question the relevance of Plato's model for the more mundane type of education that interests us today. But to think thus is to lose sight of the fact that, on the contrary, our present-day conception of education is predicated on the premise that education must unleash each and every one of our students' potentialities for self-realization. It needs therefore to be geared toward making everyone - regardless of race, gender, social class, etc - a superior person. Insofar forth, Plato's project speaks directly to our own educational interests, and is not to be cast aside as irrelevant.The compass of this review will not accommodate a full-dressed discussion of the view of education put forth and elaborated by Plato. We will have to content ourselves with achieving much less. We simply draw attention to the fact that, ultimately, the proffered education is a scientific education - but not in the sense in which we nowadays use this term. Today, science is identified with empirical investigation; but this wasn't so in Plato's day. What it connoted was essentially systematic comprehension: an all encompassing, intellectually satisfying theory of the world, grounded in rigorous contemplation. This theory was, for Plato, dominated by the idea of the good. Scientific inquiry had, moreover, to be carried out utilizing a certain methodology. It had to be conducted dialectically - which is to say, by pure concentration on abstract ideas alone and on their mutual relations. No sensibles were to be admitted, only intelligibles. Such detached mental activity had, Plato thought, the potential to deliver a degree of accuracy unrivaled by studies of a more empirical kind.The underlying tenet of Plato's conception did, to be sure, owe much of its impetus to results already achieved by investigations carried out by the Pythagoreans some years earlier. But Plato single-handedly made manifest its vital contours.In expounding his theory, Plato is at pains to drive home the point that education is about weaning the student off of a sensible diet and acclimating him to a more strictly intelligible one. To this end, Plato employs - invokes, if you will - the metaphor of the cave. The ultimate educational goal being acquiring an ability to engage in dialectic, this is precisely what you would expect. Dialectic is very much a spontaneous, inner directed activity, wholly impervious to the machinations of spoon-feeding. It requires self-discipline and analytical, creative originality at its best, as much as anything else.Now, again, I don't claim thoroughness for this outline of Plato's view of education. I'll leave that to the others writing reviews. I mean merely to accentuate that Plato laid the groundwork for the conduct of educational activity as we conceive it today. In our attitude toward education, we are far from the Humanism characterizing the period of the Renaissance. We are, rather, in the shadow of the Enlightenment and, indeed, of the post-Enlightenment. And as such, we cling to an education rooted in hard facts, not in lofty modes of expression. Like Plato, we aspire to objectivity and shun sophistic relativity and ornamental rhetoric. Granted, the day may be fast approaching when Enlightenment is displaced by postmodernism as the dominant intellectual zeitgeist, and the constructive critique of a Richard Rorty-like personage carries the day and holds sway. But for the moment at least, Plato's Republic remains very much in vogue and serves as an apt foundation of education."},{"Title":"263 Brain Busters: Just How Smart are You, Anyway?

What about remarriage? Was I destined for singleness as a result of this? I read this book with thoughtfulness, prayer and an anguished soul. By the time I was finished I had peace, confidence and hope. Reading this book enabled me to see marriage as a covenant and divorce as the breaking of a covenant. This book does not offer a quick fix or easy answers for someone who wants to get out of a marriage but seriously looks at what constitutes the breaking of a marriage covenant and what the Bible has to say about divorce and remarriage.

I highly recommend it to any Christian who wants to be obedient to God's Word while dealing with divorce."},{"Title":"Second Chance: Biblical Principles of Divorce and Remarriage (Biblical Blueprints)","review":"This book by Ray Sutton has been important to my development on the issue of divorce. The book has completely changed my thinking on how a Christian should approach the difficult topic of divorce and remarriage.In _Second Chance_ (1988), which you can download for free, Sutton rejects the \\"no divorce/no remarriage\\" view which was and is commonly held among more conservative Christians. In this view, it is held \\"that under no circumstances is divorce permitted, and if it happens to an innocent spouse, he or she is not allowed to remarry.\\" (p. 7) Not only is the view lacking the support of Scripture, Sutton argues that it likely promotes promiscuity since it's a \\"solution\\" to the problem of marital breakdown that's simply not practical.Sutton also rejects the laissez faire view of divorce/remarriage, which holds that \\"anything goes.\\"From what other perspective, then, can divorce/remarriage be viewed? Sutton's solution is to look at the issue from a covenantal perspective. If marriage is a covenant, then guidance on the issue of divorce/remarriage must be determined by looking to the Bible's teaching on covenants.Says Sutton:\\"Marriage is a picture of the God-to-man covenant: Paul says, \\"Just as the Church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything...Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ has loved the Church\\" (Ephesians 5:22-25). So all we need to do is examine how a covenant is made and dissolved at the God-to-man level, so as to understand the principles of divorce and remarriage at the marriage level. In other words, making or renewing a covenant between God and man is analogous to forming a marriage covenant or entering a second marriage, and dissolving a covenant is analogous to divorce.\\"For example, when the God-to-man covenant is violated, God begins a process called a covenantal lawsuit. He sends His messengers or witnesses of the covenant to prosecute the offending party. If the guilty party does not repent, then He divorces the offender. As in the case of the Laodicean church, Jesus says to them that He is the witness bringing a lawsuit and He will dissolve His covenant with them if they don't repent...\\" (pp. 10-11)The structure of the book follows what Sutton believes to be the structure of any biblical covenant:Transcendence: God is the originator of all covenants.Hierarchy: God establishes authorities over us in our covenant with him.Ethics: Covenants involve demands (law) and require faithfulness to those demands.Sanctions: A covenant is entered by receiving and making promises under the condition of death.Continuity: Faithfulness to a covenant is rewarded with an inheritance.Based on this structure of biblical covenants, the first five chapters in _Second Chance_ deal with principles for divorce that are derived from the five parts of a biblical covenant. Ditto for chapters six through ten, which offer five principles for remarriage._Second Chance_ is strongly argued on several fronts. The book has a strong theological focus and a strong exegetical basis. But the pastoral emphasis is not lacking either. Sutton is not only a pastor, but a counselor with experience in the area of divorce/remarriage. This is clear as one moves through the book, particularly in the final three chapters where Sutton applies the principles of divorce/remarriage to real-life situations.Much more can be said about this book, but the main point is that Sutton brings clarity to the issue of divorce/remarriage by arguing covenantly. Instead of restricting himself to one or two verses in the New Testament, he looks to the whole counsel of God for guidance on the issue.Below is a summary of more specific points Sutton makes in the book:***DivorceI began in the first half of book with the subject of divorce. I started each chapter with the covenant to understand how a marriage covenant is dissolved and broken. Accordingly, I isolated five principles of divorce according to the five points of the covenant.First, I presented the principle of creation. All covenants begin here, so we had to begin here before we could ever understand anything about divorce. The principle is that God creates the marriage covenant and consequently there can be no such thing as no-fault divorce. It also teaches that God creates through imputation, a legal declaration on the basis of faithfulness, or a pledge to be faithful. It means that He also dissolves a covenant relationship on the basis of unfaithfulness, or a particular moral fault.Second, we considered the principle of jurisdiction. It says that a person is bound to his spouse's jurisdiction, or hierarchy, as long as that spouse is alive covenantally or physically. It is based on Paul's comments at the beginning of Romans 7, where he uses life and death in a covenantal context to refer to the termination of a marriage covenant.Third, we examined the ethics principle. It is the principle of cause and effect. In marriage, it means that if certain capital or covenantal offenses are committed then a person's relationship to God is destroyed and his marriage covenant dies.Fourth, we studied the principle of protection. It teaches that death is a sanction attached to the covenant, when it is ratified, to protect the innocent party. Death in the form of execution, excommunication or restitution is the appropriate penalty for breaking the covenant vows. When the guilty party enters a false covenant, the third party ends up sanctioning the innocent party through his infidelity.Fifth, the principle of transfer was presented. Upon the covenantal death of a spouse, the estate should be transferred to the faithful by means of a certificate of divorce.RemarriageWhen I approached remarriage, I used the same covenantal guide. I started with the covenant, specifically the New Covenant, to see how a new marriage covenant could be formed. I suggested five covenantal principles of remarriage.First, I laid out the principle of new covenant. I said that if God can create a new covenant between man and Himself, then there can be such a thing as remarriage. I clarified that a new covenant is a way of transcending the older covenant, tying this principle into the first point of the covenant.Second, I established the principle of the statute of limitations. Returning to the second point of the covenant, hierarchy, I said that the death of a spouse has a moral effect on a person that may take a period of time, a statute of limitations, to wear off, before remarriage should be entertained.Third, I developed the principle of equal yoke. A person considering a second marriage should be careful whom he marries. The Bible says that there should be an equal yoke, so I used the terms of the marriage covenant to clarify what kind of person a divorcee should remarry.Fourth, the principle of judgment was examined. Before remarriage takes place, two people should go to Biblical counselors to receive judgment on their decision. In other words, they should receive some competent and Biblical person's blessing or cursing. In this chapter, I also gave some guidelines for using counsel.Fifth, I presented the principle of adoption. I said that the way to deal with the stepchildren problem is to adopt children from previous marriages into the new marriage, to transfer inheritance to them. This way, a whole new life and a whole new inheritance is created for them, removing the level of hostility toward the second marriage. (pp. 168-169)***"},{"Title":"Second Chance: Biblical Principles of Divorce and Remarriage (Biblical Blueprints)","review":"I read this book some years ago, loaned it out and never recieved it back.

It's a dark, bizarre twist on the commedia dell'Arte character Harlequin, as he follows his modern-day Columbine.In short, the art is lovely, the story entertainingly bizarre, and Gaiman has once again created a beautiful story with one foot planted firmly in the annals of cultural history and the other in the wry, tongue-in-cheek modern world."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"This book is an odd mix of romance, tragedy, mythology, and humor... with a sprinkling of the grotesque. Typical Neil Gaiman, in other words. This short graphic novel follows Harlequin, the old clown of the italian commedia del'arte as he pursues his &quot;Missy&quot;, the woman to whom he has given his heart for a Valentine gift. Missy, meanwhile, remains oblivious to his pursuit. The book also contains a brief discussion of the historical Harlequinade, Mr. Punch, and pantomime in general.The story is bizarrely romantic, the twist ending moderately interesting, the language poetic, and the art by John Bolton nothing short of stunning (some panels look almost like photographs of real people, somehow done in pastel). The only issue I had with this book was that it seemed too short: we only see tantalizing glimpses of even the main characters. Undoubtedly Gaiman intended it this way, but I still would not have minded a bit more. All in all a good read, and well worth the pricetag."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"In this comic, Neil Gaiman, the auteur writer behind the wonderful, epic Sandman comics teams up with painterly artist John Bolton (who worked on Gaiman's fine original Books of Magic miniseries) in a one-shot comic based on the English variatons of the Italian commedia dell'arte characters of Harlequin, Columbine, Pantaloon, and the Doctor. Mr. Gaiman quite graciously and somewhat unusually offers background information on his source characters in an appendix following the main story. I would suggest you read the story, then the appendix, then re-read the story. This work could easily be seen as a companion piece to Gaiman and McKean's Mr. Punch. Familiar Gaiman themes are present here, delivered with the usual confidence, with no particular connection to the Sandman oeuvre other than a possible clue into the background of the Mad Hettie character. Bolton's work is clearly derived from photographs, too much so for my taste, but still attractive and effective. The lettering is fetching but very small. None of Gaiman's non-Sandman works are as continually rich and fascinating his Sandman masterwork, but this will make a fine addition to the Gaiman fan's library."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"Based on the old mime shows, Gaimen has written a fickle and fun tale of love and hearts given freely; of yearning for the affection we all crave, and how we are sometimes oblivious to those who love us the most.Told in the first person by Harlequin himself, he leads us through the giving of his heart, literally, to his beloved Columbine. Dancing across the pages, flitting through the city as he follows Missy, meeting up with his modern day cast of characters: Columbine, Peirrot, the Doctor, Pulcinella, Pantaloon, and others.Gaimen has a particular talent with Graphic Novellas in that he manages to tell a rich, lush tale with only a few words. Harlequin Valentine is one of his better works, with artist John Bolton bringing Gaimen's story to life, animating it with sharp photographic quality characters cavorting in stark relief against fuzzy and uncertain backgrounds. This style of art work really brought Harlequin and Missy and the others directly to the center of our attention, keeping the focus on the characters despite the few words, and smoothing the flow of the tale to read like silken thoughts of love.At the end of the story, Gaimen adds a short piece with a terrific explanation and glossary of the Harlequinade and its characters; which for those like me who are uneducated in older forms of theatrical art is a real bonus to the book. Also added as a tasty treat is a little tale called \\"Drawn in Darkness\\" that Gaimen added about artist John Bolton.If you like Graphic Novels that have a softer, more playful side, you will love this particular Gaimen. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"What a brilliant, brilliant book. I think it was the perfect length. Any longer and it might have gotten monotonous, and we simply cannot have THAT. Oh, this book was delicious. I ADORE all sorts of modern mythology, and we all know that Gaiman is the undisputed MASTER of that particular genre. Harlequin Valentine is a precious little romance with a vicious little twist at the end. So, sit down with a plate of hash browns and some ketchup, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"... but it kinda peters out towards the end.A lot of the other reviewers have covered the basic premise of the plot already so I won't repeat what's been said.The artwork itself is beautiful, detailed painterly quality pictures by John Bolton. You won't be disappointed in that aspect. The color palete is cold (his Valentine is painted as a pale, waifish figure) but warm at the same time due to the splashes of red from the Harlequin's outfit and yes, his heart...Personally, I found the story to be a little short, thus making it a bit unsatisfying for me. The beginning is promising with Harlequin pinning his heart to her door and Valentine's indifference as she removes the pin to take it down. She travels around town trying to find the owner of the heart but without explanation, knows who it is at the end by devouring it. Why would she devour it, this woman who had been clueless before?All in all, this would have been better if Neil had fleshed the story out more. The characters seem to be 2-dimentional, at the precipice of being 3-dimentional had a bit more effort been made to do so. Great for diehard to midhard Gaiman fans, but not particularly impressive if it's your first Gaiman read."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"john bolton is an astonishingly brilliant artist. i bought this on blind faith in his artistic abilities, and because i prefer hand painted art to computer generated art, and bolton generally sticks to real paint, pencil and ink, as well as having delivered a truly heartfelt rendition of \\"sitting on the dock of the bay\\" in the early 90's.well, i was nauseatingly disapointed to find that most of this book was computer photos with a little bit of painting over them. bolton is such a capable illustrator, and this is basically photos tweaked in photoshop, and very bland uncompelling photos at that. if you want to see some john bolton artwork that is nothing short of astonishing, pick up \\"marada, she-wolf\\" or \\"batman manbat\\", and prepare to have your mind blown away every time you re- read them indefinitely. bolton also did a great \\"kull the conquerer\\" story in \\"bizzarre adventures #26\\" and he did incredible realistic watercolor illustrations in an \\"epic illustrated #7 and #15\\" story called \\"the llehs\\" about gorgeous, naked little underwater chicks riding seahorses and going through exiting adventures as only epic illustrated did it."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"This graphic novella, which began as a short story from Gaiman, is his wonderfully inventive ode to the English Harlequinade, which came from the French Vaudeville and on centuries back to its spawning grounds within the Italian Commedia dell'arte. The Harlequinade, essentially, is romantic comedy wherein the characters remain set and the same while the roles played change hands from one Pantomime performance to the next.In Harlequin Valentine, we see the immortal and fittingly Buster Keaton-esque Harlequin, longingly lustful for the attentions of his Missy, his Columbine. So lost in feeling that he literally gives his heart to her by way of pinning it outside her apartment door. The natural and whimsical interactions among the characters works as a kind of poetry in the sense of human observation. And like a true Harlequinade- by the end of the tale all roles have thusly changed. Just as with in all true relationships, the natural progressions lead to common ends always- everything changes, while everything stays the same. Comedy in the greatest sense appeals to a sympathy of sadness by comparison, and this book provides masterful representation of nothing less.Bolton's art is absolutely stunning here. He dances photographic realism into a world all his own, replete with slightly otherworldly nuances which only give the reader a higher understanding of the inner personae for all characters suggested by the prose. This is a fine artist in form, but his storytelling is what gives other graphic artists inferiority complexes galore. Beautiful, dynamic, and wholeheartedly insightful.I know that Neil Gaiman may have finally outgrown his britches enough so that it is currently status quo cool to demean his work. I will not do that however, at least not with regards to this, as Harlequin Valentine is easily the sort of work that can attract and romance even those persons still completely ignorant of the world of comics. It is that good.Do not dare make the mistake of callously judging this as a \\"girly\\" book, or a theatrical soap opera of emotion; this, like other works by either Gaiman and/or Bolton, is a tale full of sound and fury and told by madmen, signifying nothing (only to those unfortunates who happened to have garnered failing grades from any collegiate-level philosophy programme). The actual collaboration of this story led to Gaiman's first solo film project: a documentary on the absurdist life of Bolton himself. The characters of Harlequin Valentine, much like their writer/artist team themselves, are fully-formed and iconic, like ancient mythology filtered through medieval Renaissance artworks.Well, the creators may be all too human at times, but the characters inhabiting the world of the Harlequin can at least attract anyone with heart."},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","review":"The artwork is beautiful, the story is average. :) C for effort.

Hong Kong's landscape had changed at least 3 to 4 times in the past thirty years. Most of the familiar street corners are now huge faceless shopping malls.

What he didn't tell us was it was a comic book, not a novel. The art is bad and the story is even worse. Based on his opinion, we bought one and, frankly, threw it in the garbage."},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"Starring the most lovable young curmudgeon in comic book history, Courtney Crumrin, \\"Coven Of Mystics\\" is one of the most enderaing, laugh-out loud hilarious, tragic, bittersweet, imaginative and triumphant books I've ever read, comic book or prose, fiction or non-fiction. It's also one of the scariest, with the Rawhead 'N Bloody Bones bog monster more frightening than most of the nasties conceived of by Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft. As far as comedic value goes, I rank it with \\"Fawlty Towers\\", \\"Fierce Creatures\\", and \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\", and the \\"Gon\\" comics. On mix of triumph and tragedy, fear and delight and whimsey, think \\"E.T.\\", \\"Bambi\\", and even \\"Simon Birch\\".With a superb cast of characters - on par with the cast of the \\"Batman\\" or \\"X-Men\\" lines of comics, and unique, quirky art so expressive, especially in certain panels, that it sums up the expression 'A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words' perhaps better than anything I've ever encountered. As a bonus, the back of the book reprints, free of words, blurbs or logos, the original covers to the individual comics of the mini-series this volume reprints.If you like this (or love it like I do), I'd also recommend the following (or if you're into the following I'd recommend \\"Coven Of Mystics\\") - {comics} - the other Courtney titles, \\"Gon\\" and \\"Bone\\" (for starters); {novels}- \\"The Gnole\\" by Alan Aldridge, Steve Boyett and Maxine Miller; \\"Balook\\" by Piers Anthony; \\"Duncton Wood\\" by William Horwood (definately not for younger readers despite a huge abundance of beauty and charm); {movies} - \\"Spirited Away\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\", \\"Fairy Tale: A True Story\\" \\"Castle In The Sky\\", \\"Fluke\\" (young kids should watch with a grown-up), \\"Princess Mononoke\\" (same deal as \\"Fluke\\")"},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"I bought the first comic of Courtney Crumrin on a whim, and I eagerly bought the newest installment, the Coven of Mystics. The plot of this one is even better than the first one. It adds depth to all the existing characters and also introduces us to some promising new ones, such as Ms. Crisp, Courtney's new no-nonsense teacher, and Tobermory, the leader of the cats. The Coven of Mystics also alludes to the politics of the magical community that Courtney is only beginning to venture into.Basically this story is about love, whether romantic or familial. The story takes many turns, some of them can be terrifying and bad things sometimes happen to good people. It's a very rewarding graphic novel and one well worth your money."},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"Courtney is a school girl whose family has moved in with their great-uncle. The clueless parents have no idea what is really going on and they make are pretty much left out of this volume.Instead, we get more interaction between Courtney and her uncle, a powerful sorcerer. This volume has more of a continuous plot than the first and gives us a better idea of the magic community.Courtney may be tough and headstrong, but even she knows to be careful when something very nasty has been summoned in the woods. Will her uncle be able to stand against it?Then Courtney is privileged to visit the night world of the cats and meets a new friend. A friend that others believe has harmed a popular sorceress. Courtney and her uncle work to save him.As Courtney works to save her friend, she learns more of the Council and the politics that seem to drive it. Courtney is not pleased.These four tales are a little darker than those of the first volume, but Courtney shows good character development (see what happens when she reads a poem in school) and the additional information about the world of magic is very well done.An excellent continuation of the series. I look forward to more."},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"Several other reviewers have gone into detail about the Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics, so I'll skip to other aspects of the story. This is definitely NOT for little children, at least not without some serious parental guidance, as many opening and the ending scenes are very gruesome, and are the stuff of pure nightmares.This story introduces a very horrible man-eating, soul-enslaving giant Hobgoblin, Tommy Rawhead, whom even other Night things fear, which forces the Council of the Coven to call in their trump card, Courtney's Uncle Aloysius, to find it and do battle with it especially after it murders a prominent warlock, his wife and their children in a most particularly gruesome fashion. He must find a way to stop it before it murders anyone else in the Coven. At the same time a mystery unfolds around another Night thing, Skarrow, whom Courtney discovers is involved in the Council's political power struggles, and is being blamed, perhaps unfairly for having put a spell on a local powerful witch he once served. Is it related to Tommy's murderous spree? Courtney works to find out, and in the process does some major growing up, changing her forever from an innocent, if grumpy kid, into a girl who now sees the real world for what it is.This is the darkest of the three Courtney Crumrin stories by far and in some ways the most rewarding because of the growing up Courtney must do in order to solve the duel mysteries. As a result, this is not for everyone, and some may not like the direction it goes with, especially since Ted Naifeh pulls no punches in telling his story."},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"Ted Naifeh has done it again, proving he is one of the most amazing voices working in comics today. The tales here are a bit darker than his previous Courtney Crumrin series, but character has grown a bit since first discovering the world of magick, so it works well. Beautiful art, a compelling storyline, and a heroine who anyone who's ever felt alone can relate to. Wonderful work, Ted!"},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"This is the second book in the Courney Crumrin series. I absolutely love this series. In this book Courtney has to face a darker foe than ever before and it was a fun and exciting read.Courtney Crumrin is settling in to both her new house and new school. She is learning how to deal with the Night Things better, but when a new and more horrible Night Thing threatens their community the local Coven of Mystics blame it on a Night Thing named Skarrow. Both Courtney and her uncles suspect that Skarrow is innocent, but they need to both protect the village from the horrible new Night Thing and prove Skarrow's innocence before the Mystics find and take him into custody.The story for this installment in the series was a lot more complicated than the last series. There were also a lot of fun things that happened. Courtney is a great character. She is tough and smart and sarcastic and funny. She grows a lot in this book too and finally starts to realize that it might be better to try and make some friends at school than always be by herself.Her uncle tries to keep Courtney out of many of the conflicts, but Courtney is stubborn and always involves herself. In the end she usually does more good than bad so it is all good. I really enjoy the relationship she has with her uncle; they both help each other out and really seem to care about one another.Uncle Aloysius is an awesome character. He has a good dry sense of humor, really cares about Courtney and can seriously kick butt with both his magic and his sword.There is a lot of action in this series and I loved how each chapter had an independent story as well as building on a larger story arc. I enjoyed the new types of Night Things we meet, I enjoyed Courtney's stent as a cat, and I enjoyed when she wandered down into the realm of the Night Things.The first book in the series I got as an ebook to review and that was in full color. This book was in black and white only and that made the illustration more lackluster than the full color version I had seen for the first book. Naifeh does an excellent job conveying facial expression and I never found the drawings or story confusing. The style of drawing is pretty cartoony for the characters' bodies, although the backgrounds are very detailed. In general the illustration did a good job of supporting the story; I just wish we could see this in full color like the first book.Overall I really, really enjoyed this book. It has an interesting and fun story that is complex. Courtney grows a lot in this book and begins to come into her own as a witch. We get to see a lot more of Uncle Aloysius in action; he is an awesome character. I highly recommend this for fans of fantasy graphic novels; this book is appropriate for middle grade and older. If you liked this book I would also recommend checking out Kazu Kibuishi'sAmulet seriesor Jeff Smith'sBoneseries."},{"Title":"Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 2: Courtney Crumrin & The Coven of Mystics (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels))","review":"Courtney Crumrin...dear lovers of magical graphic novels,... is simply wonderful.

INCREDIBLE."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"In this book Helen Andelin presents her philosophy of how a wife should behave towards her husband.I knew that Mrs Andelin and I could never be soul-mates when she tells us that the ideal woman should be a blend of Agnes Wickfield and Dora from 'David Copperfield'. Great. The two women she wants me to emulate are the two who of all the women in English literature I despise the most.Her view of relations between husband and wife are rigid and uncompromising. If you are to make your husband happy you must be admiring, adoring, hang on his every word, put him first always, be obedient, sweet, girlish, childlike, a Domestic Goddess,never ever work outside the home, and do not let him have too much sex. And, above all, you must not kill your own snakes. Snakes feature prominently in this book, not killing them is avery important part of being a Fascinating Woman. women who kill their own snakes are not fascinating, and that's that.Now, I have a husband who is terrified of snakes, and if we lived in a country that was troubled by them it would be a major asset in his eyes if I was capable of killing them. I therefore do not think you can generalise that snake-killing women are necessarily undesirable to all men. He finds it very useful that I am not afraid of spiders (he hates them) and can get them out of the bath for him. Fascinating women, naturally, are supposed to be afraid of spiders.Sometimes Mrs Andelin is strangely unobservant. For instance, she quotes Proverbs Chapter 31 as a description of the perfect wife. yet the wife in Proverbs is not childlike, and she is a businesswoman as well as a homemaker, something Mrs Andelin is dead against. Mrs Andelin doesn't seem to have noticed this.The book is full of glowing testimonials by women who have put the principles outlined in this book into practice and found it makes them happier. Good for them. However, if like me, you are a woman who is constitutionally incapable of being a combination of Agnes Wickfiled and Dora, you may take comfort from the thought that not all men require women to behave like this. Some men do prefer women who behave naturally instead of putting on an act all the time. And some men like women who can kill snakes."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am a working mother with advanced degrees and a solid marriage, so after hearing a fellow scholar (and feminist) rave on about the empowerment she found in submitting more to her husband's masculinity, I had to read this book so I could convince her of the error of her ways.

I am happy to report losing the argument.What I learned:~ Elevating my husband made him want to do more for me~ Nurturing my husband's masculinity (per the book's instructions) resulted in a happier, more helpful spouse~ Putting his needs above mine did wonders for our marriage--he started treating me like he did when we were dating (more than a decade ago)~ I learned that, to be treated like a queen, I first need to help my husband realize he is king, rather than one of my simpering subjects.Why the book (in concept) turned me off before I read it:~ I didn't want to have to learn how to care for HIS psyche; shouldn't he just automatically worship me?~ I feared that \\"submitting\\" to my husband meant elevating him above me in some wayWhy this book's method WORKS:~ Submission doesn't mean elevating man above woman. It means acknowledging that he is supreme in his sphere, while woman reigns in HER sphere. Both are equals.~ The masculine pride of a man is easily crushed when the woman tries to run the man's sphere for him; he is prone to flee/tune out when this happens~ When the woman takes charge of HIS sphere, the man tunes out and goes in search of a place where his powers are needed (even to another woman or home)~ By developing our separate (masculine and feminine) spheres, we elevate each other, and the man feels like king of his domain~ Men will fight to the death to stay in a situation where they feel empowered, needed, and loved. They run away from domains where don't feel this way."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I'm a college student -- just received the book a few days ago and have read it twice since. What an amazing book! The only crime this book is guilty of is of telling you to be accountable for your actions. Basically, you have two choices. You can be sour and complain about everything, going about your duties without a kind word for anyone. Or you can be happy and make everyone else around you happy. This is not just about male/female relationships but about every human relationship and, after reading this book, I see that there's no excuse for sour selfish behavior. I live at home and it's amazing how when I make a concious decision to be cheerful and only say kind things to my family, how much happier they are. I also see how the comments my mother makes, really hurt my dad and brothers -- far worse than they hurt my sister and I.And, why not? Why not take consideration for other's feelings? Why not, instead of getting offended, ask yourself how you can make that person happy? There's nothing to lose and everything to gain.It's funny. My dad does not talk -- at all. Since I've been going out of my way to say nice things and not disrespect him, he's been a lot more talkative and he smiles. Whatever this book advises you to do is a small price to pay for making those around you happy!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I got this book before I was even married and for more than 20 years consistently, honestly and thoroughly followed it. It was right there next to my Bible, till it became part of who I was. I found that my husband,&quot;ate it up&quot;. He continued to take and take and I continued to give and give. Now I have NOTHING left to give. Yes, I'm still married, but I have no hope and no desire that it will ever be more than it is now. I staked my life on this book. &quot;If you follow these principles, he can't help but to love you.&quot; It just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It seems to me that this book has a great impact, whether positive or negative. I have to admit that it was hard to read. Ms. Andelin has no fear of stating her beliefs in a &quot;in your face&quot; manner. I had a hard time accepting some of the things she had to say about women and their role in the home. But what I finally realized was that she was only reiterating what the Scriptures say. Many think that this book is outdated. Do you also believe that the Bible is outdated? Do we put it aside because it is antiquated? I struggled long and hard over alot of the points Ms. Andelin made. But she is RIGHT! Why is it so hard for us to put our husbands first, or to think of someone before ourselves? Thankyou so much, Ms. Andelin, for having the courage to write a book that has changed so many lives of the past, present, and future. God will truly bless you!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book has taught me more about myself than anything. With a major focus on forgiveness, this book is a mental mirror and it gives a clear reflection of self. Forgiveness is such an important gift we must give freely in life. Without it, our relationships remain tainted and our situations continue to cause misery in our lives. This book, based on biblical principles, takes us away from feminism to back to the way God intended for us to be. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Helen Andelin has certainly &quot;won&quot; her share of criticism from the feminists for her completely politically incorrect book! And while I do not agree with all of her points (particularly the &quot;childlike anger&quot; section), I find most of her advice fun, practical, whimsical and helpful. Andelin sounds a clarion call for women to be women -- and to enjoy every minute of being the &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Why go through life trying to be just like a man when you can enjoy the benefits of chivalry and gentility by acting like a lady? And being a lady in Andelin's book doesn't mean being a dummy, either (Andelin's critics just haven't read enough of the book to get this message loud and clear). Andelin encourages a broad, deep liberal arts education and a wide knowledge of all things worthy and good in the world to make a woman intelligent, interesting, and, yes, &quot;fascinating.&quot; From the down-to-earth tips on personal beauty and dress to the more philosophical chapters on respecting men and learning to be feminine from the inside out, _Fascinating Womanhood_ is a super read and something worth pondering."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Putting these principles into ACTION and seeing the results for yourself (Not just skimming through and mocking the book out of hand),will prove to you whether they work or not.My marriage was good to start with, but I carefully read the book and tried the principles out, I was bowled over by the almost instantaneous results!I love being around my husband and he with me. I don't care whether this sounds stupid, or if it makes people angry. Even men I come into contact with in my daily life are responding in a very positive way, just because I am more feminine generally. I became a happier and more fulfilled person all round tooPlease TRY these principles out for yourself. This has been utterly life-changing and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is fantastic although I do not agree 100% with all of the things she says,however, I think it is a good step forward when it comes to making your relationship and marriage work with your husband.The book has two parts the first she describes Angelic qualities, which mainly deal with accepting your husband, appreciating him, admiring him, making him number one, the masculine and feminine roles.She describes the man as the leader, protector, and provider these qualities of a man are itself important and must be appreciated by a woman for a man to further displays these qualities. And many women complain about this book saying \\"oh why should the woman be the perfect one\\". That is a fallacious logic right there because the man himself will begin to change once he realizes how feminine his woman has become. So in a sense if you preserve the qualities such as your man being the leader, protector, and provider he will do those things making you feel as if you are a queen.After all most women do appreciate masculine men, however these type of men are fast disappearing due to feminists attack on the family and marriage. Feminism has become a true epidemic, which can possibly be destroyed if women decide to chose family instead of a career. Andelin, gives tips and suggestions on how to praise and admire your man for his abilities such as him being the leader, protector, and provider.She also talks about the family finances how bill paying should be left to the man and how a woman must learn to understand her man.By far my favorite section was the Domestic Goddess chapter. I believe homemaking is such an important part yet often time is overlooked because of feminism and the false belief that women should get a career and work, a working wife often time creates chaos and distortion in the home wrecking families, which can be seen in divorce statistics. So many social ills are caused by broken homes, especially in single parent households, most criminals in fact come from a broken or a single parent home. There is a very good book called the Garbage Generation by Daniel Amneus, who exposes how this matriarchal system is in fact destroying society. If you enjoyed this book you will enjoy Garbage Generation.The second part of the book consists of the human qualities which involve a feminine appearance, Manner, Nature, very helpful in that sense although I had hoped she would elaborate more,however, there is plenty of literature regarding femininity. In this same section she also talks about Childlikeness, which I admit I was not too fond of but after reading this type of approach makes a lot of sense when it comes to fighting, because after all who really wants to spend their time fighting with their loving husband.Another section which I loved besides the Domestic Goddess was the section about the working wife. She lists when women are justified in working this can happen under three conditions which include Compelling emergencies, furthering the husbands education, and if a woman is older and the children have left the home.In addition she lists why a woman should not work these include to ease the pinch, for luxuries (who really needs 2 BMW's?), when you are bored, to do something important (she argues that it is more important to stay home anyway because successful, happy and healthy children are the bedrock of a healthy society after all).And the last reason she gives why a woman is not justified in working is because \\" to ease the load for the man\\", we see many women working today because they feel that they should help, well this is the most ridiculous and fallacious logic. Even if a woman works outside the home she is stuck with all of the cleaning, the man certainty will not do a 50/50 job when it comes to chores. In fact a man who feels his wife should work is less of a man in my opinion and does not appreciate her in fact he is using her by having her work outside and inside the home. That is what feminism has done it is prostituting women into becoming worthless work machines.Two things I did not like about the book include that she quotes verses and gives religious meaning, since I am not religious it is not applicable to me. Second the book contains success stories by women stuck in bad marriages and then after they read the book their marriages became perfect. I did not like and found it disturbing that in some stories before reading Fascinating Womanhood these women were abused physically, I condone such men and I believe these type of women were better of leaving the husband instead of fixing the marriages.Overall the book is amazing and worth the read I recommend this to any woman who is not yet married and who is planing to have a traditional marriage or a woman who wants to solve her marital issues. I have discussed the premise of the book with my to be husband who whole heartedly agrees with these principles and even told me himself that he is happy I know these things now before we get married. I will keep this book for my future daughters to read because I want them to have successful marriages and I want them to persevere in being successful and happy stay at home moms."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I liked this book initially. It's very much a how-to, nuts-and-bolts kind of book. But if you're looking for a Biblical approach to womanhood, this isn't it. Some of the ideas that the author promotes are great (men need respect, honor, etc.), but others seem to be more like \\"how to manipulate your man so he does what you want him to\\". That said, I believe it can be useful for someone who is trying to rediscover their femininity."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The gist of Fascinating Womanhood is that you should stop trying to improve your husband and instead improve yourself. She explains a lot about the differences between men and women. I've been married for 26 years, I have a lot of kids and my marriage was already good. But it has made things much better. It's not supposed to be manipulative. I wouldn't say it \\"worked.\\" It just gave me a better understanding of my husband, my sons and men in general. A lot of what she says offends the sensibilities of modern American women. But she is also right. I've been around long enough to say that nearly every women of my acquaintance who is having marital problems is doing something that this book would caution against. This being said, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone married to a sociopath, a narcissist or an addict. Seriously! And I can see that it would be really bad for women in cults as well, since they have a warped understanding of freedom. But if your marriage was good way back when and you are trying to figure out a way back there, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read 40 of the 53 reviews on this book. I am amazed that there are definitely two camps of thought! I first read this book in the early 80's. My marriage was just beginning and I used the philosophy of the book. It helped that I had a mother as a role model, who followed the ideals natually, without having to read the book. She was a great role model. But this book put into words what she knew instinctively, and I didn't.I am now purchasing the book for my three daughters. I want them to know the proper way of looking at marriage and love. I also want a copy for a dear friend of mine who is having marital difficulties. I have tried to tell her what I would do. Finally, I thought of this book and got on the Internet and found that it is still in print. In fact, it has been updated. I have purchase four copies!I have been able to balance being a chiropractor and a mother of five wonderful children and a pretty fantastic wife. It is a classic book! It is FASCINATING! Obviously, I highly recommend this book to any woman who wants a fascinating life!!!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is not, in fact, the classic book that recommends meeting your husband at the door wearing nothing but saran wrap. No, this is the book which &quot;assigns,&quot; at the end of one chapter, the task of handing over responsibility for the finances to your husband. It suggests that you say, &quot;Honey, I don't want to be responsible for the finances anymore, because it is a burden to me. I know it will be easier for you, because you are a man.&quot;Probably the most frightening suggestion in this book is how to handle conflict. It suggests that women express anger in a &quot;childish&quot; manner; &quot;Pout, toss your curls, and stamp your foot.&quot; The object of the exercise is to make your husband think you're cute, and thus to feel protective of you (and then presumably to give you what you want).While this book was definitely good for some entertainment at a party, I hesitate to suggest buying it new, for fear of rewarding the author. (Does anyone know what ever became of the author or her eight children? I'd be just fascinated to find out...."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating Womanhood reveals the true meaning of patience, understanding, and acceptance when dealing with members of the oppisite sex, whether it be your husband, brother, father or friend.Trying to understand the characteristics of a male is expressed in this magnificent collaberation of stories.Accepting a male in every aspect and exploring the joy and privellege of being a woman are the areas so eloquently defined in this exciting and inspirational book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you are the type of woman I am - intelligent, hard-working, creative, thinking, and marriage-loving, you will enjoy this book. I had all the right motives, but all the wrong moves. Fascinating Womanhood helps women to really understand men and give them the things they need to be truly happy and fulfilled. This book is not full of manipulation or acting, but good advice about needs of men and women and their roles. It teaches you how to be compatible with men, not in competition with them, and how to happy in your sphere and not struggling in their's. The book is a bargain at any price."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found the chapters on understanding how men are put together very good. I remind my self of them often. I may not agree or attain all that the author says, but I've kept this book for many years and find myself refering to it again and again. If women are honest they will find what the author says is really true."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is a must read by all women who want to have a happy marriage. We have lost the art of being feminine due to the so called &quot;women's rights movement&quot;. They have lied to us -- being a femine woman is our best defense regarding our so called 'rights'. If you DO NOT want a happy husband who cherishes, protects and provides for you, then don't read and apply the suggestions found in this book.I began appling this book a year ago. I can honestly say this past year has been filled with more happiness, love, and adoration than I have ever experience in the previous 26 years of marriage. I feel and am protected and provided for in such a way that I no longer doubt his love and desire to be married to me until death.This book will change your marriage if you apply the concepts of accepting your husband as he is; learn to be childlike in your anger, appreciation and trust; and become a domestic goddess. I can almost promise - he will then treat you as a King treats his Queen.What is taught in this book runs smack in the face of what we are taught about who we are as women of the 21st century. For those brave enough -- this book will change us and the course of this Nation."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My mother gave this book to me several years ago and after reading it the first time, there were some things that I was not ready to submit to my husband. So after a year or so I read it again, this time submitting ALL of my will and I could not believe the change in my husband. He is a completely different person. And I'm the one who changed! (or so I thought) I have bought about 10 copies of this book. I buy it for all of the young couples in our church. I really works, but you HAVE TO APPLY IT! Thank you Helen for an awesome book that still works wonders in marriages YEARS later!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I've been married for 22 years and can now freely admit I love homemaking and being a wife and mother. Many women naturally do, but in my case a lot of credit must go to this special book I received as a young woman, full of encouragement and timeless wisdom.I found the section about understanding men especially helpful as well as the insightful chapter about developing a worthy character and a feminine manner- which I severely lacked in the early days. But my most favorite chapter describes the \\"domestic goddess\\" who lives in the present, doing her duty, giving all her love and attention to it, like a little girl playing house, doing the same things over and over again but with great dedication and enthusiam. She isn't rushed to get it all done with and on to other things. Carrying on this attitude, all our activities- big or small- become joyful.This book says a lot about attitude. Yet, I think that the most important point Mrs. Andelin brings out is that happiness isn't just a matter of deciding to be happy; it requires understanding nature's laws or karma. And it is a matter of following those natural laws or God's plan in order to be successful in life, marriage or any other activity. In that way an attraction for goodness and right attitudes naturally grow.Finally, looking back at my life before this book, after having been raised by a feminist dominated family, I realize I had carried an inner hatred for women and anything feminine. Now everything is the opposite. I'm proud to be one of the fairer sex and no longer try to imitate men. This book gave me a new look at what it means to be in a woman and the power women really have. It made me realize that feminism is actually anti-feminine!I've passed this book on to my daughter and plan to give it to my future daughter-in-laws as well. It should be required reading for all women who care about the future of our world.Thank you so much, Mrs. Andelin. You have acted as a very dear friend all these years every time I reached for this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is truly sick. The author uses scare tactics in order to make women crumble. Her stories are not even accurate! My favorite is the one about the marriage of Leo and Sofia Tolstoy (her name was actually Sonya). She whips up this tale about how Tolstoy found Jesus Christ and wanted to follow Christian teachings by giving all his wealth away. Mean, nasty \\"Sofia\\" rebelled against his rightful manly leadership because she liked wealth and sin. In the end, the Countess begged for his love, but he hated her. This is made up drivel! Tolstoy was brilliant and, as is often the case, VERY difficult to live with. He embraced first one ideal, and then another...creating a life of insecurity for his wife and the many children they had together. She was loyal to the end, however. Read a history book...not this garbage."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was definitely not for me. I would have appreciated some biblical foundations on where some of these opinions of womanhood come from. Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me. If you are going to put this book into your Spirit, please know that God loves you more than your husband could ever love you, and he will show you by faith in JESUS in the LIVING WORD of GOD (bible), how to love and honor your husband."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I agree that we are divided into two camps: the feminists, and those who aren't. I believe Helen is not a perfect person, but she does share some very good insights that have been so helpful. I think that those who shoot her down either do not understand what she is talking about or they did not apply it correctly in their own lives. You'd be disgusted with a supposedly wonderful recipe if it failed when you tried it, not realizing you left out an ingredient or did something wrong. May I suggest the error is not in the writer!My father gave the book to my mother before they were married, and they have been married 28 great years. She passed it on to me when I was 16, and as I read it I though Helen must be describing my Mom as her model. Mom is not a doormat by any means; she is a Godly woman who teaches at a Christian school and Sunday school, and my dad and I don't know what we would do without her. But my dad is definitely the leader in the home, and I believe they have discovered the proper balance that God designed between love, leadership, and submission.As I read this book for the first time, the Lord opened my eyes and began to transform me. People can't believe I used to be a tomboy. After I read that book, I began receiving interest from many young men. It works, because it's the way we are designed. God made woman as the helpmete for the man, not for his slave. When a couple gets married, they are one flesh. Who would want to trample over part of themselves? There must be a leader, though--how well would any company work if everyone had to be the president? Everyone is important to success, but they have different functions.I have talked to others who have also benefited so much in their relationships after reading this. If you are not insisting that you must lower yourself so you can be equal with men (not that they are lowly, but they want to have us on a pedestal), you will probably find this book most helpful and eye-opening."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am 28 years old and a mother of 3 children. I was raised to be very independent. If I wanted something done I had to do it myself. Even though on the outside I don't look rough.I am tall & slender, my attitude was rough. When I read this book there were some things that were REALLY hard for me to accept because of my attitude and I am not one just to go along with something.But I decided to accept it and apply it and see what happened. Me and my husband will be married for 10 years this year and I feel like our marriage has just begun. The wisdom in this book has brought joy and peace in my life. This book contrary to some reviews is not being a door mat to your husband or being weak. There are exceptions in every family. My husband & I do not follow everything exatly in the book. You do what works best for your family. I can understand that a lot of people have pride, selfishness & self righteousness, I know because I have been that way for many years. This information is invaluable. I have never read a book like this before in my life and am grateful beyond words what it has done for me & my family."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book twenty years ago. My only regret is that I didn't read it when I was first married. Don't believe the negative critics. People who criticize Mrs. Andelin's philosophy are the same people who show up at women's lib rallies and pro-abortion gatherings. They will never be able to comprehend the message of this book. My advice is to read it with an open mind. The author is NOT suggesting that women behave in dim-witted ways. How absurd! She gives viable alternatives to anger when we are inclined to react with bitter sarcasm, yelling, drawing into oneself in angry silence, etc. Those alternatives seem foreign to most women at first because we all have lost our childlike (not childish) response to anger and stress. After reading this book, you will understand men in good ways you never would have thought possible.I apply the principles of Fascinating Womanhood every day. I make my husband #1 because I love him and he deserves it (isn't that what you did when you were first married? What happened in the interim?) When I see something positive, I don't let it pass, I praise and admire and encourage! And, you know what I get in return? Love and tenderness from a man who treats me like a queen. And, it is all done in total sincerity.My three married daughters believe in the principles of Fascinating Womanhood and their loving and thriving relationships are a joy to behold. Their husbands have even asked me what is it that I have instilled in my daughters! My sons-in-law treat my daughters with love, respect, and none of their marriages have ever gone through that \\"bad first year\\" of marriage. Believe me, the principles in the book are righteous ones and they will lead you into happy and enduring relationships not just with men but with all people. This book is needed now more than ever before."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book thinking it would give me the validation to divorce. It isn't pretty hearing the advice you need when you've been in the wrong, but I was grateful there was some hope. The knowledge and advice found in these pages saved my marriage and everyone else's that I lend it to or tell to purchase. It doesn't require your husband to do a thing! You start the changes and the ripple effect take care of the rest. I had read countless marriage books before, tried everything imaginable, and had everyone's admonition to seriously consider ending the marriage. Every other book's and counselor's advice required my unwilling spouse to change. This book is perfect because truly the woman has the power to change all around her. I didn't understand that before because I was trying to change things with force, manipulation, and the all time favorite, deafness inducing--nagging.This book has 14 chapters just on understanding men. It has not only resurrected my marriage, but helps me parent my son (and daughter) more effectively as I understand masculinity (and therefore femininity) and cherish it rather than mock it senseless.I reread this book when the marriage (or parenting) isn't as enjoyable as I like it (or when I get it back after loaning it out) and sure enough, I gain some insight I have forgotten. I have been reading and experimenting with the principles taught in this book for 4 years. I am still amazed when it works just like the author says, even though I have yet to prove anything invalid in it. It is so contrary to every current trend, philosophy of thought, and media opinion on marriage, but current media and philosophies don't really produce lasting marriages anymore. It shows unbounded courage for the author to say it like it is and give us insight on what makes a marriage relationship work, despite what is popular and what people want to hear. What we want to hear isn't working.To me, it is priceless having a marriage that is life giving instead of life draining. I'm so thankful for the second chance this book gave me to make my marriage blissful, rediscover my best friend, and become my best self."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was written 20+ years ago and still has present, everday, practical advice for women wanting to understand their feminity and appreciate the art of being a woman. I liked the way Ms. Andelin tells us how men think. That way, we can better understand how men expect us to be. At times, their ideals are way off the mark (the mark being the Bible as the standard) because men are so influenced by society's view of women. Ms. Andelin puts this all in perspective for you, which makes you feel better about yourself. We can't all look like Pamela Anderson, nor do we have to do everything in the home like Martha Stewart, but we can strive to be our personal best, keeping things like beauty and homemaking in balance. Sometimes we just act on how we were raised, disappointing ourselves and others, and it's good to know that as ladies we can change; refine ourselves and polish up our God-given, womanly attributes. Very insightful. This book can be for marrieds or single ladies. One complaint - there's a fine line between being child-like and acting childish, and the content seems to say that acting childish is OK. Regardless, this is a great book--work it, girls!!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is a minefield for women, because it assumes men are so gullible that they will be taken in by a woman submerging her personality and becoming a &quot;Stepford wife&quot; bundle of smiling assent and praise. The principles that she advocates works on many men, but the woman using these principles will feel disappointed that the men do not appreciate them as individuals. There are other books that help women to nurture their marriages and relationships without advocating emotional slavery. I do not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I would prefer to give it no stars...My mother-in-law read this book faithfully at the beginning of her marriage 49 years ago. After she told me this little fact I understood her motivation completely. This book will teach you to become as she did: subservient, dominated, doormatted, downtrodden, ruled and made to feel like a second-class citizen with no brain or thought-process of your own. By all means, go for it if that's what you desire! She took it to heart and used it like a Bible, much to her husband's delight. And just recently started to wonder if maybe she made a mistake. A kind, loving woman has been reduced to a scared, insecure person with absolutely no sense of self-confidence other than what her husband tells her she ought to have. A sad, sad commentary on the way women used to be viewed and unfortunately, obviously, still are, judging by the fact that it's still in print and so popular with so many [misguided] souls.

It is full of helpful tips on how to shrink yourself down to the right proportions for an insecure man who can't handle marriage to an intellingent, strong, grown-up woman. There is some good advice (on being loving, admiring, and accepting of your mate) all mixed up with a bunch of sexist, woman-hating (or is it woman-fearing?) nonsense. In the movie Pleasantville, there is a scene in which the mother, who has finally become &quot;real&quot; and is now in color, puts gray make-up on her face to try and fit back into her fake world. This is an excellent metaphor for what the author of this book is trying to get women to do.

My crazy aunt Gail had given it to her for her wedding. My parents spent many hours of their honeymoon hooting with laughter while reading aloud from it.They've been married for 36 years and are one of the happiest couples I know. Their marriage is based on respect and equality.I'm sure this book works for some people- just like fundamentalist religion works for some people- but the lifestyle preached about in this book should be something two people agree they want BEFORE they get married. It wouldn't work for any of the couples I know. If my best friend suddenly started lisping and prancing around like a crush-giddy teenager every time her husband came home, he'd almost definitely call me to ask if she had started abusing valium. If a couple consists of a woman who doesn't mind being submissive, and a man who doesn't want a best friend and partner so much as an acolyte, though, then Fascinating Womanhood is probably the best book going for them.Sure, I find this depressing, but I find a lot of things about our culture's relationship norms depressing.Also- I'm very thankful that the majority of men I know would be miserable with a woman they couldn't consider an equal."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you've ever wondered why sexy lingerie didn't turn the trick, or why your man suddenly became nasty and sarcastic instead of applauding your success at something, read this book.In simple language Andelin explains what my feminist mother could never teach me because she didn't know herself; the secrets of a masculine heart.Have you ever wondered why so many women can't keep a relationship going? They can do everything, it seems, except, keep a man happy, or simply keep a man! It's especially exciting that this information has nothing to do with being beautiful or having a perfect body. It is all about having the soul power to be the one who makes him want to be a better man.Womyn, I am talking to you, the kind of female who is able to change not him but your responses to him. It's all about you. The only thing this books asks you to change is your mind. Not his. You have to change yourself into a better person, and it makes him a better person. If you really love your man, you know you want only the best in life for him. This book shows you how to pave the way to make him so emotionally comfortable and confident that he can succeed in his career. This makes life better for you! Are you able to work on yourself?As for the other review of this book, wo, that chick was bassackwards. She's got so much to do before confronting her boyfriend with the things she said. She has to change herself, and she'll know she's done it right the day the guy comes home and showers her with love and money.People, I have a copy of this book that is just frayed and tattered, that's how long and hard I had to work on my impossible relationship with the world's worst man. Why did I bother? He was the father of my daughters, that's why. My mother threw my father out when I was four and I swore I would never be like that.Like every other story in Helen Andelin's book, I did everything wrong and slowly brought myself in line, finding that certain responses brought pain and other responses brought smiles. Duh.Almost two decades later, he is way more successful than he ever dreamed he'd be. His income is more than we need, his own father (another difficult man) is in awe of him, and I am seeing what I wanted, daughters raised in a two-parent home with level heads on their shoulders. I am sure of his love, and I am doing what Andelin said to do; \\"Let him make the living, and you make life worth living.\\"Maybe you'll be a quicker study than me. Maybe you'll have an easier man to live with. But quick or slow, even if you have no man in sight but you just have to deal with the day to day world full of men, this insight into their psychology will help you understand how to get along. But like Andelin says, be sure you use this powerful stuff for the good. And you know what, it's kind of failsafe, because you have to work to BE GOOD, inside, to apply this knowledge anyway. Word."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The only thing more frightening than Andelin writing this book is the number of women who are still buying it. I can't believe such sexist ideas still exist in contemporary American society."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book several years ago and have practiced many of the principles in it for most of my marriage of 15 years. The advice Andelin gives is very wise. One of the author's main points is that women should be &quot;womanly&quot;. Men are very different than women in the ways they think, respond, feel, etc. It is wise to try and understand these differences, and Andelin helps a person to do just that.I would be curious to know how successful in relationships the women giving a negative review to this book are. my bet is &quot;not very&quot;. Their ridicule of this book is a little over the top."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was given the book by a friend and spent the entire weekend reading it as I couldn't put it down! I now realize that many of the things my husband did were merely reactions to my behavior! Unknowingly, I had become the nagging,complaining unfeminine woman I had sworn I would never become! I believe that this book has put a lot of things into perspective for me and has really changed my way of thinking..One thing I disagree with though is the idea that it is better for a woman to stay home and not work. In today's world that is almost impossible for most people and that chapter needs to be updated."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Not a blanket criticism of this marriage book which should be called how to hang onto your marriage at all costs (the Christian or rather the Church of Latter Day Saints way). Some good points about femininity and acceptance. But acceptance can be taken so far.As other writers have observed this could prevent a woman leaving a physically or emotionally abusive man. It's cult-like because it starts off promising to deliver a marriage that is unbelievably fantastic. So we get pulled in. But when things aren't going as planned it's always the fault of the woman (similar to always blaming the cult follower) and never just that maybe the book's principles don't work for every marriage or every man. You're told to look at your faults when the man is acting badly. I think that's taking the log out of the eye parable a bit too far.The desperate wife is made to feel inadequate. If at last the marriage fails despite her adhering to the book she can only look to herself to blame because who can follow this book's principles perfectly? Because she's not perfect she's to blame. Makes anyone going through a divorce feel doubly guilty.She mentions abusive men but devotes only a couple of paragraphs to them and says leave them but she doesn't really define what she means by abusive men. On the other hand she claims that no man is hopeless. Even if a woman can't think of a single good point about him (which is I think a pretty obvious red flag) she should place her faith in God. This encourages women to have hope in abusive men.She says express disbelief when he does something wrong. But after a few times of this isn't it strange to be still acting surprised?The book should come with a warning not to attempt the principles on certain men, abusers and so on.There is also contradictory advice on men who are unfaithful or who fail to provide. Has anyone else picked up on this?There's also stuff about dangerous Indians that makes them seem less than human. Obviously this book is not directed to those of native ancestry.And I wonder how wise it is to stay with someone who is chronically faithful in this day and age of dangerous STDs?She neglects to tell you what you should do if your husband lies about committing infidelity. If he won't admit to it in the first place then how can you be sure when it's stopped (if ever)?Good advice about turning your back on financial problems and letting him deal with it. However she counsels working is bad for a marriage. So where does that leave the woman when she has to leave? She says family and charity but what about situations where a woman has neither to turn to? Such simplistic answers are typical of cults.The other cultlike thing is she never mentions the failures only the unbelievable success stories. And who would admit to having failed anyway? You'd just be a target for her accusations that YOU weren't good enough. You weren't WOMAN enough. Not good for those already with battered self-esteem.A bit frightening that somebody with her background can make the claims she does in her book. Where are the studies? Where are the statistics proving her success rate? I'm sorry examples from literature aren't good enough - for God's sake they come from some person's imagination! Talking about authors, she mentions Tolstoy twice, quotes from &quot;War and Peace&quot; and from his personal life. Go check out his diaries. You'll be surprised she's using him as an example.Those vulnerable and looking for answers should beware when traversing this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Just look at the stars on the foregoing reviews (or after-going; I'm not sure where this review will end up) and notice how this is an all-or-nothing book: people either love it, or they hate it.Probably more than anything I can think of at the moment, this book separates people who swallow politically correct, feminist movement-type notions from those who either allow themselves to follow their instincts and their upbringings, or think for themselves. I would also bet that people who support this book tend to be anti-abortion, while those who villify it probably tend to be on the pro-choice end of things. (But pro-choice for whom? Certainly not the fetus.)Spiritual and God-respecting, I was &quot;led&quot; to this book as others have testified. Though I don't have a significant other, it was almost magical the way it worked when I did apply it. I think the one big thing I got out of it is that a woman should put her husband first, which is both a Biblical and a psychologically sound principle. Dismaying as this might be to Dr. Laura - whom I also adore - disciples of this book are not &quot;my kids' mom&quot; types but &quot;my husband's wife&quot; types. The logical principle here is that if you put someone else first, frequently the bread thrown out on the water that the author talks about comes back to you. Bear in mind, ladies, there is another logical principle at work: There are a lot more of them than there are of us. We're in a seller's market; we have to kowtow a little bit.I'd like to end with several warnings. Caveat: You can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. If a guy is a lout, all the Fascinating Womanhood in the world probably won't transform him. Andelin, in my recollection, doesn't make this clear - although she does state that women must demand respect. I'm sure she did not want women to prostrate themselves in front of abusive men; she's talking more about your average, workaday-world guy. And, Ladies who divorce them at startling rates to get the alimony so they can pursue handsome new boyfriends, not caring a bean about how the kids feel - you know who you are. I think this book helps men, women and children - when women learn a very important lesson in humility that keeps families together.Speaking of Dr. Laura, my other caveat is this: The book is written from a Christian perspective. If you are not a Christian, or are afraid of the implied ideas, read not; you will not be open to the experience. However, if you do lean that way, or you have a curiosity, give it a go. Even if Andelin's insights seem sugary and insipid, just answer this - if they lead to family harmony, who's getting hurt?This book has been selling for 30 years. It probably has close to the mileage of that trade book philosophical tome record-setter, &quot;The Road Less Traveled.&quot; Here's one more thought to leave you with, which should help you make up your mind about whether you want to test these waters, or stay safe: Roseanne hated this book. You know where she got her &quot;domestic goddess&quot; schtick? Straight out of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood.&quot; Okay, go ahead and hate it. And people who aren't afraid to be human can smile all the way to the altar."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I clicked on Amazon today because I was curious if this book was still in print. To my horror, it is. I no longer own this book; it went into the trash many many years ago. But like another reviewer who read and owned this book, it was my Bible from my teenage years on through my many years of marriage. I am in my mid sixties. While I certainly cannot blame this or any other book for the complicated issues in my marriage, I can unequivocally say that this book was a huge influence in my life and in my decisions. That is why I want to warn future readers. I believed in the delusion that you can make someone love you, and I believed that with the help of this book. After all, I was a young woman who had won several beauty contests, and had a very sweet, and somewhat naive demeanor,(Child like). This book just clicked for me; I could become the ultimate in femininity for my man. Especially since I had also come from a home where my father, a very dominant protestant minister, taught my sister and I how to submit, and where, submission, a virtue, was exampled daily by my mother. I learned well.Putting all those factors together, along with adopting and practicing the guidelines in this book, nearly cost me my life. It was after years of landing in the hospital with everything from a broken nose, to gashes that had to be stitched, to knocked out teeth (and I never complained. . .and NEVER brought charges, because back then YOU had to bring charges), that I finally got into counseling and learned that IT WAS NOT MY FAULT! I also learned that there was probably NOTHING I was going to be able to do to change this man and make a good marriage. What a concept! THEY WERE HIS ISSUES!While the book does not advocate staying in an abusive relationship, I had to continue in counseling for a good while to REVERSE my thinking. I was still married to this man. I still believed I could make him love me. It wasn't until he held me down and burned me with his cigarette in several places on my body, that I gained some kind of inner strength to take our seven children and LEAVE him. This man was a wealthy, well known, prominent figure, and as the years went by I learned of his many affairs.You may say that this is an extreme example, and maybe it is. But it was a mindset that was instilled in me from a young age, and then for years aided by this book, that kept me in an extremely dangerous relationship far beyond the time I should have stayed.In spite of everything, I still am a Christian, but I now have the right concept of God's incredible value for me as a woman. While this book contains some truth in relationship building, I think it is far more dangerous than helpful. Please be very cautious and discerning."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This author says to avoid dating men who are immoral etc. in the prequel to this book. But in this book, if you find yourself dealing with an immoral husband, somehow you are not doing something right.You can do everything right, and still end up with a jerk."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating Woman... I truly doubt if \\"today's\\" woman would appreciate this book. It has hints of Marabel Morgan's theory of \\"how to make your marriage come alive\\" in her book, \\"The Total Woman\\". The book is basically commonsense, with a twist of sensual tips and religion tones with suggestions on how to manipulate a man so you get what you want.My question is- why doesn't a man write a book on how to manipulate a woman?I probably would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book when it was first published, in the 60's. I was then a student at Brigham Young University, espousing the religion which Andelin claims as her inspiration. The fundamental theme underlying the entire book is contempt: contempt for men, contempt for women, contempt for marriage. To Andelin, men are so selfish and insecure that they have to be manipulated by preposterous and insincere displays of not just affection, but outright worship. Women are completely worthless except as support for men. And God is a Creator who supposedly designed these contemptible, vacuous creatures, and commands that they remain contemptible. One wonders why Andelin or anyone else would worship God at all, if He produced a race of such despicable beings and then demanded gratitude and worship for doing so. If you have any self-respect, if you have any respect for others, if you have any respect for marriage, then read this book only as a joke, or as an example of how sick and twisted a human's brain can become."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have never read this book, but have been very happily married to someone for over thirty years who has.

A comical treasure, that is. Oh, brothers and sisters, let me tell you of the joys of laughter that this volume will provide from here until revelations. My chums and I soon took turns reading entire chapters from the book aloud, in our best reverend voices, exposing the loud and clear racist, sexist, and ignorant-as-hell overtones that this book possessed on every page. Few days of my young life have been spent rolling on the floor, gripping my sides in pangs of laughter such as the day that I discovered Fascinating Womanhood.This book, after you stop laughing at how ridiculously chock full of lies and non-Christian propaganda it is, is an absolutely terrible, prejudiced book of utter nonsense, and any individual with even an once of self-judgement, not to mention common sense, wouldn't be caught dead reading it for its intended purpose. Basically, Fascinating Womanhood could aptly be described as a handbook for the subservient, callow wife that hides under the prayer altar, giving her husband all he desires without question. This sort of macho b.s. might've worked back in the Catholic church of yesteryear, but what with all the pastors relying on choir boys for their 'under-altar' duties nowadays, I like to think that holy mother church has moved on from sexism, choosing instead to focus their time on even more sinful activities. That having been said, let's investigate the book's idiotic hullabaloo a little further, shall we?There are chapters upon chapters upon CHAPTERS inside this text that clearly outline how a good, weak-willed Christian wife is suppossed to best live her life for her husband, her family, and community, all according, allegedly, to what the Bible originally preached, the word of god himself. What a crock! I seem to remember this little-known fact about how Jesus was all in favor of equality of all god's people, including that 52% of the world population known as 'females'. Anyone else heard of that? I'm sure it's gotta be in that book of yours SOMEWHERE. Ugh. There's enough Christian-hating in this world as is, and woman-hating nonsense like this is only worsening the problem. The fact that this book was even allowed to see the light of day inside some horrible publisher's house is an atrocity in itself...but it's actually received POSITIVE reviews on Amazon, many of which were posted by honest-to-gosh WOMEN, no less? Give me a break.Here are some of the commandments delivered from this book, though I have paraphrased entire chapters to save you, the loyal reader, some time, not to mention some valuable brain cells. Remember, these only apply if you're a woman, and especially if you're of the married variety. Here goes:1. Thou shalt never argue, talk back, dispute, or defend thineself when thine husband disagrees with thou.2. Thou shalt always do all the housework and chores, all the time, without thanks, and wear a smile while doing it, as well.3. Thou must always raise thine male children to rise their rightful place as the head of society.4. Thou must never raise thine female offspring to think for themselves, especially not when a man is in charge.5. Thou must always put out whenever thine husband ask-eth, no matter what. Headaches are no excuse. (I'm not making this up, remember this.)6. Thou must never, EVER attempt to acheive gainful employment outside one's own home.7. And most importantly, thou must always follow the biased word of god, according to a bunch of holy-rolling men who want nothing more than a cook/dishwasher that enjoys sex on demand.What kind of self-respecting woman would ever pay heed to this book, much less put its unbelivable principles into practice? Oh wait, that's a contradiction...you would have to have absolutely NO self-respect in order to let someone else lead your life for you. This book is so demeaning, so offensive, so close-minded, it's damn near faschist. I say again: Ugh. Double 'ugh', in fact. I find it hard, nay, impossible, to believe that a woman allegedly wrote this...a man using some made-up effiminite name that was popular 100 years ago (you remember, before woman's suffrage), just so women would think to themselves, 'Hey, sister Helen B. Subservient says this is right, so I'll just follow right along with her!'. Gag me.Listen up, ladies and gentlemen...unless you are looking for a good laugh, avoid this book like the plague. It's not right. It's not factual. It's not credible. It's not Christian...not at all. It's CERTAINLY not reasonable. It's ANYTHING but believable. So I implore you, do not read this book, or allow anyone to even hint at buying it for you as a present. If you receive it as a gift this Christmas, mail the book back to them, but only after tearing out the pages, and utilizing them as makeshift toilet paper for as long as you can stand. This book is that horrible. Save yourself, save your loved ones, and save your money...Fascinating Womanhood is a waste of them all. God bless you, sisters.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, not only am I a guy, but I'm 18, too...so what could I possibly know about any of this? Happy trails."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book may help you &quot;land a man&quot; but I wouldn't want the kind of man that thinks of me as cute and incapable of rational thought! The author takes some valid points: that women should be feminine and there should be tenderness in a relationship . . . and grotesquely distorts them. In her ideal marraige, it seems, the man and women never really communicate but the woman play-acts, manipulates and insults her husband so he feels like a big, strong brute who could crush her if he wanted to. I plan to excel in &quot;Manly areas&quot; like thinking and handling finances, thank you very much! Before you discount me as some rabid feminist who hates men and doesn't own a dress---you should know that I think that marraige and family are the highest calling a woman could have. I believe in being feminine--but that isn't synonomous with dependant deviousness in my book. If you love to hate this book, check out &quot;The Fascinating Girl&quot; by the same author and &! quot;The Man of Steel and Velvet&quot; by her husband. I have the whole collection and laugh and feel sick over them regularly."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I can understand how this book would have been popular in the 1960s, but wow, it's 2010, and apparently people still think it's okay for a wife to base her sole existence around her husband. Who knew? This book is a product of its time, and no one really should be reading it for anything other than writing an undergraduate history paper or studying the effects of feminism."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Andelin encourages building up your husband so much, you should never doubt him and should act shocked if he does something wrong. She indicates that the wife should blame herself for any problems in the marriage, even if they are the sins of the husband. She shared several stories about pathetic women who put up with abusive and/or cheating husbands and seemed to expect us to believe that if we treat husbands who act this way with love and patience, they'll eventually come around on their own and realize that they were wrong. Actually Andelin, men who drink, hit their wives, and keep mistresses on the side have issues that go beyond what normal patience and love can cure.I couldn't believe how spineless the women in her stories were; they moved around their houses like wraiths, silently putting up with their husbands' mistreatment and we're supposed to hope their twisted marriages work out? Smile when their husbands acknowledge their presence? I have a very hard time respecting or sympathizing with a woman who self-pityingly says, \\"I had to mop my husband's fevered brow while he told me of the problems he was having with his mistress\\". Get a backbone, woman! Who said you had to act that way? I might have sympathized more if the wives had eventually realized they should not put up with abuse, but no. Instead, we're lead to believe that they remained puppets and, because of this, their husbands came around, sticky-sweet reconciliations occured, and each wife simperingly thanked Andelin for saving their marriages (they supposedly acted upon her advice, you see). As far as I'm concerned, those pitiful women got what they deserved; if you act like a doormat, people might as well treat you like one. I don't even know why Andelin shared these stories since she admitted at one point that we should sometimes speak up for ourselves. So, why weren't the women in her stories doing so?This book is, in fact, filled with unbelievable \\"real-life\\" stories of women who saved their marriages by taking Andelin's advice. In another story, a woman said she and her husband were having a fight and, at one point, she stuck out her lip and pouted like a little girl. Know what happened? Her husband froze, looked at her, and said she looked adorable when she did that. And viola, the fight is forgotten and the furious husband appeased because his wife pouted like a two-year-old. Yeah, right. I, for one, would long to smack a woman who acted like a little girl and I imagine very few men would have patience for that either. My own father would be disgusted if I stomped my foot and acted like Shirley Temple! Not a single one of the Christian men I know have treated me like they expect anything less than adult competence from me. You know why, because that's what makes a real man! Real men are not threatened by smart women and real women are not simpering dolls! This is NOT womanhood!I'm not sure if women or men should be more offended by this book, because Andelin insults them both; she seems to think of men as big 'ol buffoons who can't help their ape-like ways and need women to act like morons/puppets around them in order to have peaceful matrimony. Considering her husband's horrendous view of women in his book \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\", though, I can see where the poor woman got these ideas. When was the last time you read the real Bible, Miss Andelin?When I read Darien Cooper's book for wives, I thought I'd never find a book as sick, but I've recently been proven wrong more than once and it's truly sad. This trash should not be in print and I sympathize with any woman who buys it. Men are also dead wrong if they encourage women to behave this way; any guy who expects his wife to act like this needs serious help and citing how feminism has harmed women is just a cop-out excuse for their own poor tastes. I hear that Andelin is still profiting from confused women who believe her words. Ms. Andelin, I hope one day that you'll break free of your beastlike husband's reign and see yourself as the beautiful woman that God truly created you to be."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book revolutionized my marriage. When I realized how selfish I had been, I wondered why my husband put up with me so long. The principles do work and the results are worth the effort. My copy of this book is worn from reading it so often and referring to it when I need guidance."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was wandering around a thrift store a few months back and found this book. With no real purpose I flipped to a random page and read-\\"A man wants a woman he can place on a pedestal and worship from below... If a man becomes thoughtless, harsh or critical he may be willing to overlook it in himself, but what a disappointment it is to see - the angelic creature of the earth - fall onto his level,\\"(p.108).Well that got my attention, I flipped to another random page and in bold type saw;\\"THE FEMININITY OF THE LITTLE GIRL,\\"(P.126)ummm, Gross! I was fascinated now, I started to randomly flip through the book and each page held its own special giggle. My internal monologue went a little some thing like; \\" This lady is crazy, but super funny,\\" and \\"Oooh, this would make an awesome gag gift.\\"I just assumed that this little white book, published in 1963 that I bought for a dollar was some old, outdated, terrible love life advice akin to the sun rotating around the earth: wrong and out of date.A friend of mine is having a birthday very soon and she always appreciates a good laugh and a weird gift so I dusted the book of and prepared to wrap it, but before I did I decided to read it in its entirety. It was just as bad as I was hoping it would be. Out of curiosity I went on a little internet search to see what google had to say about my little treasure and to my shock and awe I found out that this is not some obscure book relegated to the back corners of library storage rooms but something that people where still buying and using as a relationship guide, ahhhhhh!I'm a 22 year old woman with loving parents, a good education, and healthy relationships. It was ok when I thought this book a forgotten and humorous relic of a different era but now that I know this is still considered \\"relevant\\" advice I'm annoyed and concerned for the state of love and equality in this nation. As people have pointed out before me this book is an insult to women and their intelligence but is also an insult to men and their intelligence.I'm going to give Male-kind the benefit of the doubt here and say that most of them are not pedophile, and don't base their love off of the traits a 10 year old girl would posses. It a cop out to say that men an women should be held to a different standard. Should a man be willing to overlook his own shortcoming, he's damn well going to look over mine and vice versa. The book touts the idea of leaning on a man for help to show that you need him but if your covering up who you really are to satisfy his/your need for perfection what your really doing is hiding yourself and true feelings from him. It shows a decided lack of trust in your partner and, moreover, their love for you.Conditional love is no kind of love at all and this author seems to think it the best kind their is. So here's my advice on the matter, if you want to buy this book for a dollar as a laugh, be my guest; but if you're looking for real advice to create a happy, loving partnership, look elsewhere. I suggest Attached by Amir Levine. :)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Teaching women to 'get their way with their man' through manipulative priciples while pretentending to be 'submissive.'"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This drivel sets back women's rights and the feminist movement by four decades.

Anyway, this book was at work and I picked it up to have a read. I was in shock. Being a born again Believer I was surprised that this book sugested it was christian.It says that women hold the key to marriage? The Bible teaches different. Men are supposed to be the head of the marriage. They need to be responsible for the family.Also, the book is asking that women pretend to be someone they are not. If you do everything that your husband wants (example: dressing up as a schoolgirl etc) you are pretending to be someone you are not. Everything he wants you to do may not neccessarily be you.Another thing, if you need to read a book like this in the first place I suggest that you shouldn't be married. Being married is all about communication. If you need to read a book to find out about your husband then something isn't right. You need to be able to communicate together (make sure you have this right before you marry?!?!).I see alot of people who are suffering in their marriage and the main reason is because there is a lack of communication. God is a talking God. He talks to us, his children, so therefore we need to marry the right person in covenant (we need to be committed)and we need to be able to talk and communicate with the spouse.I also see people who have a great marriage, never argue (occassionally may get a little upset remember we are all human) they get along just like really good mates. The reason? Because they communicate and talk to each other."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I can't believe anybody would write a book like this.

I'm quite certain that mine isn't the only man in America who is proud of having a wife who is strong and intelligent; he once told me that I'm the strongest person he knows. I am a practicing Lutheran who has read the Bible numerous times, and nowhere does it suggest that a woman should be a simpering pile of flesh good for nothing but child-bearing and man-pleasing.

I don't think modern men would be attracted to the play acting, childish acting women that the book is advocating. They actually like stronger, career minded women and look down upon the \\"little, helpless acting housewife.\\"They appreciate a woman who can bring some money into the household and relieve them of the stress of all that responsiblity. It also costs a lot more to live now than in the 60s too. Having a helpless acting woman gets really old and it makes the woman look really stupid when she ventures out into the real world, yet acts and looks like a helpless child. I think a modern husband would be embarrassed to be seen with such a woman. I do agree however with some points, like encouraging your husband, etc. But that is how we all should be with everyone."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Reading this book I didn't know whether to laugh or burst in to tears or throw it across the room. Something about it just epidimizes every argument I've ever had with my own LDS culture about feminism. Fallacy piles upon fallacy -- the entire book is based on the premise that men are in independently incapable of love, and that women thus have to don an entire persona not their own in order to manipulate men into loving them. Although I'm not married myself, I have yet to see a marriage that I have any admiration for with any similarities to the recommended relationships in this book. I'd like to think I could marry a man who would love me for my own talents and abilities, not for my ability to wash the dishes and inability to mow the lawn. I want to marry for friendship as much as love, and this book denies that possibility. Where is there room for intelligent and worthwhile conversation in what this book prescribes? It's fine if a man needs to feel protective in order to love a woman; I'm not going to become weak and simpering to indulge this. What is so wrong with women who are self-sufficient, independent, intelligent, or even, God forbid, poor housekeepers? I refuse to believe that men *can't* love women like this. Andelin's citing of Dickens and Hugo only emphasizes that she is espousing nineteenth century fallacies and prejudices.In any case, I doubt any book in the history of the written word has done more dammage to adolescent girls. What gives Andelin the right to outline the limits within which girls can develop themselves? I only wish this book would go out of print and stay out, and stop undermining everything women through the ages have worked to hard to achieve."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I agree that, when a society begins to burn books, thereby stifling the free flow of ideas, it's a sign of facsism on the rise. But, sometimes, there are books with such awful and intolerant ideas, I begin to question (but only question) whether or not they should be burned, regardless of the threat of facsism. It would be one thing if they were just lonely books, on dusty used bookstore shelves. It's another thing if they are books with ideas that are taken seriously, with a whole history of people utilizing them in every day life.Books like \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\" are the reason feminsim is a necessary part of our society today. Ideas like Andelin's need to be combatted by sane, rational and tolerant thought. Andelin goes so far as to say that, if a husband has an affair, it is the wife's fault because she didn't perform her \\"natural\\" wifely duties. I don't care who you are, or why you believe the way you do, there is no possible way you can believe this. It's hogwash. The last thing we need in this society is women running around blaming themselves for cheating husbands.This book is full of equally hogwash ideas that deserve to be laid to rest on dusty, used bookstore shelves, and laughed at if ever discovered by young, yet impressionable, teens.

This book, however, is not official Church doctrine nor espoused by the Church nor anywhere near what students are currently taught at BYU. I was first exposed to an earlier publishing of this book while attending BYU by a instructor who thought it inconceivable to take Helen Andelin's advice seriously. It is not based on scientific evidence, and our class found much of this book to be humorous. We thought at first the author must be joking, and we did not know the author was Mormon when we began reading the text. That's how far this text is from what we were taught at BYU--we didn't even recognize it as an alumni's book. Instead of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood,&quot; I would recommend giving young girls and early marrieds &quot;Little Women&quot; as a more practical example of family relationships with Christian values, which ironically, is a much older publication."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend to help gain an understanding of what it takes to have a successful marriage.

I utilized these practices in all of my relationships, not just marriage, and I am happy to say, I have been happily married for 22 years. Things have not always been perfect, but they have been peaceful and content by looking for the good in each other. My husband treats me like a queen because I treat him like a king.

This is 100 steps backward for educating women about domestic violence. The writer should be ashamed of what she has written. She should be more ashamed that she represents her ideas as Christian.

Interesting - later found out he really wasn't happy to \\"dwell\\" with me, he was happier \\"dwelling\\" with someone else!My second husband is very committed to this marriage and he has many amazing qualities. He can also be very controlling and insistent. Some of Mrs. Andelin's suggestions are just not good in this kind of environment. One should not offer up childlike feminism to someone who is being a class A jerk. One should offer up silence. Only silence. And while you are being silent.

She told me it was a bit \\"old fashioned\\", but had some good advice for being a good wife and maintaining a happy marriage. I've heard all kinds of strange things about this book, from the extreme positive to the extreme negative, but I approached it with an open mind. But this book is SUCH a mixed bag. Although I learned some good ideas from it that I can practically apply in my marriage, some of the advice just seemed crazy and dangerous, and it makes it hard for me to recommend it to anyone except for people with really strong BS detectors.First the good: this book explains in a clear and understandable way that while men are expected to be the emotionally \\"strong\\" ones in a marriage, their egos can be fragile and its easy for us as women to hurt them with constant criticism and nagging. It recommends building up your husband's ego and making him feel good about himself, letting him know he has your support through thick and thin. This seems like very positive advice, and has certainly helped me to be kinder and more supportive with my husband.Now the bad: Andelin seems to attribute ALL problems within a marriage, even infidelity and abuse by the husband, to the fault of the wife's attitude and behavior. This seems ridiculous to me, since nobody is perfect and a marriage involves two people, both whom enter the marriage with their own problems and weaknesses. The most frightening example she gave was in the case of abuse. She implies if a man physically abuses his wife or kids, it's probably the wife's fault for nagging him too much, and he'll soon stop if she's nicer to him! Having volunteered in a domestic violence shelter, this is extremely dangerous and incorrect thinking, not to mention unfair to children growing up in abusive homes.So yeah, there's some good, but the bad parts were SO BAD and toxic to me that this book is staying on the shelf."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you've ever looked for a proper guide to fifties homemaking (as opposed to the disdainful, sarcastic and deceptive models posted for the entertainment of scoffers), this is it.

I have started doing the things the book said to do and the change in my husband's attitude towards me has been miraculous. Things are going much better in our relationship than they were. The setbacks that occur I can attribute to not following the book.There are many negative commentaries about this book and the author's religion. This book is based on the Bible and its Christian precepts. It has the possibility of changing a person's perspective by making them aware of their own selfishness. It has been said that there would be a time when people would call good evil and evil good.

The ideas in it weren't new to me: dress girly, act girly, always let the boys win, pretend you think they're brilliant, and clean up after them -- and they and God will love you, and you'll be happy.That was pretty much business as usual. But what was new about the book was that it explicitly spelled out all that nonsense in one place. I could see the whole system more clearly than I'd ever seen it before, and it was revolting.Helen Andelin preaches constant lying as a way of life. In essence she's saying that you and your husband can never love or respect each other for who you are -- not now, and not in the future. Nothing you can make of yourself will ever earn his honest, unmanipulated love and respect. Moreover, your husband will never mature into someone who can cope with the horrible realization that he's married to an adult human being of the same species as himself. That being the case, Andelin believes, your only option is to lie like a rug -- to spend your life engaging in manipulative, seductive, and servile behavior, in hopes that your husband will continue to be fond of you and treat you well.Can you be happy married to a man you don't respect? Could you respect a man who is reliably moved, year after year after year, by the sight of a grown woman dressed like a little girl, stamping her foot and tossing her curls in &quot;adorably angry&quot; Shirley Temple fashion? My beloved husband of twenty-two years is a tolerant man, but he'd overdose on that routine in ninety seconds max, and he'd never stand for that kind of playacting in a serious discussion.FASCINATING WOMANHOOD has nothing to do with Christianity. It's a rule-of-thumb set of manipulative behaviors subservient women have historically used on men, and the numerous non-Christian versions of it we have available to us aren't all that different from the advice Helen Andelin gives in her book. I see no trace here of the religion that once astonished the ancient world by announcing: &quot;You have been baptized into Christ: you have clothed yourselves in him. No longer is there Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. You have become one in Christ Jesus.&quot; And I'd like to know just where in the Bible it says &quot;God loves a liar,&quot; because I've surely missed that bit in all my previous readings.If there's any use to this book that I can see, it's that it reminds us to be kind and forbearing and considerate, and to PAY ATTENTION to our loved ones. That, at least, is good advice. It's all too easy to fall into the trap of saving our good manners and charm for mere acquaintances, and behave carelessly toward those we're closest to. This is such a simple thing that it can be hard to remember it from day to day. We do well to remind ourselves of it. But surely, surely, that's something an adult can do, and a human being can honestly express.(And a last, brief note on the economics of her scheme: Helen Andelin's advice to stay home full-time and make do with what your husband earns is a lot easier to follow if your husband happens to be a dentist; and if you yourself happen to have written a bestseller that's been in print since the early 1960s, it works even better.)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"this book is everything it claims to be. assuming there is a willingness to follow it's advice. i read the book, applied the principles and have been reaping the rewards for a few years now. i encourage anyone to try it!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book well over 20 years ago, so it must have been the original version.

And I suppose I should try that tactic on my employer, the person who serves me in a restaurant, my neighbors, speaking with my child's teacher, etc. I'd soon be \\"under observation\\" somewhere for my bizarre behavior, I'm sure. I would never EVER recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read this book three times now. I am a conservative, fundamentalist Christian woman who wholeheartedly believes in submission and complementarian marriage. So I am hoping that allows me to review this book without the typical, \\"this book is st00pit n sexist even though i haven't read it!!!\\" perspective.First of all, not everything in this book is awful. There is nothing wrong with learning how to diplomatically appeal to your husband without damaging his ego. There is nothing wrong with being feminine and clean looking. I would like to say that I have a great marriage, but I thought (based on the author's promises) that applying the secrets in this book would make my marriage even better. I read this book three times, hoping I hadn't misread or misconstrued anything, because this book did not help. It made my marriage worse. It made my husband frustrated with me to the nth degree.Here were my fundamental problems with this book:1. Very little reference to Scripture, and when it is referenced, the passages are pulled horrendously out of context. Even \\"Created to be His Helpmeet\\" is better at not completely twisting the meaning of Scriptures to make a point. Most of the time in \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\", when a verse from the Bible was referenced, I was left wondering how on earth it pertained to the \\"secret\\" being taught.2. Men are not stupid babies who need their egos stroked constantly. The major premise is that men get their pride bruised so much all day long that we dare not damage it at home. Therefore, we must constantly manipulate the relationship so that our husbands never feel the sting of our disapproval. This is dangerous. It creates an artificial happiness. What man wouldn't be happy when his wife overlooks his flaws, never holds him accountable, and is constantly in a chirpy happy state?3. This book discourages women from talking with their husbands. The book says we should ask our husband thought-provoking questions that require very detailed answers, but that we should always resist the urge to talk about ourselves. For starters, for women such as myself who are married to what Debi Pearl refers to as a \\"Mr. Steady\\", this assignment will send your husband into a frustrated tizzy. My husband does not like being asked deep questions that require him to produce in-depth answers on the spot. It makes him uncomfortable. He prefers to reveal things without provocation and stop talking when he feels like it. He doesn't want me to needle his deepest darkest secrets, dreams, and past hurts out of him.4. The whole concept of pouting like a child, stomping your feet, crying while hanging your head in shame, or storming out of a room is appalling. This is the one that nearly ruined my marriage, and here is why. My husband would rather lay down his life than see me shed big crocodile tears over his words or actions. So the natural consequence of me pouting every time I felt \\"wronged\\" by my husband was he started bottling things up inside. Rather than hold me accountable at the moment of an incident,he held his frustration, anger and resentment inside out of fear of me making a tearful production. I also noticed our confrontations became a sort of tit for tat, who could \\"out-childish behavior\\" the other person. He started approaching conflict resolution as immaturely as I was. Finally he couldn't take it anymore and exploded asking me why I had become such a baby.I confessed I'd been reading this book, and explained some of the content. He asked, \\"what sort of idiot would write a book that said that? A man caters to his little girls, because they're little girls. Just as mothers cater to their little boys, because they are little boys. But you don't want me to act like your son, now do you? No, you want a grown adult man who acts like one and I want a grown adult woman for a wife.\\"Bottom line is this - my husband fell in love with the woman I was nearly eight years ago. I allowed this book to change who I was. Not inside, mind you, because I was the woman God made me. Instead I had to tiptoe on eggshells and carefully craft and manipulate every last word and circumstance to fall within these \\"secrets\\" of how to allegedly garner more love and affection from my husband. Instead it turned both of us into immature little brats. Thank God I have a book that teaches everything I need to know about how to reverence and love my husband - it's called the Bible."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Loved this book!

I believe that the tactics that she uses is more life application---i.e. ways of training ourselves to be more submissive to our husbands.

God's word should be our ultimate resource in our marriage and our relationship with Christ is what comes first and only He can teach us how to love and respect our husbands. This book does give \\"some\\" great tips on how to show our husbands respect and how to practice being submissive, (if you struggle in that area). I think that a lot of women struggle with submission and are too controlling over their husbands, but when you learn to let go and let God (which the book does suggest) you can not go wrong, because God promises never to leave nor forsake His children.

You can't imagine my lack of respect and out right bitterness I had for my husband. There was no other guy I was even tring to see so I decided to use him as my guinea pig. I'M WRITING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE JUST LIKE I WAS. Even ones that may have written some of these bad reviews. WHEN I WAS ANGRY WHICH I WAS MANY TIMES I LEARNED TO CHANNEL IT TO THE PROBLEM AND NOT HIM. So Many things to say..One of our daughters is 18YRS old and considering marriage.I'm ordering her a copy now..I just happen to wander here and find these bad reviews. I'm a christian woman now of fifteen years and we cherish our marrige. We both understand it's easier to keep a job than a marrige together. OUTDATED?? THATS WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD THE BIBLE WAS..GARBAGE?? SEARCH YOURSELF."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is for those who refuse to think on surface level and refuse to base their beliefs on popular culture and habitual traditions. Everyone has their role and their place."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Although quite a bit of this is very old fashioned and somewhat religiously based the theory behind it all is actually really good, as I'm not religious I tend to just giggle at the references to the bible and ignore them, instead I just take in the advice and have been putting the relevant parts into practice which has seemed to really work and made my relationship a lot more relaxed and happy. I would recommended this book to any woman."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is great and the ideals in it are wonderful to live by but I do feel like it is quite old fashioned. Read of it and apply it as a whole not every part of it specifically."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"What a wonderful book,principles that are Christ like,learning to treat our spouses and children with respect,getting back to basics and living these principles in our busy life styles, isen't easy at first,but it does work.Even our children will see and feel love in the home,when these principles are applied.This book is a teaching tool,a course,a beacon for any woman,it helps women to be humble,to serve her family members with love.This book has a lot of the answers to marital problems,it is well worth a read.I recommend it fully,what has any woman got to lose?"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Since I have read this book my marriage has gone places it never went before. It has totally reformed my life and my husbands. He thinks of, Respects,and cares for me more than he used to. This book is what makes dull marriages happy and fun."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I bought this book as entertainment, not to really follow the advice. But after reading a good deal of it I decided to try it on my husband and he responded amazingly to the \\"new me\\". Finally he asked why I was such a wonderful wife all of the sudden and I confessed I got it from a book. I could tell he was hurt and annoyed that my behavior wasn't genuine. And in all honesty being a stepford wife is pretty tiring. So I quit the charade. But I will say the advice in the book works!!! So well it's scary, I would highly recommend it to anyone that would like to help their marraige by becoming the \\"dream\\" wife every husabnd wants!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Sure, it has MANY shortcomings, it is the Stepford wife handbook...but the fact of the matter is this: in a marriage, ideally, each partner would continually be working on diminishing his/her own behaviors that cause disharmony, and ignoring his/her spouse's faults. Ideally, men and women would do this equally. In the real world, this will never happen. How many MEN do you picture reading a book about how to make their WIFE feel happy and loved? I checked...there are 100 reviews of \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\", and of \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\", the man's version...nine reviews.Give up on feminism--life's not fair and it's never going to be. You don't have to get married, but if you decide you want to, you as the woman are going to have to make it work, all on your own, if you can. Men just aren't interested.Now, you want to write a book for men on how they can convince every barely-legal beautiful girl they think they deserve, to have sex with them--then you'll have a best-seller!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book has a couple of uses.One, as a piece of humor. It's so quaint and poorly thought-out, it can't be taken seriously. I've spent hours with friends reading passages and rolling on the floor with laughter. A great gag gift for birthdays, wedding showers, etc.!Two, as an anthropological artifact. The customs and beliefs described herein are fascinating. Intelligent and educated people in 1999 put about as much credence in these ideas as they do in the idea that the earth is flat, but it's interesting to consider that there are those out there who think this way. And it does lead to important questions, like why is the author is so full of self-loathing and why is she is intent on squashing the talents and ambitions of other women.Third, those who have heard that the Mormon church is antifeminist and misogynist will find ample support in this book (the author is Mormon).Aside from these, the book is worthless. As a serious work of self-help or sociology, it merits zero stars."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found this book to be very racist and disturbing. It would be funny if not for the women that actually take this to be gospel. The racism is throughout the book it is very obvious this is intended for upper class white women, and there are direct racist remarks. I found the advice that wives should be &quot;childlike&quot; to be very disturbing. Any man who takes to this is looking more for the child than the wife. I think the author thinks that adult humans are quite stupid and need to lie and manipulate each other in order to have a good marriage.If you are married in an honest and loving relationship with your husband and he likes you for your intelligence and maturity then this is not the book for you. This book is not about feminism or feminity it is a book that advocates an unequal union and manipulation as a way to get what you want. It degrades both men and women."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you're an average wife, see if you can get away with saying that to your husband without his either bursting out laughing, throwing up, or entertaining grave doubts about your general fitness to be the mother of his children, or maybe even to be running around loose. And yet it's just that sort of gushing manipulation that is the stock in trade for Helen B. Andelin's book.Since this book came out in 1965, Helen B. Andelin is no spring chicken. She's close to eighty if she's a minute. Not that that matters, but it should shed some light on why she would advocate the kind of super-submissive &quot;domestic goddess&quot; approach that she does. Not only was she a wife and mother during the infamously domestic 1950s, she is a member of the Mormon Church, which means it's a pretty good bet she'd take the same approach today. I grew up in the RLDS Church, which is an offshoot of Mormonism, and I can tell you that the odds of changing the mind of someone who thinks like Helen Andelin are about the same as the odds of making five straight passes in Las Vegas. Some of that conservativity is just part of Mormon culture, and that's all there is to it.There's not much I could say here that hasn't already been said by most reviewers. I *did* give this book one star, and that's because I agree with its general principle, which is, in my book, to make a husband feel appreciated and to treat him with politeness, consideration, and respect. However, I would expect that this advice goes equally for husbands, and the idea that a wife should blame herself for every bad thing that happens in her relationship with her husband is ridiculous. If you visit Helen Andelin's website at www.fascinatingwomanhood.net, you will see that she is still urging wives to take on the blame when a husband is thoughtless, hurtful, uncommunicative, etc.I've read Helen Andelin's other book, &quot;The Fascinating Girl,&quot; which is meant to be a single woman's version of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood,&quot; and was written with the goal of &quot;landing a husband&quot; in mind. I am a 38-year-old woman who has never married, and while the reasons for this are somewhat more complex than that I wouldn't pretend to be some dependent, childlike, clinging little girl, the fact is that if that's what is required, thanks, I'll pass. I did, I have, and there are NO regrets.More important than books like this one should be books that remind young women that marriage is not the be-all and end-all of life. It is possible to be happy and successful without wearing a wedding ring or being a mother."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have no doubt that if a woman adopts the practices outlined in this book that she might be more successful with the typical male... but it's sickening to me that a woman should have to stoop to that level. When are we going to start expecting more out of men? When is society going to stop making women feel they have to bend over backwards to cater to the big bawling babies they are married to in order to keep the domestic peace?Rubbish. Good for an incredulous laugh, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I picked this up used for [price] and what a steal! This is hilarious! A great conversation piece."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book denies a woman to be her true self and loses her dignity in the process.

Then a friend's mother gave me Fascinating Womanhood and I studied it religiously. I worked on myself and came to embody everything in the book. Since then, I have seen the results and reaped the rewards in every relationship I've been in. After turning down several marriage proposals I married the man of my dreams and after 5 years and a child, he still worships and pines for me... all because of the principles from Fascinating Womanhood that I practice daily. This book has made my life so happy - thank you, Helen!You don't have the perfect body or looks but if you become the \\"fascinating woman\\" in Helen's book, men will worship you!

A womyn betrays humanity and feminism by telling females to make themselves feel small and worthless for the sake of men (as if decent men are attracted to silent mice and blowup dolls) ... and we praise her for it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I heard about this book from someone who practiced it. Her husband left her. Other people who acted like this also seem to get divorced very often, in my experience. Many men get tired of thinking for two, and carrying that burden alone. Some modern men like this antiquated thought. In an age of layoffs, those men are disappearing fast.The staying at home thing is particularly unwise. Stay at home mothers get financially screwed in divorce, and then again when trying to get a job. Those years out of the workforce cost a woman over $1.5 million in retirement income. If the husband is laid off, there is no safety net of income. If he dies (car accident, etc) she's still vulnerable, even if she has insurance. To be willfully ignorant of your marriage's finances has gotten many women charged with tax fraud due to their husband's financial games, in debt due to gambling or addication, or broke because he used to the money for his mistress.The book is anti-Gospels. Jesus told Martha and Mary to stop the busyness and listen to the Lord. There are three in a marriage: God, husband, and wife. To blame everything on the wife is to violate Jesus's word. The Gospels state pretty clearly that men and women should be treated equally in marriage (husband of one wife, not four as allowed before). But this was written for Mormons, who don't follow the Bible- they follow a different book. That makes all this Christian accolades so interesting. These people are culturally Christian, in that they follow folk beliefs about Christianity. They are not truly Christian, because if the read the Gospels more, they'd see the major problems in this book.(...)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found this book through internet searches on organizing my home. A site recommended it as giving good ideas for helping home life. So I read it.What a twisted and evil book.Yes, good and happy marriages are built on love, service, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, prioritization, and understanding, but those characteristics must be mutual between a husband and wife, and it's not just the wife's responsibility as Helen B. Andelin teaches.Her twisted and evil principles include Wives, if your husband doesn't love you, it's your fault because you are doing something to cause it. Wives, it is your responsibility to change so that your husband may love you. Wives, if your husbands mistreat you, neglect you, criticize you, or even looks outside the marriage for his needs, it is again your fault, and your are the one responsible to change. Wives, although your husband can be a \\"man\\", you are not supposed to be a woman, but instead be a feminine childlike creature without passions or feelings except for what your husband desires. Wives, you should not be capable, strong women, but instead, you should be weak and incapable, ignorant and uneducated. Wives, you should accept men (with all their faults), but you do not have the right to have that same acceptance from men. And you should lie to and be manipulative toward your husbands so that they may love you and be \`masculine.' Husbands, you are not responsible for any of your own actions because it is all the fault of the wife.These twisted \`truths' and more is what you will find in this thoroughly disgusting book.After reading that she practiced these principle after her own marriage went sour, and that her husband also wrote a book in which he states that a women always loves her master (which is her husband), I can understand why she wrote this book. Like any other abused woman who justifies the abuse and the abuser; she needed to act this way to keep her husband. A husband that views the husband/wife union as a slave/master relationship with a dose of pedophilia. A husband with a view that it is the husband's right to rule over his family.As an LDS woman, I am appalled that people believe this is taught as LDS Church doctrine. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is such a perverted and warped distortion of the doctrine, that I thought this to be an anti-Mormon book.The LDS church teaches that, \\"Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.\\"Notice it teaches that the husband and wife are to be equal partners. Not master and slave, not man and childlike woman, but respectful, loving, equal partners.If you were looking for help on how to improve your marriage, I would suggest The Five Love Languages, it will teach you about men and women and their needs and desires, without the twisted views of this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Each woman should read, may be not every things you can apply to you life, but even one of them will safe your family and love"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you firmly believe that woman are meant to be controlled by men and that you must do everything you can to please them (no matter how much it goes against your sense of right and wrong) then by all means, read this book.If you are living in the 21st Century and are able to see that every person in this world is an individual as well as being equal, you will get nothing from this book but giggles.Times have changed, and this book is for those that are stuck in the past and for people who married their fathers."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Since most of the Christians I know (various denominations) endorse honesty and responsibility as key to a healthy marriage, I was shocked to see this infamous title was still in print and enjoying favorable reviews. I previously heard about it from friends who are members of the reformed Mormon church, believing they and their female family members were entitled to human dignity. In otherwords, this title no longer speaks authoritatively even for the original core audience it was supposed to connect with.Apparently this very title was THE in-thing in the 1950's and 1960's for training women to become 'good' members of the general church. If nothing else, it makes an excellent case study how litterature can effectively program and control people's minds. Andelin instructs women to become docile big children and let the husband have the self-esteem and encouragement instead of dispersing it equally throughout the whole family unit.Blissfuly unaware of the realities of marriage (then and now) Andelin promotes a profoundly backwards approach to relationships. According to this mindset, people will not like you unless you can successfuly transform yourself into a fairy tale and expend your valuable energy keeping that same act up. Frankly, books like these make me very ashamed to be a member of the human race because they go well beyond other right-wing sociopolitical works (including Schafly)in subordinating women.Sure the cover says the work is updated for the most current printing, but seriously who wants a life partner (if possible) who talks baby talk and is unable to think for themselves. It seems to me that this same enviroment invites the potential for extramarital affairs, the 'good' men become bored with the 'helpmate' and search for a woman who they can have a conversation with.If nothing else, economic reality of the current basic cost-of-living requires women to participate in the public sector. People embracing this book as 'proper' will have a very hard time when they are required to excersize survival skills in this intentionally not sugar-coated world."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It's shocking that books like this are still being published and worst yet, being read by women looking for relationship advice.

It's sad that someone would consider this to be good, solid advice on how to have a happy marriage."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Seriously? I read this back in the early 70\\"s and I cannot believe it is still in print. Gain control by acting/being submissive? A joke played on women so they wouldn't be desirous of having a life of their own and making decisions of their own. Truly a book of the times. It encourages women to manipulate men to get what they wanted because they weren't allowed to have or did not \\"deserve\\" to have what they wanted outright. Granted, it may have worked in the 60's and 70's, and still may in some repressed cultures today, but at WHAT COST?. It claims a woman can be in control, be it covertly, yet who is deceived more? The man who believes he is in control because these women pretned to allow him to be, or the women who think they are actually in control (at the good graces of the man) yet gives her power to the illusion of being in control? Who needs to be in control anyway? I am in control of myself.

My work and God's intervention. I learnt what I did not learn from my parents. It is basic relationships defined. It was not easy to do at first.

The book has helped many women all over the world. \\"Cast your bread upon the waters and it comes back buttered.\\" My relationship with my husband is now strong and better than it ever was.

My main disagreement is with the &quot;child-like&quot; behavior toward your husband. My husband would commit me to an institution if I started doing that. I have, however, applied some of the other principles from this book, and it worked! My marriage is richer because of it. Readers, just keep in mind that you have to read a book like this and keep a discerning mind."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"There are some funny parts in this, yet insulting. You can make yourself a simpering, weak, submissive creature--all for your husband's pleasure. Don't have any opinions or act yourself, limit your own interest, choose between your husband and your children. Some tips are downright maddening: \\"Never try to appear smarter than your husband,\\" \\"Your husband will respect you more\\"...if you dress gender-restricted, frilly clothes. And a whole chapter on why women shouldn't/can't pursue a career during parenthood. But don't worry, after the children are gone you can have a career. But make sure you're there when your husband needs you [not such a bad idea, but wrongly phrased]. Make sure it is a 'feminine' career, like nursing (remember, this was first published in '65, before many men took up nursing). And it goes on and on like this; you can't even do certain chores/jobs, such as changing a tire. Don't change your tire, women. Just wait for the rapist to 'save' you. All of this is because women are weaker and more timid than men [literal quote], and doing something associated with men will make your husband feel inadequate. And don't let me get started on the chapter explaining why women are too stupid to handle finances. Some parts are funny, though: Don't make gestures while talking, don't speak loudly, don't 'roar' at jokes, don't gulp your drinks and other snicker-inducing 'femininity rules', The chapter about fashions and dress that women need to wear is also hilarious, and the one about how acting like a little girl and 'being cute' will turn your husband on. I could go on and on. This is a great book for a few chuckles, and just to see how bizarre it is. Don't take it seriously [though it was written to be taken seriously]! Oh yeah, and remember, if your husband cheats, IT'S YOUR FAULT."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The working woman issue is addressed in this edition - the book has been updated to cover some things that were not happening during it's first publication.Many people believe that the husband and wife both have to work outside their homes to make a &quot;decent living.&quot; But again this takes a lot of inward thinking (and prayer). Fact is most of us if necessary could live easily without the bigger house, the two cars and the trendy clothes, vacations and gadgets.,It's a matter of priorities and telling the difference between wants and needs., To behave as though children were just one more thing to acquire between a husband and wife, and then farm them out to paid caregivers because Mommy has to work....Is nonsense and injurious to the children and the home life itself.The babies are nurtured and born from women's bodies, to birth them and hand them to a $5.00 an hour employee at a daycare facility is reprehensible and just a little ridiculous.Fact is, a woman's true calling is in caring for her husband and children and making their house a home. For this to be downgraded and mocked is shameful.Mrs. Andelin speaks the truth, whether it's hard to hear or not. I thought this book was excellent and am only sorry that I am now finished with it! I may just have to read it through again."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Women have lost themselves. They are trying to be men. This role confusion has caused chaos in our society. Men compete with us instead of love us and treat us well. Ms. Andelin shows us how we can recapture our femininity and use it to our advantage... for happy, healthy lives. Men and women were meant to complement each other, not to compete. Each has a distinct role, as prescribed by God. I don't believe women should be slaves to their men, but they should work together in the roles that God created for us. Women have much more power than they realize. We can virtually change the world, simply by how we treat men. Ever hear the saying &quot;behind every successful man is a woman&quot;? That woman is a fascinating woman.I am a thirty-year-old single woman and I found the concepts truly fascinating and refreshing. I am using it as preparation for myself in getting to that kind of relationship. The concepts can be applied to men in all facets of your life. I don't say be manipulative but the moment you show them you know they are a man and &quot;manly&quot; (through words, honestly spoken), they are much more receptive to you. I have always felt there was a problem with the way men and women interact and this was my confirmation. God bless Ms. Andelin! She goes right to Scripture for her back up. God knows the way for all of us, we just have to open our hearts and minds and follow want He wants us to do, not want the world says we must do. Her book is a must read for any woman, married or single. Women who follow this &quot;method' are not weak and submissive, but very smart and truly enlightened."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My grandmother, gave Fascinating Womanhood, to my mother and told her to read it. My mother and I thought it was just another funny old-fashioned &quot;thing&quot; that Gramma was giving away. We thought it was &quot;anti-woman&quot; and so backward. When I moved out to get married, my mother didn't want the book so I took it with me. Then one day, about a year into my marriage, I tore through all my old things to find it. My husband and I, were both at the end of our ropes with this marriage. I was so naive.I thought we would just get along because we loved each other. I remembered Fascinating Womanhood by Helen Andelin, and how my husband exhibited the very traits that she wrote of. So I dug it out and devoured every word. It described my husband exactly! It described how men and women are so different in thought, emotion and action. And it went beyond other marriage books I had read by telling me exactly what to do about it and when and how to do it! The next day, I decided to try the first assignment. The first assignment that is done towards the husband is: 1.&quot;Tell him something like the following: &quot;I am glad that you are the kind of man you are. I can see that I have not understood you in the past and that I have made many mistakes. But, I am glad that you have not allowed me to push you around. You have not been like putty in my hands, but have had the courage of your convictions. Will you forgive me for not understanding you and let me prove to you that I am happy that you are the kind of man you are?...2. Look to his better side. 3. Make or Buy a little &quot;Love Booklet&quot; to write down the loving things your husband does or says as you begin to apply the principles of Fascinating Womanhood. Write any favorable reaction to the above assignments.Though, it wasn't an earth-shattering response, my husband actually reacted very positively! I just knew it was the answer I was looking for. Reading it also made me feel that we weren't alone in our problems, but actually typical. Now, I can understand my husband and why he is different. I rejoice in my role as a woman, and wife and (someday) mother. And I delight in my every-day duties as a wife. I now look forward to every day with my husband. I wish I could say that we never fight but every time we do, I can think back and see that if I had followed the book's principles better it probably wouldn't have happened and if it did I could've handled it better. I wish more ladies had the &quot;joy in marriage&quot; that it can bring! I know many women, like I was, trying to appear that they have a good marriage and desperately searching for answers on the inside. Fascinating Womanhood by Helen Andelin, directs women to universal principles and takes them to their logical conclusion, through practicality. I hope that more people will read the book and share it with as many women as they can. And maybe someday, our country will be known as a country that represents happiness in marriage and not an increasing divorce rate."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Like with most reading materials you take out what's relevant to your individual situation and apply it.Before reading this book the reader should be aware of when the book was written and understand that not everything in it applies to everyone's situation. For instance, Andelin writes this book during a time where women didn't work outside the home. In today's society that is rarely the case. With that being said here's my review of the content.Truth be told \\"at first\\" it appears that the author is asking women everywhere to be doormats for their husbands. The proverbial \\"Stepford Wife\\" who caters to his every whim without even so much as saying a peep. When he is ornery or disagreeable count it all to human frailties but make sure that you are stay positive and happy. It all sounded like a facade to me. Like I needed to wear a mask and be solely concerned about his feelings and needs without ever asking him to have any regards for mine. I have to be very honest it didn't seem fair or feasible.But after studying other sources written by both men and women, some of what Andelin states holds true. Men need three things: acceptance, ego stroking and respect. When these three needs are met, you will want for nothing. What's the harm in laughing at his jokes or praising him for the big and little things he does. There is absolutely nothing wrong with making a man feel respected and needed. It is in no way a threat to our independence or feminine rights; I assure you, you will still be able vote if you do this these things.With all that being said I highly recommend you read The Five Love Languages. It gives love a new perspective. Accompanied with this book you get a greater idea of what's expected from both husband and wife."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Helen Andelin was married for over 55 years before loosing her husband. I'd say with todays divorce rate, that we could all learn a little something from this book. I don't think everyone needs to follow ever suggestion she makes, but I think everyone could find something of benefit. Making a life with the man I love is my number one priority and if I have to make a few sacrifices here and there, it is only because I know he is doing the same for me...perhaps that is why we are still married (happily)4 children and 18 years later."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"In spite of the fact that some women find Helen Andelin's ideas antiquated, she knows what she's talking about and her methods WORK! They worked for me; they worked for my daughter. Go for it. It's worth a try. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating womanhood explores a lot of great ideas on marriage, but at the same time it tends to lean towards the psychologically manipulating way of getting things done. I feel that this book degrades men as much as it does women. My husband is not an idiot who needs me to tell him how strong his muscles are when he can see that there aren't many there. He does not need someone to lean on him so much he feels like the world is on his shoulders and he has to hold it all. We marrried to become a team - one flesh. We both have strengths and weaknesses which should be utilized to make this team the best it can be. No one man(or woman) can be best at everything!I regards to the way woman are seen in this book, I disagree with a lot of the customer reviewers. It is degrading in the fact that it instructs a woman to act &quot;less intelligent&quot;/inferior in order to make the man think he is superior. By doing this it is actually encouraging women to use their brains a lot more than we do currently. How many times have we opened our mouths and said something without thinking? Ms. Andelin invites us to think about everything we say and do. I think this is the greatest advice to take away from this book. If one only speaks encouraging words, the results will be phenominal.Another book worth reading that addresses marriage as a team is the Five Love Languages and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating Womanhood has proven itself to be the Bible for frustrated and abused women. The author, Helen Andelin, is the patron saint for these women and the domestic goddess for batterers and abusers around the world. Her methods call for women to sacrifice their very souls upon the alters of male privilege and male insecurity, two characteristics which, when mixed together in sufficient quantities, combust to create domestic violence or smoulder into the more subtle, but ultimately soul murdering, unrighteous dominion.Thirty years ago my mother, when asked her opinion of the book, replied, \\"It's fine if you're married to a 12 year old brat.\\" One in three women will be assaulted in her lifetime. This statistic and the book's continued popularity demonstrate that a large number of women are indeed married to spoiled 12 year old brats.Rather than help men be accountable for their abusive behaviors, Helen joins her \\"girlish voice\\" with millions of batterers and abusers who blame their abuse on their wives. (\\"If man does not love with heart and soul, it is entirely the woman's fault.\\") She encourages her disciples to become domestic goddesses like herself. It is regrettable that Helen gave up her adult life in exchange for perpetual childhood to appease her \\"manly, superior\\" husband. And it is a tragedy that the Batterers' Bible, Fascinating Womanhood, continues to destroy women by dumbing them down into domesticated animals.Fascinating Womanhood earns 5 stars because, as a domestic violence therapist, no single volume so powerfully demonstrates the absurd thinking which perpetuates violence against women and then turns around and blames women for the violence.The natural man is an enemy to God. But Helen Andelin is the natural man's friend and servant. Recently she suggested that a man punish his wife by withholding privileges such as money or the car. Helen is truly every batterers' fantasy \\"girl\\" and every abused woman's worst nightmare."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Note: I read and reread this book over and over because it is sooooo good...To all the ladies out there who are having a little trouble, going through the worst days or your life or just need better understanding; this is most definately the book for you. I buy a new book every so often to give to other women because the info is just to valuable to just leave it with someone else... My husband is an African American male from ghettoest of ghettos and, he eats this stuff up. So if you think it wont work on your husband, guess again because if it worked on my hard headed husband it can work on yours no matter who he is!!! This book has been so helpful in the lives of myself as well as my friends that we have started our own fascinating womanhood class. And my friends are not all African American nor are they all Caucasion, we are all from international groups and races and we have come to the conclusion that men are universal and the teachings of fascinating womanhood work on diverse international backgrounds.I have come to the conclusion that us western (particularly American) women are too independent minded and we dont let men feel like men and stop trying to control everything, this is why the divorce rate is up to 65%!!!! And to the fine woman who said that the sayings were out dated, well they might be out dated but you got the general idea of what you needed to say, so dont give the wrong impression to readers and take it so literally... you knew what the author was trying to say!!!! I love asking my husband to borrow his muscles. (YOUR HUSBAND WILL TOO) He eats that stuff up and I would rather me be the one saying this stuff than some other woman(CUZ THEY WILL DO IT) so I dont care what people think, Im trying to stay married till I die!!!! It is absolutely not out dated nor are the teachings in this book. If the teachings work in todays age, then how could they possibley be outdated??? Im only 21 and my husband is almost 30 so Im still young married and it still works on my generation as well as my husbands.I recommend this book to any and every woman alive. However I dont recommend this book to any woman trying to take another womans man because these teachings are SO good that you should never use them on another womans man!!!!The women who dont follow these teachings will be worse off for it because even if your marriage works right now without the teachings, it would be horrible to pass that kind of thinking onto a child which might not find a man that will put up with that kind of attitude. The key is to understand men and make them feel like men, and support him even if you think he is making the wrong decisions, when we accomplish this, thats when men become the most loving well mannered men they always were, because they see that you trust them and now they become responsable for your well being as well as your family... If they dont feel the stress of being responsable they will stay irresponsable so let them make mistakes and feel the consiquences of a wrong decision, its the only way for them to learn, not us being nagging wives...Also ladies please dont listen to any of the negative comments that others are making about the book, if they are making these comments its because they are too hard headed to set their pride on the floor and and be strong and virtuous WOMEN that men are fascinated with.Dont EVER listen to divorced or unmarried women PLEEEAAASSSEEEE!!! They will never give you the right advice because if they had the right advice they would still be married or be able to keep a man...And in response to the woman that advised you all not to trust your husband if he wanted to join the circus I say: men already feel the stress of providing for families and it never goes away unless we as women push them so if a man chooses to change his career its in the interest of his family and us women need to trust in that, men are just as grown as we are so Im sure they probably know better than to join the circus!!!!!The best saying in this book was \\"Its better to have 10% of a 100% man than to have 100% of a 10% man\\" and it is SO true. So ladies lets support our men by being the women they need us to be... Read Fascinating Womanhood and apply ALL the teachings for a better marriage and upbringing of our children..."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Written by my spouse...Am I fascinating? Well, that is a matter of opinion and Helen does have rights to hers. I loved this book! Does it mean that when I finished this book and apply all of her ideal principles that I have now arrived into the realm of fascinating?...I dont think so. Also, the fact remains that I have killed myself a snake or two and never did the guys repulse at this but did find me fun to hang out with! I get the idea she runs with here and I do agree that men want to be the hero that slays the dragon in the end; then we women run into the awaiting muscle ripped arms and claim...\\"My HERO!\\" I do believe that this is bread deep within man to feel needed that way and my being a tomboy I have had my share of heartache of losing out the guy of my desires to the softer,prettier version. ANYWAY...What makes us fascinating I believe is only found in the beauty of our multi dimension of color, DNA, and differing design by the Master creators skillful hands, and continues to mold and shape us in our experiencial journey of life that we are all embarked on. In the meantime, what I have found by adding some of her ideals is that I am becoming, by choice of none but my own, a more gentle, loving, giving wife to my husband and mother to my children. These simply put methods she has here are easy (to at least give a girlscout try) and really...they are working as far as diffusing what usually is a fight of control and stubborn opposition on my part in my justifications. I had to be very honest with myself about the way I respond and was finding that I was beginning to rebel at the ideas of her challenges she posed, and, that was when I knew I was doing the very things she suggested was happening in my marriage situation.To this day I am faithful to appling these ideas as I believe they can attribute to opportunities that may or may not have existed in my relationships, but whether I get what I want, is that really what its all about. (If your a Christian...is it not that we are learning to die to our self and love others as better?) Just a thought? I can be so bullheaded and stubborn at times and really do desire to be the woman of his dreams. I may never experience the intimacy I have lugged around in my imagination as possible for me but hey, doesn't hurt to give these a try. I believe I am better for it.

I have also purchased many copies of this book and given them away to women who have shared concerns with me about their relationships. Upon giving this book to them I have told them that it will be the most important book they will ever read next to the Bible.

The reviews I have read do not give it justice. Some reviews quote only one side of the book. It is a balance between being a \\"Dora\\" and an \\"Agnes\\". Today's society view the male as inferior. This book provides techniques on how to respond, to be meek and how to get tasks accomplished by the men without the nagging, which women know fall on deaf ears!! I have used the techniques on not only my marriage, but also in my place of work. The suggestions are not manipulative, it is approaching from a different perspective with a different tone in your voice and mannerism. It IS NOT seductive in nature.

Is it really true that my husband is so selfish, self-centered, power crazed and the ego the size of Australia? If you read between the lines, then that is the message that I am getting. Women have to change because their husbands can't.I am a mother of an autistic child who needs care 24 hours a day. How is a selfish, self-centered, power crazed and ego the size of Australia husband suppose to feel when his wife can't kiss his feet because the autistic kid is drinking drano or trying to jump out the window? In this day and age with one kid in 166 on the spectrum, how do you just drop everything you believe in and all your responsibilities in order to worship your husband and behave like a little girl?Save your money, don't buy the book.

She is an impossible and downright dangerous ideal, and one that was already pathetically outdated by the time this book was published, in the mid 60's. While many women and young girls of an earlier era were indeed raised with many of the feminine ideals the book purports to uphold, I find it hard to imagine that a woman or young girl of \\"grace and comportment\\" would be encouraged by wise adults and peers to pout, sulk, use baby-talk, and reduce communication to blithering idiocy......the end result is not a fascinating woman, but an immediate entry into the nearest loony bin, along with the family forced to live with this kind of mental deficiency!To sum it up......there is nothing wrong with being \\"feminine\\". (The word itself is open to wide interpretation, but however you define it, there is nothing inherently wrong with that). There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a good, healthy, respectful relationship with your husband/partner/whomever; I think most of us would wish for the same.To see what is surely the most important relationship one will ever have, that of husband/wife, partner/partner, reduced to the pathetic travesty in these pages, is one of the sickest, saddest examples of womanhood at its worst and most degrading; infantile, incapable, inappropriate, injudicious, insupportable, intolerable, insufferable, insane!Like many other readers, there was a time when I found this all terribly amusing, and was highly entertained by the beyond-sane descriptions of marital interaction and manipulation.After spending 13 years in an unhappy marriage that was based on abuse and domination, and emerging, eventually, scarred but sound, with three wonderful children to raise in a now abuse-free and healthy environment, I no longer find this mindset amusing. The fact that certain people of both sexes still consider this to be a model of ideal marital interaction 40 years after it was first written, and may find it to be so 40 years from now as well, is perhaps the saddest and most destructive legacy of this harmful relic.It is my sincere hope that those who find what they are looking for in this book, won't live to regret it......then again, it may be a moot issue; perhaps they simply won't \\"live\\"."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Seriously, this book is a piece of garbage, useful only for laughing in disbelief that anyone would ever want to follow the guidelines in it. The author's premise is that women need to be doormats AND able to secretly manipulate their husband. This book is very sexist and enforces rigid gender roles. It may be useful advice for someone who wants a very traditional marriage and is OK with being \\"accepting\\" of their man even if he abuses her, but for women who want a life apart from being a doormat/manipulator, stay away.The only one who should buy this book is a feminist scholar who wants to deconstruct the ideas contained within it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is sickening.

I am a young 30's gal, recently remarried to a very traditional male and I am Christian. My husband is former military and so naturally my marriage has become more traditional the second time around with this culture of discipline.Though some of the ideas in the book are useful regarding appreciating a man and not being an overly controlling wife, the sections regarding work and education are in the 21st century, downright ludicrous as well as dangerous. There is NO guarantee you will marry a man who may not become abusive or neglectful and counseling our daughters not to have careers, or to have a backup yourself, borders on negligent and lethal advice. I actually did a no-no and reviewed the book WITH my husband after having read it and practiced a few concepts for several months and he admitted he was not at ALL pleased with the changes or the suggestions in the book. Head of household does not = he should earn every penny while the wife blissfully stays home with the 1 or 2 kids she has. As I have a graduate degree, that would be financial suicide anyway! I suppose the author would hang my mother for having dared to educate me so much.BTW, my daughter is studying to be a pediatrician and if she quit I'd be eternally disappointed that she threw her God given talents away. She is an honors student. Who is to say she might not cure cancer one day? We are all called differently and not everyone is destined to be a housewife.Bottom line, this may have worked 20 or 30 years ago but in today's society and marketplace where gas is $3 a gallon and homes run $150k, there's not but so much \\"cutting back\\" you can do. I would rather risk losing my femininity a bit by helping my husband achieve his goals for ourselves and our family than risk losing his life from a stress heart attack at 40 trying to pay for it all, something that happened more to our mothers than most of them care to admit. Not all men are dentists like Ms. Andelin's husband and many work difficult, blue collar jobs with horrid hours and conditions. Not everyone's a rocket surgeon and not all men can make 50k+ a year no matter how hard they try. Not helping alleviate that reality if you are married to it is a worse sin I think being a wife than being the helpmeet God intended us to be. I suppose the author would have those men die penniless and alone since they didn't do it all by themselves the way she feels God intended.

While I certainly do not believe that anyone in a physically abusive relationship should stay, how is it that we so called \\"educated\\" women, \\"feminist\\" women, \\"get a life\\" women (which of course means: get a career because we certainly can't be fulfilled to the fullest without it) that most of us feel pressured to be these days have the highest divorce rate? I read this book on the whispered recommendation of a few friends. They were both almost ashamed to say this book changed their lives for the better. They were ashamed because they both had thriving careers that were destroying their marriages and children, they both had babies who had never known what it was like to have their own mothers care for them for any length of time, and neither of them (previous to reading the book) could have cared less if their husbands cherished them or not as wives. While I respect all the comments, if you are a woman out there who has thought that maybe God did create men and women differently for a reason, that there is more to life than being selfish, if you need encouragement with regards to what men really want and how to make your marriage last, and you maybe question if it would be good for you to raise your child instead of a complete stranger...read this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Gotta tell ya.... after being married for 14 yrs, this was an eye opener.... just one day after applying MINIMAL recommendations from this book, our relationship is better than ever.......thought it was simply a good laugh about the 50's, but let me tell you, this WORKS&gt;&gt;&gt; and you don't have to wear saran-wrap at the door, you just have to do WHAT YOU ALREADY DO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY... truth be told, it's kinda fun playing a little girl sometimes...........huh...who'da thought..........?

He was stubborn and refused to willingly change himself for the better. Finally, after our last really huge explosive argument when all seemed futile, (but in the end we were miserable without each other), I gave up on waiting for him to change and decided to work on myself for once. Reading this book helped me change my attitude about how I thought of and treated my husband. At first glance I thought, oh great, more work for me! But, the more I read and thought about what was written and how it applied to our relationship, I realised that alot of what the author was saying is that you need to treat your husband with love and respect and like he is the most important person in your life (much like how I treated him the first year we dated). This book also helped me take pride in the role I CHOSE to take in my family's life as a full-time mother.The book has its faults. A couple of the testimonials are a little on the extreme side and seem to justify spousal abuse, but if you keep on reading, the author makes it very clear that the wife is not a doormat, abuse is not acceptable, and the woman needs to remove herself and the children from the house. The other fault of the book is that it can appear to be a book about manipulating your husband. It is a very practical book, filled with many specific examples of what to say or do. It is not deep or intellectual. If you are looking for the Biblical, intellectual argument on the role of a wife, I found The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace very helpful and a good companion to this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have the opinion that if I get one good idea or piece of information out of a book, that is useful, then the book is worth it.I got many great ideas about understanding my &quot;boyfriend&quot;\` at the time, my husband no;w.We would never have made it to the alter without info from this book.Not that he listened to,\`or used, or read any of it.My man is one of those macho, mans-man kind of guys.When I read about how a man thinks different and feels different, I cried.

Even Marabel Morgan's THE TOTAL WOMAN is better than this mindless garbage! I believe in the Biblical concept of loving submission to one's husband, but this book twists this concept into mush. As Florence Littauer says, &quot;submission doesn't mean stupidity&quot;! I'm glad that God blessed me with a wonderful husband who appreciates an outspoken career woman like me! Contrary to the author's opinion, NO man is attracted to a wife who immaturely expresses her anger by stomping her foot, throwing childish temper tantrums, and putting all the burden of decision-making on him as this books suggests. And since when is femininity determined by the type of fabrics a woman wears (the author suggesting that women shouldn't wear denim, tweed, etc. because they're not feminine)? I've never heard anything more insulting to one's intelligence. It's books like this that have led to the rise of domestic violence (physical, emotional, and sexual) in the church and society as a whole. I recommend books like WAKE UP, WOMEN! by Florence Littauer and WAKE UP, MEN! by her husband Fred; these books teach husbands and wives how to fulfill their God-given roles with common sense!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"then he isn't worth keeping! Hey, if a man loves you, then he loves YOU and all you should really have to do to keep him is be yourself.

The answer to a bad marriage is to make sure you are the best person you can be, the rest is out of your hands, the other person either lives up to his end of the bargain, or he doesn't which is when you don't try manipulating games that make you sick, but get out and find a mature person that loves you back. That is as simple as it gets. And I know, cause I tried all the B...S... in this book for 24 years and it made me sick and did not get me the love I wanted.

I like a lady that could fix her own car but also want to be the one that does. I do feel like protecting and providing.

My sister recommended this book to me and I have to say that I was absolutely engrossed in what it had to say. You can say that this book teaches ignorance or racism or sexist remarks, but it does nothing of the sort. You have to read this with an open mind. This book explains men inside and out. Every test that this author mentions, worked like a charm each and every time. I have saved my husband and I many many arguments by being able to understand how he feels. Men are just as complex as women and understanding men is simply a gift. This book tells women to love honor and cherish their husbands. Is it not true that women want the same thing. Haven't you ever heard the phrase \\"what goes around comes around.\\" That's what this book is about. Treat your man with respect and honor and he will return the feeling with an honest heart. That's all there is to it.It tells me why my husband says and does the things that he does and helps me to help him. Women want to be treated with respect and honor and dignity and this book shows you how to achieve this on a kind and honorable level. It is not a book about being a doormat and it does not say that you have to give sex on demand as one of the reviewers mentioned. It simply says that when we are kind and loving to others, they will be kind and loving to us.The only thing I found difficult was the part about not being employed. I agree that there is no more noble a career than being a homemaker, but in todays expensive world, there are often times, no way around it and if you're going to have to work, it might as well be something that you enjoy and if you have to go to school for that then so be it. This book does NOT say to train your daughters to not think for themselves, it simply tells you to teach them the beauty in domestication and femininity.This book made me feel proud to be a woman and helped me understand the importance of my role in my family and in society. This book teaches that women have the power and gift to make a happy home and raise God fearing, respectible girls and boys.Take pride in your femeninity and love unselfishly."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read many of the reviews for this book and am wondering if all the reviewers have read the same book? My mom read this book and attended a class when my parents marriage was rocky. It really made an amazing transformation in their lives! So, I read it. Don't get me wrong, I threw it a few times, but then I started seeing the forest beyond the trees and much of what she says is right on the mark. She insists on being sincere and not using these prinicples for manipulation. I have read the book several times, in fact, and don't see doormat anywhere. I do think that the book needs some updating and condensing, especially the lanuage used.Many of the reviews remind me of conversations with people following Atkins and eating only meat. They glossed over the \\"eat vegetables\\" part.What is so bad about accepting your husband as he is, appreciating him and admiring him? What is so bad about acting feminine? What is so bad about taking some responibility for your own actions and giving him the freedom to take responsibility for his.This book has a lot of important principles in it. Read it with an open mind, sincerity and love."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book after hearing my sister-in-law talk about it. I am very happy in my marriage and realized that I unknowingly was living many of the principles the author talks about. It should not take the place of the Bible, but I think it could be very helpful to those struggling in marriage.I don't think the author's intent was to devalue women or men in any way. I think her intent was to help women see what ways they can change themselves to help their marriage change. So many people are getting divorced these days and seem to always blame the other person for the problems. Andelin wrote this book hoping to inspire women to do their part. Her husband wrote a book to the men inspiring them to do their part. Wise persons know that if you want to change your partner you change yourself. Of course you can't MAKE someone change, but by changing yourself you INVITE the other person to change. You become a better person in the process. Andelin is helping women do that.As I read the book I have started applying more things into my marriage, not to manipulate my husband but to help him feel good. I didn't realize in the past how he felt when I said certain things. This book helped me understand him better and show him love in the ways in understands. It has worked wonderfully. He is very respectful of me and treats me wonderfully. This book has helped us to make our marriage even better."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Personally, I love it. I am married to my best friend who doesn't care that I am not &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; or June Cleaver. But lets be honest ladies...sauciness beats nagginess any day of the week. There is a time and a place for complaints...I sliced off a star, because I do feel that women should be encouraged to talk to their husbands about any thing under the sun...but really, I have overheard women barking at their husbands in public (and vice versa.)How unnecessary is that? For me,the techniques in this book (however antiquated in their explaination)are a KEY. NOT A KEY TO MANIPULATION, BUT A KEY TO CONSIDERATION! A reminder to be nice, and try to look my best for the guy I dolled up for while we were engaged. (How many people let themselves go to pot after the marraige is solemnized?? Quite a few.) One should not expect this to be a perfect read...but the harsh critics are just that, harsh critics. The rest of us a reaping the benefits of improved relationships by taking and utilizing the good for our good."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is fascinating (pun intended). Reviews of it -- including those on this web page -- are mixed and often passionate for good reason. The ideas are as explosive today as they were when the book was first published.Like any text, your reaction to this book will depend upon how you read it. It can be a joyful revelation, or a goad that drives you to fury, or a hilarious view into an antiquated perspective on gender relationships. Does this book suggest that a wife should put a bow in her hair and lisp praises for her husband's awesome strength and capability? Yes. Does it claim that doing so will improve her marriage? Yes. Can such techniques work in the long run? The jury still seems to be out on that.Manipulation in any relationship is deadly. But sincerely doing things that encourage others to be the best they can be is good from both a secular and a Christian perspective. It builds good mental health. Assuming that our gender makes us prefer certain kinds of behavior both in ourselves and in our mates, and that our ability to meet our own ideals of our gender affects our general happiness and self-esteem, it seems that giving and receiving gender-oriented encouragement is not a bad idea.I have never found a book that so clearly explained how I can cause my husband to feel good about himself as a man. I appreciate that. I look at this book not as a prescription for living -- which is how the author intended it, without question --- but as a sort of cook-book, full of good things to try. Or perhaps as a tool-kit to draw from to smooth over some rough times and make the good times more fun. Taken that way, I think _Fascinating Womanhood_ is a work of genius. It is jam-packed with things to try. At the very least you will learn a great deal about yourself and about your husband as you experiment with behavior and responses.If a long, interesting and ever-growing marriage is your goal, then read this book. It is bound to give you ideas to work with for many years to come."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Today's my 18th wedding anniversary, and if I had followed most of this book's recommendations, my husband would have had me committed long ago! Installing the cupholder upside-down to prove my need for his masterful help?! Even with his degree in Industrial Design, he wouldn't be flattered...he'd just be wondering why he'd been foolish enough to marry a dingbat, to force his children to be raised by a dingbat mother in these threatening times when one needs to have one's maximum wits available in case of impending terror or crime! This author must have missed the passage in the Old Testament describing the woman of valor whose value is above rubies! That biblical woman was a terrific manager, she bought and sold property and farm goods, she was very skilled, wise and strong. I can't think of a single Biblical woman who benefited herself or her family or her people by acting childish and dumb. Do you think Sarah or Ruth or Esther or Mary were talking babytalk to their spouses? come on! It is possible to have humility AND dignity AND wisdom AND strength, to offer the full measure of your intelligence and capability to your husband and life-mate, instead of minimizing yourself because you think he is not man enough for his ego to be able to stand strong in comparison. Why not offer 100% of your gifts rather than insulting him by acting like a half-wit (implying he must be only a slightly-more-than-half-wit, dumb enough to be threatened by 100% of you?) How to have a happy marriage? Just love, love love your spouse, listen to him, respect him, enjoy him, laugh with him, know him, be patient with him and keep joy and laughter in your home. Honor and love yourself and your strengths and your flaws, and share your gladness with Heaven and Earth. It's only worked for 18 years so far for me, but if that's good enough for you, save your money from this book and spend it on fun for the two of you!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am a Christian. This book restored life to my marriage. I was concerned that the author is Mormon. I asked my husband if he saw anything wrong with the book as I was practicing it. He has not read it. He has been so pleased with the new me that he describes the book as &quot;speaking the truth in love&quot;. As I have practiced what the book says, I have always checked my motives to make sure they were honest and pure in the things I said and did. I believe in the Trinity, which is different from Mormon belief. I believe the only way a person can truly and sincerely practice the ideas in the book is by the grace of God through the blood of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit. Every time I have asked God to show me how to apply the principles and to empower me to apply them He has taken over and blessed my husband and me beyond anything any human ability could do. I don't know the author, but I love her for what she has done to help me understand how to respect and win (I Peter 3:4) my husband. Her dearly loved husband has recently died and she misses him sorely. I pray for her often. A Christian man, David Coory with Zealand Publishers, has taken the concepts of Fascinating Womanhood and condensed them in a superb way in Secrets of Fascinating Womanhood. I highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was very helpful in helping me to restore a peaceful relationship with my husband. By changing my behavior I was able to s-l-o-w-l-y make amends in a rocky marriage.I recommend this book to any wife who is critical, naggy, and dis-pleased with her husband. His behaviour is partially a mirror of how you make him feel.Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I've been married for 33 years. After about 5 years of marriage, I was ready to throw in the towel. Marriage didn't meet my expectations. I prayed about it, and was led to this book (this book is old). I learned that my approach to resolving issues was causing more issues. I was doing all the wrong things. You can't change your partner, you can only change yourself. I began to practice the techniques suggested in this book, and I am here to say that it worked miracles for my marriage. We have raised three children -- all are adults now -- college educated and on their own. I am loving life with my husband. I have referred this book to many women over the years. You either love or hate this book. To those that hate it, stay single and be happy by yourself!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book really works. I read it a few years ago and found myself in a situation wherin I felt I needed to reread it. Within a couple of days of reading it, I could tell a difference. My husband smiled more and was thanking me for the thoughtful things I was doing. The author knows both men and women. She gives detailed information regarding many aspects of the man/woman relationship and then has solutions for how to deal with these aspects. Yes, as the wife, sometimes you have to humble yourself, but in so doing, the man humbles himself and begins to treat you the way you had hoped he would treat you. The wife must decide if she wants a happy marriage or if she wants to be right. I've watched women choose the latter, and it is sad to see the men become just as the author describes. Then the women can't imagine why their marriage is suffering.The author also looks into abusive situations, and of course, these are the exeptions. No one would want a woman to stay in such a situation."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was talking to someone about this book today, a good thirty years after I first read it and tried to base my life upon it, and thought I would go on amazon to see if I could get an old copy, as I was sure it was long out of print. I thought I might like my daughters to read it, not to follow it, but so that they could better understand the mindset in which I was married. I was amazed to find it still in print, and still having an influence!I rated it three stars mainly because I would have rated it five stars as a young bride, sure it was the answer to a happy marriage, and no stars now. One young woman in her review said that if you treat people well, they will treat you well in return. I always believed this as well. Unfortunately, it is not always true. As a young woman, I guess I thought I could control what happened to me by simply being kind and sweeet to everyone. But there are men out there who are cruel and misogynistic and looking for women to victimize. My husband apparently believed I volunteered, and since I worked so hard on being submissive, following the guidelines in this book (which I read over and over and over again, trying harder and harder and harder to be the perfect wife) and books like the Total Woman and others in the same ilk, and numerous classes, ad nauseum.Think about it. A marriage takes two people. If only one is trying, and the other one is sitting back waiting to see what you will do next to please him, what direction is it going to go? If you married Jeffrey Dahmer, and applied the principles in this book, do you seriously think he would treat you like a queen? The man's character comes into play too. I didn't marry Jeffrey Dahmer, but I married someone who was controlling and narcisstic and deighted to have someone to dominate. For the record, I stayed married to him for twenty years, gave him several children, was a good wife to him till the day he died. I thanked God for releasing me from a nightmare existence and I have been grateful every day for my freedom and the chance to find myself again. I threw out all my marriage books - when I get married again, I want the two of us to find out way together, and to respect each other as equals. I never want a marriage like that again. Maybe if you marry a good man this could work, but I think it would allow his worst qualities to come forth because he knows you will not check them. I know there is a section on stamping your foot and shaking your curls and so forth to keep him from bullying you, but that just doesn't work with violent abusive men."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a book to write a review on Amazon. This book is disturbing and wretchedly cruel to all of the women who have worked all of their lives to become unique, independent adults with equal opportunities and responsibilities at work and at home.I am a married Christian woman who enjoys a marriage to a man who believes in taking responsibility for our marriage, who believes that it is his responsibility to lead and provide, and who (after I read him a few quotes) told me to throw away this book. It's disgustingly condescending and narrow-minded. A woman can submit to her husband's leadership without alternating between mindless, immature behavior and Machiavellian manipulation.I'm ashamed that I purchased it and, after reading it, outraged that it is still in print. More than that, I'm frightened for all of the women out there trying to do what's right for their marriage, who are sincerely searching for God's will in it. God did not call women to helplessness or deception. You are beautiful, you are lovely, and you are cherished because you are His. Don't believe anything that tells you otherwise."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Love this book because it compelled me to look at myself first. VERY humbling for me (I grew up with feminist ideals btw). Revealed my own character weaknesses and made it painfully plain the areas where I could improve. Got me to think about how courteous and concerned about other people (and boyfriend) I really am, or if I neglect those aspects. I don't espouse the purpose of people is to have children because I never wanted my own, but I respect others' desire to do so. (I'd wish she'd write a book for the working single woman like me.) Some powerful good wisdom in here, though. I mustered an attempt to be more considerate & less witchy to the crabby awful boss and coworker men after developing some peace and sense of humor within, and it worked like a charm! Peace in the office for the first time in 3 years!! No more daily agony and fights- just tears of gratitude from me in private. And I was the one who brought it about. The power was in my hands all the time but I didn't see it! I can't even lend my book out because I don't want to be without it as a reference. I am so deeply grateful for this book as a reality check on myself. Like I said before: very humbling! Don't buy it if you can't look past some seemingly outdated views or you're not ready to self-correct! It's not about him, it's about YOU."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book has been more helpful than marriage counseling at improving, maybe even saving, my marriage. I recommend it to anyone wanting to understand their husband and role in the family better, but especially if your relationship is headed down a rough road try this book before you give up. While I can see how the advice wouldn't fit everyone's needs, the personality types fit my husband and I. This book really helped me to understand what his side of life is like and what his needs are. I needed this information explained from a woman's point of view. I can't express my gratitude enough that Helen wrote this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am surprized to read the venomous reactions of some women to this book. I came across the book about 5 years ago and it transformed my marriage - for the better. After reading it for a couple of weeks, my husband said to me, &quot;I don't know what you are reading in that book, but please keep it up.&quot; I passed the book on and heard that several other husbands made similar comments. It is especially good on understanding men. I recommend it to any wife who really truly wants to love her husband. Following these principles can transform even a troubled marriage."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My wife found this book in her mother's basement, and since I had heard it was an amusing relic of a bygone era, I thought I'd look through it. I didn't anticipate my finding a certain &quot;fascination&quot; with it indeed. If it weren't such a tragic representation of how to cultivate meaningless, shallow relationships, it would in fact be hugely comical, as some other readers have suggested.Andelin's idea of human relations is to reduce both partners' interactions to mere manipulations, to reduce human beings of flesh and blood to two-dimensional cardboard cutouts playing at roles. The naivete and flawed reasoning displayed by this author, who is ostensibly trying to help people have more successful relationships, is nothing short of mind-boggling and borders on the pathological.If this book is representative of what some women were thinking and experiencing in the 60's, no wonder there was a revolution. And no wonder some of those who didn't revolt ended up addicted to valium, suffered eating disorders, or experienced so many other psychologically and spiritually damaging things in order to live in a mental strait-jacket that they perceived as somehow necessary or inevitable. My heart goes out to them--and to women now who still believe they must be like this--and to the men who think they love them.Don't read this book if you're going to take it remotely seriously. If you do, get professional help immediately."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have been happily married for almost 8 years. When I say happily married, I really mean happily married. Many people often ask me what is the secret and I never was able to verbalize the exact secrets. I recently read this book and found the answer. This book spelled it out for me. After reading this book, I realized what I was doing right. I have been practicing all 8 relationship rules without even realizing it. What the book says about these rules worked for me. I strongly recommend all women to read this book. If you do not read the whole book, at least read and master the eight rules. It is the truth and it works. Do not be turned off by the negative critics who have not been in a long and happy marriage. Trust me it is worth every cent."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Im not a religious woman, in fact Im agnostic. However, MOST (notice I did not say all) the advice in here is what women NEED to hear these days, but everyone is afraid to tell us for fear of being polically incorrect.. Yes, men DO prefer a feminine looking woman who's physically healthy. Men do appreciate a woman who admires them, and allows them to make their own mistakes without nagging them about their behavior. Yes, say nice things to your man and let him know you admire him. After all, you like HIM to do the same for you. HOWEVER, the BAD advice is to assume men want to financially support a woman! Ask ANY man, and he'll tell you he wants a woman who can and will WORK outside the home and do her part to bring in money. Sadly, she gives women bad advice by telling them to REFUSE to work. Men these days dont' want to give their money to women like they used to. (Sadly, lol.)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I read about this book, and laughed at some of the ideas. But I was drawn in. I haven't applied everything, as some of it is a bit outdated. But I have been working on using the character principals, and it has worked wonders! I am not turning into a doormat for anyone, but giving a little respect to our husbands never hurts!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I wish I could give this text zero stars, because this was one of the most appalling books I have read. Everything from the patronizing manner it was written to the incredulous reinterpetation of Tolstoy's marriage - I felt frustrated reading this book in part due to the author writing as if her audience was ten years old.One of the biggest issues my grandmother faced after my grandfathers death was that she had no idea how to take care of herself. Maybe some men would like the traditional wife, but if he dies or leaves then the woman is completely vulnerable. I think it is naive and arrogant to not learn how to be an independent woman, especially in this day and age. It is a travesty that there are still women who still read this and believe that in order to be loved, they must show how weak they are."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I've noticed something about the review ratings for this book (the place above each review where you can rate how helpful it was). Whenever someone writes a review praising \\"Fascinating Womanhood,\\" it is immediately rated as \\"helpful\\" by tons of people. But whenever someone writes a review that criticizes the book in any way, it is suddenly rated as \\"not helpful\\" by tons of people. Personally, I have always rated reviews (for any book) on how well-written they were, and whether or not the writer supported their opinion. (Writing a review that consists of the sentence \\"This book sucks!\\" would usually earn a \\"not helpful\\" rating from me, even if I agreed with it, because the reviewer didn't give any reasons.) It seems that there is a large contingent of fans of this book who can't stand to see any criticism of it, and give \\"not helpful\\" ratings to any review that voices a differing opinion from their own. Why else would well-written, thoughtful reviews of people who disagree with the book get such bad ratings? And I'm sure that this review will get lots of \\"not helpful\\" ratings from the cult - oops, I mean fanbase - of this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"What a thrill to be allowed to comment prettily on this book. In fact what a thrill it is to live in a time when so many domestic conveniences at our disposal give us the extra time that is needed to read great literature like this - of course, after we've completed our chores and accommodated our sweetheart's every whim and appetite. I, for one, am so pleased to be allowed occasional and appropriately limited access to a modern computer after my Husband and his children have gone to bed - it's 4 AM as I write this! - so that I can share my thoughts about this book. [Would it be appropriate for me to suggest that American women take a moment every day to thank Men for permitting us - no, even encouraging us - to learn to read in the first place? Again, how fortunate we are to live in a modern society where (even though we haven't the capacity to make intellectual contribution, and thus must realize that reading and writing by women is frivolous recreational activity with no actual value to society) women are allowed books, and writing instruments!] Ah, but I've strayed from the topic. (Silly little me! how this would amuse my Man, who lies sated in a nearby room!) My purpose here is twofold: One, I wish to recommend this book with 2 girlish thumbs up and suggest that every girl in America read Fascinating Womanhood and respond appropriately to its Teachings. Two, and only because matters of female physical attractiveness and appearance of youth and childishness - manufactured, if necessary - are of such fundamental importance, I humbly request information from a reader, publisher, or perhaps, the author, herself. Can someone correct my imperfect reasoning --- what woman can perform even the simplest math, after all! -- and explain why dates of birth and college entry in an author's bio suggest that Mrs. Andelin is soon to be 80 years old, when her publicity photos (book cover, The Fascinating Girl, and Author's home page, Andelin-2000.com) depict a woman of 18 or 19? You are truly a goddess, Ms. Andelin! Thank you so much, everyone, for listening to my insignificant and superficial female thoughts on a subject of such great importance - how we might better prepare ourselves to achieve our highest calling - that of ornament, domestic, and sex slave to the good - or bad! - men who would take us as their wives."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book did have a few useful tips about relationships that could probably be beneficial for *both* spouses to use. That's why I gave it two stars. But for the most part, this book made me very angry, because the main message of the book is \\"Every problem that happens in a marriage is the wife's fault.\\" Nowhere does the book even entertain the idea that sometimes husbands can be at fault. If the husband cheats on his wife, it's because she isn't feminine enough. If he beats her, it's because she's too bossy. If he is nasty to her, it's because she wasn't understanding or sympathetic to the pressure he is under at work. And all of these problems can be solved, apparently, if the wife reads this book and follows its principles. The book is *filled* with anecdotes written by women who have supposedly been helped by previous editions of the book, and they all basically go like this: \\"My husband used to beat me. Then I read 'Fascinating Womanhood' and realized that our problems were all my fault, and I started acting the way the book told me to act. Now my husband acts sweet and kind.\\" In my opinion, there is NO EXCUSE for a man to hit a woman, unless she is coming at him with a deadly weapon and he's trying to defend himself. For this book to suggest that a woman should stick with a husband who hits her, and blame herself for the beatings, is completely unethical. Probably the most ridiculous section of this book was the one on acting \\"childlike.\\" For example, if a woman gets angry at her husband, she is supposed to stomp her foot and whine like a little kid, because apparently men think this is cute. And she readily admits that women don't normally behave this way, so they need to become \\"actresses\\" and put on an \\"act\\" of being childlike. Since when does it help a relationship to put on an act and pretend to be someone you're not?"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is the best book I ever read about making a marriage work and it did.

No supporting documentation AT ALL besides case studies, unless you count fictional characters from Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens. 2. A purportedly Christian model of marriage, even though Andelin herself is LDS (Mormon), which is NOT a Christian church and has a different attitude toward women than Christianity (or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism). 3. It claims that women facing domestic violence should try Fascinating Womanhood before leaving. This is not only a lie, it is flat out dangerous. I wonder how many &quot;fascinating women&quot; have stayed married at the cost of broken bones and teeth? 4. An incredibly condescending view of men, as fragile creatures who can be easily manipulated into &quot;cherishing&quot; their wives, which seems to mean buying them lots of presents. 5. Most women in America don't work for luxuries - unless you count food, clothing, and shelter as &quot;luxuries.&quot; This is an incredibly outdated view, supported by NOTHING but the author's belief. Has she truly read no census reports later than 1960? Doesn't she realize that in many parts of the country a couple can't afford a two bedroom apartment on one salary? Or that working class women frequently are the primary breadwinners?I could go on and on, but this book is nothing more than yet another example of misogynism masquerading as good advice. My husband actually grew *angry* at the veiled insults to men (not to mention the overt insults to women!), and said that if he ever caught me using such nonsense, he'd leave me at once.Absolutely horrible. If a woman's marriage is so bad that she feels compelled to do as this book suggests, she has my profound sympathy. Too bad Helen Andelin doesn't suggest that &quot;woman, queen of earth's creatures&quot; solve her marital problems by developing some self-respect and expecting her husband to act like an adult!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I know alot of the ideas in this book seem to be old and outdated but truly once you have read the book and really put the authors advice to work in your life I can promise you great things can happen.

I realized that I really didn't know what I was doing. I didn't understand men or know the feminine power I had to make a marriage work. I had read many marriage books and they were too much theory and not enough solid solutions. When I found Fascinating Womanhood I thought it was too &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;anti-woman&quot;. But, when I started to read further and try it out, I was amazed. It gave me clear assignments that went right along with the female instincts I had always had but was told wouldn't work. But, they did! My husband responded immediately to each particular assignment in a way that I had always wanted him to respond to me. It was then that I knew that through this book I had the power to make it work even if he never tried. And as I acquire the principles of Fascinating Womanhood into my character more and more everyday; I am living the romance that I'd dreamed of as a child. Thank God for my femininity and Fascinating Womanhood!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Yes, I bought this for my current girlfriend, because it was recommended to me by a very close friend of mine. My friend told me that it would change my girlfriend's life, and our relationship.I actually read it myself, after my girlfriend read it, and I have to say that it is a book of common sense, and hit the nail on the head, except for one chapter. The chapter on holding back sex made my mouth drop, and I talked to my girlfriend about it, and we both agreed that denying sex would be very toxic to our relationship, even if it was me denying her sex.Other than that chapter, then book was a great read, and we have had many positive discussions about this book and I have felt that we are much closer and I love how she makes me feel now."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is one of the worst books. It is all about manipulation and how to lie to get what you want. It is cloaked in a dirty robe of religion. God never asked us to manipulate people to get what we want. To act childish to get a man to love you is to have a man who never grew up himself. This writer is dysfunctional and so are the men she writes about.I was raised on this book by my Christian school. It did more damage to me than I can say in this short review. The big keys are obedience & submission. Both are not godly end all be all qualities. Sometimes the godly thing is to stand up to your man and defend your child or someone else. Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself so that you are not abused. This book sets you up so that other people will run all over and abuse you. I can't say that enough.Follow it to your own peril."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"As you can see from my Amazon i.d., i certainly love romance novels; love has always been my priority in life. So, i thought i'd read this book, just to see if it offered any good advice towards making your relationship a wonderful experience for the both of you. i wasn't expecting instructions on how to make reality like it is some kind of fantasy, but, i did think i'd pick up some pointers on building a wonderful love affair.In some ways, this book really does have some helpful advice. It does indeed give you some insight on how men think, and what they feel on the inside, particularly in terms of their masculine pride.However, i thought that this book emphasized making a man happy by being a \\"domestic goddess\\" much more so than it did making him happy by being an alluring, feminine woman who wants to deeply love him . This book talks about having an \\"angelic character\\", and while i'm sure that's wonderful, it seems to me that men want someone who is indeed loving to a fault and completely kind-hearted, they also want someone fun and exciting to be with, and who also has a lot of depth to her. You know, someone with a bit of \\"sparkle\\" to her.i don't know if i'm just misinterpreting something here, but there were times when i didn't think Mrs. Andelin's advice was the best fit for me. For example, i love and adore wearing dresses, skirts and heels, but there's times you'll find me in jeans too; preferably with a lovely floral embroidered pattern, of course, paired with a fabulous pair of heels, be they boots, pumps or sandals. Would Helen Andelin approve of a woman wearing jeans and ab-fab heels? i don't know. Also, i love wearing \\"Daisy Duke\\" shorty-shorts, regarding which i don't think Mrs. Andelin would approve (she seems quite conservative!). Well, being soft and pretty is wonderful, and of course i am; i think every really feminine woman is. Yet having a little \\"zing\\" to your personality, you know, a little \\"diva\\" thing going on, and expressing that in your outfits (tastefully and with a great deal of charm, of course) is a good thing too.Men have always responded well to me, because i am a good listener, i try to understand how they feel about things, and i'm fun to be with. (Also, i recognize that talking endlessly about feelings is what we women have girlfriends for!) \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\" does seem to advocate for those things, but it seems ... well ... a little \\"stuffy\\" too. i just think that men really want a woman with whom he can really be himself, and not have to be thinking about how she's up on a pedestal somewhere. i don't mean that to sound critical; not at all. Being a man's \\"angel\\" is fine, as long as you are someone he feels he can relate to.So, i'm giving this book three stars. While i agree with some things it says, i had a little trouble with some others. i think, as another reviewer stated, that it's like a cookbook: Try a few recipes, keep the ones you like, and don't worry about the others.For example, i just can't imagine myself \\"shaking my curls\\" like a little girl to show i'm upset, but i can very much relate to what i think Helen Andelin is really trying to teach us: It's better to try to communicate with a man in such a way that he doesn't think i'm trying to \\"win the argument\\", or make him look like he's wrong. i'm just trying to help him to understand (as much as a man can, anyway) what i'm feeling when it's clear that he does not. i just think that you can communicate with a man, and still be very feminine and loving while doing so, without having to act like a little girl (which i really don't think would go over too well!). So, i guess it's important to try to \\"read between the lines\\" a little to try to understand what Helen Andelin is really getting at.i guess i'll finish by saying that this book is very traditional in its views about marriage and relationships; Helen Andelin does teach that the man is supposed to be the leader in your relationship, so if that is a turn-off for you, then you might want to look elsewhere for advice. However, if you want to just cherry-pick some good ideas here and there (while leaving behind the ones you just can't quite relate to), then this book may well be worth your while to read.So, three stars it is; this book was helpful, and it does give a different point-of-view than what you'd find in, say, \\"Cosmo\\" (not that there's anything wrong with \\"Cosmo\\"; i've had a subscription for years). i did get some good insight and ideas, which i am sure will be helpful; it's just that, imho, men want something a little different from what Helen Andelin says that they want. Having said that, i still think that this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Some of the reviewers might not have a strong religious influence in their life, that's why it might be difficult for them to grasp the concepts in this book. If you want happiness with your husband it takes alot of hard work. It's not like they picture it in fairytales... but once you put in that effort, it will become second nature to you. You will become a better human being, and your relationships with everyone around you will improve as the teachings of FW become part of you.

The author is totally oblivious to the realities faced by many women, and even suggests in this book that abused women BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES!!!! Husband an alcoholic? What did you do to make him an alcoholic? Ack!Why five stars? Every young woman should read this with an intensely critical eye, to see the changes that have occurred in the state of American marriage, and to be thankful to the women who have worked so hard to ensure that none of us have to suffer this life any more. I will NEVER pretend to be afraid of thunder and lightening to make my husband feel like he's fulfilling his role as a \\"protector\\" . . . hahaha! :)And to all of you who bought this thinking it would work to fix your marriage - that was your first problem - you read a book instead of talking to your spouse."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of book, as the reviews show. Upon a first, or surface, reading, a modern feminist of either gender is likely to scoff. However, upon second reading, and over time, I have discovered so many precious timeless truths about men, women, and the human condition.The test is, how well does it work? And the answer is that it works VERY well. Often we are tempted to try to fix relationship problems by focusing on what the other person could do better... but really, it works so much better to take care of what we actually have control of.... ourselves.There is no subservience in this book. Mrs. Andelin specifically speaks against being a doormat to abuse. A lot of people somehow get that idea and really, it just isn't in the book.I especially appreciate the examples Mrs. Andelin gives from classical literature and history. They enrich the text with excellent ideas of how femininity \\"looks\\"... our modern world is impoverished of true femininity, and actually, this may be why people get so confused about this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It seems that several of the most recent comments are highly negative. I feel this is in direct proportion to our divorce rate in this country. In the 50's, when women stayed home, supported their husbands, and raised their kids, were there shootings at schools? Were there drive by shootings? The women who attack the author based on her religion have never picked up a bible and actually read it. In all truth, this book is simply stating God's instruction, regardless of religion, of women's role in society. We are supporters, peace-keepers, and nuturers.

The male as responsible, protective HoH (head of household) and the female as compliant, cherished helpmate may be scorned by some, but may be vastly preferable to other ways that lack tenderness, respect, and intimacy. This book is a course on how a woman, acting unilaterally, can evoke the best in her man and revitalize her marriage, by pressing the inborn buttons that bring out the master in him, in the best sense. (To master his home life, a man must first master himself.) The author uses heroines from classic literature to express ways a woman can endearingly reshape her primary relationship in the modern world. In print for over a quarter-century, the book is itself a classic that sells because millions of women have found it helpful. Its advice needn't be accepted uncritically--pick and choose, experiment and adapt; even a single helpful approach could make a difference for couples confused by conflicting messages from traditional and feminist views of the long-term monogamous male-female relationship.

The first couple of chapters were a little dull, but after getting through the part describing what an ideal woman is from a man's point of view, it got really interesting. There is no denying the differences between men and women, and Helen Adeline is very perceptive in describing what men want from women. It doesn't require being a pleaser, only a deeper understanding and consideration of men's needs - what any caring woman would want to give her husband. I learned so much from this book, and it proved itself in the implementation. I highly recommend this book. For women who are interested in a feminist perspective, see The Surrendered Wife - a book with similar views, but a different twist."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you are a red blooded feminist who scorns feminity and thinks that a woman's fufillment is in aping or outdoing men, stop here as this book will only disgust you. However, if you are a lady whose priorities lie in being loved and appreciated by her husband, children, family members, and all who meet her, this book is a godsend.Fascinating Womanhood isn't magic(though the results may seem magical!)and it isn't a gimmick.It isn't about some drastic change of your unique personality It's simply a practical, common sense detailed explanation of how to become a fascinating and loved woman using your feminine powers(and we all have them).Helen Andelin has summarized what most women have known for years, but what our generation has forgotten. She puts forth methods that, deep down inside are part of a woman's nature. Things like childlikeness, timidity, trustfulness, spunkiness, and other qualities that men find attractive are covered. She explains why theses traits fascinate men and make them love women..and it all makes perfect sense! How many times have you been with a boyfriend or husband and seen him react favorably from some seemingly stupid act on your part? You just couldn't understand why he thought it was so cute when you pouted at him, or why he kissed you when you were afraid of a mouse...Andelin explains why and gives concrete examples from her own experience and the experiences of others. Her ideas may seem foreign, outdated, and maybe even degrading to the women of our culture, but they're really based on a very well known principle of today. Opposites attract. We are only so fascinating to men in as much as we are different from them. Come on, we can all see this physically...female models are slender,big chested, and luscious lipped while the male models are buff and muscular with harder masculine features. If these differentiating characteristics are considered attractive for the body, it only seems logical that opposing characters and actions would make do the same mentally. I assure you that, if you apply the principles from this book, your relationship with your husband-or any man in your life-will drastically improve.These are such fundamental truths and I have NEVER known them to fail.Men ALWAYS react favorably when they come in contact with a \\"fascinating woman.\\" I have known many women who have saved marriages that were falling apart or brought true love to a mediocre companionship. If you are dubious and this all sounds a bit incredible, just give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Only women who are too proud or hard hearted to make a sincere attempt fail. I am sure if all girls were taught this information(as they were 60 years ago), the divorce rate would drop drastically. Helen Andelin receives my sincere and heartfelt applause."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Thank you very much for sending me the book, Fascinating Womanhood.

For centuries women have worked alongside men (granted, getting less credit, but working just the same) and only the privileged few could stand idly by while the 'menfolk' talked 'business'.

I am a strong educated woman who seeks wisdom from all viable sources. So, my advice for those with reservations is to \\"eat the meat and spit out the bones.\\" In other words, take the parts that are for you and apply them. The author is a vessel trying to deliver encouragement, not trying to enslave the minds of modern women. Her book is filled with advice which is based on opinion, and opinions can be taken or left!I look at her as if she were an older relative conversing with me about a topic of interest. So, while I may listen, I don't regard her words as law. I think that's the most balanced way to approach it.

Although there were some zingers - managing the budget can make women mentally ill, not acting strictly according to gender stereotypes (don't be a doctor or CEO, don't wear tweed, be graceful and dependant at all times) will turn your kids gay, etc. - there was a lot that I found very sensible and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, these sensible bits were grouped together with idiotic claims. For example, the advice that wives should not try to \\"improve\\" their husband by nagging or any other means was followed by the assurance that this will please your husband so much that he will be putty in your hands. The rule that any husband who physically threatens his wife or children should immediately left is tempered by the caveat that any behavior short of this, from alcoholism to laziness to belittling sarcasm, will disappear if met with womanly sweetness and compliancy. While a liberal arts education is encouraged, any career-oriented training is frowned upon. The chapter on sex was better than I'd expected - the author gives her permission for wives to tell their husbands no once in a while - but altogether there was too much emphasis on gushing over you husband's manliness and skills, especially if they are non-existent. In fact, there was a lot in this book to suggest that women are both mentally deficient and the power behind the throne, while men are strong, intelligent, shallow, and easily managed. The reader is told that husbands are under no obligation to love their wives or even show them any affection, while a wife who shows her unhappiness is proclaimed a sinner. This book originally came out in 1965 and the new edition also contains many testimonies from women whose marriages were saved thanks to this book. While I am truly happy for them, following the advice of this book requires wives to be manipulative at some times and compliant (against their better judgment) at other times. Surely it is better for both spouses to be honest and supportive of one another, rather than have peace at the price of so much deceit."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My mother, myself and all my sisters have read this book over and over.

I wish I had found it years earlier. It has helped me understand what motivates my partner, and provided me with an invaluable insight into his mind and heart.

But sometimes good things are cloaked under a lot of misunderstanding and untruths, and I think you have to read it with an open mind in order to benefit from its' message."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"...would be a better title. Madly in love with my husband, I read the book in hopes of being an even better wife to him. I thought I would find secrets of experienced wives who had learned how to be a truly facinating woman. On the contrary, I found that the author seems to have very little regard for men in general. She refers to their behavior as childlike and teaches the reader to manipulate him, tolerate his failings by turning a blind eye and discouraging too much sex because, \\"like a child who wants too many cookies, a man must be denied sometimes for his own good (paraphrased but she did use that exact analogy).\\" When I incredulously commented on the book, my husband's curiosity led him to read bits of it!! He was insulted and disgusted! He told me the only thing I would become is an automaton, a stepford wife or an unbearable bore. He found it more facinating that I rejected the fact that the author assumes men are so fragile that we must protect them. While there were some excellent points about not berating or belittling your husband as well as good points about being kinder and having a generally sweet disposition, much of her advice is antiquated.

The points presented with regards to understanding and respecting your husband are very useful and very important. Accepting him at face value, placing him first in your life, recognizing how important your respect is to him, etc. -- nobody would ever question how fundamental these are. No argument there. The book would be worth buying for those chapters alone, were it not for the other points (indicated below under \\"con\\") that negate this recommendation.2. There is no doubt that, if you are a married woman, your first priority is to be a successful wife and mother. All else is secondary. Absolutely. Again, no argument there.3. It is also not disputed that happiness is dependent upon the development of character. Of course, as a Catholic I would add that it also depends on regular reception of the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist - the author of course neglects these important points because she is not a Catholic.Okay, here are the reasons I do not recommend this book - especially in regards to Catholics:1. \\"Childlike\\" behavior when mistreated is an immediate red flag. I know of no mature individual who wouldn't think you were \\"off your rocker\\" for such behavior. It's ineffective and ridiculous, plus it does not emphasize your human dignity stating you don't accept certain behavior. Childlikeness is probably the worst way to confront real issues. Frank and calm discussion with your points clearly laid out is the proper way to handle things like this. You're an adult and you're supposed to act like one.2. Mrs. Andelin, both in this book and on her website, clearly shows that she is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church). In one of her question and answer sessions on her website, she quotes Eve as saying in the Garden of Eden when she and Adam are leaving after committing the Original Sin: \\"It is better that we go through sorrow now, so that we may choose between good and evil.\\" (Not a direct quote; this is the jist of what it said.) Now, this is NOT from the book of Genesis! In fact, it is clearly pointed out in the Book of Genesis that Original Sin was deliberate disobedience to the Law of God, and put mankind in the need of a Redeemer, etc. This is an LDS take on Genesis and is not Biblical. It may, but I am not certain, come from one of their other scriptures (there are many). This should make all Catholics and our separated Protestant brethren who are not LDS wary of \\"Scriptural\\" quotations.3. In the book (at least in the 1973 edition), she describes the forty-day fast of Jesus in the desert in the chapter entitled \\"A Worthy Character\\". She indicates that during that time He gained spiritual strength to resist temptations. Pardon me -- Jesus Christ is God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. He fasted for forty days as an example; He allowed the devil to tempt Him because the devil was not allowed to know the true identity of Jesus Christ as God until the moment of the crucifixion (you can read this in many writings of the mystics; I suggest \\"The Mystical City of God\\" by Venerable Mary of Agreda). The temptation in the desert was for our edification to make us aware of the three enemies to our salvation - the flesh, the devil and the world. While it's fine to use this as an example of how we can build our character through fasting - and the forty-day fast of Lent is, in fact, an imitation of our Blessed Lord in this act - it is essential to clarify that He fasted for our edification and example. To indicate that He \\"needed\\" to fast to \\"build His character\\" is a heresy against our Faith.4. At the beginning, she uses an example of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz as an example of true and deep love a man has for a woman. Shah Jahan was a Muslim. He committed atrocious acts of violence in India, which resulted in the mass murder of many, and had several wives of which Mumtaz was but one. To use such an example is very wrong. Any man practicing polygamy is committing a mortal sin against both the Sixth and Ninth Commandments solemnly handed to Moses by God. He cannot possess true love for his wife until he repents and confesses his sins. Muslims deny the divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ; therefore using them as the prime example in a book geared to Christian women automatically discredits the book.5. All the characters she cites in the book as examples of true womanhood are ficticious. While that is fine, she neglects any mention of the Blessed Virgin Mary as our ideal of true womanhood. For Catholics, this is a glaring and unacceptable ommission. That alone is enough to make us set this one aside. And what of the various women saints throughout history? Why resort to ficticious characters all the time? Even if you're not a Catholic, surely you can find real women who really lived as opposed to simply characters in novels to emulate.6. As a final point - in today's world, to not be prepared to assume paid employment is pure insanity. This is especially foolish in today's world with today's economy. We simply aren't living in the nineteenth century anymore. You need to be prepared to make a living. Yes, when you are raising young children, you need to raise them. That's your first priority. But you need to have the career training in case it's needed - I'm sorry, but these \\"emergencies\\" are far more common than this book would have you believe! Underemployment is a reality in this world; unemployment is a reality; mortgage payments are real; college savings are real - need I go further???? In short, you are utterly foolish if you do not realize that it is necessary to have a professional life in addition to a family life. This doesn't mean you can't be a stay home mother. I'm a stay home homeschooling mother. It does mean keeping your skills sharp, and maintaining your \\"employability\\" so you have it at a moment's notice when needed - and as a final point, when your children have left home it's a good idea to go back to work so you can accrue the Social Security benefits and put away money in your IRA, which everyone should start as soon as they're 18 - and that means you, not just your husband.Final point: Here are recommendations for Catholics and anyone else who realizes there are major flaws here:Great Wives and Mothers by Hugh Francis Blunt (now back in print)Cana Is Forever (Right Rev.

This book ruined many areas of my life and did not help my marriage in the long run. It brought peace at first since my husband was happy not having to grow and to have me become more and more &quot;fascinating&quot; while he stayed just as unfascinating as ever. The problem with this book is that it's foundations are false. People are responsible for their own behavior and if your husband is irresponsible and isn't loving you it is a problem with him, not with you. He needs to be confronted and change. It doesn't matter how &quot;fascinating&quot; you become. This book could only work if you had a really great husband and it was you that had all the problems, but even then if you followed this book he'd lose respect for you. Please, if you have marriage problems, go and see a marriage counselor, a trained psychologist, so you can base your decisions on accurate foundations. Don't give up your career or stop developing yourself. Don't believe the problem is all with you, that you just aren't &quot;fascinating&quot; enough. Don't dress like an old-fashioned weirdo and be overly self-concious about feminizing all your gestures. This book really will make you confused and waste precious time in your life! The only reason I gave it three stars was because the author is very insightful about what women really desire- it's a pity she doesn't know how they can get it. Read &quot;Boundaries&quot; by Cloud and Townsend or if you're single, read &quot;Safe People&quot; by the same authors. Hope I've been able to save someone from &quot;Fascinating Womanhood&quot;. Then I'll feel what I've been through is worth it. By the way, the author is not a christian, she's mormon."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I'm a modern, independent woman and I wasn't offended at all by this book. The concepts are actually not that far-fetched and they do work, for some strange reason (I tried a few on my husband). However, most of the behaviors she suggested are definitely NOT in my nature, so I felt like I had to perform a role or become a professional actress or something to pull them off (I also felt pretty stupid). I have another book called \\"The Surrendered Wife\\" that I like much better. The general sentiment is the same as Fascinating Womanhood, but the suggestions are much more practical and easy to implement - i.e., how to stop yourself from criticizing or trying to control your husband, how to turn over control of the finances, etc. They are simple and practical guidelines that you can implement without feeling like a big phony. :-)If you can act little-girlish and do some of the other things suggested in Fascinating Womanhood, it's definitely worth reading, but if you need something a bit more sensible, try The Surrendered Wife.Oh! Another book you might to check out is \\"The Five Love Languages.\\" That one offers pretty good strategies you can try to implement and applies to both husbands and wives. The Five Love Languages is about learning what your partner needs from you in order to feel loved (i.e., words of affirmation, gifts, etc.) and finding ways to give them those things."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is a great book for women of all colors and ages. It gets us back to the way God intended for us to be. A helpmate for the man, not his competitor."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is one to glean insights from if the reader is willing to consider love as what one gives for the other's sake rather than what onegives in order to receive. It is written in hopes that, when implemented, the suggestions would encourage a reciprocally loving relationship. But it is clear that the suggestions cannot be effectively followed if not done in sincerity. It is a dated book in that the mindset seems to be very \\"Father Knows Best\\" like, but I am grateful for most of what's being said. I read the book out of a need to understand how to love my husband in a way in which he needs to be loved. I found the insights helpful as I realize that women and men really do have different needs. I would not, however, suggest this book for women in abusive realtionships or as a primary teaching tool for young women, because the author does not empower women to reject a man's abhorrent behavior."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is the greatest! My mom was a woman's libber to the max. If a man didn't make her happy she showed him the door. After three marriages ended in disaster she started applying the principles in this book.

In a &quot;unisex&quot; age, this book takes a strong stand for the importance of honoring the differences between men and women. FASCINATING WOMANHOOD provides a time-tested method of strengthening the bond between husbands and wives and teaches how to resolve marital discords. This marriage classic can improve communication between spouses and renew romance. The program outlined in this book is especially helpful for women who missed having a strongly feminine role model in childhood"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book and threw it out. Then I read it again, and gave it away. Then I read it several more times and each time more and more of it made sense. I used some of the techniques on my father, especially the childlike way of expressing anger. It worked! I still use it occasionally. That technique allows me to blow off steam without creating a nasty scene. And though the man may laugh, he usually remembers what irritated me, which is what I wanted in the first place!

I'd like to think that a man today can appreciate a woman who is both feminine and his equal, perhaps even be attracted to her because she is in some ways better than he. This book was a response to the early days of the women's movement. But we're past that now and know we don't have to choose between being an individual and being feminine. If you want to know what fascinates Mr Andelin or what fascinated men of the 1960's, read this book. If you want to fascinate your husband, talk to him.

Definitely a book to read and apply every year."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am a Christian woman, born again of the Spirit. I denounce this book.The author uses more text from fiction than she does from the Bible. Two of the fiction writers whom she quotes throughout the book are Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo. Dickens and Hugo openly lived adulterous lives. Now tell me, would you set your lifestyle to parallel two adulterous authors' fiction writing?My favorite quote in the book is on page 192 of the 1973 printing. The author writes: \\"Often men's ugly and cruel actions are the woman's fault and are due to her lack of sympathetic understanding, her failure to appreciate and admire him, her inability to accept him at face value, to place him No. 1, or other things.\\"First, as a follower of God, I place God first. If you are following Christ, you don't put anyone before God (Matthew 10:37).Secondly, if an adult is \\"ugly and cruel\\" it's because he or she has chosen to be that way. It's not someone else's fault. I find that remark insulting and abusive to women -- blaming a man's wicked lifestyle choice on his wife. What hogwash!On page 166, the author talks about a state of \\"Angela Human\\" and that a woman can make her marriage last through eternity. The Lord told people flat out that those who enter heaven would not be given in marriage, but they are as the angels (Mark 12:25). What the author is bringing to the table is from the Mormon religion, which I caution Christians, has many errors.Here is more advice for women from the author from page 165. \\"You must dispense with any air of strength and ability, of competence and fearlessness and acquire instead an air of frail dependency upon man to take care of you.... And it is the absence of this air that permits many a senseless doll to capture an able intelligent man whom one would expect to choose a more sensible companion.\\" Basically, women need to dummy down for men to please them. That's the message throughout the book. Pretend to be incompetent, but all the while use deceptive contrived behavior to manipulate your husband into doing your will. That's the message, backed up with unsubstantiated quotes and fiction.\\"Women especially are inclined to be self-centered and think in terms of 'my children, my husband's success, my house, my wardrobe.' Even our special problems dominate our thinking.... We often fail to realize what narrow selfish lives we live.\\" This quote by the author about women may be found on page 132. All I can say -- what a sexist remark.On page 114, Andelin names several feminine jobs that are suitable for women. She writes: \\"Another suitable field for the older woman is that of nursing, an occupation which has always been considered feminine and benevolent.\\" Always? How much research was built around this statement? When Florence Nightingale first attempted to help in the Crimean war, it was considered scandalous, because nursing was deemed (at the time) a man's profession. Actually, Andelin should read about the life of Florence Nightingale, who believed she was called of God to help the needy instead of enter matrimony (which was expected of her). Not everyone is called to enter marriage (Matthew 19:10-12). Paul the Apostle wrote that it was better not to be married (1 Corinthians 7).If you're a Christian woman, your first service is to God. God should be first in your life. When women put men before God, they are asking for trouble. Instead of buying this misleading book, get yourself a Bible and study it all the time. That will bring you blessedness and eternal life (Psalm 1:1-3). Buy yourself a good concordance. Prayerfully ask God how He wants you to be. He may lead you to a good husband; he may lead you to be single. Trust God completely and cleave unto Him. Then, you will know the best life. The only book you really need, as a Christian, is the Bible. But, concordances are really nice for finding scriptures.I warn you, this book throws in a few truths from scripture (Satan's favorite trick), but is completely overshadowed by lies and fiction. Christians don't be fooled."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is one of the best marriage books I have read. I looked at it as a marriage help book even if that was not how it was intended. With the kind of man I married, and the kind of relationship I was having, this book told me directly how I can cause change more clearly than any other marriage book I have read. The problem with the other books is that in order for the plan to work effectively the man has to do something, but in this book all the responsibility for making the marriage better falls on the woman. Some people hate the fact, but honestly it is more realistic. I must have easily read 15 help books, and it was this practical guide for bringing about my husbands strengths and sense of responsibility that has done the most to improve our marriage.It talks about selfless service, humility, and the power of a womans charm! I recommend this book for anyone who is yearning for a more traditional relationship but isn't quite sure how to make it happen, and even for those who are little rough around the edges and would like to be a little more feminine. It turns out my man really does lke a girly girl, even though he met me in the army! go fig. :)Some people feel this book requires they be fake. If you interpret it like that then your not reading it right. You can be yourself, just a softer, cuddlier, more lovable version. Don't delete the old version, just upgrade!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read this book several times over, for other reasons, and have determined that it's teachings mainly facilitate abuse in male-female relationships (especially marriage) and does not empower anyone to adequately address problem issues with any degree of maturity, responsibility, liberty, rationality, etc. Upon reviewing the book, I am marveled by how wonderfully people, who claim to be of character depth and intellectual maturity, can stuff themselves in short sighted ideologies, as suggested in our very own \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\". Although Andelin claims that women ought not reduce themselves to the level of doormat or \\"Severe\\" abuse, she does not empower them with the necessary tools to avoid such happenings. Indeed, the broadly educated or uneducated, careerless woman with no \\"masculine skill\\" is encouraged to escape the confines of \\"Severe\\" mental and physical abuse by removing herself and the children. The suggestions in this well respected reading are, at best, surface and pacifying. They are insulting to men and women. I have read all of the reviews and noted a peculiar pattern of thinking among those in support and those in opposition. Clearly, there is intellectual and character disparity in favor of the cons. Has anyone noticed?If we are to simulate, as many believe, the role of the man in the home to the love that Christ has for the church, then his role, as head, is a service oriented and sacrificial one. He is there to take a leadership and initiating role of service and sacrifice. A role such as this requires utmost care, detail, emotional intelligence, spiritual vigor, maturity, sensitivity, etc, all of which most men are not properly reared to exhibit. If men were being reared with these qualities engrained, they would not be overly dependent on women to train them as adults. The woman is the man's helpmeet, his equal, not is \\"fascinating\\" trainer or parent. It is time people are rightly measured against the bible teachings we claim to support."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Okay....so I read this book and came away with a very disturbing conclusion. There are millions of women out there who think it is perfectly acceptable to make someone love you by playing dumb, practicing deceit and manipulation, humiliating yourself by speaking/acting like a child to your husband, and allowing yourself to be used as a human doormat. Even more disturbing, there seems to be millions of men out there who get turned on by a wife who behaves this way. This book is a disgusting shameful example of what is wrong with Mormon women. I bet it is handed out to every LDS girl and particularly the sects who practice polygamy. I am certain my LDS next door neighbor practices the manipulative behaviors outlined in this book and she is one of the most exasperating idiots I have ever met.

Dr. Williams blasts away with tongue-in-cheek satire aimed at the psychologist's belief that everything that is said, thought, dreamed, and done has many layers of significance. Unfortunately, that approach means that your enjoyment will be modest if your knowledge is correspondingly limited in either area. If you know little about psychology and have not read Winnie-the-Pooh, you may not get most of the humor in the book.In Freud-like fashion, Dr. Williams begins by descrbing the case for Winnie-the-Pooh being a super psychologist. The thrust of this argument is that Winnie employs every method ever recommended by any psychologist or psychoanalyst somewhere in his fictional adventures. In fact, he often combines them in a single fictional encounter.The book then recounts seven cases and Winnie's role in them.Case 1 -- Pooh Cures Christopher Robin of Arktophobia (fear of bears)Case 2 -- Pooh Assists Piglet to MatureCase 3 -- Pooh at His Most Eclectic with TiggerCase 4 -- The Problem with RabbitCase 5 -- Parenting: Kanga and RooCase 6 -- Wol's Problems with CommunicationCase 7 -- Eeyore: A Case of Classical DepressionThe cases are written up like Freud's with the exception that they are illustrated with many drawings from the original Pooh stories.As an example of the approach, the book Winnie-the-Pooh opens with a reference to his living under the name of Sanders. That is never mentioned again. Dr. Williams provides a lengthy argument in favor of this meaning that Winnie-the-Pooh is describing himself as the Sand man, the bringer of dreams. This is an indication of his role as psychotherapist.In the famous story where Winnie eats too much honey and cannot get out of the hole in the tree, Dr. Williams reinterprets this as Winnie-the-Pooh making an example of himself to discourage others from overeating rather than using aversion therapy on them.To put this prescience into context, Dr. Williams points out that the Pooh stories date in the 1920s. In the text, he finds &quot;frequent anticipation of theories and practices which more plodding psychologists arrived at much later.&quot;I don't know about you, but I didn't think much about Jung when I read Winnie-the-Pooh. Obviously, the references were too subtle for me.Those who have experienced psychotherapy will probably find humor in the observations made about Winnie-the-Pooh that they may have heard applied to themselves. Could the observations be equally apt?This book is best enjoyed by a roaring fire on a cold night with a warmed snifter of brandy, and savored slowly.After you have finished the book, you might consider the many instances where novels do show ways to solve psychological problems through their fictional developments. Could it be that we can use fiction to be our own therapist? Or, is someone else the therapist? If someone gave you the book, perhaps they are the therapist. If so, is the author the propounder of the theory . . . or is the character?See the possibilities for humor in pomposity everywhere!"},{"Title":"Pooh and the Psychologists","review":"I bought this book because I read a lot of books on psychology AND I was introduced to looking at diverse themes through the \\"Pooh\\" world view when a frind suggested \\"The Tao of Pooh,\\" by Benjamin Hoff. I got this book thinking it might be entertaining and illustrative as well.It is entertaining for the first while, but generally not very illustrative. As the previous reviewer said, the more you know about shools of psychological theory the more you will enjoy the book. But if you are looking to either learn something about psychological theory OR looking for images and anologies that illustrate concepts in a striking or perceptive way, this is not the best book.It is entertaining, but it can get old if you are not careful. The tone is very tongue-in-cheek, I had some good chuckles. The kick of the book is looking at the world of the Hundred Acre Wood through such over-the-top scholarly eyes. There is an \\"inside tone\\" to his dialog with the reader: sort of a \\"uninformed and unstudied individuals fail to appreciate this, but you and I can clearly see...\\" attitude runs through the entire book. I enjoyed that in the first few chapters, but after a while the joke got old. To be fair, I did read this in just a couple long sessions in just a couple days. It may be enjoyed more as a nightstand book where you read a chapter or two every few days.In terms of learning anything new from the book, one is not likely to get more than a few nuggets of information about one theorist or another. The book is orgainized more by character and story than by psychological concept, so one never really gets to see a school of thought fleshed out in a way that enhances your understanding of it. But, if that's not why you're reading the book, you won't experience it as a short-coming.It is a fun book, especially if you LOVE Pooh or psychology. If you love and know a lot about both this could be a good, light read to nibble on before bed or over lunch."},{"Title":"The Voice Of The Butterfly","review":"&quot;How can we save ourselves before we self-destruct?&quot; That's the central question of this book. Laws, social activists, the media, ordinary citizens, and economic interests all come in for the sharp stick of satire in this irreverent look at political processes in the early 21st century United States. The book revels in vulgarities and the ugly side of humanity as an attempt to shake you out of your political lethargy. The style of satire will remind you of Candide. The book's best strength is found in the character of the manic, self-destructive Kelly, who is dying from having lost her hope for the future.Charley McFarland is the central character in the novel. He is a Don Quixote of lost causes. This time he wants to stop a new road. Because the road will come through a section where a rare butterfly species lives (the &quot;Phistic Copper&quot;), he has hopes of winning with the regulators if not at the polls. He is aided in this process by ancient Lydia, on whose land the butterflies live, his wife Kelly (from whom he is separated), reluctantly by his son Lucifer, and Susan Delgado (an anorexic reporter who has her eye on him). The economic forces have a strong control on the town, and own the newspaper. Only after the Butterfly Coalition's antics attract the attention of outside media does progress occur. The book's moral is that elections and the free press (with all of their weaknesses) are our only, best hope. The process is described though as being like a 17 ring circus, detached from the facts. And that's probably pretty accurate in many cases.Although the average person cannot be bothered to work on the issues (even if they are affected) until the television reporters tell them it's important, the activists take significant physical and financial risks. Kelly is a one-woman guided missile, committed to helping the coalition, getting Charley back, and having another drink (not necessarily in that order). She is a tragi-comic figure of Rabelaisian dimensions whom you will find appealing, despite the bleakness of her life and outlook.Most people will find the satire overdone. Mr. Nichols certainly does like to keep putting the stick into your eye, to be sure you don't miss his point. I think that few will, but the savage and unrelenting pounding from the satire will dull your senses after awhile. The plot itself is merely a way to move from one slapstick scene to the next. There is no attempt to pretend that it is realistic. This is a tale about morality, so think of the book as a fable about modern life rather than as a normal novel. The book's style will remind you of many Vonnegut books.After you have finished enjoying the humor here, take some time to let the lessons settle in. Where should you be taking a stand, influencing others, and helping positive change occur in our society? Please start working on something you care about!May our actions match our mutual needs!"},{"Title":"The Voice Of The Butterfly","review":"In &quot;The Voice of the Butterfly,&quot; John Nichols takes a fairly common theme - a group of environmental activists taking on wealthy and powerful developers - and turns it into quite an uncommon novel. &quot;The Voice of the Butterfly&quot; is a highly critical look at modern-day American attitudes toward our environment and our political system couched in biting satire and fast-paced, non-stop slapstick humor. With characters including an &quot;herbal proctologist,&quot; a funeral home named &quot;Suicide City Body Shoppe,&quot; and character names such as Abe Gingivitis &amp; Miranda Satan, the reader is clued in early and reminded often that this is not the kind of novel to be taken literally.It took me three quarters of the book to finally decide that I liked it. Although I had been warned about what to expect at a book signing by the author, it still took that long to suspend my grip on reality enough to &quot;get&quot; what the author was trying to accomplish and to realize that he wasn't &quot;hearing voices&quot; induced by smoking hallucinogenic butterflies when he wrote it. Once I realized that, it became a very entertaining and thought provoking read.The story John Nichols told at the book signing about the difficulty he faced in getting this book published is a good indicator of just how different a work it really is. Having originally written a 1500 page slapstick &quot;epic for the ages,&quot; Nichols was turned down by 30 or more publishers. Finally, his agent promised that she could sell the novel if he'd only make a couple slight modifications - like whittling it down from 1500 pages to 250 (it's actually ended up being 240 pages) and rewriting it using the male lead character (Charlie McFarland) instead of the female lead (Kelly McFarland) as the narrator. I'd have to agree - 1500 pages of this intense writing would be torture to read. Fortunately, the result of the rewrite is a tight, bizarre, politically charged, hilarious piece of writing with a serious message.Whether the reader ultimately agrees with the message or not, &quot;The Voice of the Butterfly&quot; is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Roarshock","review":"Kurt Schiller's Roarshock is a turbo-powered journey through the vast unexplored regions of the capability of the human mind.

I really recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading Shakespeare for the first time because it will help you not to misinterpret anything."},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"I found nothing of value in here. This guy is from Harvard so I thought there would be some poignant, new, insightful analysis here. Instead I found pop-psychology stuff that is entirely unhelpful and nothing concrete in which the reader can put into practice. Not only that, it doesnt provide any improvement or insight into the investment psychology literature. I read 1/2, couldnt bare the rest."},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"The real value in this book is taking the time to read and reflect on the many skills an investor should have developed. It is not a \\"fun\\" read. It is not a book you cannot put down! It should be read over time (like a textbook) and not digested quickly. Some insights may be helpful, like knowing why you hold on to securities that turn out to be losers. It is unlikely to help you decide precisely when to sell but it may free your thinking to know there is a time and you should deal with it. I suggest taking the time to read the book. Expect what you usually get from a book on Psychology."},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"I was deeply attracted by the bold tagline printed on the back cover &quot;Dr Richard Geist's rules for using the power of your emotions to out-psych Wall Street&quot; as below:1. Leverage your emotions, dont exorcise them. (Understand how your idiosyncratic emotions undermine or enhance your investment decisions)2. Dont just rely on the facts. (Understand also the deeper psychological forces that move Wall Street)3. Know yourself. (Master an investing behavior in harmony with your own personality and lifestyle, your reaction to anxiety and pressure)4. Understand the nuances of risk (Know how you feel when buying and selling)5. Break the taboo (Understand your mistakes, and correct them)6. Empathize with management7. Recognise your investing anxieties8. Be an interpersonal investor (expansion of perspective and protection against group think)Very attractive, huh! So sorry that the author failed completely to write up to what he or his editors promised. Dont know whether the author's writing or story telling skill is so poor or what, the book appeared to be a boring pile of 291 dissociated pages that I find it very difficult to concentrate and read on. There are many real life cases and examples, but I can hardly draw from them any practical and memorable lessons.In a word, dont waste your valuable time and hard earned money on this. Spend them elsewhere more productively.p.s. How come the author gave no answer/suggestion/analysis for the 9 page &quot;investment personality questionnaire&quot; at the end of the book?? Should readers bring their answers to the author personally for advice???"},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"Let me first say that I like this book better than most of the other investing psychology books out there that I have examined. But I have two problems with the book. First, there is an investor psychology test at the back of the book which is also available on a website. My question is, especially after reading the test questions, how scientific is this test? I doubt that it really tells the taker anything but many will be suduced by it anyhow. Most of this material I have seen is either rubbish or Mickey Mouse. Second, any investor that needs this material does not need this material. In other words any investor that does not already understand this material independent of the book a priori is certainly not in need of studying this book and then attempting to beat the market with his/her new found knowledge. My own experience is that the psychological equipment needed to truly outwit the market is necessarily the result of long hard experience, not reading books. The completely clueless may find solace here but until the material is internalized it is probably of not much use. The book provides no help on internalization."},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"This is a book both every investor and financial advisor should read. Rather than proposing a scheme for eliminating emotions from your investment decision-making, which is the mantra of most books, Geist cogently argues that emotions are always present in risky decisions. His solution is not to ignore them, but instead to understand them and see how they idiosycratically afftect our investment choices.Investor Threapy is one of the only books I've read that makes clear how profound the ramifications actually are of integrating emotions into investment decision-making. The book clearly spells out in an easily readable way how emotions influence not only when we buy and sell, but what sectors of the market we choose to play in, how we gauge our own risk level, how we repond to herd mentality, how we deal with loss, and how we so often mismatch our personality to an investing style.Geist offers a fascinating view of how to understand management, and why it is so important to invest along side a group of trusted others-what he calls Interpersonal Investing. Any reader of this book will come away with information and ideas not published anywhere else on how to use our emotions to enhance our perfomance and results."},{"Title":"Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street","review":"Reviewer: A reader from Winchester, MAAbout half way through this book, I made the same mental connection that I made about 20 years ago when I read Tim Gallwey's classic, \\"The Inner Game of Tennis.\\"That is, this is a very fresh and relevant way to look at a complex game phenomenon with a very quiet and objective mind.While this may not be a book for the technically sophisticated investor, it is highly recommended for a wide range of investors that are looking to create and sustain a personal psychological advantage on the market.In many ways, this is a book that enables the reader to look at the market in a Zenlike way. Rather than dealing with winning investment strategies, it deals with an often overlooked and more important aspect of investing: creating and managing winning emotional strategies.Without sounding overly Eastern in philosophy, Dr. Geist deals with strategies to help the average investor focus more of their energies on understanding their personal emotional reactions to the market. His thesis is that you can achieve greater happiness and success by integrating an emotional understanding of yourself into your investing strategies.Like Gallwey, Dr. Geist provides the reader with a much needed perspective and tools for helping to manage the most difficult opponent we all face, our own emotional inner game."},{"Title":"Not well advised","review":"This book is about the advice that local public officials receive -- when and why is is good and useful, when and why it is more often not useful and not used.

They had to follow strict rules and watch people get taken from their families and put into gas chambers, getting shot and thrown into mass graves. They smelt the smoke and decay of the dead being burned. Hedi's parents were killed along with her many friends. Hedi and her sister Livi were the only ones who survived in her family.

I had to purchase a new copy. I have made at least 25% of the recipes in this book and they have almost universally been delicious. The only reason I haven't made more of the recipes is that I keep making some of our favorites repeatedly. This past Thanksgiving we made a turkey breast recipe for the first time that turned out incredibly moist with Mable's tip for putting cheesecloth soaked in wine over the turkey.

My husband is a picky eater but I have yet to have a problem getting him to eat any of the dishes that I've prepared using this book.

I found Crockery Cookery to be a great guide for those of us who don't have the time (or in my case the experience) to follow complex recipes.Since getting this cookbook, I find that even I can make really great food with a minimum of prep time and ingredients. Plus, its nearly impossible to overcook food in a crockpot. In fact, now I go days without using my microwave for dinner (and if that isn't enough endorsement than I don't know what is).

I'm sorry I did.I use a crockpot to make my life simpler. Ms. Hoffman's recipes usually require either cheesecloth, a crockpot trivet, or both. Sometimes, you have to prepare the food before placing in the crockpot. The food may be marvelous, but as a working woman, I'm not going to do all these things.I believe I copied out 3-5 recipes per each book of Ms. Hoffman's that I bought. If you enjoy fussy crockpot cooking, these may be the books for you."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc).

However, the layout of the book itself is terrible. It's a paperback book and I prefer cookbooks that will stay open on the counter such as spiral bound. I also like slick, glossy pages in cookbooks as they stay cleaner. It really bothers me that the size of crockpot needed for each recipe is not stated. Some cookbooks state which sizes are necessary. I just have to figure it out based on the number of servings, but I wish it were stated in the recipe. The center of this edition has some color pictures that are on glossy pages, but they are staring to fall out of the book. The book is not very well-made.Of all my slow cooker cookbooks, this is the one that basically gathers dust on the shelf."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"My experience with slow cooking dates from about 30 years ago when I purchased Mable Hoffman's original \\"Crockery Cooking\\" to supplement the recipe guide which came with a nice, solid, reliable Rival 5 qt jobber. Lke her recipe book, the two worked hand-in-kitchen mitt together. The original edition was of convenient 8.5\\" x 11\\" size vs the 7.5\\" x 9\\" of the revised edtion and was very well-used for a number of items. I'd make adjustment to various recipes and note hints on the pages of my favorites. Flash forward some 30 years and I just purchased a Hamilton Beach 6 qt. programmable slow cooker and felt it was time to up-grade with her newest edition. I still have the 1975 edition, but it is nice to see some of my old favorites, i.e. her German Short Ribs (to die for), Beef Stew (better in a crock pot than heaven could imagine) and her Country Pork Ribs (no more analogies from me about livin' and dyin'). To my chagrin, this is 2009 and the 'newest edition' is already some 14 years old by the time I purchased it!! That's not quite my definition of \\"new and revised\\". It has been sitting on a shelf somewhere and the pages are starting to show discoloration from age. In addition, in her 1975 edition, Mable Hoffman reviewed a number of crock pots/slow cookers, but the new edition doesn't. I suppose that is because a product review would be outdated for some models, given modern features like ditital timers and thermal probes. In this computer age you can go on-line and be more up-to-date about the newest models than reading an older book. That's how I came to purchase my new slow cooker -- on-line comparisons and product reviews. It would have received all 5 stars, but for the fact is is already 14 years old by the time of purchase and doesn't have a word about \\"programmable slow cookers\\". However, given that the original edition contained reviews of the slow cookers, a \\"new and revised\\" edition should have reviews of this generation's newer features, such as the termal probe and the scivvy on how well different models programmable cooking really size-up. The revised edition does a cook book's nice job providing 'hints' of using such as beans, rice, cooking times, using spices in a crock pot, high altitude cooking etc, etc. and that's nice for the novice and to remind veterans. Talk to some owners of crock pots/slow cookers and they'd rather give up the microwave before ditching a crockpot. If you begin to work with and enjoy the benifits (time-shifting and cooking around your daily schedule, enhanced flavors) of slow cooking, this is the \\"Bible of Slow Cooking\\" and thus the recipe book to purchase. My other 'gripes' are really inconsequential."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"Great recipes to try, I'm looking forward to my next crockpot meal from this book.

Great to make in morning and know you are ready for dinner! family loves the recipes"},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"I bought this after using her original HP Books \\"Crockery Cookery\\" for several years. Most of the recipes that I have checked remain unchanged. A few of my favorite recipes have been changed, for the better, reflecting changes that I made either to taste or from consulting other recipes, so that's good. On the other hand, a few recipes have been deleted and new recipes added. I haven't tried the new ones and miss some of the deleted ones. Overall, if you are buying, used, I'd go with the revised version. However, because my old version has many of the recipes updated, by me, because I'm thinning out my library, I'm getting rid of this one. The old one has many more photographs of the dishes, the new one is organized with one recipe per page and looks more like a cook book.Overall, there are many recipes that don't appeal to me. at all, in both books.I also have \\"Betty Crocker's Easy Slow Cooker Dinners\\" and find that I've found more of the recipes from there to be worth repeating than from Hoffman's books."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"I like the from-scratch recipes in this cookbook, which was just what I was looking for. Most of the recent books seem to have prepared mixes which I never use. A ring binder would have been better than a bound book format, but I still think this is the best cookbook."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"My mom bought this book for use with her new slow cooker back in 1975, for the astonishingly high price of $3.50. I inherited both the pot and the book from her, and although I have several other slow cooker cookbooks, this is the one I always keep coming back to.This book was aimed at people like my mom--working full time and trying to raise two kids, with not a whole lot of time or energy for fancy meals. The recipes are easy, mostly of the \\"set it and forget it\\" variety. Some do call for canned soups and prepackaged spice mixes, but most do not, and even those that do I consider healthier than a lot of the recipes in my newer books. Plus...and a big plus...they all turn out well! There is also a chapter with information on various brands of slow cookers and their heating characteristics, which, though out of date, is a great help for those who own older pots or have picked up an older one at a sale or thrift shop.My only warning is that, if you have a newer pot, be aware that the newer ones cook a good deal faster and hotter than the older ones. You may have to adjust the cooking times and/or buy or build a temperature control device. Once over that hurdle, though, you'll be glad you bought this little book, and it will quickly become your \\"go-to\\". Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"My mom had this book, and every recipe I make from it has that nostalgic taste of home. I especially love the breads and beverages -- things that other slow-cooker books leave out.However, I find myself using these recipes mostly for weekend entertaining rather than on work nights. A substantial number of these dishes aren't designed for the dump-it-in-and-run-to-work crowd; they require six hours on low heat or the addition of extra ingredients halfway through the cooking time.Devoted cooks looking for tasty long-simmered flavors will be delighted, but there just aren't enough dishes here that can be made on the working-family schedule for me to give this the rating that the flavors deserve."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"Nourishing, mostly gourmet slow-cooker recipes and a few new tricks for your crock pot. You never knew your crock pot could be so handy!\\"Everybody\\" knows that slow cookers are good for pot roasts and chili con carne. But did you know that your slow cooker could produce chocolate cake, chicken and dumplings, and rice pudding? I didn't, either. The wonder of it is, your crock pot can make all these wonderful dishes and many more with less prep time and inconvenience than the traditional versions in most cases. Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery is just what I needed to dust off my slow cooker and get started with the rest of my life.Regarded by many as The Standard for crock pot cooking, this revised and updated recipe book has all of the basic favorites and quite a few more sophisticated dishes. To date I have only tried 13 in all, a mere fraction; and a few standouts like Flank Steak in Mushroom Wine Sauce and the Nostalgic Chicken and Herbed Dumplings, have made this purchase totally worthwhile. I would have stopped at entrees, but no - there are also some great soups, vegetable side dishes, party appetizers and desserts. Yes, you can bake cakes and breads in crock pots that have at least 4 and quarts capacity, but be warned that they do come out on the soft side, without that top crust. I found the banana bread pleasant enough, however.The real surprise for me was in how perfectly suited my crock pot was for steamed pudding recipes. Bread pudding is a natural here. But get ready for a heavenly Grandma's Rice Pudding - light, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness and no more. The best I have ever tasted, bar none.I should hasten to add that Mable Hoffman puts an emphasis on preparing recipes from fresh, wholesome ingredients, and very few of them involve opening cans. You will end up with nutritious, lower-than-average-salt dishes that will take a little more prep time than frozen dinners, but greet you with a delightful aroma when you walk in after a hard day's work. Most of the recipes are even thrifty when compared to a fast food diet. I don't remember how I ever managed to cook for my family 6 days a week before I discovered this cookbook!My only complaint is that I have used mine so much in the last 4 months that a few pages escaped from the softcover binding. No problem: I am getting my copy spiral bound at a local copy center.

Since we didn't have one in my house when I was growing up, I really had no idea how to use it. I found 'Crockery Cookery' on a fluke one day while shopping. Little did I know, then, that this cookbook would become one of my best friends! Mable Hoffman has created a book full of concise, easy to follow recipies that are easy to prepare, and HARD to mess up! Most of the recipes have a cooking time of 6-8 hours or 8-10 hours, so whenever you get home is O.K.... it won't burn! And you do have to add a thing or two at the end of some recipes, but you can do that when you get home, set the table, and then sit down to eat! This book was a God-send for a new bride who was still a bit nervous about her cooking skills! I must admit I haven't tried all the recipes yet, but every time I make the 'Favorite Pot Roast', my husband thinks I'm a genius in the kitchen...and I've become a little famous because of the 'Traditional Apple butter' recipe. Now everyone in the family EXPECTS it as a Christmas gift! If you have a busy lifestyle, you will LOVE this book! It is soooo wonderful to set the pot when you leave for work, and come home to dinner ready and waiting! The whole house smells like someone has been slaving away all day in the kitchen... and only you know the secret!

With all I have to do during any given day, I found spending two hours in the kitchen every evening was wearing on me. I'm not the type to give my family chicken nuggets and french fries all the time. My crockpot had always been a seldom used item in my cupboard. Since childhood, I had only known one recipe: meat, carrots, celery, onion, potato, cr. of mushroom soup. Not a bad recipe but if it's the only one you ever use, it does get old. I felt all crockpot food had one flavor. Enter this cookbook! Since I purchased it in January, I have used it non stop Monday through Friday during our week. On weekends, sometimes, I go back to regular cooking. The recipes in this book are so good, my family doesn't mind them every night. We can't tell the difference from oven or stovetop cooked food.In most cases it's actually better and that's saying alot as I enjoy cooking and don't do half bad. Many of the recipes do call for wine. That has never bothered me as my parents cooked with wine on occassion. The alchohol does cook off leaving only great flavor,no alchohol taste.But I add this because I know the use of alchohol in any way will offend some and you should know ahead of time. These recipes come out tasting like meals from a fine dining restaraunt. We rarely ever feel any desire to eat out anymore. Not when at four or five o'clock in the evening, instead of feeling like I don't want to cook tonight, I'm smelling wonderful aromas instead. Now, instead of being closed up in the kitchen , away from my family, I am relaxing in the living room with them.Dinner's almost ready and now all we need to do is set the table and eat!

Obviously, they haven't read this book! From Kowloon Chicken to Steamed Chocolate Dessert, it all tastes different and it all tastes good. Before I got my copy, I had no idea you could bake bread in a crockpot. Hoffman has over a dozen breads and cakes, which, of course, inspired me to get creative and substitute ingredients to make hundreds more varieties. In fact, the idea of having Mulled Cider to go with the beef stew at a Super Bowl party inspired me to buy a second crockpot so that we could do just that. If you've never owned a crockpot, have this book on hand when you bring your first one home and you'll be an instant convert. If you already own a crockpot, Hoffman will give you hundreds of new ideas for tasty dishes to supplement your old favorites.

But we love good tasting and healthy food and the recipes in this book are wonderful. The Spicey Brisket over Noodles recipe has become a favorite of my husbands. I like the California Tamale Pie, and the Stuffed Flank Steak with Currant Wine Sauce and the Slow Cooker Cassoulet.And the breads and cakes section is great. Some people don't know you can cook desserts in a crock pot. The Carrot Coffee Cake, Persimmon Pudding, and Date Nut Loaf are favorites.Crock pot cooking is something love to do year round. In summer it keeps the kitchen cool and in winter provides good hearty dinners on cold nights. The ingredients are available at most larger grocery stores. The desserts take an average of 3 hrs while the main courses are between 6-8 hrs.Use a plug in timer so that you can start the cooker at 7 or 8 AM and have it shut off.

I've tried 6 recipes straight out of the book with no adaptation. 2 of them were OK, but had little flavor. The other 4 were barely edible, with strange flavors. Another reviewer said this book is a good spring-board for crockery cooking. I would definately say that you need to be experienced enough with the crock pot, and spice usage in general, to adapt these recipes to taste, in order to enjoy recipes from this book."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of crockpot recipes and ideas. It begins with 100-page introductory section with information on menu planning, use and care of your crockpot, and a consumer's guide to crockpots, detailing differences between crockpot brands. Next come the recipes, with chapters for beef, other meats, poultry, vegetables, appetizers and beverages, soups and sandwiches, main dishes, beans, breads and cakes, and fruits and desserts. You name it, if you can eat it, Mable will tell you how to prepare it in your crockpot.I've tried a number of these recipes, and none have ever gone wrong. There's nothing like tossing a roast in the pot in the morning with some onions and fruit, and coming back in the evening to the wonderful aromas of slow-cooked meat. At first, I was a little unsure of how to begin with crockpot cooking, but with Mable's guidance, everything has turned out just fine."},{"Title":"Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery, revised and updated edition Winner of the RT French Tastemaker Award","review":"If you order the Mass Market Paperback version of this book, keep in mind that it is the size of a small novel and pages are 'dark' (recycled) paper -- not very efficient in the kitchen.

He helped me at my first job by giving me some of his wisdom, and I subsequently went to work for him. I still work at his old company. We were taught much of this information, and it has been most valuable and helped me to achieve things that once were not possible. Now I have a nine year old daughter, and twin boys, age 6. I let my daughter read aloud the section \\"Lesson one\\". The boys are still a little young, but not for long. What is so wonderful about this is how pure and simple it is, so my daughter understands it easily. It is now standard reading before bedtime. If we taught our kids this in school, even for 15 minutes, how much simpler their lives would be. I can't get enough of these books. We've ordered another 6 for friends and their children, and I'm sure we'll be ordering more as time goes on. What a perfect gift. Life's simple lessons in one easy to read book.

Such is the case with this book. My wife and I purchased ten of them to give to the young people we know because all of them can benefit from it.The accurate, concise chronologically organized advice and wisdom the book contains makes it a wonderful reference book for addressing each and every problem typically experienced by each various age group. It is a great tool for parents of teenage children who are at a stage where they will not take advice from their parents. If the children do not want to accept advice, the parents can leave this book where the children will find it and pick it up on their own. Much of this book's great and truthful content is simply not taught in school so too many children enter adult life with an entirely unrealistic outlook on the way things really are as to career, friendship and marriage. This book can help set them straight BEFORE they become adults so they can succeed in all aspects of their lives.

I have found that there is information in every age lesson that has been helpful. Even in the age 7-15 lesson there is information I never learned, thought about or can improve upon in my life. Information like how to treat my brothers and sisters, and my friends or how to be aware of what my thoughts are at all times.At the end of each lesson there is a summary called Lesson In A Nutshell and a summary called A Few Profound Thoughts. Rereading these summaries lifts my spirits and lifts my desire to be more conscious of how I am going thru life. I have shared this book with all ages because I can't resist. I put the book in someones hands and within a few minutes of reading quietly they end up reading outloud a passage that touches them in a noticable way.I love this book.

You Can't Afford to Make Them All Yourself!","review":"They say that the best way to learn to do anything is to learn at the feet of people who have done it before. This way you learn all the tips and tricks and all the mistakes that can be avoided. Author J. R. Parrish was raised in a house on a dirt street in Macon, Georgia. From these humble beginnings he watched successful people and applied the rules of life that he learned from them. Using these techniques he went from being a milkman to being a millionaire. Mr. Parrish did not have a college education or any other of the advantages we commonly think of as necessary for success. What he did have was this set of success secrets that he had garnered from other successful men. Mr. Parrish attributes his success to following these secrets of finance, business, investing, career, dating, marriage, school, and relationships.The book is organized into five different age groups so the advice is appropriate for the priorities of that age. This is a highly recommended book for everyone. I will be sure to be giving copies away as appropriate graduation gifts for high school and college students."},{"Title":"If I'd Known Then What I Know Now: Why Not Learn from the Mistakes of Others? You Can't Afford to Make Them All Yourself!","review":"Ever since Mr. Parrish and his staff \\"adopted\\" a 5th grade class at Hester elementary school, my daughter Pearl, one of those 5th graders, has had a white board with a list of goals in her room. As I'd walk in and out of her room, year after year, the list would morph--checkmarks would appear, items would disappear, and interesting new items would appear. This pattern was steadfast as the tide. I was so proud when Mr. Parrish asked Pearl to speak at one of his company's morning meetings. She talked about the \\"Better World\\" theory--an idea Mr. Parrish and his staff had shared with Pearl's class. Part of the concept is that one should not blame others for their predicaments, and they should take responsibility for improving their own lives. Just this one concept alone can be life-transforming. But in \\"If I'd Known Then What I Know Now,\\" Mr. Parrish shares MANY tips that can help you better your life NOW. One irony of this book may be this: it is divided into lessons for different age groups (for example, 7 to 15, 16 to 25, 26 to 40 and so on). It could be hard to get your 17 year old to sit down and read the section of the book that pertains to them, because at that age, they might think they do not need any advice. Yet if they would be open to reading and internalizing the advice, their whole future could be happier!!! I thank Mr. Parrish for sharing goal setting tips with Pearl that have enabled her to chart her life's course. Pearl is only 19, and she's already been to Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, New York, Riverside, Omaha, and had her own TV show! I used to love reading positive-thinking books when I was young, and this book reminded me of those days when all seemed possible. I realized after reading his book that all is STILL possible. Since reading Mr. Parrish's book, I got reacquainted with long lost friends, I've improved at keeping commitments (I want my word to be my \\"bond\\"), and I'm reviving some goals I set aside a long time ago.

But seldom do we meet a person as compelling and charismatic as someone like J.R. Parrish.Within a few short years of meeting J.R., I knew that I wanted him to be the Godfather of my son. I could not imagine, and still cannot imagine to this day, a better role model than J.R.Having read his book, it brought back many fond memories of time spent mentoring with J.R. His book and the others that he recommends are all very powerful, and J.R. speaks the truth. You will change your life by reading his book and by taking his advice \\"literally\\".

Others speak to your children in one breath exactly what you have shared with them for years and the children can not repeat a single word you have spoke while they can recall with perfect clarity the words of others with the exact same teachings.Our family has taken turns reading JR's book at dinner time and it quickly and easily unlocked conversations that were previously difficult to convey without our children's eyes glazing over. Our 3 kids (15-B, 12-G & 12-B), have all commented about the valuable teachings found within each chapter. Our communication with each other has grown and improved and the attitudes toward one another are more positive and helpful. If you are raising children do yourself a favor and read the first chapter or two together and I know for a fact you will love the feedback from your kids and your spouse.I believe JR's book will be just like \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" where it took time before everyone reviewed the subject matter for themselves and determined how great the story is to the viewer.

As the chapter reassured me that I'm doing OK, it also offered suggestions that I hadn't thought about.For example, one point Mr. Parrish brings up is that school is about learning, not grades...grades are secondary to knowledge acculmulation. This seems like common sense, but in this competitive world it's a long forgotten value.Another great thing about this book is how he offers advice for almost every aspect of one's life, and he modifies that advice to adapt it to each age bracket.

I have been reading the book with my 7 year old 1st grader and have already seen a change in her.

These are the sort of people that are looking for a quick fix. To change your life requires a certain amount of rigor over a sustained period of time coupled with a burning desire to reach your objective.As a student of J.R. Parrish for 20 years, I have seen him positively change the lives of 100's of people. He has been speaking these virtues a decade before they were ever popularized in the media. In his company alone he made over 100 millionaires through his generosity of sharing his life of learning. His company was the envy of the Silicon Valley business community for its extraordinary culture of giving to one another. These same people have better marriages than the norm, are great parents, daughters and sons that make significant contributions to their communities. These are people who accept responsibility for their actions and lives.Although he spent only one term in college before becoming a milkman, J.R.

(\\"Wild Bill\\") Donovan. Ford was a colonel in the Air Force and served under Donovan at the O.S.S. The reader is left to surmise how objective the author will be concerning his subject. Donovan is primarily known as the \\"Father of American Intelligence\\" and the \\"Father of Central Intelligence.\\" This book does not provide any critical insites into the murky history of intelligence. Another factor to consider is that this book was written in 1969 and many archives were unavailable to authors doing research.We are left with with an interesting story about a remarkable man. Donovan was able to marshall and direct the efforts of many individuals to create from the ground up an effective intelligence service under the intense pressures of wartime.The aspect of this book that interested me was the details of Donovan's service during World War I. He organized and led a battalion of New York Volunteers, the \\"Fighting 69th\\" and for his service in France he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Ford brings to life the battles and heroism of that tragic, unnecessary war.This book is recommend for readers interested in World War I and for a general discussions of intelligence services, there organization and methods."},{"Title":"One of Us is Lying","review":"The first 50 pages or so of this one are kind of dry and rough to get through, but once you get past that it is good. The story is about a British woman named Maya whose parents die suddenly and leave her their house. She has never had a relationship with them, her mom especially, being sent off to boarding schools her whole adolescence and seeing them only on holidays. She takes a leave of absence from work and moves into the house, planning at first to be there only long enough to fix the place up and get it ready to sell. Then Maya meets two relatives from a side of the family she never knew existed and begins to discover secrets about her family and herself that were intentionally kept from her her entire life. Patricia Wendorf holds out on us with the secrets and the twists until the very end, so the suspense and guesses go through the entire book."},{"Title":"Kidnapped","review":"GRAT BOOK..

I tried to find Portobello Road in Notting Hill, since a number of tourist information sources said that the shopping was good there, but no such road is listed in this map's street index.

I was expecting schmalz, and what I found was a series of exercises which ranged from a meditation on loving compassion [a variation on the brahmaviharas], to a brilliant presentation of mahamudhra, to an analysis of emptiness as it relates to emotions and everyday life, and more, and more, and more.Berzin's presentation is terse, loaded with information, and is structured to address both the rational and intuitive aspects of the mind. The book is written by someone who is a master of his material. I am currently on my second read through the book, taking care to do each of the exercises thoroughly. I have found each of them to be both highly beneficial and true to the Dharma.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to explore the mind, and especially to anyone who is interested in Buddhist psychology and wants to engage in an approach that refreshingly different from the Abhidhamma studies. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Dr. Berzin, and all of those who helped to make this material availible to me."},{"Title":"Developing Balanced Sensitivity: Practical Buddhist Exercises For Daily Life","review":"This book helps us distinguish Tibetan Buddhism from the culture it flourished in, as well its differences with psychotherapy. It provides guidelines to gain inspiration from Asian and Western teachers without unrealistic expectations and idealization. An excerpt from the book:&quot;In the present day of scandal, controversy, school violence, and AIDS, people tend to distrust everything. Thus, people who involve themselves with a spiritual path are naturally wary of trusting spiritual teachers. On the one hand, critical evaluation of a teacher before establishing a relationship is a healthy precaution and may help to avoid disappointment, harassment, or abuse. On the other hand, morbid skepticism and paranoia prevent gaining the inspiration from a qualified teacher needed to energize and sustain serious practice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Developing Balanced Sensitivity: Practical Buddhist Exercises For Daily Life","review":"Alex Berzin, you are the best - always greatly enjoy your lectures and your books.

I commend her for being able to bring humor into such a painful and ungodly experience. Great book club read however, I highly recommend this book being read by Junior High level students. Not only for the racial issues but for the peer pressure, family, and social issues, which unfortunately, still exists today. It's almost unappropriate to say this book is a \\"good book\\", \\"great read\\", \\"real page turner\\", etc. when it involves someones true heartbreaking ordeal."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"There are probably a few Hoosiers offended at Julia Scheeres' description of her native state as a \\"a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan and {still} a haven for backwater bigots\\". Well they say perspective is everything, and as sister to two adopted brothers, David and Jerome, Scheeres had reason to be sensitive to bigots. Not that her parents were much more enlightened than their neighbors; the first time that Julia's mom washed David she \\"feared the black would rub off on her hands.\\" She and her husband had been pressed by the agency to adopt a black child, because there were so many in need of a home.\\"To reject a black baby would have been un-Christian, a sin. God was testing them. This was a chance to bear witness for Jesus Christ, to show the world that God was not prejudiced and neither were they.\\"Julia takes us to a diner in Birmingham, 1977, the year she and David, the brother who is her best friend, are ten. Engrossed in their dinner choice, they simultaneously become aware that their fellow diners are glaring at the family in disgust, the waitress ignoring the family.Recalling the way their dad had them sheepishly slink from the diner, Scheeres gives us a glimpse of the might have been. \\"What if instead of walking out in defeat our father had rebuked those people for treating a god-fearing family in such a shameful fashion? This was America after all, a country founded on the principles of Christian love and harmony.\\"The children's home life isn't much more welcoming. Even though their father, a surgeon, has a Porsche and a new tractor, Mom scrimps money for the missionaries from the kids' clothing allowance and feeds her kids Garbage Soup, an unappetizing mixture of leftovers. She looks forward to the day her children leave home, when \\"God will be my family then.\\"Still, there are perks to being a white child. White children sleep upstairs; Jerome and David sleep in the basement. White children are grounded, but Jerome and David are beaten by Dad, who has left both boys with backs riddled with scars. Obviously this impairs Julia's and David's close friendship.\\"When their wounds are fresh, their allegiances change, and it's no longer children against parents. It's blacks against whites, and I'm one of the enemy.\\"Jerome retaliates by molesting Julia, something that began when Julia was twelve. \\"Over the years I've noticed a pattern. After Dad beats him, Jerome comes to find me.\\"The first part of Jesus Land focuses on David and Julia's senior year, after Mom and Dad move the kids out to the country, transferring them from insulated Lafayette Christian to \\"Hick High.\\" At school, where the boys are taunted regularly, Julia finds it easier to pass her brothers in the hallway than to be known as the \\"black boys' sister.\\" She finds solace with shots of Southern Comfort and secret sex in her bedroom with her new boyfriend. His presence \\"blots out Jerome.\\"Before the semester ends, Jerome is in a juvenile home. When David reacts to the news with anger, dad does some reacting of his own, breaking David's arm. Since he's a doctor, he is able to get it fixed without reporting the break. A few days later David attempts suicide. Julia recalls her mother's reaction.\\"Why can't I have one day of peace?\\"Her parents' solution is to ship David to Escuela Caribe, a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic, and a source of nightmares for many of its grads (www.nhym-alumni.com). When Julia is caught \\"fornicating,\\" she follows a mere two months later, and enters hell on Earth, where \\"everything you think, do or say (is) scrutinized to measure (her) progress in the program\\" where she \\"Must ask to move; must ask to stand; must ask to sit, and must ask to eat.\\"\\" Communication with David is monitored. \\"There's always some kid lurking on the fringes of our conversation waiting to hear something check (non-program approved) so they can tattle on us for points.\\"Julia quickly learns to trust no one, and David, still searching for acceptance, makes the mistake of not doing the same. Julia sees a familiar pattern replicated. \\"The white girl who breaks a rule is slapped on the wrist while the black boy who commits the same transgression is shoved back to the starting line.\\"Through it all, David and Julia struggle to keep faith in the time when they will be released and on their own. This book is a tribute to David and Julia's friendship, and a complicated exploration of race and religion in the United States. It is also a vivid testimony of the abuse children suffer in the name of treatment, even in facilities that claim to be Christian. It's not a painless read, but it is a provocative one."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"A brother and a sister whose fierce love for each other helps them to survive: That would be a fine concept for just about any book. However, \\"Jesus Land\\" isn't just any book. It is a memoir of startling clarity, written by a young woman who not has endured great cruelty, but has transcended it. Her tough, witty prose is written on pure scar tissue.Scheeres, who is white, and her brother David, a black child adopted by the duo's evangelical Christian parents, form a much-tested bond from their earliest days together. Their parents have three older biological children, as well as Jerome, another black adoptee two years older than David and Julia. When the children face racism, the parents tell them, \\"Turn the other cheek,\\" advice that doesn't begin to meet the needs of children living in a nearly all-white, rural Indiana setting. The parents can't claim poverty, as Dr. Scheeres is a successful surgeon. He and his wife seem to be floating in an unbreakable state of Biblically-sanctioned spare-the-rod-spoil-the-child viciousness, coupled with parental burnout. The three eldest siblings appear to have been spared much of the abuse endured by Julia, David, and Jerome. We don't hear much about them, but it doesn't matter; if we did, it would have detracted from Julia's narrative.When David and Julia are sixteen, the family tensions come to a full, rolling boil. The two are exiled to a \\"concentration camp\\"-like (Julia's words, censored from her letters home) Christian boarding school in the Dominican Republic. There, notes Scheeres, the adults all seem to hate the teenagers sent there by their parents. The \\"students\\" scrub floors, tote rocks, run in circles, are punched and beaten, contract typhoid, and learn that the fastest way to obtain the tiniest privileges is to \\"nark on\\" each other. One of the most telling details is a felt banner in one minister's office reading, \\"I am the potter, you are the clay.\\"The reader aches for David and Julia, but not from any false emotion. There isn't one false note in the entire book. Julia's survival, and her unshakable love for her brother, make this memoir the most riveting, memorable book I've read this year."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"I agree with all the reviews written before mine.

Although we have never met, our experience is similar enough that at times I felt as though Jesus Land was my own story.Jesus Land is frank testimony to extremely dangerous evangelical dogma that grips many families today; where the church is often more important than its members, and the nurturing needs of children are often less important than their parents' faith.Far exceeding her own goal of writing a tribute to her adopted black brother David, Julia has gifted the world with her captivating ability to tell her own coming-of-age story that is altogether entertaining, hopeful, courageous and leaves us in wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"This book was (is) amazing. The author does a fantastic job of pulling you into the story and connecting. It was interesting to read about Escuala Caribe as my family is from the Dominican Republic and I just visited recently. It is hard to believe that while I was a few miles away from Sosua, where Julia and David spent their last day, there were youths suffering, and still suffering. As a juvenile court clerk I hear of all sorts of programs parents send their kids to. I hope I never hear a parent mention Escuala Caribe. It made me think of a concentration camp more than anything. A touching book and I recommend it as a great read."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"First off, I definetely have to say that Jesus Land is a wonderful and touching book. I was very surprised to find out this sad story began in Lafayette, IN. My boyfiend is from Kokomo, IN which is like 30 minutes away, so he knew a lot of the places of things that she mentions.Jesus Land is about the story of Julia Scheeres and her brother, a black child who was adopted by her hardcore christian parents. They become inseparable but they also have to endure the cruelty of the racist pigs from school. They also have to struggle the horrible attitudes of their parents who'd care more for their christian duties than their kids. After this they both go to Escuela Caribe, a school full of christian freaks which seems more like a penintentiary. I'll stop here so I don't give away important details and of course the end.This book made me want to kick some people. I can't believe, or rather yeah I can, that people can be extremely ignorant to the point where they believe that ignoring your children, beating them and being the more distant you can be with them is good in God's eyes.Now I agree why many people believe in God but hate religions, some can get really crazy and cause pain instead of peace. I also have a comment about Escuela Caribe. People that think that out-of-control kids should be sent to this reform school are hugely wrong.This book is amazing and very well written. If you like novels you'll like this too because it reads like a novel. I recommend it very much.

I knew David Scheeres, he lived in my house which was T.K.B. at the time. I don't know about Julia's home life, but I can tell you from first hand experience that she has fabricated a mixture of truth and fantasy in this book concerning the program. We did have boxing matches, but they were strictly between students as a last resort if those students could't get along. In the 16 months that I was in the D.R. I never witnessed a boxing match. I knew alot of the folks that she depicts in her book. My memory is pretty sharp, and I don't recall any of them acting as she says they did in her book. Although I went through the program, and I am posting here, that doesn't mean that I am a \\"religious fanatic\\".

It is disheartening to read how someone has gone through this much ordeal. It reflects the condition of a fallen world. The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because the book got the culprit wrong. It is the lack of God that has caused her pain, not God."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Am I the only person who absolutly hated this book? I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to something more original. I would have much rather read a fiction story from the point of view of David because I found his side of the story much more interesting, and when he wasn't in the story I was wondering what he was up to. I'm getting sick of memoirs about drug/alcohol abuse, rape, and the loss of virginity! Why is it mandatory for one (or all) of these topics to be in every memoir ever written?! These books write themselves.I think I would have liked the book better if the first half of the book,which takes place in Indiana, was left out and the majority of the book took place at the reprogramming camp. The author could still look back on the events of her life, but as a reflection instead of \\"this happened, then this happened, then this happened...\\" style of writing that so often makes a memoir boring and flat.I realize this is a memoir and I don't want to make light of any of the horrible events that happened in the author's life, but just because horrible things happened to a person does not make he or she a great author."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"If Tolstoy's dictum holds that \\"every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\\" then Julia Scheeres's JESUS LAND presents a unique tale of despair. Her personal story as presented in this book is the kind that makes your skin crawl even as your blood boils, a sort of American Gothic version of Adeline Yen-Mah's growing-up-in-China memoir, FALLING LEAVES. At once a tale of racism and family and coming of age in the American heartland, JESUS LAND is primarily s story of religious extremism and the extent to which virtually any behavior can be rationalized into \\"goodness\\" through the blinding lenses of bigotry and zealotry.Ms. Scheeres grew up on the rural outskirts of Lafayette, Indiana, the youngest of four children. Her Christian fundamentalist parents, in an act of missionary-style charity, adopt a young black boy named David who is virtually the same age as Julia. Later, believing David needs a brother \\"of his own kind,\\" the Scheeres adopt Jerome. Her three older siblings having all grown and moved away from home, Julia lives a Midwestern version of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs,\\" with Jerome and David relegated to the basement. As the three children grow up together, they face incessant racism from the local townspeople and their school classmates. Inside the home, even darker events occur, including repeated beatings and physical abuse of the boys by Julia's surgeon father, extreme parental indifference on the part of both parents toward Julia, and sexual assault. Throughout, the family's external veneer is that of the perfect, God-fearing Christian family.Jerome, the oldest, experiences repeated run-ins with his adopted father and is ultimately banished from the Scheeres family home. His final, Thanksgiving Day appearance is perhaps the author's most breathtaking piece of writing in this story. Not long after, David is banished to a Christian fundamentalist \\"re-education camp\\" called Escuela Caribe in the Dominican Republic. Increasingly rebellious and eventually picked up by the police for a minor infraction, Julia elects to join her \\"blood brother\\" David on the Caribbean Island. Not surprisingly, they discover that they have simply traded one set of hypocritical, religiously intolerant abuses for another. Even as they struggle to adapt to Escuela Caribe's point-counting system and learn not to trust any of their \\"narking\\" peers, Julia and David manage to retain vestiges of their childhood exuberance with one another and grow ever closer as sister and brother.While the JESUS LAND story is inarguably compelling, several aspects of the book seem peculiar. Ms. Scheeres offers no background or explanation for her parents' religious fanaticism, where it came from and or how it grew. As a result, to the extent they appear in the book at all, Julia's older siblings come across as either remarkably uncaring or blissfully ignorant of their parents' behavior. Julia's siblings make virtually no effort to rescue her, or even to intervene on their youngest sister's behalf. Julia's brother Dan, in a move worthy of the most alcohol-wasted frat boy, actually makes her pay half his room rent at Purdue University for the brief time she manages to escape her parents' fundamentalist gravitational pull. Julia fails as well to connect with any teachers at her high school, nor do they connect with her or help shelter Jerome and David from the racism they certainly must have known was occurring. In Ms. Scheeres's world, all families were dysfunctional and all adults are uncaring, oblivious, or both.Nevertheless, JESUS LAND is a fascinating and highly readable story of adolescent survival among adults whose religious agendas brook no tolerance for the doubts and travails of growing up. I grew up Catholic in white bread Indiana and, like Ms. Scheeres, managed to escape (she to the West Coast, I to the East), but her story makes me eternally grateful my parents were able to recognize and accept the rightful place of the secular in their children's lives. Four stars to JESUS LAND for reminding us once again that cult-like brainwashing remains one of Christian fundamentalism's dirtiest little secrets."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"This is one of the saddest, most compelling, and most frightening books I have ever read. Why are these boot camps still allowed to exist? NHYM has operated since 1970, still running the EC as far as I know. Is there no oversight? If we can inspect nursing homes twice a month, why can't we inspect these so-called \\"reformatories\\" just as often?"},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"What an extraordinary story Sheeres tells here. It would be impossible to come away from reading Jesus Land unmoved by the experience. Scheeres is no doubt a gifted writer who gracefully introduces the reader to a host of our nation's most complex and divisive issues: race, religion, and class. She likewise offers a brilliant examination of the universal struggle for identity, belonging, and hope.The book serves at once as a devastating indictment of the worst forms of dogmatism and self-righteousness found in fundamentalist subcultures while at the same time demonstrating the beauty and profound meaning of love. Although subtly, the reader senses throughout Jesus Land the transcendent potential of love despite the coercive restraint that always lingers. Scheeres heartbreakingly demonstrates how difficult and complex love can be while showing the ease and essential weakness of committing to an unswerving devotion to a belief system and blind faith in authority.The narrative of the story is no less compelling than Scheeres' greater message. In rural Indiana, we see a world divided by class and bound to its racist past. For David Scheeres, Julia's adopted brother, his struggles with coming of age as a black boy in an all white town are difficult to bear but all too telling about the state of race relations in the post-civil rights era. The story takes a turn toward the almost surreal when David and Julia are sent packing from their Calivinist home to a Christian \\"reform school\\" in the Dominican Republic. There, in a place that possesses more commonalities to a penal colony off French Guiana than an actual school, the Scheeres teens are forced to submit to the worst petit tyrants and absurd Christian teachings imaginable. From the experience, however, David and Julia recognize the gift they have in each other.Importantly too, Scheeres provides us truly multidimensional representations of the individuals who populate the book; although so many of the people who touched Scheeres' life in those years caused pain, the reader is forced on some level to confront their motivations. In the end we are left wrestling with feelings of anger and sympathy, loathing and disappointment. Compared with so much current literature that depends on simplicity, thoughtlessness, and easy resolutions, such canny balance seems a rare feat--one well deserved of high praise.While reading this, I couldn't help but admire such a courageous effort Scheeres took up in writing the book. So much of the story introduces us to people who are utterly devoid of the capacity for introspection, yet the strength of Scheeres' memior stems from her ability to dig deeply inside of herself. In the end, the reader is rewarded.Jesus Land is a sublime, heartbreaking, and provocative memior."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"I grew up in the rural Midwest during the 70s, the child of \\"Born Again\\" parents whose parenting touchstone was James Dobson's \\"Dare to Discipline.\\" So this time, this place, these people, and this blind, punitive brand of Christianity are all very recognizable to me. But Scheeres' memoir blew past that familiar discomfort zone and straight off the edge of the continent. The reform school in the steamy Dominican Republic is as vivid a nightmare of Christian fundamentalism as Margaret Atwood's \\"Handmaid's Tale.\\" Throughout the book, the author's candor singes, especially when she accounts for spurning her black brother at school, falling for a would-be rapist jock, or leaving her other brother to starve in the barn at Thanksgiving. Racism is pervasive, pushing in from all sides and infecting her, too. But a tender, incorruptible bond remains between sister and brother, in spite of the extraordinary brutality of their adolescence.

It isn't about color, it isn't about blood, it isn't about phony family values. It is about the genuine connections of love and support between people that transcend the flimsy bonds that many think of as defining what a family is. David and Julia were REAL family to each other, they thrived and grew in spite of the horrific odds against them. Never a fan of religious dogma myself, I cringed at how child abuse was couched in the self-rightiousness of their \\"parents\\". It's amazing that Mr. and Mrs. Scheeres are still doing their \\"missionary work\\"; they should be in jail doing hard time for their crimes."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"It amazes me how our parents are supposed to be our protectors yet they can be the ones who hurt us the most. Julia Scheeres shows in this amazing story how her parents chose their beliefs in Jesus Christ over her well being. While they thought she had to save (sell out) her soul to Jesus, she was trying to be a normal teenager. She was sent away to a reform school in the middle of the Dominican Republic, which I am surprised to learn is still there. Those places in my opinion should be illegal, ans they are a form of child abuse. They brain wash these children into thinking they are serious sinners, when the worst thing Julia did was have sex with her boyfriend. Her poor brother did NOTHING. He was sent there so they did not have to deal with the black child any longer.The parents adopting the black children to find a spot in heavan - god help them. All those children were used for was for the public. Do these people really think God doesn't see what they do and did to these children behind the doors of their home? Once the parents sent David, the youngest black child to the reform school (the oldest one had ended up in juvinelle detention) she disenfected the basement they were living in, and complained how they lived like apes. This is the woman who brought them into her home and made them call her mother. She never let them back into her house again.I applaud Julia for writing about her experience. It could not have been an easy book to write. The fact that America is slowly turning into an evangilcal society makes this book all the more scary....."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"I just finished reading Julia Scheeres' beautifully written memoir. Her story reinforced my belief that parents who believe they are 100% right about any ideology can destroy their children. Every couple who plans to have or adopt a child should read JESUS LAND first.Scheeres' memoir about being raised in a fundamentalist Christian home parallels the struggles of any child raised with absolute values and beliefs. When there is no space for questioning or original thought a child with a good mind is going to suffer. Scheeres had a good mind."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"In her often harrowing, yet slyly droll memoir, \\"Jesus Land,\\" Julia Scheeres smashes a fist-sized hole through the brittle, smiling faade of the Christian family fantasy. Yes, on the surface, Julia's family, with pious, Midwestern Doctor and Nurse parents, four blonde kids and two adopted black sons, was the picture of brotherly love. But, things were, as they say, not all they seemed to be in the good Doctor's house.For one thing, Mrs. Scheeres clearly hated her children, which she expressed by alternately ignoring them or telling them she couldn't wait for them to grow up and move out. All of this while she was continually praying, going to church and acting the part of the loving messenger of God. Dr. Scheeres was mostly absent, except for the interludes during which he came home to dole out punishment - most of it branded with a belt onto the backs of his two adopted sons. And Julia, well, when she wasn't being emotionally abused by her parents, she was being sexually abused by Jerome, the oldest of the adopted boys.Jesus Land tells the story of a two-year period during the 1970s when 16-year-old Julia and her beloved youngest brother, David came of age in a crucible of violence. First there was the violence David endured as the only black kid in their backwater hamlet. Scheeres' depiction of high school life for David, who is humiliated and threatened by rednecks, rejected by girls and beaten by his father, is gut wrenching. Her own horror at the behavior of others towards him is further exacerbated by her adolescent guilt about not wanting to suffer under the negative attentions his proximity brought her.Then there was the sexual violence against Julia which happened with the regularity of bible study. Because, when her brother Jerome wasn't banned from the house by their parents for some behavioral transgression, he was breaking into her room at night for regular rounds of rape. And if Jerome wasn't doing the violating, it was the local jocks trying to gang bang her. Ultimately with the aid of some Southern Comfort and a recognizable brand of skewed teenaged logic, she submits to one of them, who becomes an ersatz boyfriend with whom she hopes to \\"feel something,\\" and to blot out the memory of less willing acts committed upon her in the past.The family's veneer of working dysfunction is finally ripped away for good when Jerome throws a party while his parents are out of town. They return to find broken bric-a-brac and booze bottles and throw Jerome out for the last time. With the three older kids already gone to college, this leaves Julia and David to take the brunt of the Doctor's anger, which he aims at David - first leaving him with a broken arm, and then sending him to Escuela Caribe, a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. Julia is next. When her mother finds evidence of her sexual activity Julia runs away to avoid the beating she knows can't be deflected any longer. Ultimately she joins David.Indiana was no Disneyland, but Escuela Caribe was surely the unhappiest place on earth. Under the guise of Christian values, the sadistic counselors and house parents at this camp \\"vomit evil\\" and generally demoralized the teens sent there. The kids are not allowed to stand, eat or move without asking permission. They are given daily, harsh physical punishments and endless chores. They are encouraged to turn on each other to \\"build character.\\" And all of this is done, like the witch trials, the massacres of the Crusades and the sexual abuse of children by priests, invoking the name of Jesus.Scheeres writes about this ongoing nightmare with a wry detachment that makes it almost palatable. Her depictions of the fumbling hubris inherent in teenage sex are startling in their authenticity. Her attention to the comic details of life on the fringes of the action adds life to her often-grim narrative. Overall, there is a steely resolve and unlikely hopefulness about her voice that allows the reader to believe that she will survive a world in which she trusts no one except the brother who was her best friend. Had her tone been more vulnerable, or her eye been solely fixed upon ugliness, this modern, Dickensian tale would be unbearable to read. Instead, it is hard to put this book down."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"This book is a remarkable and inspirational tale of a teenager's survival at the hands of uncaring parents, inane religious fundamentalism, racism and a steady diet of abuse that changed its form over the years, but never its intensity. This story is about survival and includes a surprising lesson about learning to play games so well that ones becomes free of them, or as free as one can ever be.The author is to be commended for her courage in revealing so much about her life and for her willingness to do so without asking for any sympathy, and without indulging in the anger or sullenness that could come so easily to someone deprived of even basic affection as a child. It is an easy, enjoyable read, even though the cruelty and indifference portrayed throughout is hard to stomach at times. The book never strays far from the author's heart or from the truth, and these basics are present in abundance.The real strength of the memoir comes from its unapologetic style and the author's eye for which details best bring out a scene, though the writing itself is not perfect. At times, the memoir appears to be an effort to reconstruct the style that might have been used by its teenage narrator in the moment, yet it sometimes meanders into eloquent descriptions far beyond the capabilities of a credible teenage writer. It's never clear what age the writer means to address the reader from, and the overall sense one gets is that the author never quite settled on a viewpoint. This confusion is only emphasized by the absence of much inquiry, description or reflection on the author's parents as might have come to her in her adult life. Some perspective on her brother is however furnished by italicized passages in a reflective, past tense adult voice, a device that works well.Then, there are occasional and clearly unintentional problems with grammar, typos and punctuation. (For example, one cannot shoot down an \\"airline\\" although one could shoot down an airliner). Nor is a description of a waterfall that \\"ejaculates\\" anything but bizarre. At one point, the story abruptly shifts into past tense, only to resume its usual present tense mid-chapter, with no explanation. The conclusions of paragraphs frequently include a sentence, sometimes two, that tell the reader what to think about what has just been vividly related; it is as though the author has little confidence in her readers' intelligence or more likely, in her own ability to have conveyed the meaning of a scene. It is to her credit that she would have succeeded by relying on the subtlety that is already present, and without her own frequent editorial summations; it is surprising and disappointing that her editor, or even her literary agent, did not catch more of these fairly obvious stumbles before the book was printed.The heartfelt feeling behind the book and its valuable criticism of false affection outweigh its technical problems, and it even has a unique cover that carries part of its heartfelt tone. It is well worth reading, both by those who understand the problems of institutionalized religion and those who feel religion is a panacea. The book demonstrates, simply but profoundly, that opening one's eyes to what is right in front of them, and simply appreciating what one has, is all that truly matters."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"I loved this book.

What a miracle that Jesus Land's lovable duo - bound together by the pain of childhood in an Indiana home ruled by loveless religious zealots - survived their grueling stint at Escuela Caribe, a Dominican Republic reform school/holy-rolling nuthouse that nearly sucked dry their fragile teenage souls. In a spare voice teeming with furious dignity, Scheeres recounts that awful period as she honors David, a gentle, goofy black youngster whose restraint in the face of racism and religious bigotry both inspired and humbled her.

It's a 300-page sock in the face, yet full of beauty and nuance and grace. Read this book and you'll remember its scenes and images for a long time. The experiences she went through in rural Indiana growing up and at Escuela Caribe in the Dominican Republic are cinematic in the extreme: wrenching, personal and the same time universal. It's a book of strength and resilience, one that makes you feel the author's pain and her power at the same time.

I was deeply moved by what happened to Julia and David. I am a Christian and was appalled at the behavior of her parents as well as the reform school. It's hard to believe that places like that still exist.It does bring up many questions for me like what should a parent do with a teenager that seems out of control? Granted in Julia's case most of it stemmed from lack of love from her folks, the abuse from Jerome, and the mistreatment of her brothers, but what would be an appropriate way to deal with a teenager who is drinking and having sex at 16 years of age? I'm not saying sending her away was right (especially where they sent her) but what would be a good way to handle the situation?Julia, if you read this review, I am so truly sorry for what happened to you.

The wonder of this book is how perfectly she renders the events that led her and her brother to a Christian reform school in Santa Domingo. Her language is clear and almost stark in its simplicity. She takes us with her into that house, into her brothers' basement bedrooms where the boys are beaten mercilessly, onto the school bus where she and her brothers are taunted, into the reform school run by zealots. Sheeres has the amazing ability to render the most horrifying situations in a voice that does not set us cringing. I trust her voice, loved its teenage honesty and wry humor, its ability to reveal what is so dishonest in adult behavior. Hers is a voice that does not soften the truth but neither does not ask for sympathy or even understanding.

In this memoir of her youth, she sheds light on an aspect of our beloved country that many do not know exist and others turn the other cheek to.The Story:When there are no white kids left at the adoption agency, Julia's parents are guilt-tripped into adopting David, a three-year-old black child. To Quote the parents, \\"To reject a black baby would have been un-Christian, a sin. God was testing them. This was a chance to bear witness for Jesus Christ, to show the world that God was not prejudiced and neither were they.\\" Nevertheless, the first time that Julia's mom washed David she \\"feared the black would rub off on her hands.\\" Not prejudiced indeed.Even though their father, a surgeon, had a Porsche and a new tractor, which did not stop Mom from taking money from her children's clothing allowance and giving that money to missionaries. Though having plenty of income, mom deems it necessary to feed her kids Garbage Soup, an unappetizing mixture of leftovers. She looks forward to the day her children leave home, when \\"God will be my family then.\\"The parents adopt another black child, Jerome, because David needs \\"one of his own kind\\" to keep him company.\\" However, not all is equal in the house. White children sleep upstairs; Jerome and David sleep in the basement. Grounding was the common punishment for the white children; on the other hand, Dad, who had left both boys with backs perforated with scars, beats Jerome and David. This does not help Julia's friendship with David; however, Jerome, who she was not particularly close to, had something more sinister in mind than strained relationships. \\"Over the years I've noticed a pattern. After Dad beats him, Jerome comes to find me.\\" Jerome retaliated by molesting Julia starting at the age of twelve. Before the final semester at \\"Hick High\\" ends, Jerome is in a juvenile home.This causes David to flay out in anger at those around him. In reprisal, Father decides in turn to hurt David and breaks his arm. Days later, David attempts suicide to which mother groans, \\"Why can't I have one day of peace?\\"How do the Scheeres' parents deem to help the young child that they so thoughtfully took in? How does a Dominican Reform school sound? The only light for David is the parents discovery of Julia's \\"fornication\\". Packed off to Escuela Caribe, Julia joins David at the prison like Christian boot camp. There they are ordered to repent for their sins, many of which they are not aware of. At this supposedly Christian establishment, they, \\"must ask to move; must ask to stand; must ask to sit, and must ask to eat.\\" Until their release, David and Julia struggle to stay loyal and survive.Do they survive? Are their mental and physical scars too much for their friendship to over come? Furthermore, what happened to Jerome or the awful holier-than-thou parents? I will not ruin it for you and I have tried to leave out the best parts. Though, this is mostly a heartbreaking story, Julia should be commended for finding positives in even the darkest of times. A subtle humor pervades her first novel. Dark, yes. Hopeless, no.Favorite Quote:Upon returning to Escuela Caribe to gather information for this book, the staff introduced her around. They considered her an outstanding alumna (she worked for the Los Angeles times) and in front of a group of despairing children, one smug staff member asked her, \\"What's the most important lesson you learned at Escuela Caribe?\\" \\"To not trust people,\\" she answered without hesitation.

It is a call to look into the serious human rights violations of these \\"reform schools.\\"Second, it is an amazing story about two siblings, white and black, who are forced to be each others only family; in the end, the power of sibling love transcends everything."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Writing in the present tense, Julia Scheeres writes about her ordeal with two abusive parents who hide their virulent hostility behind an obsession with biblical platitudes. They move their three children Julia and her two adopted brothers, both African American, David and Jerome, to a farm house in Indiana where they encounter cruelty and racism at school and just about anywhere out of their home and receive more cruelty--in the name of the biblicial injunction \\"to not spare the rod\\"--inside their home as well. But Julia is spared and she feels guilty for being untouched while her black brothers are whipped and beaten. The abuse is also psychological: Christian radio is blurted into their rooms at six in the morning, spy speakers are on 24 hours a day so all conversations can be heard by the mother from any place in the house, they are force-fed with bible verses, they are subjected to tedious farm labor in the hot humid sun. When her two adopted brothers misbehave, which is often, they are beaten and whipped in the basement with belts, two by fours, and other weapons. Their bare backs have welts and scars. Julia tries to defend her brothers but cannot. She takes to drinking as solace from her sadistic parents. Things get worse when her older brother sexually abuses her. Eventually, she and her younger brother David, who are very close and who are at the center of this book, are sent to a Christian boot camp in Latin America, which is so over-the-top cruel and controlling it could be taken from the pages of Kafka's In the Penal Colony. Not only is Scheeres' book a true account; it's a recent one. I would have thought this kind of abuse and mind-control died over a hundred years ago. I guess I was wrong.Scheeres' prose is lucid, clear, never full of self-pity. She writes without a chip on her shoulder. Her real motive is to express her undying love for her younger brother David, for whom this memoir is dedicated to.If you enjoy Scheeres' harrowing account, you might want to check out Tobias Wolff's This Boy's Life and Samual Butler's The Ways of All Flesh."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"When this title showed up in catalogs and library lists, I was drawn to it in the same way a kid keeps picking at a scab. I grew up in a Christian home in the eighties, and I too saw things wholly incongruous with the gospel the Bible teaches. I too have pictures of me and my sister standing next to a trailer, nearly identical to this book's cover--except that I'm blindingly white.Julia Scheeres writes with chest-torn-open honesty. The book starts with the faintly disturbing strains of religion gone bad and builds to moments that feel entirely Jim Jones-ish. The real power of this lies in her sympathetic telling of family life, particularly the relationship between her and her adopted black brothers. She never candy-coats the racial issues. She tells it the way it is. And, by the end, she creates an ode to the love and bond that can exist despite evil on every side.In \\"Jesus Land,\\" the worst crimes of all are done in the name of religion. This is a crime repeated over and over through the ages, but here it's given a personal feel. The very gospel that Julia's and David's parents and teachers tried to force down their throats is a gospel that speaks against hate and lies and hypocrisy. If Jesus were to walk the grounds of Escuela Caribe, you can imagine him kicking over tables and throwing out the moneychangers.This book will raise the hackles of those still locked in religious la-la-land, but it should be read by all as a bracing reminder of all that is good and all that is not behind the closed doors of American homes and churches. If Jesus were present in these situations, I think he would be heart-broken and ashamed. Unfortunately, I don't think he is present in most of the activities that bear his name. And without Julia's sort of honesty, we will only continue to perpetuate the worst crimes of all."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Jesus Land is a very powerful and very personal story. No matter what your upbringing was like or how prominent organized religion has been in your life, there is a lot to absorb from this memoir. The issues raised in this book should be familiar to everyone (e.g. a dysfunctional family that seems to have it all, the tyranny of conformity, mistaking individualism for disobedience, unqualified authority figures who rule through fear and violence, misplaced ideals that lead to the suffering of others), but, fewer people have had to live with so many of them in such a short span of time.As I was reading Jesus Land, I couldn't help thinking that this book ought to be part of a high school or college curriculum. It isn't often that you find such concise writing and vivid descriptions in a first-person account of life surrounded by racism, fanaticism, and injustice in the name of God. In addition, the present tense is used throughout the book to relate the events as they occur to a young girl during her teenage years and includes enough teenager-appropriate dialogue and asides to make you think that Julia either has an incredibly detailed diary or a razor-sharp memory. The narrative's effect is entirely transporting and allows you to understand what life was like in a God-fearing, rural Indiana home and in a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic.Julia Scheeres is a prolific journalist, and her writing experience serves her memoir extremely well.

The primary target of abuse by her parents, especially her surgeon father, whom one would think would be intelligent enough not to allow his religion to take over his psyche so completely, but alas, is totally swept up in the cliches and rituals of the Calvinist Church, is Julia's two black adopted brothers.Citing the \\"Christian\\" thing to do by adopting them, both parents quickly and viciously single out the two boys for their most brutal attacks. As is so often the case, the Bible offers handy excuses for all they do, and even at the end of the book, no hint of remorse or recognition of wrong-doing can be found.Julia, of course, rebels and finds herself in the Dominican Republic with her youngest brother David at a camp designed to rehabilitate wayward teens. It is scarcely more accomodating than a prison camp, and the behavior exhibited by its staff are nothing short of psychotic.Rather than attack Christianity as a whole, the focus is strictly personal, as it should be. Not all Christians by any means behave like the Scheeres, and that is good news. However, one suspects that many more ugly stories of abuse of every imaginable type exist under the guise of Jesus and God's names. Arthur C. Clark declared, and I paraphrase, that religion is the most effective and lethal mind virus ever concocted. In this case, religion which should be a tool for living has devolved into a hideous mental disease. A sad but brave tale."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"This is one of those heart-breaking books, like Elie Wiesel's Silence, or the stories of Ivan in The Brothers Kharamazov, that make you question not only a given religious authority, but God himself. It is more painful than the book of Job, in a way, because here unrelenting cruelty strikes not an adult, but innocent kids. Yet as other reviewers note, this book also contains hope. Julia Sheeres and her brother slowly overcome the cruelty of parents, a racist town, and what can only be described as a Christian concentration camp in the Dominican Republic, through love of life and of one another. The author has done a wonderful job, telling her story. I could hardly put the book down.I also grew up in an evangelical Christian family. My parents really follow the teachings of Jesus, though; and I don't think that's so rare. But I think Christians should read this book. Jesus warned about \\"wolves in sheeps' clothing,\\" who come to \\"kill and destroy,\\" rather than give life. Sheere's story should encourage us examine our own motives, and also also keep an eye out for children in families like this, even in the church. Kids need real love from someone, God knows.On the other hand, I don't think readers should identify this kind of abuse with evangelical Christianity too closely, as some seem to below. No matter the ideology or lack thereof, every generation produces horror stories about growing up. M. Scott Peck's analysis of four levels of religion fits this story well. Sheeres' parents, and the thug who ran the camp, appear to have been classic \\"level two\\" religious types, who escaped moral (redneck style) anarchy by adherence to rigid authoritarian beliefs. But even number two types often show more love than this.For those who understandably feel leery of Christianity in general because of such nastiness, I recommend seeking balance by considering the arguments of Vishal Mangalwadi, Carroll and Shiflett's Christianity on Trial, or the chapter in my own Jesus and the Religions of Man entitled \\"How Has Jesus Changed the World?\\" The answer to one form of dogmatism is not dogmatism on the other side, but a fearless commitment to truth wherever it lies, and fairness all around."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"I cried when I read the last line of Julia Scheeres tragic and touching memoir. Scheeres sucked me into her life and I couldn't put the book down for a second. My blood boiled at several points through out the book. Is it truly possible that people can be so heartless and cruel? Is it truly possible that while I was living a carefree childhood, Scheeres (who is only two years older than me) was living in a private hell? Jesus Land reads like a well paced, well written novel but I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fiction, this really happened.Jesus Land touches on many different universal themes of Scheeres life from religious zealousness to blantant racism to misogyny and sexual abuse. It's also a testament to the human spirit and the power of forged relationships. The ties of family not necessarily has to be linked by blood. Anyone, whether you're black or white, male or female, young or old, gay or straight can glean something from this touching, heartfelt and honest memoir. Coming from a fairly religious family myself, I can truly relate with the damage that can be done to individuals and families all in the name of Jesus.This is a very important work that everyone should read. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"This memoir of a girl growing up in an ultra-religious family with two adopted black brothers was absolutely riveting. The racial prejudice and misuse of religion were heart-wrenching. Throughout the whole harrowing story, however, Scheeres never lets herself fall into the 'poor me' victim mentality. Her strength and determination are inspiring. This story will remain with me for a long time. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"One couldn't dream up the strangeness, the hypocrisy, and the wrong done in the name of religion that pervaded Julia Scheeres's childhood. In the 1970, when Julia was 3, the Scheeres family adopted a black 3-year-old named David in order to save his soul, to save him from his blackness. Julia loved David as a brother, and she had trouble understanding the racist insults the pair received in town and in school, as well as the fact that she got scolded for any of their mis-adventures while he got abused in the basement. When the two are just children frolicking with a red wagon, a concerned neighbor calls Ms. Scheeres to report that her daughter has run off with the maid's son.In the name of holiness and soul saving, first David and then Julia are shipped off to a brutal Christian reform school located in the Dominican Republic. Having basic privileges like freedom of movement, freedom to talk, and bathroom privacy removed is part of the process of breaking down these troubled children and building them back up as Christians. Julia, who has tasted Southern Comfort by the age of 14, has to admit to being an \\"alcoholic and a fornicator\\" at therapy sessions. She works tirelessly to earn the privilege just to talk to her brother David.There is another brother in the Scheeres household, another black boy who needs to be saved. While David responded to the turbulence around him with calmness and resolve (always hoping that someday the Scheeres would love him like a son), his brother Jerome responded with anger and violence, leaving the house as a teenager for a life of crime. Jerome exacted his revenge on the Scheeres by sneaking into Julia's room and violating her at night for years. Oh, but it was her \\"fornication\\" with her high school boyfriend that got her sent off to reform school.This is not an angry or bitter book. Julia tells it like it is. Jesus Land is truly a tribute to her brother David. She wrote it to tell his story, and her website has supporting documentation from his journal and their reform school report cards. A quick search of the web reveals that reform school Escuela Caribe, part of the New Horizons Youth Ministries, is alive and well in the Dominican Republic, with complaints being lodged against them well into the 1990's and 2000's."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Julia's story made the scars of growing up as an awkward teenager begin to itch from the first page (I've been on that country road. I've been confronted by the same ignorant red necks). The similarities (and so the justification for her story) end there. Perhaps the most appealing element to this surprisingly readable memoir is her lack of self pity, bordering on humor, in light of the injustices piled on by her narcissistic parents. So readable, in fact, that my wife and I couldn't put it down. I had to share it with her by reading Sam Harris's apropos book \\"The End of Faith\\". The two books should be sold as a compilation set."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Julia Scheeres book Jesus Land is difficult book to read. Wonderfully written and captivating, the hard truth of fundamental Christianity can be a hard pill to swallow. And it's not all fundamental Christians, just the ones that Julia encounters and writes about in this memoir of her life.Raised in the South, Julia's parents are hardcore Christians. After having four children, Juila's parents decide it is their duty to adopt two black boys in order to save their souls. Outrageous in their legalism, little Julia and her brother, David, are force-fed Scripture and the fundamentals of Christianity without the love and compassion of Jesus. Plus the adults around Julia do a terrible job of biblical exegesis and hermeneutics. Rather they rely on a shallow faith of works and show their \\"love\\" through verbal and physical abuse.Juila and David are sent away to a concentration camp for Christians off in Gulf Coast. They are treated like prisioners and come to resent God, Christianity, and everything they've been taught about it. Sadly, the music of Larry Norman and Keith Green even become associated with this malarky.A lot of times this book made me want to wretch. I can't believe that \\"Christians\\" could act this way and their churches could endorse it. Then again, my best friend was subjected to similar treatment her entire life.I recommend this book highly, but warn about the sexual content as well as language. It really gives us a chance to examine how legalsim can be hurtful. The story is compelling and from a girl who wanted to believe in Jesus, but rejected Him in the end. I just pray that Julia Scheeres the adult can find the real love, grace, and mercy He has to offer."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"November 13, 2005'Jesus Land': Her Brother's KeeperBy ALISON SMITHWhen they were young, Julia Scheeres and her brother David would sneak into their father's study in the family home in rural Indiana to watch \\"The Brady Bunch.\\" David loved this show, and saw his family as an 80's version of it. But while both families have three boys and three girls, the Scheereses are about as far from the simple harmonies of the Brady family as you can get.Julia's parents are guilt-tripped into adopting David - a neglected 3-year old black child - when there are no white kids left at the adoption agency. Holier-than-thou Christian fundamentalists, they teach David about Jesus and save his soul, but they stop short of loving him. It's a stingy, brutal world that they've brought the child into, and you begin to wonder if David wouldn't have been better off taking his chances in the foster care system. But David, a sweet-natured boy in thick glasses, does get one break. His new sister Julia, who is the same age, loves him almost instantly. They become constant companions, and this sibling bond is at the core of \\"Jesus Land,\\" Scheeres's gritty, heart-wrenching memoir.The first time Mrs. Scheeres touched David she feared \\"the black would rub off on her hands.\\" A parsimonious Jesus addict, she pipes Rejoice Radio (the local Christian pop station) through the intercom system of their ranch home, and feeds her children plate scrapings and scraps for supper. This would not be such a bitter pill if they were actually poor. But their father is a surgeon at a Lafayette surgical clinic. He drives a Porsche.The parents adopt another black child, Jerome, thinking that David needs \\"one of his own kind\\" to keep him company. They relegate the two boys to a basement room while their \\"real\\" children are given bedrooms in the house proper. When the kids misbehave, David and Jerome are beaten. The other children are merely grounded. Outside the home, things aren't much better. The inseparable Julia and David are subject to all manner of scrutiny. Barraged with racial epithets, they are chased out of public pools and refused service in restaurants.After Mr. Scheeres beats him with a two-by-four and breaks his arm, David makes a half-hearted attempt to take his life. His parents see this as the perfect excuse to ship him off to a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. As soon as he's gone, their mother clears out his belongings and scrubs his room with Lysol, \\"scouring away the remaining traces of his existence.\\" When Julia asks what she's done with David's stuff, her mother replies, \\"He doesn't live here anymore.\\"Once David's gone, there's nothing tying Julia to home. She runs away and is arrested after breaking into a car and violating her curfew. The judge is willing to drop the charges and release her into her parents' custody, but Julia refuses to return home. She's left with three choices: she can become an emancipated minor, she can run away with her boyfriend (he's more than willing), or she can follow her brother to reform school. Scheeres chooses the hardest of these paths: \\"I'll go to the Dominican Republic,\\" Scheeres writes. \\"I will go to David and be family to him.\\"When she arrives, she discovers that the supervisors of the school have censored her brother's letters, that barbed wire rings the encampment, and that the children are subjected to physical and mental abuse.Scheeres is certainly not lacking for material. The list of wrongs perpetrated against her and her brother is staggering. A lesser writer would have buckled under the weight of this story. Scheeres does occasionally fumble. The first third of the book is diffuse. As she shuttles between life at home, life at school and life at church, Scheeres seems uncertain which devastating details are essential and which will only distract from the story she wants to tell. Once she is in the concentrated world of the reform school, however, her narrative comes sharply into focus and the book becomes a page turner. Her depictions of life there - the punishing system of checks and balances, the midnight brainwashing sessions, the grueling physical demands - are heart-stopping and enraging.As the story gains momentum, it becomes clear that Scheeres is driven by two things: the fierce love she feels for her brother and the rising anger she experiences as she witnesses the injustices he endures. There is much praise, these days, for the detached, quietly elegant narrative. But there is little mention of the power a well-tended rage can bring to a good story. It is Scheeres's high emotion and her tight control of her narrative within that emotion that is most striking. Her anger serves her well: it is focused, justified and without a trace of self-pity.When they are finally sprung from the reform school, David and Julia are given one day together on the beach. It's an all-too-brief moment shot through with poignancy and with the conviction that all of it - the years of deprivation and racial slurs, the months in the reform school - was worth it, for these two to have just one day at the beach. It may not be \\"The Brady Bunch,\\" but in Julia, David found his true family.Alison Smith is the author of \\"Name All the Animals,\\" a memoir."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"The best memoir I've read in years, and this is my favorite genre. By turns funny, heart-breaking and haunting. A book that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Julia Scheeres' Jesus Land is a memoir that takes the reader through a childhood spent in abusive environments and into the mind of a child trying to cope with these circumstances. The first half of the book is set in Scheeres' childhood home in rural Indiana, and the second part takes us to a religious reform school in the Dominican Republic where she does time alongside her brother David. As the white sister of two black adopted brothers, Scheeres' witnesses the disparity in treatment that they receive, both in punishment and in routine treatment. Together, Julia and her brother David endure a physically abusive father, racist classmates, and a mother that is totally disconnected from their existence.Scheeres' portrait of both herself and her brother David account for the only two sympathetic characters in the story. It is easy to feel sorry for the life that David leads, as a black boy in rural (read: racist) Indiana, and to understand the plight of the author as well. Most readers will recognize pieces of themselves in these two as they read about their struggle for acceptance at their high school and as they fight against the world as two people united as brother and sister.As Scheeres intimates in the book's question and answer section, she chose the title \\"because the book deals in specious facades, like the amusement park.\\" This theme of using religion to mask inner family turmoil may appeal to the reader because (a) it is something they recognize from their own upbringing or (b) they may be interested in exploring this topic after reading about it elsewhere. Either way, it is a familiar theme that pops up in modern day politics and often drives the narrative that the religious right pushes upon the American conversation: \\"Embracing religion will allow you to solve all your problems.\\" Readers who are not prepared to deal with the idea that one can be both devout and abusive, may not appreciate the theme. Readers interested in themes of discrimination and accounts of religiosity gone wrong will appreciate this book.On a social note, this memoir was published in 2005 and brought a lot of attention to the way that the reform school was being run. The author is part of an online community of alumni that brought the abuses to light and prompted a change in ownership. The school is now known as Caribbean Mountain Academy, owned by a company called Lifeline, and still employs many of the staff that was in place before the ownership change.

This life experience has enabled her to write about the experience of racism from both sides, and with absolutely heart breaking detail. As a white person, it made me question myself - \\"do I understand the experience of living as a black person?\\" Of course I don't, but I didn't realize just how difficult it can be, especially in less accepting parts of the country. This story is set about 20 years ago, but of course this kind of hatred persists today, and it is appalling. Racism is a large theme in the story, but it also deals with family, religion, and the realization that sometimes you just can't trust anyone.I sometimes skip over the epilogue in a book, but make sure you read it. It brought me to tears and gives you more of an understand of how she was able to so eloquently tell this story.I read memoirs frequently, and this is one of the best I've read."},{"Title":"Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))","review":"Weeks after finishing this book, I'm still thinking about it. In Jesus Land, Julia Scheeres writes about growing up in a strict Christian (Dutch-Calvinist) household in rural Indiana in the 80s. When the older siblings are grown and gone, the parents decide to adopt, and end up with an African-American child (named David) that they choose for all the wrong reasons (p 19), \\"To reject a black baby would have been un-Christian, a sin.\\" When he turns six, they adopt a second African-American boy as a playmate for the first. Jerome (p 76) was \\"already a petty thief and a liar when he entered [the Sheeres's] household.\\" Dad is a surgeon, Mom is a penny-pinching religious fanatic (p 17), and \\"She and Dad go on medical missions trips from which she returns giddy with enthusiasm.\\" The parents' double standard in showing less love and kindness and punishing more harshly the African-Americans children causes a lot of strife. When David and Julia switch from private Christian school to a small public high school, racist incidents increase and Ms. Scheeres disassociates herself from her brother to avoid being targeted. She suffers in silence when repeatedly abused by Jerome both physically and emotionally. After a string of poor choices land Jerome in hot water, the family decides to wash their hands of him. So when they think David is headed down the wrong path, they choose drastic measures and send him to a sort of religious boot camp in the Dominican Republic. Strong censorship of correspondence between residents and their families prevent the Scheeres from knowing just how bad things are there and is why Ms. Scheeres, after having a run-in with the law, chooses to be with her brother rather than remaining with her folks. Her experiences at and after Escuela Caribe make up the last half of the book. By the time she tells her story, neither brother is in a position to confirm or deny her contentions or allegations. Either way, Jesus Land is a compelling read that might not sit well with certain religious folks.

What a miracle that Jesus Land's lovable duo - bound together by the pain of childhood in an Indiana home ruled by loveless religious zealots - survived their grueling stint at Escuela Caribe, a Dominican Republic reform school/holy-rolling nuthouse that nearly sucked dry their fragile teenage souls. In a spare voice teeming with furious dignity, Scheeres recounts that awful period as she honors David, a gentle, goofy black youngster whose restraint in the face of racism and religious bigotry both inspired and humbled her.

His account is so striking for a multiplicity of reasons, starting with the fact that the works is a chronicle of people, ideas, and events which filled the deep groove of esoteric challenge left by Jesus the Christ. I find no more convincing evidence of the raw power of Jesus than I do here, for his infleunce in these very early accounts proved to be incredibly fortituous and contagious. In Eusebius' chronicles we are exposed almost first hand to what people were thinking and saying about Christ, and how they were acting, including becoming martyrs, in the wake of his presence. What this means is that Eusebius has preserved for us a non-fictional look into the time directly after Jesus' departure, and in reading all these separate but not conflicting accounts of the early Christian pilgrims we get not only a fundamental understanding of the more immediate influence of Jesus upon the people of the Near East, but of the foundations upon which the Christian Church grew upon- not upon physical churches per se, but upon people whose faith was so unwavering that they were willing to face axes and lions to maintain the religion's message. We thus see how the Christian Church was formed not upon stones and government regulations, but upon persecuted peoples who were so moved by Jesus' message that they sprouted up between the cracks of the cruel fasces of thier era until the wave of religious growth overwhelmed the statecraft authorities.This works takes us as far forward as the aegis of Constantine and the Nicene Council, and no further. The fact that C. F. Cruse has kept true to the original, unabridged language as far as is possible in a translation is refreshing. All too many religious scholars can not keep from injecting their slant or propaganda into the works they purport to be conveying 'unabridged'. But C. F. Cruse sticks to the facts and to historicity, and has included some additonal information concerning the early martyrs- 'the Martyrs of Palestine', as some refer to them.It is with chagrin that one must concede that the drama in the New Testament has become so second-nature to our understanding of Christianity that for many the Bible might seem like an old TV re-run. What Eusebius phenomenal 'Ecclesiastical History' does here is make fresh again the grandeur of Christ and his message by showing us new angles in a very historic sense, by following the movemnets and sacrifices of common individuals, and by relating accounts less 'theatrical' and more 'real'. This is, after all, a non-fiction. The seriousness of the works and Eusebius' in-depth reporting is truly stunning in its crucial insight into those incipient days of Christianity."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus","review":"Eusebius uses the writings of other historians of his time, i.e. Josephus, to provide useful facts regarding church history up to the time of 300 AD. Although we might not agree with his application of Scripture to the events of the times, the compilation of facts which relate to the history of the church provide us with glimpses of the manner in which the church was formed and the events which accompanied the early church. Especially useful was his delineation of the various heresies of the day which even now still come back to haunt us, the mention of the compilation of the canon of the Scriptures, and facts surrounding the lives of the early church fathers and apostles."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus","review":"I do not find that Eusebius of Ceasarea's Ecclesiastical History is a useful general history of the Early Church. Any credible Early Church history from Schaff onward is far more accurate, balanced, and inclusive. If what you are looking for is a history of the Early Christian Church, please look elsewhere. That being said, what does one get in this nearly five hundred page package? The reader gets a mass of useful data on events and personages in the history of the Early Church as well as quote after quote from the Early Church Fathers available nowhere else. In addition to the works of Eusebius in this volume, there is appended to them a short and and interesting \\"... Historical View of the Council of Nicea,\\" written by a British divine somewhere in the late Nineteenth Century, and lastly, a valuable group of documents pertaining to the Nicene Council including the Cannons of the Council.Readers should ponder Eusebius's purposes and intentions in writing these ten volumes of \\"history\\" and his \\"Book of Martyrs\\" which deals with the Diocletian persecutions in Palestine. This is not in any sense modern objective history. Eusebius first attempts to illustrate that Christianity was a fulfillment of the Old Testament in every way possible. It is how Eusebius understood the justification of Christianity both spiritually and temporally. In the Roman world, old and venerable made a religion legal. New and innovative made a religion a superstition. After its eviction from the synagogues, Christianity was treated by the Romans as a superstition which made it illegal and it's adherents subject to persecution and death. Therefore, his first concerns were apologetic as well as historical. Second, he provides the reader with renditions of martyrdom after martyrdom during the persecutions from Domitian through those of Diocletian. This material is mixed in with other historical and theological data and writings of the Fathers that are timely. Here he purposely exaggerates the influence and pervasiveness of Christianity during the first three centuries of its existence. This leads him to declare the coming religious domination of the Roman Empire by Christianity under Constantine the Great. Here his purposes appear polemic in addition to historical.Also, the book can be used as a resource to research a multitude of specific topics. For example, the Revelation of John is dealt with on at least on six different occasions. Looking at these as a unit, the reader may conclude that Eusebius and the Church accepted the Revelation as canonical by 300 CE. However, his arrangement and presentation of the material tends to lead to the conclusion that Eusebius does not ascribe authorship to the apostle John. Emphasis on certain persons or points should also be noted. Eusebius writes what amounts to a glowing biography of Origen within the pages of the book. As he does this for no other Early Church Father, one is lead to the conclusion that Eusebius considered Origen to be the greatest of the Fathers before his time.Beyond this, there are valuable nuggets of information and insight throughout. The \\"Book of Palestinian Martyrs\\" refers to less than two hundred martyrs over the many years of the Diocletian persecutions. This may call into question the pervasiveness of Christianity at the time, or in the alternative, it might indicate a lack of systematic persecution by the Romans or both for that matter. Heresies and heretics are regularly abused by Eusebius, but their heresies are not explained. There is also much of interest in the Nicene materials. The 19th century history wrongly accuses the Melitians of abandoning Christianity in the face of persecution when just the opposite was true. In the documents section, Eusebius's letter back to his bishopric after Nicea is a remarkable document that attempts to minimize his prior Arian leanings in a most obviously dissembling fashion . These leanings are amply illustrated by Eusebius's earlier letter to Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia which is also included.That Eusebius of Caesarea's \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" is invaluable to the serious student and scholar of the Early Church is beyond question. It is our major source regarding the first three centuries of the Church and the Church fathers. Read it whole if you feel you can gain something from it. If not, and you are a more casual reader in the area, you may wish to own it as resource and reference that is easily checked against other more contemporary writings. In and of itself, it can tell you a great deal, however, this in large measure may depend on what you bring to the task. And yes, reading this book is a task. This is by no means an easy read."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus","review":"Considered by most to be the father of Church History, this text's primary focus is on the period from the 2nd century to the 4th culminating with Emperor Constantine and the famous council of Nicea. This is certainly a classic text and a must for anyone interested in the history of Christianity. The reader should find a host of interesting topics and can see much of the progression of Christianity and how the theology developed. A special emphasis on martyrdom is given but is appropriately balanced with the periods of times in which Christianity was accepted. On the darker side, one can certainly see the seeds of anti-semitism and the division of the church even in Christianity's adolescense. Considering the many changes that transposed in these earliest years when many of the second generation Christians still lived as evident from this reading, it is no wonder that Christianity is so far removed from its core beliefs today. Finally, I found it most interesting to examine the biographical notes of some of the faith's most influential members, its heroes and its villians."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus","review":"Scholars over time have called into question certain information contained in Eusebius. However, in many instances, while there may not be proof confirming what he claims, neither is there proof denying what he claims. Given the scarcity of actual materials from the time period, scholars work with copies and confirmations from other sources. Manuscripts perserved in monasteries, the occasional archeological find, etc, have provided general confirmation of some information; however, to dismiss Eusebius (or any other ancient historian) because of a lack of \\"scientific\\" or \\"archeological\\" information is a rather short-sighted and biased methological principle in itself. In fact, by these lights most all ancient historians would have to be dismissed out of hand. Having said as much, Eusebius provides an historical account of the development of the early Church, informed by the Faith itself. While it is unlikely he had access to a large volume of source materials and the like in the manner of contemporary historians working from archives, the oral traditions and information avialable to him at the time provide a good outline of what can be gathered in regard to early Church history. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, Eusebius does not deny the authenticity of John's Revelation (he does deny a Revelation ascribed to Peter); rather, in the case of Cerinthus -- a Jewish gnostic and heretic -- he points out how Cerinthus' heresy lead him to make spurious claims in regard to our state after the Second Coming of Christ. This itself is interesting since Eusebius mentions St. Ireneaus and writings against gnostic heresies, many of which find present-day counterparts in today's New Age movements. Eusebius provides interesting information on early Church practices, the scriptures employed, and the existence of an ecclesiology even in these early days. If one is interested in the development of tradition and the early Church, Eusebius is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus","review":"This is agreat book to understand the early Church.

For example, in the book of Acts, when Herodhas summoned Peter, who was imprisoned, to be examined and probably executed, he was made aware that Peter was nowhere to be found. The guards, a quaternion, 4 fours of soldiers (16) were all probably summarily executed. Herodthen departed for Caesarea to be present at a festival where he was clothed in fine apparel lined with silver thread and shimmered from the rays of the sun. After making a speech in which he was hailed and received worship as God,he was struck with worms and died. Eusebius' history describes his affliction, pain, suffering and then miserable death.

This cleric came out of Diocletian's persecution alive. Survival skills he then put to good use at Constantine's court, which was a dangerous place to be, even for members of the dynasty. In the comfort of American democracy it might be hard to imagine what these circumstances can do to an individual's integrity and ambitions. But from the spot where I am coming from and who had lost relatives in the death-camps, Eusebius looks a bit like an honest Nazi. It would be as silly to reject his testimony simply because he carried the wrong membership card, as it would be silly to reject Hss's diaries as evidence for the killings in Auschwitz. As a high ranking cleric Eusebius had an obvious bias. It comes with the territory. But he did not completely lack a sense of critical insight. After all it is Eusebius who, based on Dionysius's analysis, rejects the authenticity of \\"Revelations\\" and even names a certain Cerinthus as the actual author.! This is pretty bold, coming from a man like him, and it is reflected by Bultmanns curt treatment of &Ograve;Revelations&Oacute; in his monumental &Ograve;Theology of the New Testament.&Oacute; (See my review.) Or, to give another example, the darling of apologetic theology these days uses to be Papias's &Ograve;testimony,\\" which wouldn't even exist without Eusebius. But it was Eusebius who called Papias \\"... a man of very small intelligence, to judge from his books.&Oacute; It is interesting to see how modern scholars gingerly navigate around this verdict and stack a tower of speculations on this &Ograve;witness.&Oacute; (And what is Papias witnessing to? That he personally knew somebody who knew someone else who claimed to have seen the daughters of a nebulous apostle Phillip. Papias apparently prided himself to report hearsay and nothing but hearsay.) So it is almost impossible to overstate the importance of Eusebius for Christian history of the first 3 centuries, because, apart from the patristic literature and earlier apolog!ists, Eusebius is practically the bottleneck of Christian traditions before Constantines edict. This is a sad fact, and we should have no illusions about the fictional character of the exodus to Pella by the Jerusalem Church after the fall of Jerusalem. However, I see no reason to doubt that the sectarians as long as they had stayed in Jerusalem, had selected their leadership from the family of their first leader. This is common practice for budding sects almost everywhere. After Mohammed's death the early Muslims recruited their leaders from the prophet's own clan. It speaks for Eusebiuss relative integrity that he felt compelled to explain the discrepancies in the Gospels genealogies. Apparently modern &Ograve;sceptics&Oacute; were not the first to put a finger on this sore. Eusebius ascribed to the so called Arian heresy. What this meant can be expressed in one sentence: &Ograve;There is no God but God and Jesus is his prophet.&Oacute; In other words the emphasis was on Jesus human nature. Well no!t quite. This would have been the Ebionites faith, and we all know of course that Ebionites are evil heretics. Eusebius says so himself. Arius proposed a more arcane teaching that had God and the &Ograve;Logos&Oacute; (familiar from Johns gospel as the word from the beginning that turned flesh) (co-)existing from all eternity until God suddenly called into existence the Universe. Logos then took care of all the creation within the Cosmos except for &Ograve;the Son&Oacute; and mankind. This, for dessert, God Father reserved for himsel. Not what we would consider an orthodox belief these days. But by the good grace of his god, Eusebius was spared to see himself condemned (or worse) in his own lifetime. I told you he was a survivor. My point here is not that we cannot put our trust in Eusebius alone, my point is that we have little choice. Decius and Diocletian had rounded up clerics for deportation and in a systematic fashion had collected scriptures for the shredder. Consequently we have no complete te!xt of the Christian canon from before Constantine. In fact we have barely anything complete from that period. So when the persecutions finally abated, missing scriptures needed to be replaced. The criteria and means of how this was accomplished is still a moot and little researched subject. For instance only by disassembling the fragments of Tatians &Ograve;Diatessaron&Oacute; (a harmony of the 4 canonical gospels) we get a glimpse on the state of the gospels short before 174 AD. There can be little doubt that the decades after 311 AD. had been assiduous in scriptural and apologetic fabrications of every kind and some accuse Eusebius of having participated in this industry. I dont really know. He might, but then, he may not. One has to use critical judgement. For instance Acts 5 gives a rather typical illustration for sectarian life: With his gang of devoted thugs (the &Ograve;young men,&Oacute;) a cult-leader - Peter - enforces his rule of terror over a new sect. 2 members hold back on their contrib!utions and get the treatment for backsliding. They &Ograve;mysteriously&Oacute; die. All very plausible. Has been seen before and since. So the statement deserves some credence. The same test applied on Eusebius, will leave enough to feed an academic career. Constantines vicar was a rather bright fellow and the Tyrant knew his name. We cannot choose the time where we live; Eusebius was no exception. He survived the most severe of all persecutions, he is Antiquitys first ecclesiastic historian who has reached us intact; and if he is not trustworthy, than it is time that we say good bye to that notorious Papias as well."},{"Title":"Writing GNU Emacs Extensions","review":"...is reading this book. Step 1 would be to read O'Reilly's &quot;Learning Gnu Emacs&quot; from cover to cover. Step 2 would be to start bookmarking &quot;Info&quot; pages in the Emacs and Elisp manuals (inside Emacs; Emacs can bookmark places in files you've edited, bookmark directories, bookmark Info pages, etc.); and then you are ready to read this book.While you can become proficient in Emacs just by learning a handful of commands, to be truly productive and happy you must learn most of the features and use them. This is a very long process (over a year for me, learning a little bit more each day). But what I've gained from the journey is invaluable. For example, one insight I've gotten is that Emacs can work very well for the novice (open/type/save/close) and the expert (write major mode to handle new language) equally well, and this idea can apply to any software project. (Sure, it sounds simplistic but the moment of &quot;Aha!&quot; is more profound than that.)This book is fairly small and progressively introduces new ideas in writing Lisp code to add functionality to Emacs. I think in retrospect the topics covered were well chosen because I have looked up the examples time and again to use code snippets.Step 4 in mastering Emacs is to read the newsgroup gnu.emacs.help every day for a few months, which will teach you about a great many features Emacs has that are not covered in any book (or covered very well, like term mode, font-lock and many more)."},{"Title":"Writing GNU Emacs Extensions","review":"If you have taken the wise step and decided to learn emacs you're aware of the eLISP substructure underlying your C- and M- actions.

Why not hack emacs to make your hacking faster?In true geek fashion, I thought that this book would be, like so many of ORA's books, a canonical START on the monopoly board of computer / technology progress.It wasn't really.It started with introducing the notion of evaluating a lisp command string (in this case, making sure you have your ^H, ^? and Erase sorted out) - and goes from there.

As he couldn't win the fight with them he had to go home and become a miner again; he had lost his wife and he had got nothing.I personally was very touched by the story itself as well as with the way Cronin tells it. Although you know how it's going to end if you've read some other Cronin's books (the thing I really suggest to do), you are so deep in it you are not thinking about it. Stars Look Down is not the new-age kind of book-the one you take, read and put in the bookshelve and never take again, it's got the classical value-you think of it again and again and you recall it when you feel absolutely miserable about your dreams and things you're trying to do or reach.4 stars instead of 5 cos I really hoped for a better ending, although 4,5 would fit better as it was a realistic one.I recomend it if you're a serious reader, otherwise you'll simply be bored."},{"Title":"The Stars look Down","review":"I could not believe how relevant this novel is! It's so much like what we see today in the political and economic arena--political corruption, the helplessness of the poor, working class, the power of those with money to make the rules and control the government, the ineffectiveness of those who lack money to make much of a difference. The novel uses the mining industry to illustrate all these sweeping concepts. The author definitely seems to be railing against capitalism and advocating socialism. The main character, a poor fellow from the working classes who has a chance of succeeding, moving from the mines to a career in teaching, finally gets into the government hoping to change the mining industry for the poor, almost-enslaved miners, but he completely fails. He is eventually soundly beaten by another fellow, a friend of his, also from a poor working class family who has lied, cheated and stolen to get to the top! In the end, the hero seems to me to have completely failed. He ends up back in the mines and has not succeeded in changing anything for the workers. The novel certainly is about the theme of capitalism and rugged individualism versus a compassionate socialism. And in this novel, those with the money or those those who step on others, crush them, to gain money and power, win out."},{"Title":"The Stars look Down","review":"Found a book I had been looking for in good condition at a resonable price!"},{"Title":"The Stars look Down","review":"This book is as blatant a piece of political propaganda as anything that came from Ayn Rand's pen. In the guise of a heart-tugging novel, Cronin gives us working class people who are all noble, hard working, honest, long suffering, and abominably exploited by employers who are universally either arrogant, greedy, dishonest, unscrupulous and heartless, or patronising, stupid and hoplessly incompetent. The characters are never more than two dimensional, the world in which they live essentially one dimensional, with that one dimension being the class struggle.The story is well written, with exquisite graphic detail, but still it would have been far more enjoyable with a rational balance of characteristics for the protagonists, instead of the ridiculous polarization that Cronin employs.If you're looking for a dollop of marxist propaganda, then this book will fit the bill. If you're looking for a serious and balanced cross section of life in the England of the Edwardian era, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Rome's Ruin by Lead Poison","review":"A good read, informative and enlightening!

It is rational and easy to follow and cites some very good references.It underestimates the harmful effects of lead as it was published before Needleman's 1996 work showing the effect of lead on antisocial behaviour and Canfield's 2003 work showing \\"normal\\" lead levels of 10 seriously impair IQ . These 2 latter references magnify Gilfillan's case and make it overwhelming.

The book is really cool and a quick read and I was astounded at how well he writes only knowing him from his comedy but his brutal honesty and ultimate day-to-day battle to stay sober has certainly made my own recovery something even more to be proud of. This is quite a book for anyone with the &quot;quiet fear&quot; of having all sorts of addictions and should give lots of people courage to change their lives. I think I have quite a few people to send this book to anonymously. Shh! Don't tell anybody. Bravo, Mr.Lewis!"},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"A book that brutally describes what addiction is like, from the viewpoint of an addict, and how to overcome addiction is &quot;The Other Great Depression&quot;. Written by comedian Richard Lewis, we learn how he has overcome three decades of alcohol and drug addiction with seven years of sobriety. His book analyzes how youthful traumas and adult insecurities lead to anxieties, depression, alcohol, and drugs. It was Richard Lewis's realization that his lifestyle was leading towards death and that he wanted to live that enabled him to win his struggle to overcome addicitons and regain his life.Richard Lewis presents many deep personal thoughts about the pressures of youth, dating, and the entertainment worlds to present his own road to the depths of depression and alcoholism. His description of his struggle to overcome his difficulties, which came from his own realization of his need for survival along with assistance from caring friends and his sprituality, brings encouragement to people seeking to overcome their addictions.One key point Richard Lewis makes is that addicts are screaming for help, even when they deny they need assistance. All too often, we ignore their pleas, in part because many addicts do not know how to ask for help. Addiction can be helped. It may not be easy. Ignoring the addiction is not the way to provide that help."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I've been a huge fan of Richard Lewis' for many years and have always loved his stand-up as well as his acting. When I read &quot;The Other Great Depression&quot; it blew me away! Now his story-telling brilliance is written for all of us to savor anytime. As honest as he always seems to be on stage, one never knows if that's real. It's real! And then some. The book is revealing, humorous, and tremendously inspiring ... I have a long list of friends and relatives who need to read it--including my girlfriend!"},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I really like Richard Lewis. He is a very funny man. But the title of this book is so apt. Reading it was...kind of...depressing. But the book I'm sure has much in it that would be very helpful to those caught up in addiction. What makes it worthwhile to the rest of us is the painful glimpse it gives you into the mind and psyche of someone dealing with Depression. And the descriptions Richard gives you of his relationships with his mother and father are heartbreaking. But the description of the redemptive scene between him and his dying mother in the nursing home is worth wading through some of the other weightier areas of the book to get to. This book is very painfully honest. It would have been easier for him to gloss over some of the rough stuff and would probably have certainly made him look better, but to battle addiction I think brutal honesty is probably called for and Richard certainly comes through in this regard."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"Reading Mr. Lewis' book was like having a private and meaningful 12-step meeting with him. Yes, there was profanity, yes, there was some stuff about women that made the hairs on my neck stand up and yes, he was a sick and dysfunctional puppy, but Mr. Lewis' story echoes the stories heard in &quot;the rooms&quot; and his thought processes may strike a chord with others who suffer from the disease of alcoholism. Speaking from experience, the lives of suffering alcoholics are never pretty so be prepared for some embarrassing, pitiful and demoralizing scenarios. His brutal self assessment and rigorous honesty are very impressive.In the end, Mr. Lewis' story shows that the disease of alcoholism is a terrible war fought within the confines of one's mind and spirit, persistently threatening to destroy one's physical being. His strength, on a day to day basis, to be victorious over this killer is encouraging. By staying sober, his hope to be the person he was meant be, is slowly, but triumphantly, realized in the progress he's made towards this goal. Thank you, Mr. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"Reading this book makes me so proud of my husband who has been sober for over 20 years. I didn't know him when he was using and Richard's essays make me realize the strength and courage it takes to get there. Thank you Richard. Your words are inspirational and your girlfriend is one lucky woman."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"Lewis does a great job describing the insanity of his addiction and the depths in which it can take a person. I give him a lot of credit to be as bold as he was. Lewis writes of issues, episodes, and obsessions that might be harshly criticized by anyone, but to another alcoholic/addict, these events are all too real. Lewis doesn't hold anything back -- his humor and neurotic personality give this book layers of dynamic energy. Addicted or not, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs to know about the perverse, insidious nature of addiction. Lewis has the strength to discover himself, the courage to face his addiction, and the candor to give it a voice. We can all learn from this intriguing and provocative story. To Lewis I say -- keep working it baby 'cause you're worth it! One day at a time."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I didn't think I had a drinking problem--and still don't but for sure I have an addict's state of mind in a myriad of other areas and thanks to Mr. Lewis' amazingly candid memoir it has given me the courage to keep an eye out on myself before I could conceivably fall into the hell he did--and yet--his story gives such hopefulness and good advice I heartily recommend it to anyone who\`like myself has doubts about one's own manner of living or those of loved ones."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I know Richard and he poured his heart out in this book. It's funny, touching, sad and at times scary. I reccomend this book for anyone having addicions problems. It's a brave book by a brave guy who puts his soul out there for us to see."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"The sheer honesty, baring of one's soul - is the definition of courage. The step by step journey into and out of addiction is a gift to everyone battling the same relentless demons. His story, his heart, his soul offers hope to so many people who may feel that they have none. Are a step away from giving up. God bless, Richard, for being who he is, fully, clearly, honestly. Walking in the truth."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"A must read for Richard Lewis fans, fans of comedy, or anyone interested in addiction. He is an amazing man."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I bought this book at a tag sale for 50 cents and if I remembered the address I'd return it. Alcoholism is sad and serious; however, Lewis is a self-indulgent egomaniacal narcissist who thinks he is the most important person to ever recover from the disease. He offers superficial reflections on his disease and recovery, and is barely able to conceal what this book is truly about: his obsession with himself, his career, and friends he repeatedly refers to as \\"famous\\" but never names. No idea who gave this man a book deal, or who edited it for that matter - it could be cut down to four pages and it would offer the same amount of value. Depressing."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"Towards the end of this book Lewis, remembering when he started the book project and how tough it was to build up the steam to write and keep writing observes:\\"Oftentimes I sat motionless for hours, as if mummified, just doodling random thoughts or just aimlessly wandering around my house thinking that my story was meaningless.\\"Well, Richard, in this one respect your instincts for this project were right on the money.The problem with this book is that it is very poorly organized, bordering on being incoherent. Furthermore, time and again he bumps up against an honest confession of some drunken mishap only to pull his punch at the end.Will some earnest Lewisologist have the stomach to count the number of times he tells us that he embarassed himself at a [fill in the occasion or restaurant or party with other celebs] only to pull the veil of vagueness over the final humiliation. We want the goods, dammit!Is there any other reason to read a self-indulgent celebrity whinefest?One of his anecdotes that worked was the time on the plane when, thinking he was impressing his fellow celebrities every time he staggered to the bathroom, he finally discovered to his horror that part of his shirt was sticking out of his fly.That one had a beginning, a middle and [no pun intended] an end.If you are going to spend an entire book alternating between bragging about your showbiz pals and rich lifestyle and flagellating yourself (addiction is not friendly to rational thinking) at least have the wit to make the anecdotes interesting.He is a very funny guy with a beautifully cracked sense of humor. I remember a great line of his to the effect that his grandmother used to sit around doing needlepoint, sewing her epitaph. Great image!I hope Richard Lewis tries this again, this time leading with his strength, which is humor. Really funny stuff is a high art form. Anyone can do incoherence and boredom."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"Richard Lewis has blown me away me away with this book. It is original in style, as it is neither a typical book of comedy bits or rants, nor is it a conventional autobiography. It reads like the writing of a man who sat for a solid amount of time, cutting open his insides and writing them out for the world to read - and I mean that in a good way. Lewis thankfully keeps namedropping to a minimun, but what he does reveal positively about David &quot;Santa Claus&quot; Brenner and others is genuinely touching. The language is often crude, something that Lewis himself seemed apologetic about at a recent reading at Barnes and Noble in New York. To me the language sounds honest and natural as it reflects raw emotions coming straight from the inside of the man. Lewis has said that he feared he would die when he completed this composition. I can barely express how appreciative I am that Richard lived to write this book and has lived on for the next chapter of his life. He writes with remorse (and actually apologizes to them in print) about his past romantic liasons. Yet he also writes with hope in general and specifically in regard to loving and being loved from now on. Although he might take offense at the corny tone of this review and say something like - &quot;my image is changing...I'm getting rave reviews by rabbis on line&quot;, I mean this praise with all my heart: You've done a great job and may you be strengthened to go on. Thank you Richard, and G-d Bless!"},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I knew comedian Richard Lewis had logged a lot of sobriety but had never read his book. The book rambles, a lot like his hilarious stand up, but somehow he manages to make his points and in this book a ton of them on now leading his life out from from total darkness and alcoholism to an even funnier entertainer and mostly, so it seems, a much better person.I always admired Lewis for his brutal honesty on stage but this is the mother lode. I have recommended it to many people who either have addicition problems(and Mr. Lewis has a trunk full of them) and if they can't get out of denial after reading this memoir it's a shame.For sure, Lewis could have written one of those typical jokey books most comedians write but he opted for digging as deep he could into his disease and sharing it with whomever I guess which was not only cathartic but to help others. It's cool to see that this \\"alcoholic from hell\\" has seen the light--for all of his fans and those who still are suffering."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I'm sort of blown away and a little scared as well. I'm in my late thirties and just got out of a bad relationship and was feeling horrible. I also was getting a lot of heat from friends who felt I was an alcoholic. I'm still not sure if I am or not but after reading Richard Lewis's book I have my doubts about that but also feel a hell of a lot better for getting out of my relationship and also in some crazy way actually feel less alone. His book, although unbelievably funny at times and amazingly dark in some places is mostly one of the hippest most perceptive books I have ever read on just plain living. It's weird that a guy like Lewis who I always liked as a comedian but seemed to be so out-of-control ( and in reading I guess for a time he was)can be so in command of his life and I just got a lot of strength and courage to be myself--maybe for the first time--and not care so much about what others think of me. His stream-of-consciousness style was sort of like how he is on stage and yet it was real literary too and I can't remember the last time I was so taken by so many insights in one book. What a memoir! What a read! Thanks, Richard."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"There are no pictures because this is an internal view of Richard. Pictures would detract from getting to know the real person inside. This book lets you see him as he really is now and how he got there.This book lets you know Richard Lewis from his point of view. Why he thinks what he thinks without any necessary segue from thought to thought."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"We collect stories of extraordinary comebacks, and so when CBS Sunday Morning (April, 2008) mentioned Richard Lewis and his (resissued) book we were interested and immediately secured a copy. Fans of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Lewis' past work, and fellow Ohio State grads (Lewis' golden days were in Columbus, he says) which we surely are, may be disappointed because this presentation is not hip, clever or carefree. It is a rather harrowing and repetitious tale of alcoholism, womanizing, childhood angst, self-hatred, faithlessness -- even an eating disorder thrown in for good measure. Gives another meaning to 'feel your pain.' It is a long, tough slog to get to the redemption part, and thankfully, we made it, and thankfully, Lewis attains sobriety, a measure of faith, and some peace of mind. Still, that edgy, irritable, angry guy you see with Larry on Curb? Richard playing himself, more or less. That torrent of art is coming from somewhere, after all. Despite what is on the printed page here, not convincing that Lewis ever really attains Nirvana-like peace-of-mind, or even the feeling of being at home in his own skin. That attainment might bust his comedy shtrick to smithereens, which as of this writing is going great guns. (Google RL and read the reviews.) Still we like Richard, a lot, and we can't help but hope he finds it."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I would personally like to hit Mr. Lewis on the head for his three year romance with one of the greatest fantasy figures of the seventies, Baronss Nina van Pallandt. If you were a teenage or adult male at that time, you were reduced to jelly by her picture. You knew she was not for mere mortals but for billionaire mega studs in Cannes, or on the Riviera.So who gets her? A shleppy Jewish standup comic from NY, whose father was, and this is so perfect, and so very Jewish, a caterer.As a barmitzvah bandleader, I have spent many years fighting, working with, and plotting the forceful overthrow of many Jewish caterers. Not one of whose children ever dated anyone faintly resembling Nina van Pallandt.Let me say this. Being a standup comedien is one of the most difficult jobs there is. Mr. Lewis succeeded admirably, and yet his personal demons, or many would say his progammed genes, and the chemical constuct of his body resulted in a breakdown fueled by drugs and alchohol. The scenario is familiar and Mr. Lewis tells it well. My vocabulary contains many of the profanities used by Mr. Lewis, but I think it was a wrong decision to use them this liberally. Mr. Lewis describes his father as the Lee J. Cobb waterfront union leader in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. You know how the longshoremen speak. The only profanity in the movie was when Brando said to Karl Malden, the priest, &quot;You go to hell&quot;. That's it. Not bad for one of the greatest movies ever made.My life has paralleld Mr. Lewis. It's a war with no armistace, and he seems to be doing well, and I wish him well. Those who like the book may want to see &quot;Drunks&quot;, a pretty good movie starring Mr. Lewis, and the late Howard Rollins."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"As a recovering alcoholic with 5 years of sobriety under my belt, I can say that Richard Lewis shows a great deal of insight regarding the issues of addiction and recovery. It is unfortunate that one must plow thru so much dross to uncover the gems.I think the book would have been much stronger if he had focused on his alcoholism and his success with it. I understand that there is a strong need for honesty in recovery; however, I would have preferred he address his sexual addiction and his eating disorder by simply saying that he is still struggling with them and hopes someday to write of his success with them.Because he did not list his acknowledgements until the end, I read thru the whole book wondering if he had simply typed it up himself, run a spell-check on it, and bundled it off to the publisher with the instructions, &quot;Don't change a comma!!&quot; So I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who stated that the book needs a good editing. It's unfortunate that it did not get this treatment. It is a good book. With strong editing, it could have been a great book.I do look forward to hearing of Richard's continuing success in the future."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"It's a dull book written by an ego starved comic wanna be. I was looking for humor but generally found it to be a tedious read."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I love Richard Lewis on stage. But this is beyond bad. Was there an editor on this project??? It's the most repetitious book I've ever half-read (I couldn't finish it). It could easily have been condensed into something 1/3 the length. That aside, I feel this is not a book about addiction. Instead, it's a thinly-veiled attempt by Lewis to portray himself as a bigger celebrity than he actually is, and perhaps more so, to portray himself as a major ladykiller. Ahem. I could tolerate the charade if the book were even remotely funny....but it's not. C'mon Richard! Luckily the book was given to me, and it will be passed on to make sure the next reader doesn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"What an absolute waste this is, and that comes from someone who's enjoyed Lewis's humor for more than twenty years. It's repetitious as hell, directionless, and not even clever or humorous. It seems to have gone straight from the tape recorder to the printer without the guiding touch of an editor who could have made this book a guide for those without addictions. Such a work could have been as informative as it was entertaining, but this work is neither, the total antithesis of what I expected from one as gifted as Lewis. A ponderous read to begin with, it crawls to a plodding pace as his health ostensibly improves. If the point of the book is to illustrate how a harrowing addiction drives away those who like you, then this book has succeeded."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"There's some interesting stuff in Lewis's book. His style reminds me so much of Spike Gillespie...All the Wrong Men and One Perfect Boy : A Memoir by Spike GillespieHis book (and likewise hers) lets me get into the mind of a hyperverbal, hyperactive personality. Very exciting, but tiring!I cringe at how he treats women. His biggest addiction seems to be to cruelty. Like in that movie about rehab w/Sandra Bullock, maybe he should try having a pet before he attempts a &quot;people relationship.&quot; But he is brutally honest. That's worth something.Sobriety is tough and I admire anyone who embraces it. Richard Lewis lays his soul bare and it ain't pretty. It took guts to do it."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"I love Richard Lewis, but this book was actually ... depressing. I had to stop reading and just skim the rest. It was repetitious. I never really understood what pain of his childhood he was trying to escape by drinking. I think some editor should have fixed the tone to make it either funnier or more-serious-and-readable. It was too shticky to be meaningful, but too serious to be funny."},{"Title":"The Other Great Depression","review":"This book may have a lot to say to people either in recovery or needing recovery but I was greatly put off by the foul language that appears to command Mr. Lewis' language skills. I hope he moves on to recovery of his communication skills next. What a shame to have a message to share and not be able to do it in a way that people who don't use profanity can relate to. Am I to believe that all people needing recovery from substance abuse are also consumed with disgusting expressions of the English language? I don't think so!! There is a better form of communication than what offensive language offers. Profanity is not a meausre of honesty."},{"Title":"The great American con machine","review":"In the 70's I worked my way through college selling on the telephone so I was intrigued to come across Mr. Riemer's slim tome on the subject. The pitfalls of listening to telephone solicitors have been evident for some time now but this piece of investigative journalism was one of the first to ring the alarm. Riemer's book came about after his total immersion in the shady industry in the early 70's and he limns his experiences, some creepy, some hilarious, with a panache that frequently sails over the top in its avidity for its subject. He strives for an arch neo-noir tone that seems as much a spoof of the &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Confidential&quot; tabloid journalism of the 50's as a sincere effort to expose a crooked industry. Mr. Riemer gets top marks for chutzpah and enthusiasm. By the way, I was relieved when this book informed me the organizations that I worked for way back then were all quite legitimate. A fun read albeit a dated one."},{"Title":"Audel Electrician's Pocket Manual (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"This book is typical of the Audels books in that it fairly concisely covers the important areas of the topic.

They had an audacious mission, to link the nation's great long-distance trails with the cities in between and lay out a way to get from coast to coast under one's own power.To many of us, this sounds like a dream assignment. But Eric and Ellen faced many challenges-finding a route through a maze of mountain ranges, urban parks, farm roads, rail trails and river crossings; securing the cooperation of local hiking clubs and wary landowners, enduring a cold winter, networking with the media, writing a guidebook, and taking their case to Washington to gain designation as a National Scenic Trail. It was hard, often frustrating work, yet their good humor, physical strength, and boundless enthusiasm saw them through and got the job done.We're all the richer for it. The book is a real page-turner. Eric and Ellen take turns telling their story, and they make you feel you're right there with them. Especially compelling are the times they get separated. You'll experience first-hand the fear of a woman alone in the wilderness, and the grim determination of her partner to find her. In the end, they'll have you cheering as they accomplish their task.An adventure for the ages.

This subject has been of keen interest to me for many years now, and having read so many accounts of the Rendlesham case, this one is the most sober account I have so far read. It brings out new accounts from the U.S. Airmen, based at RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge, in the early eighties. A good investigative account by all means, backed up by new facts. Since the book was published the UK government has released documents proving they were interested in this case. A Great read about an ongoing eventHighly recommended."},{"Title":"You Can't Tell the People: The Definitive Account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO Mystery","review":"The late Georgina Bruni (who died of cancer in 2008 aged 61) was a trained private investigator and successful writer/magazine editor with connections to leading politicians and senior military figures. These contacts, together with her single-minded professionalism, made possible direct access to many witnesses to the events at RAF Bentwaters in December 1980 who had not previously gone on the record. \\"You Can't Tell the People\\", her book on this most famous incident of UFO-military-base-intrusion is the most thoroughly researched, comprehensive and wide-ranging yet written.The book's title is a direct quote from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when discussing the UFO/ET issue with the author in an unguarded moment at a public function in London in the spring of 1997, three years prior to the book's publication. The comment was prompted by asking the former PM her views on the testimony of several leading scientists and former military men recently interviewed by Bruni in the USA who had claimed they had been secretly working with recovered alien technology. Sure enough, the former PM knew something about this and cautioned her to make sure she \\"got the facts right\\" and as a politician \\"you can't tell the people.\\" This most revealing conversation was then interrupted by the intervention of the former PM's security men.The book is a factual and comprehensive piece of detective work which leaves no stone unturned, and extremely well-organised. Right off the bat, the author summarises in a short chapter the \\"major players\\" in the event: Commander of the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing Major General Gordon Williams, Base Commander (of both Bentwaters and Woodbridge) in 1980 Colonel Ted Conrad, later Base Commander Colonel Sam Morgan, Deputy Base Commander Colonel Charles Halt (author of the famous \\"Halt Memorandum\\"), AFOSI Deputy Base Commander Wayne Persinger and in all, 29 leading USAF witnesses or participants plus RAF, Suffolk Police and civilian witnesses. Bruni hunted them all down, interviewed them all, and presents their sometimes extensive and detailed testimonies for the record.The history of this enigmatic area of Suffolk and of the twin bases is explored, and the author toured the now-decommissioned bases including the underground areas prior to embarking on the project. The extraordinary incidents between 26-29 December 1980 and their gradual emergence into the public domain are described in a logical, chronological narrative. Each chapter introduces the perspective of a new witness or group of witnesses: Gordon Williams, Larry Warren, Timothy Egercic. The evidence of John Burroughs, Jim Penniston, Edward Cabansag, Adrian Bustinza and Charles Halt each gets an entire chapter, as does the local police file, AFOSI, civilian witnesses and other base personnel. The case builds and builds.The author draws all this evidence together in the final chapters, concluding the \\"case for the UFO\\" visiting Rendlesham Forest in December 1980 is unassailable, and that the governments of both the UK and the USA covered it up and did their best to discredit witnesses. She presents a compelling case. The theory that the Orford Ness Lighthouse explains the events is comprehensively discredited to the point where only a deluded fool could possibly give it any credence. What exactly are these UFOs visiting us? She goes through the usual hypotheses: secret hi-tech human technology, inter-dimensional phenomena, time travellers. Although the Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis remains unproven it's the strongest candidate, says Bruni; however, such speculation is not the issue. The issue is that SOMETHING UNKNOWN landed on more than one night and left broken tree branches, imprints of landing gear in a triangular pattern on the forest floor (plaster casts taken) and soil baked hard and changed at the molecular level (samples analysed, with control samples); the craft \\"adversely affected the nuclear ordnance\\" by firing beams of light down through the steel-reinforced concrete storage bunkers into the nuclear weapons; multiple highly credible witnesses testify to having interacted with the \\"visitors\\"; a paper trail of official documentation was generated inside the USAF and between the USAF and the UK Government, and the whole incident was subsequently downplayed and covered up by the authorities.So in summary, \\"You can't Tell the People\\" is one of the most compelling and deeply-researched books on the UFO subject in general and on the Rendlesham Forest incident in particular, driven by an impressive quantity of original field research, supported by a large number of first-time-on-the-record interviews and substantial official documentation. Georgina Bruni was a great writer and investigator, her untimely demise in 2008 was a loss to the field and this fine original work deserves a five-star rating.It's interesting to speculate if, having supplied the book's title, Baroness Thatcher has read this book. If not, she should - and so should you."},{"Title":"You Can't Tell the People: The Definitive Account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO Mystery","review":"Georgina Bruni (since passed away) has written an encyclopedic account of her investigation into the Rendlesham - Bentwaters UFO case. Half a dozen books have been written based on the accounts of military men who purport to have been there when the object landed in the forest. Each book has the viewpoint of its principal, and each shifts the story just enough to create doubt in the mind of objective observers. Investigative journalist Bruni has written an account based on her exhaustive interviews with the usual suspects as well as many secondary players involved who have not been interviewed in the past. Her strength is the ability to be tenacious in resolving conflicts among the many accounts, and when unable to do so, to point out the questionable claims and her personal feelings about the credibility of those involved.From my perspective, she has managed to chronicle the many conflicting accounts of Larry Warren and Peter Robbins, two of the most prominent who have written about \\"the British Roswell\\", and to call into question many of the statements made by Warren. To her credit, she does not dismiss the accounts out of hand, but feels, as many do, that Warren has been \\"messed with\\" by the intelligence types of AFOSI. Bruni points out that many of the low level men involved have kept quiet as instructed by the military, while their tight lipped superiors have enjoyed rapid advancement in their careers. To read her chapters detailing the years long process of securing interviews and updating her files, carefully cross checking her facts and dates, one has to admire her unwillingness to simply go for the sensational in this story.Bruni spent years on this book, and it shows. This is the one volume that looks at each of the principals in the case and sums up her personal verdict that something was there, and as probably extraterrestrial in origin. This is the last (and best) word on how things stand today on the Bentwaters Case.Her intriguing title stems from an interview with Prime Minister Thatcher in which she was told: \\"You must get your facts straight, and you can't tell the people\\". Make of that what you will."},{"Title":"You Can't Tell the People: The Definitive Account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO Mystery","review":"I really can't say anything more than what all the other reviewers have all said so succinctly and articulately.I was disheartened to hear that Ms. Bruni passed away at such a young age. She did an amazing and laborious job in researching the events at Rendlesham, trying to separate the facts from the misinformation and as anyone who knows who has read any books on the UFO phenomenon, can be quite a task at best, and virtually impossible at worst given the extent government officials - and perhaps even the aliens themselves - will go to to create disinformation by giving false screen memories to witnesses, contactees and abductees.That's why witnesses' testimonies can be so confusing, whether in Larry Warren's case or even in other UFO abduction cases. There's so much disinformation, which leads to the conclusion that the witnesses were given screen memories, by being given drugs combined with hypnosis. This way, whenever the subject begins to recall the events, the created false story, the screen memory becomes all distorted and is recalled incorrectly.Not only is it not enough to implant a false memory, hypnotic amnesia is also induced as well which causes the subject to forget their programming, never knowing they were tinkered with. As Georgina writes in her book, these methods are not out of some fictional espionage book. They were created and used by the CIA and the US military. What makes this so diabolical and treacherous is that they know these subjects can be deprogrammed by undergoing hypnotic regression in the future, so they create MULTIPLE false memories so that it makes it virtually impossible to get at the truth, to know what really happened.With so many witnesses being drugged and interrogated, it's not hard to conclude that this is a form of mind control. Was this something we learned from the aliens themselves or did this come out of our own twisted minds?"},{"Title":"You Can't Tell the People: The Definitive Account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO Mystery","review":"This book explains a lot of the werid things that exsisted and have exsisted on this twin base complex. I was stationed here and can testify there is a lot of strange events around here. I have served or rather stood on Security Post 18 and know that area as well as anyone. Late at night it is a creepy location to be in on watch. The woods this occurred in are to say the least spooky. I was stationed at this base before this happened but I still know many of the people referenced here. This book and one other by Warren cover the whole incident in great detail. They are and this one especially is well worth the read. As the book title says....\\"you cant tell the people\\". I am generally a disbeliever in UFO events but this one has been testified to by numerous trained people I knew and I respect their narration of the event and suspect these men really did see this."},{"Title":"You Can't Tell the People: The Definitive Account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO Mystery","review":"I really liked this book and the research they did although at times it gets a little tedious and repetitive I would recommed it.

I would say the only negative of this atlas is that it is almost too detailed, and might be a bit overwhelming for a beginner. For example, it labels subareas of structures that might be labeled as single structures in other atlases (e.g., claustrum, amygdala etc.). I don't mean to present this as a criticism--the atlas fills the role of a comprehensive atlas for intermediate to advanced users, but beginners might want to use this in combination with another atlas (I recommendThe Brain Atlas: A Visual Guide to the Human Central Nervous Systemin the paperback). This latter book is nice for the illustrated pathways as well. I was a big fan of the last edition of the Mai et al book, and I think the current edition is even better. For example, there is a supplemental website containing a large amount of great information: [...]. Used in combination with another book, this atlas will give any medical or neuroscience student a solid foundation in anatomy."},{"Title":"Atlas of the Human Brain (Deluxe Edition)","review":"For many readers, this might be a rather exotic book. However, for those who want a sense of the structure of the human brain, this is a fine resource. The title refers to this as an \\"atlas\\" of the human brain. And that it is! As the authors note: \\"The present book consists of a series of maps, each featuring. . .brain morphology and topography.\\"MRI technology allows for a better view of the human brain and makes this volume more helpful still. The Introduction (Chapter 1) emphasizes some realities--such as the fact that there is a fair amount of variability in individuals' brain structure; localization of brain function is another issue discussed here. Methodological issues are joined, too, in the Introduction. Chapter 2 focuses in more detail on materials and methods in the study of brain structure. Chapters 3 and 4 represent the heart of the book, an atlas of different parts of the brain.Interested in the structure of the human brain? This is a handy resource if you wish to visualize the brain."},{"Title":"On the Trail Of The Wild: Encounters In The Southern African Bush","review":"One comes across many books on the African wilds both in the coffee table category and the more informative data and detail-type. This book combines the best elements of both, and is one of the most outstanding books I have ever come across on this subject. The photographs are exceptionally good. They are enhanced through the knowledge and sensitivity of the author towards his subject, and this unique combination of understanding and ability provides for a photographic view of the wilds that few photographers, let alone authors, could emulate. The author's experiences and knowledge of both wild creatures and wild places is ably shared with the reader, and together with the magnificent photographs, the reader is able to enjoy the best of the Southern African wilds through the medium of a book - this is a rare achievement!"},{"Title":"On the Trail Of The Wild: Encounters In The Southern African Bush","review":"Mr. Ben-Shahar does a great job at presenting his research and personal experiences in various Southafrican bush areas. In addition to his interesting narratives, Ben-Shahar provides us with the opportunity to enjoy some of his outstanding photographs. A must read if planning a trip to a Southafrican destination."},{"Title":"On the Trail Of The Wild: Encounters In The Southern African Bush","review":"&quot;On the Trail of the Wild...&quot; captures the essence of a land that is a curiosity to so many and yet known to so few. The author has brought to life some of the more spectacular regions of Southern Africa, with detailed descriptions of the topography, ecology, and it's wildlife inhabitants. From the smallest beetle to the massive elephants, he describes their interactions and the important role each plays in this complex society. And into all this he has woven some incredible personal experiences that the average urban dweller can not begin to imagine.Rather than painting a glamorous picture of life in the bush, Mr. Ben-Shahar has presented a realistic description of the harsh conditions he experienced and the unpredictability of the wildlife. The fact that he survived an elephant attack, endured the long and painful recovery, and still returned to the bush speaks well for his deep love and respect for this wonderful land.If you've ever been to Southern Africa or thought about going, this book is definitely one you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This book is really quite interesting. It is very good. But it is almost entirely short quotes from Bruce Lee's notes. The editors have taken these quotes and organized them by topic and then organized those topics into chapters. And they did a very good job with this.But really, the book reads like a Twitter Feed. You could probably take this book in its entirety, and write it out, quote by quote, to twitter.What this means is there is no depth. You get Lee's thoughts on a topic, but no concrete examples or additional expository text. Like reading The Book of Five Rings and trying to think about how it applies to your life.I like that, and enjoy it. But I wanted to write this review so other people would know what to expect. There are other books that explain JKD much better by using Lee's quotes, and then adding additional exposition to further explain what the quote means.

This allows you to see how Lee was percieving martial arts and what he was looking for. You also get possible insight to where his art was going.Near the end of the book are Lee's training routines.

What is frustrating about it, and it's not the fault of the publisher or writer, is that it seems as though Bruce was never able to really complete his thought. He was constantly evolving so you're never quite sure at what point in that evolvement he is making the comment. Was it before he abandoned Wing Chun? After he worked with Joe Lewis? In Seattle? Oakland? Hong Kong before or after immigrating to the U.S.?Bruce Lee was a genius. It's very difficult to pin a genius down or &quot;freeze them&quot; so they are the same forever. With his early passing though, we are left with little else of this man's actual work in the martial arts (not films) than these compilations and the observations of his training partners such as Joe Lewis, Danny Inosanto, Chuck Norris and Mike Stone in books such as Lewis's How to Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I'm only on page 82 out of 400+ pages.

The 'Tao' book itself, is bigger in size with better quality paper and looks more like a Manual vs an academic Textbook. It would be nice if this book can be printed in such format, too.However, the content encompassed in this voluminous text, is indeed invaluable and offers an in-depth analysis of numerous aspects of JKD and indeed, Sifu Lee's thoughts and actions.Once again, Mr. John Little has done a remarkable job!"},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This is the best book on strategy I ever read.

As I was reading this book there was one thing going through my mind. \\"Just what is so new about MMA?\\"Sure sure techniques may have changed and while Bruce Lee was alive BJJ was nowhere to be found but Bruce Lee's idea and approach to fighting does make him as Danna White said the Godfather of MMA. In fact JKD might as well be called MMA. After all JKD is just a name so do not fuss over it.

John Little has done a superlative job of locating, formatting, editing and presenting Bruce Lee's writings in a manner that is comprehensible, informative and inspiring. In many ways this book far surpasses &quot;The Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; which, in comparison, looks to be so many of Bruce's notes simply tossed into a stew. This book presents Bruce Lee's writings and sketches on his art of Jeet Kune Do in an organized and comprehensive manner -- much like Bruce Lee presented it himself when he created his art in 1967. This book is, quite simply, the best book on Jeet Kune Do ever written. But then, that shouldn't be suprising -- it was written by Bruce Lee."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Speaking as a student and teacher of martial arts myself for almost 40 years, this is a very detailed and thorough discussion of Lee's ideas. There's so much detail here that one problem is organizing it successfully so it can be presented in a coherent and structured way, but Little does an excellent job of that too. This book will be of interest too all those interested in Lee and his ideas on martial arts.I won't try to go into too many of Lee's ideas about fighting, which wouldn't be practical in such a short review, anyway, but I would like to make one comment. One thing you'll notice in this book is that Lee spends a lot of time discussing strategy and principles rather than techniques. He comes back again and again to such notions as timing, distance, interval, gauging your opponent, knowing when and how to attack, creating your own openings, etc., rather than discussing the technical details of technique per se. This is because the book pretty much assumes you've already achieved the necessary physical and mechanical skills and attributes--speed, power, coordination, and so--and are looking for how to progress from there, having already built a solid foundation. This book will help you do that by focusing on the more advanced principles and tactics."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I picked up this book with extremely high expectations. I was not disappointed in any way whatsoever. To say the least, I was impressed. John Little has shown great respect for Bruce Lee in presenting his material in just the way that Lee would of wanted it.Lee didn't want any of his teachings to be the only way to do it. He wanted to teach the student the concepts behind it and then allow him to create something that follows those concepts. Little did this perfectly in the way that he left the material vague so that the reader must study and truly understand the intracicies in it.I have had this book for about 2 years now. The cover has raggedy edges, and the center is splitting open. I still don't think I have gotten out of it all that I can."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I don't like reading too much, but I read this over and over. Either get this one or the Tao of Jeet Kune Do. There is much overlap, and you can probably do almost as well with one or the other. The difference is that Tao of JKD is written by Lee, and this was compiled from Lee's notes. In addition I recommend Art of Expressing the Human Body, which I think is volume 4 in this series. While this book gives you the techniques themselves, The Art of Expressing... tells you how to train your strength and power and speed, etc. in order to make the techniques more effective."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Commentaries of Bruce Lee is one of the most comprehensive collections of quotes, diagrams, and theories on the market today. Integration of Jeet Kune Do in Movies adds an element of excitement, to the book. I found the book very well organized. The five elements of Jeet Kune Do were describe in comprehesive detail. Narrative was easy to read supported by a series of thoughts, techniques, and insights that kept my attention for hours. One of the best Martial Art Books, I've read this year."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I see that a lot of reviewers that gave this book low ratings seem to think that you can learn martial arts from a book. I will give you this warning now, you can't and never will be able to learn a martial art from a book, but this is a good starting place for beginners to see some of the techniques and ideas put forward in Jeet Kune Do. If you're someone with martial training as I am you can learn a number of things from this book. Most martial arts that are taught today are for exercise, fun, or competition, rarely are they taught for safety or other more historical reasons. This book can help you get back to those roots of your art.I have studied various forms of martial arts for around ten years now and would consider this book an invaluable edition to my library, which is always growing and always changing and I still rank this book as one of the better ones in my collection. Inside you will find sections of philosophy and sections on technical work. The reason I gave this only four stars is that if you are not a martial artist or if you don't at least have some basic training, the technical section of the book is worthless and will do you no good. However, if you have practiced, you can learn a lot from the technical section of this book as Bruce goes over individual moves and how to use them to their best in a fight. He also explains how to close space between yourself and an opponent, how to mix up the rhythms of a fight, and how to make your attack and defense more effective.If you haven't studied martial arts then you will find some sections of this book to be quite interesting while others are utterly worthless. If you have, however, this is one of the better technical manuals that can be purchased that is also veined with the philosophies behind this physical and mental art. It is a wonderful resource and a useful tool for any martial artist."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Jeet Kune Do is a book full of insight into the martial arts through the eyes of Bruce Lee. It does contain many important aspects of martial arts. It appears to attempt to address very important topics which many martial art styles tend to ignore. Martial arts are more than lists of techniques and pre arranged kata. They are about developing fighting skill, and about how to train in order to perfect your agility, balance, power and timing. Volume three does address these concepts and more.The down side to this book is that it isn't very much more than the brain storming sessions of Bruce Lee committed to paper. One statement after another is made with very little logical connection. What this book needed was to be ordered such that related statements and concepts were grouped together. In places there are simple lists of various techniques without little or no explanation of the context. Rather than clear explanations of concepts we are treated to short unrelated sentenences.The job of trying to extract from these notes the real meaning of what Bruce was trying to convey was very difficult indeed. The book is full of photos of Bruce in action, however these photos are generally not related to the content. Drawn illustrations are in somewhat better context, but they are obviously the original illustrations Bruce had drawn himself.For those who are interested in the original notes from Bruce Lee there may be some interest. However, for a general reader the presentation of his ideas is confusing and incomplete. This isn't to say that the book does not have value. There is quite a bit of good advice. My issue with the book is that the editors could have substantially reorganised it in such a way as to make it more comprehensible. It would also have been an advantage to redraw the illustrations professionally so that we don't have to strain to read the notes.Bruce was a great Martial Artist, but that doesn't mean we should expect him to be the best writer. In this case his ideas should have been extended and examined. Where there were incomplete sections the context should have been filled in for people. Also the order of ideas should have been changed so that similar ideas were not repeated throughout the book."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I've read this book 4 times and each time I get something new out of it.

To many martial artists who want to take up Jeet Kune Do or just want to study the martial way, this is great book.Many first time martial artists might be bored with the many philosophical parts but when read through and through again will come to learn and master not only JKD, but also the way of life and living day by day as it happens.Jeet Kune Do teaches us to not look at the outside of things (and that means everything), but to look at the inside. Now I'll talk like Bruce Lee talked. You don't drink dilluted wine do you?The martial arts that are Americanized to a point of digust is diluted wine. Jeet Kune Do teaches not to look at the flower but to look at the roots."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This has to be the definitive book on Bruce Lee's martial art. If you own this you do not need &quot;The Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot;. John Little has done a great job of locating, formatting, editing and presenting Bruce Lee's writings in a manner that is easy to read, espcially when compared to &quot;The Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; which, in comparison, looks to be so many of Bruce's notes just randomly written. This book presents Bruce Lee's writings and sketches on his art of Jeet Kune Do in an organized and comprehensive manner.This book is, quite simply, the best book on Jeet Kune Do ever written."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Great book on Lee's martial art of Jeet Kune Do (JKD).

Nothing filtered here. It is FAR SUPERIOR to the TAO. Although the TAO makes a great complement to this for the more serious student. It's one incredible book and by far one of my favorites I own. I HIGHLY RECOMEND this book to anyone involved in the fighting arts regardless of style. This shows what a true genius and how far ahead of his time he was."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This is a wonderful book. It compiles Bruce Lee's thoughts and ideas related to Jeet Kune Do and martial arts in general and even a few thoughts on life, too. His explanation of the tools and tactics used in fighting open up a whole new level of the martial arts, even for beginners. This is a GREAT book. While it may be a tad disjointed at times, that only seems to add to the greatness of it. Some of it is like a puzzle you must figure out, so even after you've finished reading it, you find yourself actively STUDYING it. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I found this book to contain decent information regarding Bruce's method(s) for effective fighting. The thoughts contained are not complete, often they resemble simple lists or phrases without thurough explanation. The way in which this book is organized is very similar to the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, by Bruce himself. It sould be stated that the information in this book is decent information; it just needs to be weeded out.

In reading Bruce Lee's hand written notes, we can now learn the 'why' instead of just learning the 'how' when it comes for fighting."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"When I got this book, I'm was very pleased with how John Little done this with good editing from Bruce's diary on Jeet Kune Do.It's got pretty great follow along movements, and with pictures from Bruce's famous movies to show you how it's done. Like if you were reading page 193 for footwork against your opposition, you'll see 2 pics of Lee avoiding Kareem Abdul Jabbar's kick from &quot;Game Of Death&quot;. Also, you can see James Tien's KO'ed body in the background like the other viewers said while they reviewed &quot;Game Of Death&quot;. ;)Pages 75-78 show you how to do cool throws to bone breaks. When you look at the pics of &quot;Game Of Death&quot; when Lee faces off the second fighter that went &quot;CHI-YAAH! &quot;, you can learn how to break the limb without injury after you throw him. Better yet, have the &quot;Game Of Death&quot; tape and this book handy. You can put it frame to frame and you'll see what this book is talking about.When you're learning about strangleholds on page 85 against your opposition, think of what Lee did to finish Kareem Abdul Jabbar. On page 79, you can learn the Standing Neck Crank, which Lee finishes Chuck Norris off in the Coliseum finale of &quot;Return Of The Dragon&quot;.Learning the Side Kick was easy for me to learn. When I looked at a pic of Lee teaching James Fransicus the Side Kick on &quot;Longstreet&quot; on page 269, it made me get inspired to do it. Way to go, Bruce!Anyway, the movements and Bruce's sketches are easy for beginners, and the pictures on how to do the moves from start to end is a GREAT touch! I even like Lee's sweep when he faces Shih Kien in the finale of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; on page 114.In my final words: If you want a great JKD book with Lee's sketches and Lee's movie pictures? Don't buy the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, buy this one! This is a COOL book and a good read for beginners."},{"Title":"Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I was twelve years old when a friend asked me if I wanted to learn martial arts.

After three years I told him that bruce lee was my favorite fighter, I liked his power, his calmness, and his stlye. Which I found out that it is'nt a style at all. It's a way of life. I am now thirty seven years old. and thanks to my sensi, I also teach neighborhood kids and some adults the art of being ones self in war or at home. Jeet kune do has made me a better person overall. my special thanks to mr.bruce lee for being a giving individual with a heart of gold.

Ms. Jeffreys persuasively argues that western women express their relative status of powerlessness and subordination through beauty practices in an effort to conform to the expectations of their male oppressors. Through her astute scholarship and analysis, the author identifies ways in which we might begin to create an equalitarian world where women are freed of the burdens of male-imposed behaviors.Ms. Jeffreys' thesis poses a formidable challenge to neoliberal feminists who have suggested that women exercise agency or 'choice' with respect to their appearance. By rooting her analysis in capitalism's tendency to divide economic activity into the public (masculine) and private (feminine) spheres, Ms. Jeffreys contends that beauty practices serve to reinforce the social hierarchy by heightening gender identification. As the neoliberal economic system has increasingly allowed the marketplace to function as the arbitrator of morality, these practices have become more extreme. In fact, the author submits that the United Nations' definition of harmful cultural practices (which in the past had been used to condemn the developing nations of the world) might now be more appropriately read for its description of how western democracies are currently mistreating women through an imposition of needlessly destructive beauty practices.Interestingly, Ms. Jeffreys traces many widely-accepted beauty practices to their origins in prostitution, including the wearing of high heels, makeup and surgical enhancements. Ms. Jeffreys describes some of the negative health consequences that have ensued as a result of these and other practices that have been made popular by the mainstreaming of pornography, including tattooing and labiaplasty. Ms. Jeffreys discusses how the beauty/industrial complex adroitly uses the media to heighten women's feelings of insecurity for profit. The significant expenditures of time and money that women make in an effort to beautify themselves could be better spent on improving their real lives, the author suggests, and she encourages her readers to eschew such practices as a political acts of resistances. She also calls for better government regulation of the medical, adult entertainment and advertising industries to help limit the harm caused by destructive procedures and harmful messages, especially those that target the young.Written with insight, passion and intelligence by an author of the highest integrity, I recommend this timely book to everyone interested in a strong feminist perspective on the topic of beauty and society. However, it is probably best for adults to provide readers under 18 years with guidance, given the mature themes of the book."},{"Title":"Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West (Women and Psychology)","review":"When I first discovered this book I was very eager to read it. I'm a feminist; I don't wear makeup or high heels and I thought this book would be enlightening. Unfortunately, any hope I had of learning anything from this book was killed by chapter 3, when the author airs her opinions on Transsexuals.According to her, MTF transsexuals are all sexual deviants who get off on wearing women's clothing, while FTM transsexuals are just trying to grasp male power. Jeffrey's scoffs at transpeople who state they've always felt like they were in the wrong body; according to her they are all \\"coached\\" to say that by their doctors. This is SO ignorant, as anyone with even the smallest knowledge of the transgender community would know.I just can't believe how old fashioned and outdated this book is! And it was published 2005, not 1975! On page 95, the author even says that \\"Homosexuality cannot be explained by genes or hormones but is a socially constructed form of behavior. Gay men develop an identification with \\"femininity\\" as a result of being shut out of, and often badly persecuted and harassed by masculine society.\\" Where has this woman been for the last 10 years?!

Buy it, read it, give it to your friends. We all need to be conscious of the lies we perpetrate in our damaging \\"beauty\\" practices and the inarguable role these practices play in reinforcing women's oppression."},{"Title":"Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West (Women and Psychology)","review":"If you are looking for a book that presents a feminist critique of U.S. beauty standards, I would suggest reading The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf instead. It's much more digestible and it's a classic that many have read. I'd only suggest this book after reading The Beauty Myth if the social construction of beauty is something that very very strongly interests you and you have a background in feminist theory/sociology/philosophy.My main issue with this book is that the first 25% of the book is a complete nightmare to wade through for anyone who doesn't already have a strong background in feminist theory or philosophy. Seriously, I have a bit of a headache. I'd say it's more written for grad students and professors in Women's Studies than for the general population or general college students. It does get more digestible after that, when she discusses applications of her theories to specific examples.She tries to set her up as being radically different in philosophy from Wolf, but in my opinion the basic claims are the same: beauty norms subordinate women and give men power, women often don't recognize this, men and capitalist system have a stake in keeping women dissatisfied, it's not necessarily a \\"choice\\" to wear make-up/be thin/get cosmetic surgery when there is so much pressure to have a certain look and adhere to expectations for your gender. The only part that seemed completely new and fresh to me was chapter 3 (critiquing \\"transfeminity\\")."},{"Title":"Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West (Women and Psychology)","review":"This book makes a radical assertion, namely that most of the modern 'beauty' regime in western culture imprisons women, in a prison now of their own making ironically, no differently than the burka or the chador. The enslavement of women who dumb themselves down to be 'sexy' who destroy their helth and ruin their lives merely for the sake of showing off for men shows how disfigured and hypocritical the modern feminist movement is. The feminist movement has two sides, one that argued the pornography and obsessive dieting and all the other 'feminine' things were harmful and the other which embraced all forms of these things including women who are imprisoned in cells and forced into polygramy as 'liberation'.The only slight problem here is the assertion that these practices are true only to western women, which is categorically false, women all over the world masicate themselves for men, whether it is wearing viels and never leaving the house, or happily working in brothels at the age of 12, or being circumsized, or dying their hair blond in India, the entire world is made up of 'beauty' regimes that mean most women whether in the the 'liberated' west or elsewhere enslave themselves to whatever chance 'style' is supposedly 'in' this year.

He'd visit a lab, give them a presentation about what he'd seen in other places, then see what they had been developing. Then, he'd go to another lab, frequently in another country, and do the same, incorporating what he'd seen at the last place into his presentation. In this fashion, he was serving as a walking information nexus. Researchers who were largely unaware of other research going on in other places would learn about each other, and make contact with each other, as a result of his travels and his presentations.Hell of a gig if you can get it. Where do I sign up for something like that? And get paid to do it?Many of the technologies he writes about are still unknown, a decade later. They were cool when he wrote about them. They're still cool. They just haven't gone mainstream, for one reason or another.If you buy and read this book today, you won't spend much time thinking \\"gee, that's old hat.\\" Much of it is still quite eye-opening.The guys in the UK who were using compressed air and hoses, where many people would be trying to use hydraulic actuators (much higher cost), were very interesting.The differences between US and Japanese mindsets, WRT wearing headsets, was very amusing.Creating a device which you can move with your hand, which simulates different textures, was intriguing. Not sure what the practical applications are for that, but it was definitely intriguing. There's a whole realm of VR there which I don't know that anyone is touching.The high-speed motorcycle ride through Brooklyn, without physically moving, would be very fun to try. Even if it was film-based, back before the advent of cheap electronic displays. The fact that the guy even managed to incorporate wind, coming from different directions, and scent makes that one truly ground-breaking.I'd love to see an updated version, with \\"where are they now\\" information on more of the projects.

Donkin takes pain to explain not only the reasons why a particular location, such as the Azores or Crete, were picked, but also the evidence that exists against those locations.

If only we had a truthful understanding of human nature and society, he thinks we might more effectively design healthy educational systems.Here Maritain writes prophetically: \\"The task of moral re-education is really a matter of public emergency. . . . . That teachers in public schools may not face unruliness and violence, moral authority must be recognized; and there must be a serious teaching of moral principles, I mean as grounded on truth rather than as suitable to social convenience\\" (p. 93). The \\"present agony of the world,\\" he believed, is \\"a supreme crisis of the Christian spirit, which for a long time has been neglected or betrayed in democracies, and which totalitarian states are now determined definitely to abolish, then it is obvious that a revival of Christian conscience and a new work of evangelization are the primary and unquestionable conditions for the moral re-education that the man of our civilization needs\\" (p. 107).Maritain begins by insisting we set forth coherent \\"aims of education\\" which gives order and direction to our endeavors. \\"Education is an art,\\" he says, \\"and an especially difficult one\\" (p. 2). Thus it demands we have artful designs with clear objectives (or ends) in mind. It is an \\"ethical art\\" which truly seeks to free persons to attain the end for which they are created. As practitioners of the art of teaching, teachers are more like farmers or doctors than sculptors. There must be an attentiveness to the nature of the person, an ars cooperativa naturae (art cooperating with nature), a genuine ministering to the learner which characterizes good teaching.At this point he cites some wise words from his master, St Thomas Aquinas, who urged students: \\"'Always make sure that you actually understand what you read or listen to,'\\" and \\"'avoid speechifying on anything whatsoever.'\\" To both teachers and students, Aquinas said: \\"'never leave behind him any difficulty unsolved.'\\" \\"He also warned teachers--this advice was already necessary for the educators of his time--'never to dig a ditch that you fail to fill up.' He knew that to raise clever doubts, to prefer searching to finding, and perpetually to pose problems without ever solving them are the great enemies of education\\" (p. 50).Above all else, education should encourage the development of moral reasoning, virtuous living, qualities of mind and character which, we early discover, cannot be mechanically inscribed in the young. Facts can, at least momentarily, be poured in. Data can be inscribed in computers. Our young people have often acquired lots of facts. But they know little about the soul, the life of the spirit, the moral dimension to life, the life of freedom. Moral persons, of course, are necessarily free persons who make moral decisions and become persons of character.What we mainly aspire to, as persons, is freedom. Most deeply, we long for an inner spiritual freedom, the freedom which St Paul described as freedom of the Spirit. Our social world, our vocational world, have worth, but lack the eternal dimensions our heart craves. \\"Thus the prime goal of education is the conquest of internal and spiritual freedom to be achieved by the individual person, or, in others words, his liberation through knowledge and wisdom, good will, and love\\" (p. 11). The love which we need comes not from mental training, of course. It comes from strong family ties and religious examples. It is, ultimately, a gift from God, a gift of grace. The true liberation we all need is freedom from self-centeredness, egoism, sin. Thus there is, in a profound sense, an essentially religious component to genuine education.Ultimately, he says, \\"our chief duty consists, according to the profound saying of the Greek poet, Pindar, in becoming who we are, nothing is more important for each of us, or more difficult, than to become a man. Thus the chief task of education is above all to shape man, or to guide the evolving dynamism through which man forms himself as a man\\" (p. 1). Indeed, \\"education is not animal training. The education of man is a human awakening\\" (p. 9).What is man? What is the nature of human nature? To answer this question is the most important of educational inquiries. The failure of socialistic systems reveals their flawed definition of man--homo faber--as a worker, a tool-using animal. Where man is so defined, education becomes a variant of animal training. And since animals, such as bees, are maximal specialists, education seeks to mass-produce specialists who can methodically work in the factories of mass production.But perhaps this behavioristic, materialistic, socialistic approach is wrong. If, in fact, the Greek, Jewish, and Christian understanding is correct, we best understand \\"man as an animal endowed with reason, whose supreme dignity is in the intellect; and man as a free individual in personal relation with God, whose supreme righteousness consists in voluntarily obeying the law of God; and man as a sinful and wounded creature called to divine life and to the freedom of grace, whose supreme perfection consists of love\\" (p. 7). And this definition of human nature leads to distinctively different educational strategies.As educators, we are probably always at some \\"crossroads.\\" Clearly that's the case today. And I know of no better consultant as to which turns to make than Jacques Maritain!"},{"Title":"The witch, and other stories,","review":"I'm a big Checkov fan and it's always wonderful to get more of his short stories.

Professional speaking is about being a first class expert. Only then develop an entertaining and humorous format and delivery. Or you could shoot for the lower rung of just being funny. Unfortunately, just being an expert does not put you on the ladder.With the name Zig Ziglar-- his business associate-- all over this book my hopes were to high. The title (Inspire Any Audience) is overdone. Inspire is a misrepresentation. Keep them interested would be more accurate. Page 121 he advises avoiding words like certainly, positively and others. If the word any is not a violation then it will require a Clinton like explanation for the word \\"is\\" or in this case \\"any\\" from Jeary.In chapter 8 \\"Keeping Their Attention\\" he introduces the concept of business entertainment-a phrase he has trademarked. In the title he uses the words proven secrets. The big secret is that his explanation of business entertainment is shockingly shallow. The worthy gist of is to do bold things to keep the audience engaged. Sorry, Jeary the command to play music, play games and other categories does not cut it. Explain yourself. I get the drift of it enough to say that is the book that Jeary or someone should write. That book would be fresh and exciting. In fact if that book exists I am going to find it.On page 96 there is a page on gestures. In nearly every speaking book the author is so afraid of mechanical outcomes that they say trite stuff about be natural or be yourself. Give Jeary credit for making an attempt at giving some specific advise about gestures. The book turns me off on paying big bucks for his in person seminar on presentations at this point. There are lots of little tidbits and minor insights through out the book.Just--- not a block buster book. It is well above average. Of the 40 plus books on speaking that I have read and reviewed on Amazon this book is at the lower end of the top ten books to read for public speaking improvement. Clearly, a worthy book.Inspire Any Audience is worth the money and then some but it is not an inspired book that the author was burning to write. It is a darn good survey of techniques to give your customers an interesting day long seminar."},{"Title":"Inspire Any Audience: Proven Secrets of the Pros for Powerful Presentations","review":"This book delivers far more than I thought it would when I first purchased it.My openings have gotten a thousand times better.

Hannah loved it so much that she quit her job in Denver and went to work as a detective in BVI in Tortuga. After a year of living there she has a lover, good friends and a houseboat where she can look out at the sea every day.One day she is awakened by an explosion and sees the Caribbe on fire and sinking into the water. She dives and brings up her friend Elyse Henry who lapses into a coma. Evidence points to the incident being an accident because she left her propane stove on, which apparently sparked and caught fire. Hannah's instinct tells her somebody was trying to murder her friend. In defiance of her boss' orders to leave the case alone, the determined Hannah tries to prove her instincts are correct, but almost gets killed in the process.DANGEROUS DEPTHS is an exciting police procedural set in an exotic setting. What makes the attempt on Elyse's life interesting is that she didn't have an enemy with a motive to murder her; so readers keep wondering why as they seek along aside the heroine to find out who the killer is. Armchair travelers beware! Once you read this book, you'll want to hop at plane and visit the unspoiled British Virgin Islands.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"Third in a great series. This book, in particular, will take you for a ride both above and underwater with enough twists and surprises to satisfy any reader. I have a love of diving and a healthy respect for the Sea. It is obvious Kathy Brandt does too. Through her facinating main character, Hannah Sampson, she tells a heck of a yarn, but in so doing gives us all a tast of beauty, danger, romance and the need to respect our \\"one earth\\" and its endangered species."},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"Detective Hannah Sampson is back in her third adventure and this time dealing with what she believes was an attempted homicide. It was Sampson who was first on the scene when her friend Elyse Henry was thrown into the burning sea by an explosion aboard the boat \\"Caribbe.\\" Sampson was asleep on board her own boat \\"Sea Bird\\" when the noise woke her up and she investigated. Despite her injuries due to the flames, she was able to rescue Elyse who now lies in the hospital in a coma.For Hannah Sampson, she believes that the explosion and resulting fire were caused by foul play. Everyone else, including Chief Dun of the Tortola Police Department, believes it was just an accident. Elyse Henry, advent environmentalist especially in regards to the sea turtles and the coral reef, annoyed some of the natives in the British Virgin Islands and appealed to others. With no real evidence other than a gut feeling on Hannah's part, Dun wants her to move on to more serious and obvious matters such as who is breaking into charter boats and stealing stuff. Hannah is not about to let anything go.What follows is a rather simplistic but enjoyable read. The second storyline of the break-ins on the charters is rather obvious as is the author's feelings on environmental issues. Frequently the narrative read stops completely as the groups are portrayed simplistically as either for or against the environment and the reader is lectured. Like the character development itself, the lectures are simplistic and cultural differences regarding native islanders are mentioned but basically ignored.The main plot line is enjoyable however and holds a couple of minor surprises. Obviously, the author loves the area she writes about and that comes through clearly to the reader when she concentrates on her main plot and the beauty of the area. When that is in play, the story moves forward at a steady pace. Unfortunately, the lectures are frequent and not at all subtle or woven skillfully into the story and thus, stop the action and the reader cold.The overall result is an average read at best. Simplistic on all levels, this is a pleasant diversion for a couple of hours.Kevin R. Tipple (copyright) 2006"},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"Love this series. Please keep them coming!!! Love these especially since I am on a rescue dive team in Nebraska!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"This is my favorite of the 4 books.

You could read it as a stand alone, but trust me, you'll enjoy it so much more if you read the previous two books first.

This one's grittier than the previous books.This time, Hannah's best friend Elyse's boat burns, and Hannah's the only one who thinks it wasn't just a tragic accident. She's racing against time and her boss to prove it was attempted murder before the killer can finish the job.In addition to the diving details and the exotic British Virgin Islands scenery, Dangerous Depths includes interesting environmental details about sea turtles and the effect of rats in the islands.The mystery has nice twists, and I'm enjoying the development of Hannah's friendships and her romance with O'Brien.Good series.

An easy and enjoyable read, very entertaining, and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"The explosion wakes Hannah Sampson in the middle of the night. Her neighbor's boat has just blown up. Quick diving saves Elyse Henry's life, but she's in a coma in the hospital. Chief of Police Dunn thinks that it was a tragic accident, but Hannah is convinced her friend is the victim of an attempted murder. Since Elyse's work as an environmentalist wasn't always received well, the list of potential suspects is rather long. Can Hannah put the pieces together?So the series has never been a favorite with me, but I have enjoyed them. This time, the flaws of the series were too much. The sub-plot about charters being robbed was obvious from the very beginning. The book is obviously a lecture on the environment, but the characters fell into two camps, the good environmentalists and the evil business owners. The only exception to that was Hannah's boyfriend O'Brien. There were also times the story was stopped so we could have characters lecture us on the importance of their pet environmental issue. Finally, the author and editor paid no attention to detail, referring to events from several days ago as yesterday and calling the same meal breakfast and lunch multiple times within a few pages.The idea of a scuba diver in the British Virgin Islands is a great premise, and I've been generous to the series in the past, hoping it will improve. After this outing, I'm not holding my breath."},{"Title":"Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation","review":"As an avid reader of environmental thrillers, Dangerous Depths kept me intrigued until the last page.

I had already bought some microscope books. This one was the best for beginners. On every page there are detailed but cute color pictures explaining all the technical stuff. ALSO, on each page that talks about viewing a particular object under the microscope, there's an ACTUAL PHOTO of the object under the microscop, so you don't have to guess if you're looking at the right thing. This is a really fun book. Before I looked at this book I was getting discouraged because the other two books seemed way too complicated and thus boring for my 8 year old son.NOT ONLY are the pictures and experiments great, but this book talks about SAFETY, it tells you what overall SUPPLIES you will need, for each individual experiment what SUPPLIES you will need, it explains--in a FUN WAY--how the microscope and other lenses work. ALSO, in the authors own words, &quot;THE MICROSCOPE BOOK is intended to teach children basic techniques and observation skills WITHOUT DESTROYING ANY LIFE FORMS.&quot;I commend the authors Shar Levine &amp; Leslie Johnstone and the Illustrator David Sovka."},{"Title":"The Microscope Book","review":"This larger format book contains a wonderful mix of colorful cartoon-like illustrations and full color photomicrographs of interesting projects for learning more about our small world.

I wish that I had had it when I was a child, enraptured by my first microscope. The book uses clear directions, specific lists of materials needed, accessible drawings and actual photographs.The first section, Lights, Lenses & Microscopes, explains the priciples of how a microscope works and why. It also covers how to measure and how to keep a journal of your findings. I wish that kids would read this section, but many may skip directly to the experiments in the next several sections. The book also has some safety tips, but parents should read those parts with the child so that they make sure that these are not skipped.The biology section shows ways to view plants, fish scales and other items. I liked the section on how to build your own microtome using a wooden spool, a carrot and a screw. The geology section is shorter but has some good ideas about looking at crystals. There are also short sections on forensics and fibers. The section on food and the environment include fun activities using mould, yeast and mushrooms.Each activitiy description is short enough to keep an older elementary-younger middle school kid entertained. The author puts in educational snippets that enlighten but do not overburden the young reader.This book is a fun introduction to the microscope that will encourage kids to explore more."},{"Title":"The Microscope Book","review":"This is an excellent book for kids learning about microscopes. It identifies the parts of a microscope and how to use one. It has a lot of well explained experiments (preparing all sorts of slides) for kids to do. There are photographs of what the slides should look like under magnification. The drawings and cartoons throughout the book make it fun and interesting."},{"Title":"The Microscope Book","review":"The Microscope Book. This is a book which could also be considered course, consisting of roughly 40 chapters- each which could be considered a complete lesson. For its size (only 80 pages including glossary and index) it is comprehensive of all aspects of microscopy- on the elementary to middle school level. It is well written and illustrated, with clear cut directions and explanations. This is the ideal book to accompany any student's first microscope. From making your own stage micrometer to hair, fiber and fingerprint identification, this book sets up an inspirational career path for any budding forensic scientist or microbiologist.

Jackson begins with a very brief overview of the development of Lunar and Stellar Magic, condensing in a few pages the journey from Syrian, Judaic, Persian, Babylonian and Graeco-Roman esoterica through to the Middle Ages in Europe. This provides a context for the next stage of the book, which discusses the philosophy of magick, and the alchemical process developed and practised by hermetic philosophers in Renaissance Europe.The next section of the book is devoted to consideration of the three-fold nature of the universe, and the seven great powers expressed through the angels and their attributions. This is supported by the inclusion of Jackson's English translation of 'De Umbris Idearum' (Giordano Bruno), of the seven images of each of the seven planets.The next chapter describes the 28 Mansions of the Moon, and provides examples of how these may be used to construct and empower talismans. Jackson then looks briefly at the Fifteen Stars (based on specific fixed stars), before discussing the daemon (or Daimon), and its role in the creative process.The book concludes with some practical rituals based on concepts described in the preceding chapters, and a select bibliography that will assist the reader to delve more deeply into subjects touched upon by the author.The illustration below (Saturn) is one of the many beautiful illustrations by the author to be found throughout the book.'Celestial Magic' will appeal to those who wish to learn more about the practise of magick, especially the purer forms that have been displaced in many occult lodges by later practises dveloped by the Golden Dawn, OTO and other similar Orders. It is not an easy read, but it is a book that I can thoroughly recommend to the serious student of the occult arts.'"},{"Title":"Celestial Magic: Principles And Practices of the Talismanic Art","review":"I'm not very good at reviews, but I just had to give another 5 star hit to this book. Having read different occult texts, Nigel puts aggripa's work into action as well as bringing other historical references into play. This book was exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"The Liberian Civil War","review":"Huband's book is essentially three very different ones on the same subject put together in one jacket. And it ultimately fails to win top marks due to this. Part one , based on his experiences is interesting and gives good eyewitness accounts of events behind rebel lines in 1990. However for those who followed newpaper reports closely at the time [and who like me have files full of Huband's articles] there's little new. Part two, his dogged investigation of the events leading to the war is excellent and I just wonder why the whole book wasn't written in this analytical style. The final part fails to inspire as it is based on the author's attempt to discuss the later events of civil war in the six years that followed the events he witnessed in 1990. A bold, though flawed attempt to explain the 1989-1996 civil war in Liberia. Huband's book should more realistically have been titled ''Liberia: 1990, the start of an African war''."},{"Title":"The Liberian Civil War","review":"Despite its plain, rather academic title, Mark Huband's book is not a comprehensive history of the war in Liberia. Rather it is highly personal, drawn from his own expererience of being caught up in the early part of the war -- a series of vivid, highly detailed snapshots of particular times and places, linked together with just enough basic history to knit them into a narrative. But it is also one of the first serious attempts in print to try to make sense of what happened in Liberia in the early nineties. As such it will be compelling reading for anyone who was in Liberia, or closely followed events there at that time.It was the essence of the conflict that it was dispersed and chaotic, and people caught up in it were isolated and ignorant of the whole. Once the fighting started, Liberia was a country without post or telephones, without newspapers, radio or television. Individuals knew only what was happening to them where they were trapped, but had no idea wha! t was going on five miles up the road. So Liberians are still trying to piece together the patchwork, fill in the gaps, and understand what happened.Mark Huband, who was then a young British journalist working in the region, had a grandstand view of some of the most dramatic events -- after being kidnapped in an ambush on a train, he was the first outsider to visit rebel territory and meet Charles Taylor -- so can fill a lot of gaps. He has also spent the years since nagging at some of the central mysteries of the war, such as those surrounding the death of the former President Samuel Doe. Was it pre-planned, and if so who by? Was Doe betrayed, and who was the traitor? I was there when the President was taken away to his death, but I still don't know the answers to those questions. This book helps bring us a little closer.I can't pretend to review this book from the point of view of readers who don't know Liberia. They may find it an absorbing and painfully vivi! d account of what happens to quite ordinary people when all! civilisation falls apart, and their country descends into anarchy around them. Or they may simply be confused. If so their confusion will be greatly increased by the false economy of the publishers who have not included any half-way decent map. So here's a good idea; why doesn't Amazon get some good maps and street plans of Monrovia, and sell them as a boxed set? It would make this book accessible to a far wider audience."},{"Title":"The Liberian Civil War","review":"I just finished reading Mark Huband's real-life horror story, The Liberian Civil War, and there were moments on the airplane this afternoon when I simply had put the book down. The tragedy of Liberia is not just that these terrible things happened, but that so little was done to avert them. For those of us who knew the Liberia that used to be, and have walked among ashes that are Liberia today, this book will fill in many of the details that survivors prefer not to recount. I salute Mark Huband--along all journalists who bear witness at great personal risk -- and who, when the smoke clears, take the time to tell us their story in the intensly personal way that Mr. Hubbard has done.Comment to the publishers: thank you for taking the risk on a book with such limited appeal.

The accompanying text in this oversized book is broken up into three sections that represent Frida's various art periods. The extensive introduction has the most information as he basically runs down the (low)highlights of Frida's tumultous life beginning with her early(polio) health problems, her traumatic accident, her marriages to Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, her lesbian affairs, her straight affairs, her deterioating health and ultimately, her death. Beginning with the section on Self Portraits we see many of her known and some lesser known photographs of her life and art pieces from private collections that apparently haven't made the exhibition rounds very much. Also included in this section are portraits of other people. These portraits cover three decades, beginning in the 1920's and extending to the 1950's. The section entitled Still Life is interesting because there are many included and since she seems to be most known for her self portraits it is nice to see this other side of the artist. Her still life work runs the gamut from the oridinary to the exquisite both in subject matter and presentation. Again the period covered is thesame decades previously mentioned but there are elements of her surreal period throughout. The final section is entitled Marginality and Modernism, it covers the same time periods but relies mostly on the 1930's and 1940's. Within this section many of her most &quot;out there&quot; pieces are included that some art critics labeled her Surrealism period. One of my personal favorites that I had the honor of seeing in an exhibition aa few years ago is included entitled &quot;The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth(Mexico), Diego, Me, and Senor Xolotl,&quot; 1949. This is a magnificent oil on masonite from the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection. Frida is holding Diego like a baby while she and their dog are embraced by several hands representing the unknown universe with spacey visual representation in the form of clouds and the red planet split with earth tones and a dark night vision of the universe on the other half of the canvas that engulfs them surrounded by cactus motiffs with dangling roots. My description does no justice to this superb piece of art; you have to see it for yourself. I guess some people cut up a book like this to mount the pictures in small frames but I like to look at the totality of the book, without missing pages. There are 80 large-scale full-color plates for your enjoyment plus many black and white photographs of her and Diego. The fact that the pictures are so large is one of best things about this book as you can see the details of the pieces. A perfect book for anyone just starting out and getting aquainted with the works(she produced over 140 pieces) of Frida or for any level of interest.

Some of the painting reproductions, at least in my book, are not of the best quality. Many of the color plates cover two pages across the face of the open book. Pages 6-23 introduce the artist with an interesting biography and vintage black & white photographs. Pages 24 - 111 are the plates, divided into 3 sections:1) Self Portraits (This section contains 16 portraits, 23 self portraits and 6 other paintings)2) Still Life (This section contains 12 of her most noted Still Life Paintings)3) Marginality and Modernism (This section contains 17 paintings and includes some of her \\"Surreal\\" works)Each section begins with an essay, written by the author, about that particular group of Kahlo's paintings. Each painting is also identified by: title, medium, date painted, size and current location.The author of this book, Frank Milner, has published many monograph's on artists, and he calls Kahlo \\"Brilliant and Charismatic\\"."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"There are two recent books that touch on this subject. Ms. Pringle's and Christpher Hale's \\"Himmler's Crusade\\". Hale's book is about the expedition to Tibet, which also occupies a large part of this book. Even so, go with this one. Ms. Pringle is an excellent researcher and writes very well. She avoids veering off and making mistakes about military affairs, a major weakness in Hale's book. In addition, this book goes beyond the Tibet expedition (a fascinating subject) and takes up additional matters regarding the group set up by the SS to examine racial-biological-political issues.

The book is fascinating. Like all good history, it contains lessons for the modern world: 1. It is dangerous to mix politics and science, and 2. Even \\"smart\\" people can convince themselves of almost anything, especially if it will win them credit with powerful people. Unfortunately, as one looks around the world, the same willingness to ignore facts for the sake of ideology is still rampant. I wish more people would read Ms. Pringle's book."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"While everyone knows something of the Nazi medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners, I did not appreciate the extent to which other areas of science were twisted and corrupted to serve Nazi ideology. It's sad to see the extent to which presumably intelligent people, professionals in their field, abandoned all the rigors of logic and the scientific method to satisfy their own preconceptions. \\"The Master Plan\\" is a fresh perspective on the Nazi abuse of science (especially archeology) in the furtherance of their favored (and, for the most part, bizarre) racial and historical theories. This is the only study of the Ahnenerbe (the elite Nazi research institute created by Himmler) that I've ever seen. The writing is a touch dry but the subject matter is compelling. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the Nazi period."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"This is not the first book about the mysterious branch of the SS called \\"Ahnenerbe\\". But it is the most well-written one and also the first book to present all the amazing Ahnenerbe expeditions abroad. These expeditions bring Indiana Jones to mind but are far more interesting than the \\"Indy\\" movies, as they took place in real life.As Ahnenerbe was to a great extent about motivating the pagan faith of the SS leader Heinrich Himmler and many early SS-officers the book is also about the relationship of the SS to the major religions. Both to buddhism (therefore the fascination with Tibet), hinduism (with its \\"Aryan\\" side), Islam (two SS divisions were largely Muslim) and Christianity (incompatible with true SS spirit according to Himmler).Had Nazi Germany been victorious the SS would have dropped its wartime acceptance of Christianity and would have worked hard on replacing Christianity with its brand of pagan faith. \\"The Master Plan\\" gives a really fascinating insight into what was actually done in the SS to promote the new/ancient faith, and what the SS planned to do about religion, had the SS won."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"In the bright daylight of modern day it's with some difficulty that one attempts to comprehend the horrendously monstrous things that the Nazi regime perpetrated against some of their fellow human beings. Everyone has read books or stories about the Nazi atrocities committed against the Jewish people, but Ms. Pringle's highly researched book really delves deeper into the \\"Final Solution\\" of the Third Reich and details the acts of the upper echelon of scientists and scholars involved in it.All through this book I was wondering what could motivate seemingly \\"normal\\" people to devise and even participate in these terrible events? This even seems to be the author's final question about her own research. Probably the most striking thing about these events and the people involved in them is the fact that so many got away cleanly and continued to live normal everyday lives, some even going on to great accomplishments in academia.For anyone interested in the WWII era or interested in the true underlying framework behind the Holocaust, I cannot more strongly recommend Ms. Pringle's book. Even for those like myself who have researched this area of history extensively, one can still be shocked by the almost unbelievably heinous motivations and actions of those who actually carried out the \\"Final Solution\\"."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"It is just possible that Heinrich Himmler was even worse than Adolf Hitler. This well-researched and equally well-written book tells the previously almost unknown story of Himmler's subversion of scholars, scholarship, and academic integrity in the pursuit of a justification for genocide. The author brings to light the story of the research activities sponsored by the SS in the attempt to create the mythology and folklore of the Aryan race. Archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnologists, and academics all put their own rise in Nazi Germany over truth and ethics. The remarkable expeditions taken all over the world, as far as Tibet, in pursuit of relics that were perverted to represent the purity and superiority of the Aryans, are described in thrilling detail. Of course, the outcome of all this research and pseudoscholarship was an intellectual rationalization for the genocide of Jews, and other so-called inferior races. The book is chilling as it makes us realize how far educated men and women will go to advance their own interests. It also shows that Himmler was planning to create an entire religion of Aryanism, that would eventually replace all other faiths in the Thousand Year Reich. Just when you think you have read everything worth reading about the Third Reich, a book like this comes along. A great read and worth every sobering moment"},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"The Nazis used anything they could to justify their rule and the primacy of the \\"Aryan\\" race. They used many aspects of science to prove this point, but twisted and molded these ideas to suit National Socialist dogma. Heather Pringle's book investigates and illustrates how various sciences were used to show that \\"Aryans\\" were the superior race. Heinrich Himmler, being the dreamer he was, tried to twist history(prehistory) to show that the Germans were meant to rule the world and that they in fact were responsible for all the greatness of civilization. He enlisted scholars of all sorts to \\"flesh\\" this out. Along the way he encountered charaltans and crackpots and even respected acadmeics to his cause. Pringle tells this ghastly story well, well qualified from her earlier book about Mummies. This story will repluse some, but the lessons it teaches are well worth reading, it has exposed another of the inhumane and incredulous facet of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"Here's a review of the book from the website of Helsinki paper, Helsingen Sanomat. Review written by Pirkko Kotirinta and with a distinctly Finnish flavor.... thought I'd repost as it provides a slightly different look at the book.Himmler was excited over Finnish Kantele .....Book reveals hushed-up cultural cooperationFinnish anthropologist Yrj&ouml; von Gr&ouml;nhagen met German SS leader Heinrich Himmler in 1937 at Himmler's home, along with German music researcher Fritz Bose. The scientists were led into Himmler's study, and they were surprised at what they saw. Hanging on the wall of the study was a copy of a photograph that had recently been taken by Gr&ouml;nhagen, of Timo Lipits&auml;, a Karelian runonlaulaja, or \\"poem singer\\". The photo, which had been given to Himmler a year earlier, hung over Himmler's desk as if it were an icon. Von Gr&ouml;nhagen (1911-2003) and Bose (1909-1975) brought new gifts from Karelia. The Nazi leader was especially enthusiastic about the kantele, a traditional Finnish stringed instrument. Bose played for him, and the kantele was given to Himmler, who immediately ordered ten more for the SS.Does this sound familiar in any way? The information is from a book by author Heather Pringle, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, which was recently translated into Finnish. The work by a respected Canadian writer of popular science touches upon Finland and the other Nordic Countries, especially the rock paintings in Sweden's Bohusl&auml;n Province, while describing in detail the activities of the Third Reich's Ahnenerbe research institute. The book is the most thorough account of the foreign expeditions of Ahnenerbe.Ahnenerbe, or Deutches Ahnenerbe, Studiengesellschaft f&uuml;r Geistesurgeschichte (\\"Study society for primordial intellectual history, German Ancestral Heritage\\"), was established in 1935 for the stated purpose of studying the legacy of Germany's Aryan forefathers. Its real purpose was to create myths. According to Pringle, its leading researchers dedicated themselves to falsifying the truth, and to churing out carefully tailored information to support the racial doctrines of Adolf Hitler. Pringle tells of the most imaginative arguments used to prove the glorious past of the Aryans. In addition to Northern Europe, expeditions were conducted in Tibet, Iraq, Greece, Libya, and Croatia. When the Second World War broke out, Ahnenerbe's work was co-opted for the war effort, and for solving \\"the Jewish problem\\". Especially chilling is the chapter on a skeleton collection, which tells about the mustard gas experiments by anatomist August Hirt (1898-1945) and his work for the establishment of a collection of Jewish skeletons.Pringle met Bruno Berger (1911-2004), an expert in race research, who took part in the Tibet expedition of Ernst Sch&auml;fer, and also took part in the establishment of the skeleton collection, for which he was sentenced as a war criminal. During their three-hour meeting in 2002 Berger never showed any pity or sympathy toward the 86 Jews whom he was sending to the gas chambers. Ahnenerbe was interested in Finland and Karelia in the early phase of its activities - specifically through the activities of Yrj&ouml; von Gr&ouml;nhagen, who was born in St. Petersburg. The young aristocrat, who studied at the Sorbonne, had decided to travel on foot from Paris to Helsinki, and to practice \\"practical sociology\\" on the way, by collecting greetings in his diary from people whom he met on the way. During his hike, Gr&ouml;nhagen made it to Germany. For him Germany immediately seemed familiar, because Gr&ouml;nhagen spoke the language, and hated communists.A Frankfurt newspaper published Gr&ouml;nhagen's article on the Kalevala, and soon a meeting with Himmler was arranged. Himmler also wrote a greeting into his travel diary: \\"Germans and Finns always remember that they once had the same fathers.\\" It is from this common foundation that the young anthropologist soon got a job in Ahnenerbe, where he rose to the leadership of the recently established Indo-Germanic-Finnish Research Institute in two years, at the age of 26. Gr&ouml;nhagen and Fritz Bose made a research expedition into Russian Karelia in 1936, taking along the illustrator Ola Forssell. Gr&ouml;nhagen returned to Karelia again in 1937 and 1938, alone both times. On the first trip, Bose had a brand-new AEG tape recorder with him, with a sound quality that was far superior to previous recording devices. Finnish researcher Risto Blomster says that this was \\"apparently for the first time in the history of the world\\" that a tape recorder was used for collecting folk traditions. Tape recorders became more commonplace in the 1940s.Gr&ouml;nhagen was among the directors of Ahnenerbe only for a few months. The new chairman of the institute, Dr. Walter B&uuml;st dropped him as incompetent. The focus of research moved from the north to the east, partly because Hitler preferred to emphasise the assumed connections between Aryan culture and ancient high cultures. The intense interest that Himmler felt toward the Nordic region as a target of research irritated Hitler: \\"It is bad enough that the Romans built magnificent buildings while our forefathers were still living in clay huts; now Himmler is starting to dig up these clay hut villages, and gets excited about every fragment of a clay pot, and every stone axe that he happens to find\\", Hitler once said to Albert Speer.Personally (and this is my own comment, not from the Helsingin Sanomat review), I find it interesting that, while there's so much criticism of the Nazi's and their \\"racial cleansing\\" and all the rest of it, very few readers and reviewers seem to realise that much of the Nazi's medical / eugenics theory and practice originated or was taken from from medical theory and practice in the USA in the 1920's. Much of what went on in the USA in the 1920's was almost as barbaric as anything that happened in Nazi Germany, the only difference being the industrial scale with which the Germans applied the theory during the war years."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"Heather Pringle's \\"The Master Plan\\" gives an excellent history of the Ahnenerbe, the special branch of the Nazi SS made up of some of Germany's leading scientists and scholars whose purpose it was to document the history and prehistory of Germany and the Aryan race. These scientists, often hand-picked by Heinrich Himmler himself, were intended to provide the historical and scientific justification for the Nazi's ideology and conquests. Much of this story has remained largely unknown and Pringle's work is the first book that provides a comprehensive account of this fascinating subject.Himmler was obsessed with the idea that he could validate the superiority of the Aryan peoples and the supremacy of the German \\"volk\\" by providing clear scientific evidence supporting these claims. Where such evidence was lacking, it could be invented. Thus was born the SS Ahnenerbe, a organization that operated under the guise of unbiased scientific inquiry by some of the leading German scholars of the day. The findings of the Ahnenerbe were used to justify the Final Solution and the sinister deeds of the Nazis as the German war machine steamrolled across the world. Pringle's book explores the lives of the many scientists who served the Ahnenerbe and the various expeditions that were undertaken in the service of the Reich. It was these very archaeological undertakings that partly served as the inspiration for the film \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\".Pringle's book also makes clear Himmler's agenda to alter the very fabric of German society, especially religion. Himmler was a passionate anti-Christian who believed that Germany should be returned to the pagan religion of their ancestors. To that end, he used the SS as a prototype for a future society that would embrace the beliefs and practices of their Aryan forbearers.Himmler understood that if you can control what people know and understand about their past and their ancestors then you can control the future of that society. History is written, or often RE-written, by the victors for a reason. The Ahnenerbe was created for this very purpose. It is an important piece in the complex puzzle of understanding the motivations of the Nazis and why they did the things they did. Pringle's book is an excellent addition to that understanding."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"Heather Pringle has done an exceptional job in writing this book. Her writing style is dynamic, interesting, and personal unlike the talent of many Holocaust book authors who are authoritative but dry. I consider this one of the top two books I have ever read relating to the Holocaust, and I have been reading about this subject for over 15 years. I am in awe of her research and ability to have gone so deeply into this subject. There is much to learn here not only about Himmler and the maniacal search for a source/invention for the Aryan Race, but grasping a real sense of the Nazi mentality in how they approached their cause in general. Ms. Pringle really delivers on her goal of sharing Himmler with the reader. Congratulations! I eagerly await her next book."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"Extremely interesting and thorough account of Ahnenerbe, Himmlers quasi-scientific organization that tried to prove their theories of human \\"history\\". Well written and entertaining while also historically accurate. I recommend this book to anyone, who wants to know where the roots of these theories really were. Nazis did not invent their racial theories but borrowed bits and pieces from several scientists and artists preceding the Nazi movement. You can also read it as a warning of how it is possible to twist science to political ends."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"A largely anecdotal account of the SS Ahnenherbe research project. Driven by the ideological fixations of Heinrich Himmler and other prominent Nazis, the Ahnenherbe was founded to validate the Nazi idea of Aryan supremacy by tracing Aryan supremacy thoughout human history and prehistory. This effort involved some truly strange ideas and unusual, to say the least, efforts. Examples include an expedition to Tibet to look for Aryan conquerors of Inner Asia and ethnomusicological investigations in Finland to recover lost Aryan religion. Some of the work of the Annenherbe was bound up with even stranger ideas such as the World Ice theory and Himmler's delusional search for ancient super weapons. Pringle also discusses the involvement of the Ahnenherbe in Nazi efforts to find a system for racial classification and the horrible crimes of the Holocaust.Pringle, an experienced science journalist, clearly did a significant amount of archival research for this book and some of the information is novel. Written well, this book is a useful introduction to the bizarre Nazi ideology. Pringle, however, is not a historian and this book has some significant shortcomings. This is not a systematic history. The later chapters on expansion of Ahnenherbe activities and involvement in the Holocaust don't provide the necessary context on the huge expansion of the SS during WWII. Nor were the individuals described by Pringle an aberration. The SS successfully recruited a substantial number of well educated and talented individuals. Similarly, understanding the Nazi racial ideology requires some context about 19th and early 20th century racism. While many of the ideas pursued by the Ahnenherbe were bizarre, they are easier to understand in context. The idea that you could recover crucial features of vanished prehistoric cultures by studying folk traditions was pursued by prominent mainstream scholars well into the 1960s. The idea that all civilizations have a single origin (diffusionism) was a legitimate 19th century scientific idea and not necessarily associated with racism (eg, Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki). Pringle also makes some minor factual errors."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"I've been a fan of Heather Pringle ever since I picked up The Mummy Congress and spent an entire day in Acapulco in my room reading it in preference to splashing about in the Pacific. This book is, of course, entirely different and concerns the efforts of Heinrich Himmler to establish a anthropologic/historical \\"school\\" called the Ahnenerbe to indoctrinate young Nazis by advancing the theory of the \\"master race\\" and tracking the history of advanced civilizations back to thier presumed Aryan ancestors.While Himmler's efforts were in themselves crackpot and gathered quite a few kooks along the way such as his assistant, former mental patient named Karl-Marial Wilgigut who traced his family back to the Norse god Thor, more interestingly is that many of the reputable German scientists of the day followed along either through fear of political censorship or quite possibley through shared beliefs.Throughout, Ms. Pringle pops up with interesting facts such as Hugo Boss' supplying of the Nazi uniforms and Ludwig Roselius' invention of decaffeinated coffee (sufficient reason in itself to dislike the Nazis.)This book is well worth the price particularly as it presents the acceptance of craziness and promulgation of insanity in modern civilization and deals with an area of the Third Reich which would otherwise be unfamiliar to most readers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"This book is pretty interesting if you like reading about the Ahnenerbe and Himmlers and others weird ideas on the origin on the aryan race.The book describes some of the journeys they undertook to explore the world to use it for their propaganda, like that the aryans had emigrated from Himilaya and conquered India and founded the caste system there. The book also describes a journey to a island in Norway, but Heather Pringle has got the name for the island wrong. She should have checked her facts better. The island contains a phallos and many old rock carvings. The oldest depiction of a man skiing is to be found on the island, and Ahnenerbe and Himmler wanted to show the world that the rock carvings was the worlds oldest (and aryan) language. One of the researchers in Ahnenerbe also travelled to the old norwegian rock carving field in Bohusl&auml;n, Sweden and took copies of many of the rock carvings there. Sadly, some rock carvings there was damaged because of this.The Ahnenerbe organization of the SS invented the technique of study and research groups made up of researchers coming from different intellectual disciplines, but all working on a common theme. This method is still used today with success, in practically all universities."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"As a librarian and researcher of this topic, I feel that Edward P. Rich's Pazyryk Agenda has more unbiased information to offer than Ms. Pringle's study.Mr Rich's discussion of Ahnenerbe is the more extensive in scope, comparable to the writings of George Lincoln Rockwell. A real understanding of both of these phenomena is not possible without reading it."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"These are the people who gave Nazis the \\"scientific\\" evidence for their ridiculous racial theories. But no one still has been able to explain how such a modern and sophisticated society of doctors, scientists, and thinkers could accept such beliefs as facts. Pringle has a large cast of intellectual villains pontificating their theories, to the captive audience of Germany. But, no German stops, just for a moment to think, how outside of the human ken it is. There has to be some-thing more to the mercenary drive to keep one's job, and move upwards in a profession, that drove these well educated to accept junk science. These German professionals in science, seem content to follow heard instinct in this matter. Just like the kleptomania that swept the German forces in every country they conquered; stealing everything that they could get their hand on. They gave the violent sadists in their society the scientific cover they needed. Or did they really believe the bunk they were postulating on? And to everyone's grief some of them simply got away with it, because there wasn't enough evidence, or people did not try hard enough to convict these animals."},{"Title":"The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust","review":"Although I enjoyed the read, by the end I was left somewhat disappointed by the content. The details of the Nazi occult belief system are glazed over. I understand that this is a difficult topic to get to the bottom of, and many have tried before, but the author seems more at home dealing with the external logistics of Himmler's strategy rather than explaining the ideology that lay behind. When reading of the primeval blond-haired master race I couldn't help thinking of the \\"Nordic\\" aliens who feature so regularly in UFO abduction stories and in alien conspiracy books, and how Nazi scientists appeared in Speilberg's \\"Taken\\" series working hand in hand with the little grey aliens on the operating tables. No doubt a respected journalist, such as Ms Pringle, would be disinclined to follow that line of thought, but I wouldn't put it past Himmler. He was also inhuman. But more to the point, why would Himmler, or Hitler for that matter, be so obsessed with tall, blond hair blue-eyed types when they so obviously did not resemble them? Did the thought not occur to the author? It must have."},{"Title":"Eyrbyggja Saga (Penguin Classics)","review":"Imagine a society in which someone gets really cheesed off about his neighbor and decides to bushwhack him, and maybe his whole family and his servants while they're at it. Forget the police, forget the army. There isn't any. If you're unhappy about this, you try to get your favorite chieftain to intervene. Of course you'd better have a whole bunch of armed followers to show that you mean business. You can bet the murderer will too as a matter of course. How you come off in this hypothetical society depends on how much influence you wield on your neighbors. If you're willing to go to bat for them -- and vice versa -- your power will increase. Unless, of course, someone decides to swing an axe at your hatrack in the meantime.This is Medieval Iceland in the 13th century, when this and all the other great sagas were written. The EYRBYGGJA is one of the best of the sagas -- provided that you can handle all the genealogies. (Virtually all the people in the saga were real people; and many of today's Icelanders can trace their families back almost 1,000 years.)If there is any hero in the EYRBYGGJA, it is Snorri the Priest. He manages to maintain his power despite several threats that unfold during the several generations of this story. At times, as in the case of the feud with Arnkel, Snorri seems to be in the wrong. But he is consistently faithful to his friends and therefore has no problem raising the forces to back up his position. His life bridges the conversion to Christianity in the year 1000: Snorri proves his adaptability by going from a priest of Thor to an advocate of the new religion. In all the Icelandic sagas I've read, most of the characters do not seem to be wholeheartedly committed to either the old or the new religion; but all are superstitious about the restless dead, which brings me to one of the most fascinating aspects of this saga: the ghost episodes that seem to proliferate. I particularly like Thorolf Twist-Foot, a disagreeable old man who keeps coming back from the dead and causing trouble -- which Snorri deals with in most inimitable fashion by holding an ancient legal proceeding called a &quot;door court&quot; to expel them.My only criticism: This book needed a good set of maps for following the action. The lone map provided is inadequate."},{"Title":"Eyrbyggja Saga (Penguin Classics)","review":"Eyrbyggja Saga is the most &quot;supernatural&quot; of all of the Norse sagas. Throughout the story, the Ere-Dwellers are confronted by death and disaster, which in turn result in ghosts, eerie occurrences, and hauntings. Eyrbyggja Saga was one of the best sources I located when developing my on-line article about Norse ghosts. There are &quot;shiver up the spine&quot; sections, and also typically droll Norse humor (such as one unique exorcism wherein the people being haunted drive off the ghosts by bringing a formal Norse lawsuit against them).

There's definitely more of the supernatural in the Eyrbyggja Saga than in the dozen or so others I have read. Angry ghosts, sinister omens, strange goings-on. This is the \\"Amityville Horror\\" of Medeival Literature. It's a short, quick read (the saga itself is 140 pages, set with relatively large type.) Some passages are smooth-flowing, very intense page-turners, and some sections seem choppy and confusing. I'll agree with another reviewer who said that the family relationships and intricate web of who's-fighting-who-for-what-reason are extremely hard to follow, especially in the first third of the story. The action is very violent; there's a lot of fighting for such a short saga. The main character, Snorri the Priest, is a mysterious enigma - he's intelligent, sly, and crafty. He plays \\"close to the vest\\" so nobody is ever quite sure what he's up to. Even the author is unsure of Snorri's motives.I have a few minor complaints with the editorial handling of this saga. The chapters have headings which tend to give away what happens. The introduction should have been an afterword, since it contained far too many spoilers which gave away all the surprises in the story. If you've read any sagas before, then I recommend skipping the intro and reading it AFTER you've read Eyrbyggja Saga. If you've never read any sagas, the first 4 pages of the intro will give you a bit of general background, but the rest of it is a plot synopsis and discussion of the saga in sections - best saved til afterwards, when it will be of more help in gaining closure and filling in some of the details of what you've read."},{"Title":"Eyrbyggja Saga (Penguin Classics)","review":"Eyrbyggja is a saga heavy on the supernatural. Characters do not always disappear when they are killed, but often return as ghosts to cause mischief, murder and, in one instance, to prepare a meal while stark naked! Hauntings, omens and visions of the afterlife are treated as part of the natural order of things.This is essentially a saga of the clans of early Icelandic settlers, especially of their feuds and disputes, over two centuries. The genealogies get very confusing. The translator includes a List of Characters in the front and A Glossary of Personal Names at the back. You will be constantly referring to these, but will still get your Thorbrandssons mixed up with your Thorlakssons and wonder which Thorgrim is which. This work must be a treasure trove for Icelandic historians and geanalogists. One of the delights of the book is the occasional weird name, like Thorstein Cod-Biter and Ketil Flat-Nose.This is not the courtly or romantic epic of the French or German culture of the same period. This is a narrative as hard, cold and bleak as the Icelandic landscape in which these characters struggle for survival. There is some black humor, and I guiltily confess to enjoying the story of the cowardly Scotsman. Speaking of Scots, this was Sir Walter Scott's favorite saga and might well have helped him to form the concept of the historical novel.This is a readable translation with some useful footnotes and a good introduction.

The pagan temple described is not organized in a Christian plan, and so is unlikely to be a back-projection of Christian practices onto the older pagans (the temple is structured more like the Parthenon than like Christian churches).

Wow, was I ever wrong. After starting with Vacuum Diagrams and then moving on to Raft and Flux I am totally smitten, I don't want it to end. I wish he had written a hundred Xeelee novels. I went out and bought all 9 books concerning the Xeelee universe except for Timelike Infinity which you can't find for under 35 bucks, but that's ok because I think there's a four volume box set coming out in the spring. I keep going back and re-reading the stuff in this one and am saving Resplendent for the very last. The ideas are mind-blowing. At first I was like, how can an author have the audacity to hop along a 5 million-year timeline? Then I grabbed his 'Evolution' with it's 65 million-year timeline just on our own planet and the rest seems totally sane.Maybe the coolest thing about the books to me is the lengths the human race go to in trying to defeat an enemy that isn't really their enemy but more of a conceit. It sort of parallels the Crusades in that way.Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone who is a lover of any fiction, speculative, fantasy, whatever, eat it up."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"and a good introduction to Baxter's Xeelee universe. For hard sci fi fans only."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"This book was a hard read. I couldn't put down the book once I started reading it. I had to re-read few of the chapters in order to keep some sense of the stories.As others have mentioned the book has big and bold ideas and one realizes the depth of those ideas only after the book is finished. Which is really strange because as you read the book jumps not just from location to location but between time periods."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I am an avid reader of science fiction but somehow Baxter had slipped under my radar until now. I picked up this book on a whim in the paperback section of a supermarket of all places! What got me was thatthe back cover claimed to tell the story of Mankind for the next 5 million years. I tore though this book, it was a great read. People are critical of his character development and it is something that he needs to work on but the ideas are so immense and engaging you can get past that. I see why it won the Hugo Award. It was the most fufilling SF novel I have read in years."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Its 'Future History' with a big emphasis on *future*. This is very much like Niven but the ideas are actually even larger and more in depth. If you want SF that your mind can chew on read this book...."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Great collection of hard-SF. Baxters ties his immense series together in an effective way, although some of the stories do drag on a bit. But after reading through this book the mind boggles... Easier to grasp than Asimov, not as well written as Clarke, but well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Vacuum Diagrams is a collection of short stories which are more or less related to the grand background theme that Baxter calls &quot;Xeelee Sequence&quot; - a vast vision of the history of the Universe spanning a period of 5 million years, depicting the rise, fall and rebirth of mankind and its participation in the epic battle between two vastly superior but incompatible life forms. There stories range from those that are light and entertaining (like &quot;The Xeelee Flower&quot; or &quot;Pilot&quot;), to stories that carry deep phylosophical shades (&quot;The Sun-People&quot;, &quot;Cilia-Of-Gold&quot;, &quot;Vacuum Diagrams&quot;) that rise questions about the role of intelligence, about destiny and fate, about logic and chance. Above everything else, the stories are deeply humanistic and show that we should value much more things that we take for granted. If you like Clarke, Simak or Heinlein, then I think you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I leave this book wondering how anybody could top it. It ends, literally, with the very last humans in the universe managing to leave the universe itself, through an artifact (the &quot;Ring&quot; of an earlier novel) thousands of light-years across. I don't think anybody will surpass the boldness of Baxter's imagination.A previous reviewer mentioned that the characters are flat. So they are, but I think that really doesn't matter in this type of fiction, which instead offers mind-bending ideas, exciting struggles, etc. However, I have other issues with the book. It took a second reading before I realized that the stories aren't really stories, but more like series of events. They end with some wild idea or image (that the people depicted are about 1/20,000 of an inch tall, for example, or that a character literally doesn't have a past). There is nothing that makes you care what happens next. Of course, the book alludes huge struggles between immensely powerful races, which would work well to advance the plot (see Lord of the Rings), except we don't actually see the struggle. At one stage in the sequence, humans vie with the Xeelee for mastery of the universe, but we never see that struggle. Instead, we see very, very minor, incidental events.Another qualm is that the science comes very close to hokum, at least partially, on a second reading. A computer driven mad by &quot;quantum loneliness&quot;? Baxter goes for the &quot;gee whiz&quot; without really earning it. The best hard science fiction (Benford's Eater, or Cosm, for example) doesn't just invoke science, it absorbs it and works within it. The result can create wonder, not just at the writer's imagination, but at the world itself.Telling stories set against a vast backdrop is not easy. Good examples that come to mind are Lord of the Rings, again, and perhaps Vinge's Fire Upon the Deep (some would include the original Foundation series.) Baxter gets the vast-backdrop part of it right, anyway.It is also not easy to link disparate short stories and novels into a coherent whole. The best example I can think of is Niven's Known Space series. Here, Baxter succeeds reasonably well. (Although I thought the final Observer was Michael Poole, from Timelike Infinity, not the pastless &quot;Paul&quot;.)Despite these faults, I find myself looking hungrily for my next Baxter fix. Perhaps that incredible imagination is really all you need."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Okay, his writing skill is nothing to be gawked at, but this is SF, not drama. The main talent behind SF comes not from plots or character development, but from the grandiosity and the audacity of the ideas. Baxter tackles morals and science ideas that he shouldn't have the nerve to try, and it comes off crystal clear. Although some of his science is vague, he is always careful enough not to put in too much as to downgrade the original idea, and although some of his ideas are copies (for instance, Sun-People is a distinct copy of creatures from Ringworld) these are only ever used as back-up for a more important point that he is trying to make. It is obvious from the reading that he is enjoying his bursts of creativity, and his respect for the diversity, will-to-live and the obnoxiousness of life is quite effective. I have read the entire Xeelee sequence, and Vacuum Diagrams is up there with them all, surpassed only possibly by the brilliant Ring (which will always remain his greatest work). For people who are looking for brilliant character development and ingeniously subtle plot; stay away from SF, try something like John Irving (if you can keep awake)."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"This review is purely on the condition of the (new) book received. About 10 pages have been bent inward and torn upon receiving the book. Somehow, the outside of the book is in pretty good condition, although not what you would expect from a brand new book. However, the condition of the pages inside (which can clearly be seen as torn and bent from the outside) makes me wonder if the book was in such poor condition prior to shipping. The other book packaged with it was in mint condition."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Vacuum Diagrams is a really good science fiction anthology. It covers from the year 2100 to 5 million, in humanities struggle across the stars. A great way to get into Baxter (I also suggest Evolution by Baxter for the same reason)"},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Not being a great writer myself I will let others do the plot summaries and simply state my opinion of the book.I consider Baxter one of the core group of hard science fiction writers however reading his books often feels too much like work...unlike Banks or Reynolds. Maybe its too much exposition on physics and too little character development. The balance between the two is off.All in all, a so so book."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I am not a SF reader by habit. Just now and again. But I loved this book. I read it twice (years apart). Not all stories are great, but those that are, really are. Not being a hard science type, maybe some of it went over my head. Fine.Some stories still stick in my mind. Lovely."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I place this one as middle of the pack Baxter. That makes it a very fine book. Whenever I read a Baxter book, my scientific background fills in a bit more. In the study of math and physics, some concepts are memorized equations and others are ideas expressed in mathematical language. As I understand more, I get to move things from the memorized box over to the idea box. Vacuum Diagrams helped quantum wave functions to finally click.That's the wonder of Baxter's story telling. The narative brings life to the math.As for the story, it is a collection of short stories bound together by a narative. The technique works amazingly well. It also gives a nice overview of where a lot of the other books sit in relation to the grand universal arc that runs through Baxter's books.Having read so much Baxter, I didn't have the wide eyed wonder that my first encounter invoked. I did, however, enjoy it enough that I missed some new episodes of Stargate (atlantis and SG1)"},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"cuum Diagrams throws us far into the vast expanse of space and time and won't let us return, though we shudder at the sheer enormity of its vision. It shows us this vision, the 4,000,000 year future of mankind, through short stories that are connected through a common narrator. Each one is exiting and awe-inspiring, taking us on journeys that show the advancement, and at times the degradation, of mankind.As we sail these great seas of time we are witness to many events and great happenings, all of heart stopping importance. We watch the conquering of the solar system, made possible through the use of enormous wormholes, whipping us through the fabric of space-time at unheard of speeds. We stand alongside those who resist the Qax invasion and watch as they tragically fall. We gaze at the impossible craftsmanship of the Xelee, masters of the universe, and then turn in fear as their nightships descend upon our worlds with a calculated efficiency that man is powerless to stop. We ride along with the battle arks, massive ships the size of our moon, equipped with gigantic weapons of war and filled with enough warriors to invade a solar system. And then our eyes fall upon the heartbreaking beauty of the Xelee Ring. Fabricated from the very material of the cosmos itself, it stretches a hundred million miles in to the black oblivion, ripping galaxies apart and pulling them into its core. This is where the mystery lies, at that bright point where all the universe is headed. Why have the Xelee built this audacious construct? And what purpose does it have in man's future? Immerse yourself in this spell binding novel, and maybe you will find the answers."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Difficult going at first with so many ideas and situations thrown at you that it seems a bit overwhelming. Stick with it, though. I finished this as I sat in the back of my truck on lunch break at a construction site and the words \\"wow\\" and \\"holy sh*t\\" came involunarily from my lips. The ten million year history is wrapped up in a sequence of stunning stories concerning the ultimate fate of humanity and the Universe, and it was a rush of sparking imagination with a wonderfully melancholy finish. I may have even wept. The scientific detail can get ridiculously esoteric at times, but the prose is solid as are the dialogue and characters. Excellent all around."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"First off, I the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because, like others have said in their reviews, character development is kind of lax. In Baxter's defense however, the story is told in little vignettes spanning 5 million years. Of course you're going to have to leave old characters behind and introduce new ones. In my opinion, he does a passable - but not outstanding - job of character development.You don't need a degree in physics or quantum mechanics to understand the concepts Baxter presents, but an &quot;armchair&quot; familiarity with these disciplines will help. Still, Baxter does a very good job explaining difficult concepts within the stories. The scope of the overall story arc is amazing and it left me with a very warm feeling and a little more optimistic opinion about Humanity's future. For a scientist come late to writing, Baxter has achieved far more, in my opinion, than most of his hard SF contemporaries."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"This novel is long, and it does get dry at some times, but some of the stories are remotely interesting. I liked parts of the book, (it's made of 23 short stories SB wrote and published in magazines.) but the characters were constantly being throw out, leaving you wondering: why? Overall, I use this book as a guide of what NOT to do to a character in a novel, but it also gives you an okay, and somewhat comprehensive idea of what quantum physics are about. Read Hawking's &quot;Brief History of Time&quot; for clarification on some points. I just don't understand what some stories had to do with the novel."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"When I first read stephen baxter's book &quot;Time Ships&quot;, I was very satisfied with it. It has grandiose theme and very intriguing. I expected the same when I bought this &quot;vacuum diagrams&quot;. But it seems that the quality of this title is not on the same class with &quot;Time Ships&quot;. Baxter is not good on characterization but technically he knows the science well. However, I can only browse half of this book since it is boring and dull, also the science description is long and heavy."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"This book was incredible. It's amamzing how he has tied in an entire history of our species for that span of time. It's one of the best books I've ever read by far."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Baxter's main work is called the \\"Xeelee Sequence\\". It is a story of the future of the Universe, which Baxter tells in 4 books: Raft, Timelike Infinity, Flux and Ring.Vacuum Diagrams is the fifth book of the series. It is not a one-story book, but a set of 21 short stories chronologically placed. The first one is set on year 3,672 and the 21st happens some time after year 4 Million.The 21 stories are snapshots of the future, logically linked to the main concepts of the Xeelee Sequence. In general, each story presents new and creative sci-fi concepts.If you have read and enjoyed other works from Baxter, you will surely like this book. If you haven't read him but are a Clarke (or even an Asimov) fan, you will probably enjoy this, too.Notwithstanding my 5 star rating, I must warn you of two issues I had with this book:- Its style, with so many short stories, that are linked in time and in concept, can be tiring. On sci-fi terms, its like turning on a hyperdrive to move to a new galaxy, take a look at it and when you're beginning to understand what's it all about, you have to jump again. You are always left wondering about so many details and ramifications of each story. It can frustrating.- Maybe because of this, I found the book became a little bit tedious when I got to story 18 (Shell). It took me a while to regain my energy and read the last 3 stories.I don't think it will be fair to get into details about the Xeelee Sequence, but for those who are curious about it, here are some of its main concepts:- Around 3000 AD, humankind develops new technologies that allow it to travel quickly through space. The solar system is colonized.- As the human civilization expands, it finds many different and curious forms of life in planets and satellites.- Eventually, humanity is \\"conquered\\" by other galactic races, for some time. However, Man is persistent and resilient and gets its freedom back.- Through all the time, humankind and the other galactic races are somehow obsessed about the Xeelee, a mysterious, ancient and very powerful civilization that has technologies far beyond what the rest of races have.- The Xeelee are so developed that they manipulate stars and planets and build a huge \\"Ring\\" somewhere in the Universe. The ring has such a gravity field that stars in its vicinity look blue.These are just some of the basic premises of the Xeelee Sequence. I am surely missing some key elements. Hopefully just with what I wrote here you will be compelled to try any book of the Sequence. If you're into sci-fi, you wont be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"PROS: Vast scope of ideas, steeply based in science, epic qualityCONS: Writing style is a bit dryBOTTOM LINE: Great collection of related stories.BRIEF SYNOPSIS: A collection of related stories set in Baxter's Xeelee Universe.The memorable things about Baxter's stories are not so much his characters, nor his writing style, which is a somewhat stiff, but rather his ideas. Each story contained in this collection contains some form of scientific concept that defies any simple comprehension due to sheer scale, large and small. Sometimes travel spans universes, sometimes beings are microscopic in size, and sometimes artifacts are light years wide. Baxter's signature hard science is present here in a big way.The stories average 14 pages in length but are packed with all these ideas. Many of the stories, spanning 5 million years, reference the same events or reference each other, which is always a secret thrill for a science fiction reader.One huge plus in Vacuum Diagram's is the Xeelee Sequence Timelins listed at the back of the book. This makes it prerequisite reading for anyone wishing to dive into Baxter's 4 Xeelee novels (in Xeelee Universe order: Timelike Infinity, Raft, Flux and Ring)."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I have read several of Stephen Baxter's novels, and this collection of his short fiction (including sections from several of his novels) is by far the best way to be introduced to his ideas. Stephen has a real talent for formulating mind-blowing ideas based on hard science. What he doesn't have a talent for is developing characters. This book gives you an overview of his ideas, without boring you with his characters. It is all plot and exposition. The only way that I would improve this would be to lose the redundant stories about how marvelously adaptable life is."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I hope you read this review first.When I was halfway through the book I was eager to write a book review. I would have given the book a 2 out of 5. In all fairness, I decided to finish the book, then write the review. I felt the book was disjointed, that the author often became tired of writing and filled pages with random thoughts just to finish his work. At the same time I was amazed at the technology mentioned. This brought the author to a 2 out of 5 instead of a 1 or 0.I kept reading. I'm too cheap to spend 8 bucks for a book and not finish it. I'm glad I didn't throw the book away. When I finally finished I was stunned. This is the first book I've read by Stephen Baxter, but it will definitely not be the last.I've read science fiction all my life. I was underwelmed by authors such a Ray Bradbury and exceedingly impressed by Zindell. None have ever gone as far as 'Vacuum Diagrams'. This book is an epic masterpiece encompassing the history of man as a footnote. The bigger picture covers 30 billion years and an ancient race trying to save the universe. I don't want to blow the story line so I'll just say, \\"If you like SciFi and Tech and you're not a dumby, read this book.\\"I've long finished the book and have done something I NEVER do. I read it for a second time.I can't wait to read more books by this author. I hope they are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"It was absolutely unbelievable. Baxter had me convinced that it actually happened. This man's storytelling ability is unparalled. I am an avid Clarke and Asimov fan, but this tops the cake, even better than his previous masterpiece Ring, if you never read another book the rest of life, read this one."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"Not for Stephen Baxter the piffling concerns of most science fiction this is a man who goes for the big picture. A set of stories which reveal the past and future history of not just mankind but the whole universe itself until the stars dim and go out!I confess I have found some of his books pretty hard going (Raft, Flux etc) but this is much more digestible, a lot more fun and you don't need a Phd in quantum mechanics to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I truly enjoy science-based science fiction, and Stephen Baxter is one of the few writers who applies the latest discoveries and theories in particle physics to his novels. The only drawback is his story telling. Which leaves much to be desired. He can tell you about cosmic strings and inspire awe in you and a new way of looking at humanity and technology, but he really doesn't have a good grasp of the art of keeping a reader interested in the characters or the plot development. What carries his stories, (I have read 6 of his novels thus far)is his grand visions of the galactic struggles and technological advances. His visions of aliens are the most realistic and logical. They don't just have horns and an extra eye and limb, they are truly fundementally different from carbon based life forms. Some aren't even made of baryonic matter, they are made of Dark Matter. What's also great is that by the end of his novels you actually can grasp &quot;Dark Matter&quot; vs &quot;Baryonic Matter&quot;. I recommend Stephen Baxter despite his shortcomings as a story teller just on the merits of his science based stories. Hopefully he'll improve in his future novels."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"10/18/063.7/5.0 starsOverall this is a descent book that mostly flows pretty nicely, and it's a pretty easy read besides some of the physics. From what I've read on other people's reviews this book is a collection of short stories that spans time(from the beginning to the end of the universe), so you are usually introduced to a new set of characters each chapter, but that didn't really bother me. the book starts out around 3000 AD and describes mankind's exploration of the solar system and the strange but interesting life that they encounter. The first few stories are very good which gave me high hopes for the rest of the book, but towards the middle the quality of the stories start to decline, especially the story about an experiment that involves abstract mathematical concepts about an unhappy AI being trapped in a miniature universe. He doesn't do a good job explaining the basics of the mathematics involved in certain stories. Although he does give simple definitions for some of the physics terms he uses, and that helps a lot, there are some terms and concepts he made no attempt to really explain to the layperson either because he doesn't feel like describing in depth the mathematics and physics involved in a way you can understand or he doesn't fully understand it himself, after all he is talking about complex mathematics and physics scientist's may be contemplating thousands of years from now. Some times he briefly mentions some things that seem like they'd be pivotal to the epic of mankind. For instance, he says that humans spread out through the galaxy and conquered many alien species yet he doesn't tell any stories about that other than just mentioning it. Instead he tells a couple of tales that seem sort of irrelevant like the tale about a group of people who tend a giant tree(I recommend that you skip this story). Any way some of the middle stories aren't that great in my opinion but it starts to pick up again towards the end of the book."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"This compilation of Baxter's short stories comprising the Xeelee Sequence is awesome in scope, but at times too heady. For me the book began to pick up steam with the last few stories, when there is a nice balance between plot and science lesson. This is real HARD SF! Baxter knows his physics and quantum mechanics, and uses them bravely throughout the book. It's not an easy read, but, if anything, will leave you contemplating its many themes and ideas."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this. Perhaps this is some new writing style but I find it tiresome and it makes me long for better use of my time. I've read earlier Baxter that was a lot better, these stories are rambling, incoherent, hallucinatory. There's a gee-whiz wowzo quality that makes me wonder if what I'm reading is intended to be made into a video game. If I had bought a physical book I would take it to a store and trade for some old Silverberg. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"If you've read Baxter's other works in the Xeelee Sequence (Raft, Ring, Flux) this book is worth reading, if just to flesh out the universe (humans DID survive after the Xeelee left!). But be warned: several of the stories in this book are actually chapters in other books. And I find Baxter's &quot;hocus pocus&quot; approach to mathematics annoying. A stupid idea doesn't get better after several paragraphs about some principle of physics."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I started backwards. I think I should have read first this book and then gone to Flux, Ring and other Baxter's novels, but I started by Ring. I specially liked its first chapter, and then I discovered it was originally a short story, contained in this book.I have to concur with other reviewers: I like the science in Baxter's books, even if sometimes he is too dense. The four stars come from this. Sometimes the main interest lies not on the plot, but in the ideas presented.Why should you read it? Standalone, it is interesting. In the Xeelee Universe, this book gives the background to others, through its short stories. I finally understood why the Xeelee Ring is associated with a human name, and some other details about the Xeelee and other races."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"I recommend this book. I have read half so far - I am taking my time to savor it, like a gourmet meal. I have read one other book so far from Baxter (The Timeships). Folks, science fiction is about ideas, less about plot and character development. (I would say Baxter is weaker than Asimov and better than Clarke on those accounts.) Baxter delivers what I look for in science fiction: awe-inspiring ideas, a solid foundation in real science, a life-affirming attitude, and clean plots (no hollow thrills from pornography or senseless violence). If you are inspired by science and would like to be carried away into a grand vision of the future of the universe and mankind's place in it, get this book."},{"Title":"Vacuum Diagrams: Stories of the Xeelee Sequence","review":"A collection of stories set in Baxter's 'Xeelee' future history, where humans get to fight multiple powerful alien races over short and vast distances, and likewise for timeframes.

There's a linking narrative (which means a boatload of italics, which is incredibly annoying to read, as usual, when it is more than a few lines).

The formation of the League was a good idea, until the United States decided to not enter and Brazil dropped out due to not being represented on the Council. The formation and initial history of the League showed it could arrive at positive things such as relieving tension in a conflict. The downfall came when the dictators started goobling up states and disregarding the protests of the member states. First, elements of the Japanese structure seized Manchuria from China. Then Italy took over Ethiopia. Finally Germany remilitarized the Rhineland and took over Austria. The crowning achievement was when a late League member invaded Finland. The League was all but dead at that point, and little more than a debating society.This a nice interesting history of the League of Nations.

In Ashlaw, Captain Gray's widow and his daughter Linden strive to simply survive. The two female Grays turn to the wealthy Humbert family as a means of subsistence with Linden making a point to charm Alex.Linden easily captures Alex's heart and soul, leaving her sister Margot to wonder why since the amoral chit is not a devastating beauty. When a villager dies in an apparent accident, Margot believes Linden is involved and subsequent events sends Alex scurrying to Africa for solace. Linden seems not in least perturbed by the desertion of her boyfriend as she simply turns to Margot's rich lover as her next conquest.A HINT OF WITCHCRAFT is an enticing work of historical fiction that brings the post World War I era into vivid display. The story line centers on the interaction between the charcaters with Margot's belief that Linden is an evil witch causing much of the action and reaction. Dark and foreboding, this fabulous tale is an amazing character study that includes a fascinating look at a 1923 English village that will bring much acclaim to Anna Gilbert.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Hint of Witchcraft","review":"This book is NOT about your traditional spell casting witch in the black pointed hat. It hints at the witchcraft that subtlety surrounds us, its lies, deceit, omission and just plain not doing anything. This reads more like a Jane Austen Novel. There is no Main climax, rather a few smaller ones that build into the resolution of the Main Characters' (Margot) state of mind. Anyone can have this story by looking back and weaving all the threads together that point to a specific outcome or result.I really enjoyed this book, the pacing was steady, and the characters were interesting. It had the feel good ending that I know we all hope to achieve."},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"Peter Braestup's book on the reporting of the Tet Offensive is a critically important book to read for those trying to understand the effect of reporters' all-too-human bias on what information the average citizen has available to him or her, as well as for those looking to find out not only what went wrong in Vietnam, but what the United States and its allies (including South Vietnam) did right - an aspect still all too overlooked.Though it is critical of some particular newspeople, as well as some politicians and military spokemen of the Vietnam era, the book is highly constructive in tone. Many of the lessons pointed out by Braestrup two decades ago have clearly been taken by the media, judging by the general improvement in war reporting during the current (as of fall, 2001) events in Afghanistan.It is also a must read for those who question the abilities of democratic states to defend what they believe in.Braestrup lays bare the notions of the time that the allied forces - from ARVN to the U.S. Marines, were not effective, or that they were a corrupt force for undesirable ends.An added bonus is that Braestrup is a gifted writer; his prose is readable and engaging, and his research is thorough and well documented. This book deserves to be brought out in a new edition (though I did buy mine through the Amazon's used book marketplace, and received excellent service there)."},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"A thorough critique of the press coverage of the Tet Offensive. Amazingly, the press almost universally got it wrong. The U.S. and the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) actually won the battle; the Viet Cong were decimated and never recovered as a fighting force (The regular North Vietnamese Army shouldered the major fighting from then on). It took the NVA (North Vietnamese Army) four years to build up enough strength for another major offensive (1972), which led to the Christmas bombings of Hanoi and the \\"peace accords.\\"Written by a journalist, this book is critical but not ideological; the press is not \\"the bad guy\\" here. There is plenty of blame to go around. The military misrepresented the strength of the Viet Cong, for its own reasons, and the press went on to misrepresent the battle for its own reasons. The real heresy of this book is revealing how the ARVN and U.S. forces aquitted themselves exceedingly well on the battlefield. Was the war \\"winnable\\" on the ground? It certainly wasn't \\"winnable\\" politically, but credit should be given to the servicepeople on the ground (and in the air) who did in fact win the battle tactically and strategically.The original edition was published by Westview Press in 1977; Yale University Press issued an abidged version in 1983 and 1986; another edition was published by Presidio Press in 1994."},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"This book was a real eye-opener for me. As a Vietnam veteran who served in Vietnam in 1967-68-69-70 and 71, I had always held fast to the premise that media coverage of Tet 68 sabotaged the possible successful conclusion of the Vietnam war in our favour. I had always believed that the american press had deliberately skewed their war coverage towards the negative side.Braestrup's well documented study of press coverage of the Tet 68 offensive made me re-think all my knee jerk attitudes towards the press.He presents meticulous summaries of coverage by the major american newspapers and television networks. While some individual papers and networks might have had an anti-war bias most tried to give balanced coverage.When Braestrup gets into the logistical details of the in media coverage of the war, he really enlightens us. It's easy in hindsight to assume that todays wall to wall coverage of world news was the norm in Vietnam. Braestrup shows us in great detail the limitations in personnel and technology that constrained media coverage of the Vietnam warIf you read his analysis, compiled from his own in-country experience with an in depth analysis of most major news outlets reporting from Vietnam during the war, you as a reader are enlightened and forced to rethink your own pre-conceived notions about the subject.I found this work one of the most illuminating works of modern history that I have even read.It's interesting just from Braestrups first hand retelling of his own part in history as a practicing journaslist. His analysis of journalistic coverage of the Vietnam War is incredibly stimulating and educational.I highly recommend this work to war correspondents, editors and journalism students interested in getting war coverage just right.John Reid"},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"\\"Big Story\\" is the recounting of how the \\"American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington\\".I would dearly love to be able to say that author Peter Braestrup concurs with my long held conclusion that the American media were all left-wing, sympathetic to Communism and knowingly lied when they reported that the American and South Vietnamese military victory over the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in the 1968 Tet offensive was actually a disaster.In fact, while Braestrup does meticulously report what many might consider the misdeeds of the press in their reporting on Vietnam, he concludes that it was a mixture of factors that led to media's ultimate reportorial failure. He is, of course, right. General William Westmoreland was not a paragon a virtue when it came to dispensing the facts. The military staff assigned to liase with the media, Braestrup demonstrates, was essentially inadequate in many, many ways. Then there was the dynamic duo of Lyndon Baines Johnson and Robert McNamara who believed they were military and political geniuses and were neither.Though published decades ago, Braestrup informs the present day. American media has become more stridently left-wing and more intent on misleading and misinforming the public while pursuing their own political and ideological goals.Baestrup tracks the trajectory of the competitive press corps in Vietnam, particularly the television people who were coming into their ascendancy. For the TV people, images mattered, not facts. They needed material to engage eyeballs, not minds. It was logical that the images be violent even though they didn't tell the true story. The news anchors weren't objective readers of facts: they were advocates of the America as the oppressor theory and they echoed the shouts of the people clogging the streets with their protests.Braestrup concluded his analysis of the media's performance by calling it \\"an extreme case\\", but warned as well - and bear in mind this was in 1977 - that \\"unsatisfactory performance [of the media] in another surprise crisis or near-crisis appears likely\\". What Braestrup did not foresee was that the media, led by network television, would get into the business of manufacturing crises and that the media's tilt toward the left would become more pronounced. Peter Braestrup passed away in 1997. It is our loss that we did not have his insight on the performance of the media in Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns. It undoubtedly would have been enlightening.Jerry"},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"I just finished this book in the last couple of days. Excellent all the way through. Carefully crafted examples of what was right and WRONG with the media coverage of the Tet 68 Offensive during the Vietnam war, and the war overall, show the problems with the reporting: in some glaring cases, the bias. I specifically could relate to recent conflicts the comments made about the speed of a story from the start of an event to publication and how that sometimes led to the wrong analysis and conclusion.The perceptions set forth by the media, either deliberately or by editing mistakes, to the population were in cases wrong and led people in a path to make decisions based on faulty information. For a long time I wondered if my opinions and own analysis of the Vietnam conflict were ill conceived. This book put those concerns in their proper place: even though it was a terrible event, maybe the US could have been done with it sooner and with a better result for all had the true facts, as the media could gather, come to light for the general population instead of an inherently flawed approach with a lot of bias added.Given that the book was written by a Journalist in the middle of it all gives great validity to the book: yesterday, today, and tomorrow."},{"Title":"Big story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)","review":"How could LBJ forget the blunders of a limited war established by the mistakes of Harry Truman in Korea in less than 12 years? The author outlines all of the questions that cannot be easily answered. How do you end a war once it started? How do you justify the costs in blood and money? And How do you define victory? The writer seems to say, Limited War is like Marriage, easy to get into and hard to exit.

The press never did \\"turn against the war\\": it reflected the growing opposition of the U.S. public to the war, lagging behind them, rather than leading them. The idea that the press fooled the American people into thinking we \\"lost\\" those engagements instead of \\"won\\" them is absurd. What the Tet attacks did was highlight the fact that the American military was lying to the American people about our progress -- both political and military -- in winning the war. The American people decided that the war simply wasn't worth the loss of American and Vietnamese lives that it entailed. Whether traditional war advocates like Col. Harry Summers were right in terms of our history of \\"winning every battle\\" is simply irrelevant. War is waged militarily, but it is won politically, a truth which we have again been taught in Iraq and Afghanistan when our disastrous failure to learn the lessons of Vietnam (or misinterpret them, as Braestrup does) led us once again into unwinnable political territory. Braestrup's study is both discredited and sadly out of date, and shouldn't be invoked in contempory debates."},{"Title":"Ethics in Information Technology","review":"This text is highly reductionist.

Though there have been a few success stories regarding women on the scene and behind the scenes of the Hip-Hop movement, women's place in it have been, for the most part, invisible, degrading, and kept to a minimum. In Gwendolyn's Pough's exciting new book, Check It While I Wreck It, the assistant professor of women's studies at the University of Minnesota examines the dysfunctional relationship between Black women, feminism, and Hip Hop.The book commences with a history of Black women in the public sphere who have contributed to the betterment of African-Americans such as Angela Davis, the historical Black clubwomen, and women who were trailblazers in the blues music industry. Pough reveals how Black women laid the foundation for future successes for the entire race. Pough writes \\"Black women were major players through Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and the Black Power movement.\\" In fact, because of their exclusion, the author even suggests a re-writing of history.Later the author gives us a more recent history of women's contributions to the arts and Hop, including Sylvia Robinson, the label owner of Sugar Hill Records, break dancer Baby Love, and female rapper Roxanne Shante. The book gives major props to Grammy-winner Queen Latifah, Sista Soulja, MC Lyte, and poet Jessica Care Moore.Pough also critiques the products of popular culture such as movies like Boyz N The Hood and Just Another Girl on the IRT, books such as Sista Soulja's The Coldest Winter Ever and Omar Tyree's Flyy Girl, and of course rap records such as L.L. Cool J's I Need Love, and Latifah's U.N.I.T.Y.The book is best when examining the problems that exist between women and Hip-Hop, from the objectification of women in music videos to the acts of hyper-sexual rappers such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown. Pough writes \\"Today, in addition to the old images of the sexually promiscuous Black women...we have the bitches, hos, stunts, hoochies, pigeons, chickenheads, and baby mamas put forth by Black men rappers. The need to struggle against stereotyped images is still present.\\" Let's hope this book will keep the discussion that invokes change alive.\\"Check It While I Wreck\\" is a thoroughly researched, erudite, and culturally relevant work that is virtually impossible to put down. Reminiscent of the writings of bell hooks, this scholarly work in feminist theory and Hip-Hop culture is destined to be an instant classic taught in college lecture halls across the country."},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"Unfortunately I must disagree with the other reviewers in that Pough's book is a history of women in hip hop. It is actually much more than that. Check It While I Wreck It is mainly a discussion of black women in the public sphere and questions how black women are portrayed not only in hip hop culture but in black culture. The author asks the reader to review some of the things we as women love so much about hip hop and ask how much these things have influenced today's young women. She gives her own reasons of why women have a hard time breaking into the hip hop culture and engages in the age-old question: can black women uplift themselves and embrace their own culture without the emmasculation of black men. With that said, if you are looking for a history of women in hip hop, this may not be your best source. However, if you looking for a study of black womanhood as a culture and its evolution, this would be a great choice."},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"When hip hop made its debut onto the urban scene in the 1970s, most saw it as a fad that would eventually fade into oblivion. Some thirty years later this culture, essentially born from urban decay, with its eclectic mix of rap music, poetry, dance, dress and attitude, has become universal.In her new book CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT, Gwendolyn Pough, assistant Professor of Women's Studies at the University of Minnesota, highlights some of the contributions of noted female rappers to hip hop and explores their impact on the evolution of the genre.Dr. Pough explains the phenomena of \\"bringing wreck\\" a catch phrase often used in hip hop circles, as a form of praise, to describe \\"skill and greatness.\\" The author uses this terminology to ascribe to the ways in which various female rappers; from the lyrically raunchy Foxy Brown and Lil Kim to the socially conscious Queen Latifah and Lauren Hill have brought \\"wreck\\" to the world of hip hop by causing \\"disruptions which somehow shifted the way black people were viewed in the society at large.\\" The author further expounds on the theory that the hip hop culture has the power to \\"affect change and bring wreck in a meaningful way\\" and exhorts female rappers to recognize the tremendous possibilities of hip hop and use it as a force for good.CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT is a thought-provoking, enlightening read which affords all readers a window into the world of an often misunderstood, yet extremely popular culture. At the core of this book is the author's call for female rappers to continue to \\"bring wreck\\" to the hip hop world, as they strive to carve their own niche in this essentially male dominated culture.Reviewed by Autumnof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"\\"Wave ya hands in the air and shake\`em like you just don't care.\\" These are words often used to hype the crowd for hip-hop concerts around the country. I found myself singing the same tune as I read this remarkable tribute to African American culture, hip-hop and feminism. Pough does an exceptional job of researching the roots of black women in the hip-hop phenomena, which has swept the world and become embedded in its very foundation. The hip-hop culture is broken down and explained through the lens of black women detailing how it has changed and how women are viewed. She traces the rhetoric of women in all hip-hop genres: urban literature, rap & soul music, development of the spoken word, and black film. The essence of the title, Pough explains is how black women bring \\"wreck\\" which is a form of praise to describe the \\"skill and greatness\\" of the lyrics.Do you know the great women of hip-hop? You should take the time to sit down with this account of rap legends - Roxanne Shante, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo Yo, Salt-N-Pepa and many more. You will learn about Sylvia Robinson, the owner of Sugar Hill Records, break-dancer Baby Love, and poet lyricist Jessica Care Moore and Sista Soulja. Pough uses the work and dedication of these women to help readers understand how women are portrayed in hip-hop. She reaches back to Sojourner Truth preaching black power and equal rights use then leaps forward to Queen Latifah performing socially conscious rap and Salt-N-Pepa exuding sexuality in their breakout lyrics. From the stereotypical roles of \\"mammy\\" to the present day images of \\"chickenhead\\", black women have used rap music to outline their life, reconfigure their identities, and breakdown the historical stereotypes and negative images that male rappers have constructed.Pough has provided the world with a well-researched, provocative account of hip-hop culture and the women who have added to its success. Readers can relive the development of hip-hop and sing the songs, remember the films, dances and slang made popular starting from the early 1970's to the present. This is a must-have book for every hip-hop lover, feminist, or African American studies student/department. The issues discussed in this book will provide hours of discussion for anyone who reads it. Pough has brought \\"wreck\\" to the area of academia.Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"Gwendolyn Pough has done something that many would have never thought could be done she wrote a delicate yet interesting academic book on an era that many seem to think will faze out hip hop has been with us for three decades or more hip hop has continue to thrive even when things that had nothing to do with it where use it against it but Ms. Pough takes it even farther she takes it to a point where most will tell you don't exist she breaks it down and tell you how woman yes I said it woman not just any woman but black woman step in and made their selves known in hip hop even though other hip hop scholars deny that ever being.Gwendolyn takes you back to the days when working the turntables was a way to perform, rapping was a way to be heard, graffiti was a way to be seen because the state didn't want to have a performing arts curriculum so the black youth found away to allow their culture to thrive without the help of those who were educated to teach them these things they didn't need anyone to tell them what was the correct note or the proper way to do a dance the generation of that time was determine to make something of their selves and to say that this culture as Ms. Pough considers Hip Hop continues to grow so does other aspects of it from Rap to the Urban gear we see not only is it baggy jeans anymore we now see our young black brothers sharply dress in a three piece suite courtesy of Sean \\"P Diddy\\" Combs, brothers are wearing GRILLZ in their mouth because of Nelly, and last but surely not least women artist aren't afraid to take the stage because they have seen Missy, McLyte, Mary J Blidge, Queen Latifah, TLC, Salt N Pepper those ladies before them do it and they are determine to do it their selves I mean if you look at it Missy Elliott she is doing big things from producing to running her very own company. You can't tell me that hip hop has not arrived and that the black woman didn't help it arrive I mean woman are playing important roles in hip hop movies I know you all saw Brown Sugar where Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan are representatives of hip hop she is a part of it just as much as he is but no man will ever tell you hip hop is represent like it is black and white / man and female but Gwendolyn Pough has no problem telling you the truth behind the culture we know as Hip Hop.After reading the book I sat back for a moment and really thought of what Ms. Pough said and her book now for me it was easy to accept as a young black woman working in the hip hop industry as a radio personality I see it all the time some black female artist trying to go up against whatever fella that's on the corner rapping its nothing to see a sister battling it out to maintain her place in the game they will get raunchy with their words and say something that you wouldn't expect but they will do what it takes to stand with the fellas because they know what its like to be in the male world of hip hop. So I stand give Ms Pough a applause for her dedication and hard work to make today's world understand that woman have a place in every culture even hip hop."},{"Title":"Almost everything you wanted to know about American watches and didn't know who to ask,","review":"This paperback, thoroughly researched and written by collector George E.

Oil Trade covers a gamut of issues from oil exploration to investment to consumption, but two matters stand out by virtue of their originality and their vast implications. First, Hartshorn argues that the Seven Sisters and the Texas Railroad Commission administered prices much better than do the OPEC states. You didn't see Exxon and Mobil hurling abuses across a conference table when they ran the show; all intent on making money, they succeeded quietly and effectively in carving up the market. But OPEC states, as sovereign and political entities, could not do this (think of Iraq and Kuwait). Failing to cooperate, OPEC lost control of the market. Hartshorn's argument suggests that in the long term the consumer gains from OPEC's nationalization of its oil industries in the 1970s-certainly not the way it appeared then. Second, he emphasizes the &quot;central paradox&quot; of the oil business: consumers are racing through the high-cost oil (in places like the United States) and avoiding the low-cost oil (in the Persian Gulf). Implicitly, everyone who invests in producing energy outside the Persian Gulf gambles that the Saudis, Kuwaitis, and others will continue not to flood the market with huge amounts of inexpensive oil. If they did, their oil would drive everyone else's out. Hartshorn sees this situation rendering prices inherently precarious, but thinks the gamble a good one for the Saudis et al. have little incentive to overturn the apple cart.Middle East Quarterly, June 1994"},{"Title":"Bringing Life to the Stars","review":"This book covers one of the most important moral subjects facing humanity-and other life forms-the next few centuries.

I don't know which was more grating: the lack of information or her insulting tone throughout the book.

Or why you should never walk under a ladder. And what about the number 13? Superstition still plays a part in our lives whether we wish to deny it or not, and reason does not always conquer instinct. Philippa Waring has done an admirable job of cataloging the world's most prevalent superstitions, and explains how and why they developed. Turns out that ladder is to be avoided because when it leans it forms a triangle, symbol of the Christian Trinity. It was considered disrespectful to walk through it, and suggested that your affinities might lie with the Devil! This is no boring, pedantic dictionary.

It is just for fun so don't get too wrapped up in the meanings. Unless they work! Knock wood!"},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Omens and Superstitions","review":"For once this book has nothing to do with a GoodReads giveaway. It is merely a random book picked up from the ether. It's worth noting that I started this one with the intent of reading it straight through. This is fairly unusual for a reference book but since I have recently instituted a policy of reading three books at a time it made some amount of sense. One book in the current reading pile, according to the new scheme, should be easily consumable in tiny interruptable bits. This was that book.As a book to be read straight through this is fairly unacceptable. It's redundant, unentertaining and pretty poorly organized. To this my diligent reader may say, simply, \\"duh, it's a dictionary\\" but it goes beyond that. When I was a child I read the dictionary and it's not all that terrible. There is, at least, a sense of variety. Waring's definitions all have an infuriating sameness to them that makes one grit ones teeth and turn the page with increasing hopeful vigor as time goes on.However, as a reference work it has its shortcomings as well. Since I've read through the first third of the book in its entirety I can tell you that it is, at times, inappropriately self-referential. If one is going to be using a book by randomly hopping into the middle bits looking up superstitions related to the word \\"badger\\" then phrases like \\"as stated earlier\\" and \\"as we said before\\" are rather nonsensical. It seems clear the book was written in some sort of order which doesn't match up well with the order of use. There is also a problem with organization in that some entries are not sufficiently self-referential. Terms which are typically considered synonymous bear strikingly different information and do NOT refer to each other in any way. So the results of any reference depend at least in part on luck and choosing the exact right word. Lastly, the book is terribly dated. Despite its publication date in 1997, most of the entries appear to date from the 70s.In summary, this book is going on my shelf for later reference but I'll remember the lack of organization and work a bit harder at using it when its use is required. Not the best dictionary ever but better than nothing."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Omens and Superstitions","review":"This book contains information about superstitions on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order. It would take too long to mention everything this book contains, but I was fascinated by it. Some of the superstitions were ones I'd heard before, but much of it was new information. There were a few that puzzled me because they were the opposite of what I'd heard before. For example, the entry under Black Cat said, \\"Perhaps the most famous of all superstitions is the belief that a black cat crossing your path will ensure good luck.\\" I've always thought that black cats were universally considered bad luck, but the book is British, so perhaps the superstition is different in Europe. Many of the superstitions described in the book are European, although there are also plenty from the U.S. and some from other areas of the world."},{"Title":"To Save Her Dream: A Mission of Duty, Friendship, And Justice","review":"To Save Her Dream is the most \\"reader-friendly\\" book I've had the pleasure to read. The author supplements his very readable account of his struggle to preserve a friend's historic horse farm from urban sprawl with a website that provides voluminous background material and updates on the continuing battle. This makes it easy to delve into additional material or pass on it at the reader's desire, and it helps answers every reader's question about every true story, \\"I wonder what happened after the book ends?\\"At its simplest level it is tale of friendship between a younger man and an older woman who join forces to preserve a romantic piece of land against the forces that would rape it. On a more sophisticated level it details the complicated legal dance forced upon the man who just wouldn't say \\"uncle\\" to government pressure and urban development. Far from being a victim, the author mounts a serious challenge after the woman's death to the government's reliance on the power of eminent domain to take away the private property of a devoted naturalist. The legal challenges this non-lawyer mounts to the statutes of fraud and limitations are written in very understandable fashion that make these dry laws comprehenisble to the reader.This fascinating account of a modern-day David standing up to the government Goliath will inspire both environmentalists and proponents of individual rights. This description of a non-lawyer fighting through the courts to preserve history from development will hearten the reader on some pages and sadden her on others.The author gives the reader one last gift with his musings at the end of the book on a path not taken. This makes it especially fun to consider the possibilities for the farm, the author, and his friend had the author made few different decisions earlier in life."},{"Title":"Reap the Whirlwind: Augusta in the Revolution : A Novel","review":"I have to be up front and say that since historical fiction about early Georgia is so rare, I am heavily biased in favor of all books that deal with this subject. I can only think of three other books that are set in early Georgia: \\"Rascal's Heaven\\", \\"A Lesser Form of Patriotism\\",Rascals' HeavenA Lesser Form of Patriotismand \\"The Hornet's Nest\\". As a matter of fact, it this book very similar to \\"The Hornet's Nest\\" in style and content. That said, \\"Reap the Whirlwind\\" was a good book. Anyone who is interested in the American Revolution will find it interesting simply because it deals with the southern aspect of the conflict. This side is rarely encountered in historical fiction. Most works about the Revolution tend to be centered around the New England and Middle Colonies."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"Reviewed by Ernie SchreiberAn interesting book about Islam. I am not versed in theology; however, I have read Gibbons' The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and gleaned enough about Christianity from it to allow some comparisons. There is the common thread of feudal rulers and the religious leaders supporting each other in order to keep the masses under their thumbs. Emperor Constantine is one good example.One must say that the author has presented the problems with Islam in a way which makes it possible for those unfamiliar with theology and the dogmas of world religions to understand the problems created by the constant, continuing efforts of the clergy to hold sway over the general public's opinions and create a readiness to fight for the various superstitions without regard to their well being, lives, and health (physical and mental) and that of their fellow human beings.Most if not all religions are attempts by a priest-caste to exert power over and exploit the ordinary people, the \\"masses,\\" the \\"unwashed.\\" They always suppress independent thinking and scientific research because they know that knowledge presents a danger to their power.There are many similarities between the Christian religions and Islam, but the basic approach to enforcement is the same: threats, torture, and killings of all those who disagree with the religious leaders. There are also similarities with factionalism. The eastern orthodox (Greek branch) of Catholicism vs the Latin branch (Roman) Catholics which often turned quite violent, not unlike the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam although Christianity was more civilized and worked from within existing and somewhat orderly societies whereas Islam attempted to unite and lead a band of brigands and made them stop fighting and destroying each other by re-directing their killer instincts toward those not part of their own group.The author draws attention to these basic facts by showing how they are reflected in the \\"holy\\" books (Koran) where the faithful are directed toward unifying rituals and enforced prayer routines. As with all religious (\\"holy\\") books, reasoned thought is condemned and adherence to dogma and repetitive reading of meaningless texts are encouraged and enforced in order to deaden independent thinking. After Martin Luther's reformation movement stirred up criticism of the Roman Catholic church, the power of all the churches started waning and their total power never recovered. Islam ought to go the same route, which seems to be the only way to make it bearable.The final chapter gives a list of progressive Islamic thinkers who were always persecuted but who had the right idea how to attain a civilization of Islam. It shows that improvement is possible, but there is yet a long way to go, a way that must go through an educational system that is liberated of religious dogma.Although the rational thinker will have come to similar conclusions already when observing the current upheaval in the Middle East and in the world of Islam, this is still a very interesting book and well worthwhile perusing, indeed."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"Excellent review of Islam, the philosophy and the practical implications that lead to 9/11.One major consequence - IRAN SHOULD BE DISARMED OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS before we face a horrible consequence, an apocalypse 10,000 more lethal...."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"Has this guy even studied history?

Life liberty and pursuit of happiness is not in the Muslim vocabulary. What is in their vocabulary is to dress like a 6th century savage and live like him too. That is the extent of Muslim prosperity. The Arabs do not hate America because of our policies, they hate us because they are jealous of our superior intellect, period!

The book is easy to read and jam packed with FACTS. I have not found any unsubstantiated statement in the book. Yes, the author is a bit harsh in his tone but after 9-11 who can blame him.I have learned about the nuts and bolts of Islam from this book and I have decided to check up on Mr. Tulbure's documentation. I found that the author did his homework well. I suppose to major drawback is in that he ignored the &quot;politically correct&quot; mindset of many people which are indoctrinated with the &quot;PC&quot; mentality by none other than the mainstream media. So I can see how people may react harshly to this book, seeing how people are as fanatical about being PC as are Muslims and others of their religions. It would be fair to say that being &quot;politically correct&quot; is a form of fanaticism and perhaps almost a religion-like dogma so mane people have embraced.All I can say is that this book is for the open minded and those who want to know the true nature of Muslim mentality.Tatiana Mikelov"},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"Tulbure makes a thorough study of the totalitarian nature of Islam. He even goes as far as to compare the impact of monotheism on human rights versus polytheism and atheism. For all those who still wonder why Muslims hate so much the west I recommend reading this book. There is a whole chapter dedicated to this subject.Winwoods Reade said; ?A sincerely religious man is often an exceedingly bad man? This fact applies to no one more than to Muslims. Here is the proof:?When you meet the unbelievers, strike off their heads; then when you have made wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives.? (Quran47.4).&quot;And when the sacred months are passed, kill those who join other gods with God [i.e. moshrekin.] wherever ye shall find them; and seize them, besiege them, and lay wait for them with every kind of ambush: but if they shall convert, and observe prayer, and pay the obligatory alms, then let them go their way, for God is Gracious, Merciful.&quot;(Quran 9:5)And as for Christians and Jews who rejected him he has this to say:&quot;Make war upon such of those to whom the Scriptures have been given and believe not in God, or the last day, and who forbid not that which God and His Apostle have forbidden...&quot;( Quran. 9:29)These are the injunctions of Muhammad?s Gracious and Merciful God. How can a ?good Muslim? disobey these explicit ?divine? mandates? And how can one who observes them be a ?good person?? This is the question that sincere Muslims must ask themselves. I am not insinuating that there are no good people amongst Muslims. Good and bad people are distributed in equal proportions in all nations. Yet in Islam good people are often forced to do bad things and go against their conscience. They often convince themselves that in this apparent injustice there must be a hidden wisdom that they do not understand and that God knows better. Many good people who claim to be Muslims are often ignorant of true Islam and dismiss the real orthodox Muslims as hard-liners and fundamentalists. But as Solomon Tulbure in ?Islam Exposed? points out, unlike Christianity, Islam does not leave room for leniency and tolerance. Islam and fundamentalism are synonymous terms. You have to break the laws of Muhammad, just to keep your humanity and be good. No amount of intellectual acrobatics performed by Muslim apologists can justify the intolerant and ruthlessness of Muhammad?s religion.?Islam Exposed? is worth its weight in gold. Tulbure's book by far is the best source I found on Islam. He tells the truth and pays no lip service. The book?s only flaw is that it is not translated into the language of people who are victims of Islam. I am sure that will be taken care of too.Islam was established through force and bloodshed. No argument, no reason, no logic was ever given but the blade of the sword. Masses were kept in ignorance. Muslims have no knowledge of Quran and are not aware of its naivete and inhumane character. Should they read Quran in their own language and understand it, they would be disappointed to see the book, far from being a ?miracle?, is a hoax; poorly written, full of errors and bereft of beauty.Islam has silenced all voices of reason throughout the history. But now is a different time. The Internet, although strictly censored in Islamic countries, is becoming accessible even to Muslims. Freethinkers can write and publish without the fear of persecution. I foresee that ere long, the same devout Muslims will turn their back, against their religion and will endeavor to liberate the rest of humanity from the claws of religion in general and Islam in particular.Tulbure talks about ?Arab Imperialism and Islamic Colonialism?. He explains eloquently how through Islam, many civilized nations lost their identity, their dignity and humanity to bow in front of a savage god of a bunch of uncultured Arabs and follow the wimps of a fanatic and schizophrenic bloodthirsty madman of Arabia. Islam is the enemy of science, of freethinking, of reason and of human rights. It acts as a powerful break on the advancement of civilization. Tulbure keenly points out that ?Islamic Civilization? is a contradiction in terms. You can either be Islamic or civilized. In another place he argues that also ?Islamic Philosophy? is a contradiction in terms, because philosophy was regarded as a ?foreign science, which led to heresy, doubt, and total unbelief?. Brilliant minds like Zacharia Razi and Avicenna never believed in Islam and were attacked by Muslims. More recent intellectuals and freethinkers don?t fare better. For example Ali Dashti, the brilliant scholar and the author of ?23 years?; a book written about Muhammad and his 23 years of prophetic life, was incarcerated while in his 80s during Khomeni?s rule and died in prison.Ex Muslim"},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"A bag of lies, written with the sole intent of giving Islam a black eye...Certainly not a work of decent art."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"At first I thought the author is simply a hateful person.

The research that was done in order to intelligently portray the religious slavery of Muslims is highly concentrated and vast . Also portrayed in the book is what the author considers the antiquated belief system of Islam and how it has remained stuck in the Middle Ages due to the superstitions of a populace who refuse to integrate into a modern society. Tulbure has bluntly exposed Islam for which he may very well suffer the consequences. Whether these consequence are to bring fame to the writer for what will be considered by many readers as a literary masterpiece or suffer the fate of Salmon Rushdie, only time will tell.The book is very well written. Undoubtedly it will eventually attract the attention of many talk show hosts in the media. (Bill O'Reilly take note) Anyone who has ever wondered whether Islam is a religion of peace or barbarianism should read this book. President G.W. Bush has told the world that Islam is a religion of peace. I suggest that the author send a number of copies of his book to the White House for the president and his staff to read. Many other people will also naturally point out the cruelties depicted in the Bible and portray them as being no worse than those in the Qur'an or in Solomon Tulbure's book.If the readers of Tulbure's book want to know they can help to alleviate religious stupidity, I wrote a book on religious rationality and common sense, called &quot;Transcendentalism: A New Revelation&quot;. It delves into how a modern society can integrate their spirituality in a way that makes sense. In this 21st Century, the Age of Technology, we are still plagued by religious beliefs that may be a contributing cause of terrorism, killings and wars between nations. Belief in a God who causes catastrophes, punishes people, and who created the universe out of nothing as if by magic was brought about by hysteria and superstition. This thought process needs to be reassessed and brought up to date. Open-minded people must use common sense to determine whether this God was incorrectly perceived, misinterpreted and misunderstood by the masses of a bygone era.Kurt Kawohl"},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"I don't know if it is him or not, but someone claiming to be him has the same comment for every book on the muslim world.&quot;This book leaves out much to be desired.

Islam: Sex With Babies and Animals is OkayHere are a few excerpts from the book of Islam's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khomeini:\\"A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby. However he should not penetrate, sodomizing the child is OK. If the man penetrates and damages the child then he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life. This girl however does not count as one of his four permanent wives. The man will not be eligible to marry the girl's sister.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990\\"It is better for a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin menstruation at her husband's house rather than her father's home. Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990\\"Young boys\\" are apparently not off-limits, either. When it comes to the rewards in heaven Muslim men will receive, some of the rewards are young boys for them to enjoy in sexual ways:Koran, 52:24: \\"And there shall wait on them [the Muslim men] young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls.\\"Koran, 76:19: \\"They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who will seem like scattered pearls to the beholders.\\"Ayatollah Khomeini also wrote about sex with animals:\\"A man can have sex with animals such as sheeps, cows, camels and so on. However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm. He should not sell the meat to the people in his own village; however selling the meat to the next-door village should be fine.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990\\"If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow, a ewe, or a camel, their urine and their excrements become impure, and even their milk may no longer be consumed. The animal must then be killed and as quickly as possible and burned.\\" From The Little Green Book, Sayings of Ayatollah Khomeini, Political, Philosophical, Social and Religious with a special introduction by Clive Irving, ISBN number 0-553-14032-9, page 47Muslims sometimes also practice animal sacrifice. In the Hadith, Mohammed actually suggested it as one of three possible treatments for lice Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 503.) However, today it is practiced as part of a ritual called the Zar. According to Samuel M. Zwemer, F.R.G.S., author of The Influence of Animism on Islam, the Zar is practiced all throughout the Muslim world (and even within non-Muslim religious traditions in Africa). The Zar is basically an exorcism of mischievious demons that possess people. Unlike Christian exorcism, which involves asking God to cast out the offending demon in a battle between good and evil, in Islam, the demons are asked to leave and to take pity on the victim \\"in the right of the Prophet.\\" Although this form of \\"devil worship\\" was denounced by Mohammed as a minor form of polytheism, in Islam it is only considered a minor offense and not at all a rejection of Allah. The Zar is a very elaborate ceremony of pagan origin that culminates in the sacrifice of small animals such as chickens and roosters and the drinking of their blood as they are being killed.I will simply let the above speak for itself. If Islam is peace as president Bush said, then I choose chaos because Islamic peace is not my ideal and vision of peace. The next time Muslims attack America and kill thousands or millions, President Bush should remember that the Muslims are only trying to impose Islam's version of \\"peace.\\""},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"Review of Islam Exposed by Lynne H. SchultzIf you liked Dr. Solomon Tulbure's earlier book, G. W. Bush Is a Moron: Islam is NOT Peace, then you ought to love his latest offering, Islam Exposed. It is more than four times longer, and it presents a much more detailed look into the dark side of Islam. There is also substantial new information on Muslim reformers and apostates. Although a few of the chapters will seem familiar, Dr. Tulbure has expanded most of those to include new material, and he has also added several all-new and even more exciting chapters.Several chapters cleverly expose the false claims of literary, numerical and scientific \\"miracles\\" in the Koran. In spite of the teaching that Muslims must seek out knowledge, Islam Exposed shows that most Islamic writers and apologists are quite often very ignorant of modern science. Islam, as it is practiced in most of the world today, appears to be trapped in an earlier era, without the benefit of the western advances during the Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment. Little has changed in Islamic culture over the past 500 years.As the book suggests, part of the problem may be that Mohammed is not just the founder of Islam, but is also considered to be the perfect moral role model. But of course, considered in the light of modern moral values, he is not that at all. Dr. Tulbure uses the Koran, the Hadith and other documents to expose just what sort of person Mohammed really was.Over 40 pages have been added on the status of women in Islam, and its surprising connection to modern forms of slavery in the Muslim world. In those pages, Dr. Tulbure gives us a detailed look into the abominable lives of many Muslim women. That chapter, \\"The Slavery of Women in Islam,\\" is truly one of the gems of Islam Exposed.Another real gem of Islam Exposed is the chapter on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. Most of those pages are dedicated to a thorough, objective, but easy to follow, history of the entire conflict from the 3rd millennium B.C.E. to modern times. Most people would be quite surprised to learn that this battle did not begin in the 20th century, but thousands of years earlier. This chapter alone would make an excellent book, disclosing just why this conflict appears so intractable.A central theme throughout is the struggle within Islam between democratic values and the oligarchic forces of Islamic theocracy. It explains how and why political Islamism has managed to marginalize democracy-loving Islam reformers, and what can be done about it."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"I'm afraid this book was published for purely political reasons, by someone attempting to fuel the flames of anti-Islamic bigotry.

I am not versed in theology; however, I have read Gibbons' The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and gleaned enough about Christianity from it to allow some comparisons. There is the common thread of feudal rulers and the religious leaders supporting each other in order to keep the masses under their thumbs. Emperor Constantine is one good example. One must say that the author has presented the problems with Islam in a way which makes it possible for those unfamiliar with theology and the dogmas of world religions to understand the problems created by the constant, continuing efforts of the clergy to hold sway over the general public's opinions and create a readiness to fight for the various superstitions without regard to their well being, lives, and health (physical and mental) and that of their fellow human beings. Most if not all religions are attempts by a priest-caste to exert power over and exploit the ordinary people, the \\"masses,\\" the \\"unwashed.\\" They always suppress independent thinking and scientific research because they know that knowledge presents a danger to their power. There are many similarities between the Christian religions and Islam, but the basic approach to enforcement is the same: threats, torture, and killings of all those who disagree with the religious leaders. There are also similarities with factionalism. The eastern orthodox (Greek branch) of Catholicism vs the Latin branch (Roman) Catholics which often turned quite violent, not unlike the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam although Christianity was more civilized and worked from within existing and somewhat orderly societies whereas Islam attempted to unite and lead a band of brigands and made them stop fighting and destroying each other by re-directing their killer instincts toward those not part of their own group. The author draws attention to these basic facts by showing how they are reflected in the \\"holy\\" books (Koran) where the faithful are directed toward unifying rituals and enforced prayer routines. As with all religious (\\"holy\\") books, reasoned thought is condemned and adherence to dogma and repetitive reading of meaningless texts are encouraged and enforced in order to deaden independent thinking. After Martin Luther's reformation movement stirred up criticism of the Roman Catholic church, the power of all the churches started waning and their total power never recovered. Islam ought to go the same route, which seems to be the only way to make it bearable. The final chapter gives a list of progressive Islamic thinkers who were always persecuted but who had the right idea how to attain a civilization of Islam. It shows that improvement is possible, but there is yet a long way to go, a way that must go through an educational system that is liberated of religious dogma. Although the rational thinker will have come to similar conclusions already when observing the current upheaval in the Middle East and in the world of Islam, this is still a very interesting book and well worthwhile perusing, indeed."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"By Molly MartinAbsorbing read Recommended 5 starsThe ReviewThe publication is a work of 27 chapters over 361 pages.

Chapter 13: The Omnipotent God? Chapter 14: Islam on Human Rights keeps up the work as Dr Tulbure broadens his scope into the principles offered in Islam.I found Chapter 15: Islam: Women, the Inferior, Evil Creatures of special interest because I am a woman.

Author Tulbure has an excellent understanding of how to the hook the reader, draw them into the work then hold their interest from first paragraph to last page. Often documentaries tend to be dry, dogmatic or argumentative. Write Tulbure has avoided these pitfalls. Careful attention is given to details, using quotes from Islamic writing to provide a basis for his statements and a reluctance for sensationalism.This is not a book to rush through, or read piecemeal. Rather it is a carefully wrought work meant to be read over a period of time with ample time allowed for the reader to assimilate, ponder, perhaps check some of the references and to really inculcate the knowledge Dr Tulbure would like to impart to those who use his book."},{"Title":"Islam Exposed","review":"\\"Islam Exposed\\" is a very well written book about the Islamic belief system. It chronicles the history of Islam, the deplorable human rights violations, and the resentment towards other faiths and western culture.Islamic Extremists will be angered by what they read. The author is very brave to have written this book.For Islamic Extremists, religion governs politics and society, and with it, a fanatic refusal to evolve/modernize. What the reader is shown is how dangerous and brutal a society becomes when religion has all of the power. Rape, torture, forced marriages of girls as young as 9 years old are documented. Women are viewed as inferior(basically slaves) with no rights. They are considered property not human beings.This book was not written to encourage hatred for the Muslim World. It is the complete opposite. Dr. Tulbure states: \\"I do not condone violence against Muslims as a solution to anything...\\"\\"it is morally wrong and not something a civilized person would consider.\\"\\"Muslims are not the problem, Islam is the problem, and it must be fought with pens and keyboards rather than swords or guns.\\"Also, Dr.Tulbure does not support conversion to Christianity. I totally agree.What the author seems to envision is evolution/modernization of Islam. That is, a seperation of Government and Organized Religion: an establishment of democracy where all have the same human rights, that is, slavery, torture and oppression are abolished. Also, the author mentions the many Muslisms who are striving for this.I believe the author is a strong proponent for peace and equality.

It is the classic work on the subject -- highly regarded by folks such as Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, and Thomas Paine (former administrator of NASA). When this influential book was first published, it changed a lot of minds throughout the world.Is human colonization of space achievable even with 1970's-1980's technology? Could it be profitable on a global-economic scale? The author thinks so and tells us why and how; and his credentials are impressive.The author, Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill, was a tenured professor of physics at Princeton and one of the founders of the Geostar Satellite Corporation (a company that worked on implementing GPS satellites). Many of the conclusions in the book are backed up by actual experiment and by numerous studies done both within and without NASA.This is one of the handful of books that have helped to shape my outlook on the future of mankind -- a strong statement reserved for an excellent and influential work.-- Brooke P. Anderson"},{"Title":"High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space","review":"This book is amazing. This 3rd edition has two parts: the first is the original text by the late Gerard O'Neil, one of the great visionaries of the 20th century. Though things did not develop in the time scale he hoped for, his message is as valid today as it was in 1980 -- or even more so. The second part of the book is a series of chapters by contemporary leaders in the aerospace industry, and provide a fresh, modern perspective on where we've come since O'Neil's day, where we need to go, and how to get there.The emphasis of this book is more on what we need to do, why we need to do it, and what that would be like, than on the details of &quot;how.&quot; Other books cover the &quot;how&quot; in more detail. But because of the focus of this one, it is easily read by anyone; no special technical or math skills are required.After reading only part of this book, I did some web searches and found that the concept of space solar power (which is central to O'Neil's thesis) is still very much alive today. NASA did a new study on it just a couple years ago, and it has been discussed in Congress increasingly often since then. It is a very real concept, very nearly ready for implementation. Read this book to find out why it's so very important."},{"Title":"High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space","review":"O'Niell's writings (the first 12 chapters) are as well written and exciting as ever. His vision of how humanity should enter space is unsurpassed, despite now being some 25 years old.The additional chapters don't seem to add too much. I was hoping for a good description of where we've got to, and how things have changed. For example, in O'Niell's time, the richness, number and accessibility of Near Earth Asteroids was not known, but there is little in the book on the how these could be used to make O'Niell's original vision easier to fulfill. Likewise, Tether technology could reduce Earth launch costs and bring the vision closer to reality. None of this is covered.John Lewis has a good section on Space Law, but to see new ideas from him, you have to read &quot;Mining the Sky&quot;Overall, if you've never read The High Frontier, this book is an excellent buy.

Although his timetable of such colonies by the 1990s turned out to be too optimistic, this book is very much worth a look, both for historical reasons, and also to see what will happen once the price of access to space drops.Packed with technical detail, O'Neill's plan is based on two assumptions - that the price of access to space would drop, and that the price of energy would rise. Neither came true in the early 1980s. The Space Shuttle did not make space flight cheap as promised, and low energy costs did not make space based solar power economical.

And it is even more fascinating to see how those challenges can be overcome by simply expanding into a world where there are no limits: the Space.O'Neil and his followers convincingly explain how profitable economic exploration of the inexhaustible energy and mineral resources of space is possible and how that will help to solve the problems on Earth itself - and, as a side effect, lead to space colonization.Indeed, &quot;The High Frontier&quot; is not just a book for space enthusiasts: I would also recommend it for businessmen who want new ideas for tech ventures with *real* prospects for long-term profit - not the trendy fairy tales of Internet and biotech businesses that are quickly consumed in their own self-generated enthusiasm."},{"Title":"High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space","review":"I read this wonderful book as an undergrad in the seventies.

Gerard K. O'Neill -- what a breath of fresh air! His audacious, technically-grounded vision, can-do spirit and embracing human compassion, here and in his book of futurism2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future (Touchstone Books (Paperback))changed how I and many others viewed our world's possibilities.O'Neill liked to give students this puzzle: arrange six matchsticks on a table so they form four triangles. Impossible -- until you discard the unnecessary assumption that they must all stay on the table. (Answer: a tetrahedron.)In 1969 O'Neill gave his advanced students a much larger mind-expanding question: \\"Is the surface of a planet the right place for an expanding technical civilization?\\" He was actually surprised how easily they solved technical and engineering issues of designing practical *free-space colonies*: slowly-rotating cylinders, etc. miles across, each with about 10,000 people living in comfort with normal Earth gravity and oxygen levels.The gloom-and-doom crowd just lacked vision or were intellectually lazy: when you discard the unnecessary assumption we must stay on our tiny planet, \\"Limits to Growth\\" virtually disappear. Unlimited energy streams by, easily captured with collectors miles wide -- in weightlessness and vacuum they can be just aluminum foil and silicon with minimal support. There is enough material and all the necessary elements -- metals, silicon for solar cells, oxygen, even carbon and nitrogen on occasional asteroids similar to \\"carbonaceous chondrule\\" meteorites -- to ultimately build colonies with the land area of hundreds of Earths. No overpopulation. No crowded countries making war for \\"Lebensraum\\", when even with 1970's technology each colony can build a copy of itself in about a year, they calculated. An optimal size around 10,000 per colony is a more human scale, probably greatly simplifying problems of government. Some colonies may choose isolation -- he calculates a reflector the same weight as the colony would capture adequate solar energy at twice the distance of Pluto's orbit. Many others would choose to cluster, allowing quick travel for people and goods between hundreds of colonies by precise \\"inertial transport\\" vehicles.In the 1970's and 1980's, O'Neill and his students at Princeton (including future nanotechnology guru K. Eric Drexler one summer), with NASA and the Space Studies Institute ssi.org he founded -- worked out this vision in great detail. Since near-Earth-orbit asteroids had not yet been discovered, O'Neill invented and tested mass drivers (years before the \\"Star Wars\\" railgun) to boost moon rocks to precise locations in orbit. They computed stresses and supports required by each design using physics and structural engineering principles. They designed chemical processes to convert lunar and asteroidal materials using solar heat and electricity. Eventually they had it planned down to just two Space Shuttle missions, one to the Moon including a nuclear plant for power in the 2-week lunar night, a small bulldozer to scoop up lunar soil and materials to build a processing plant that would build a mass driver. The second Shuttle load would go into Earth orbit at the precise destination of the moon rocks. It would include a \\"catcher\\" moved by jets of surplus oxygen and the initial processing plant to build the first colony, \\"Island One\\".I believe these were tentatively placed in the Space Shuttle schedule around the ninetieth mission. Then came the Challenger disaster, budget cutbacks and recognition of how flawed the Space Shuttle design was. O'Neill's untimely death from cancer in 1992 removed the strongest advocate. Yet these bold and highly achievable ideas deserve serious scrutiny today, because they can still solve our most serious global problems."},{"Title":"High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space","review":"This is the classic proposal for the human expansion into space by the originator of the idea himself, Gerard O'neill.

He and his grad students spent years in workshops and conferences, meticulously working through every imaginable aspect of this herculean, yet possible, endeavor. I first read this tremendous book when it first came out, in 1977. I was in about fifth grade, so a lot of it went over my head. Still, the basic fact that this is SCIENCE, not science fiction, did sink into brain, and it had a big impact on me. The ideas in this book were some of the most exciting and important concepts I've ever encountered, period. Finding this book again in the library, a couple years ago, was one of the forces that pushed me back into making a serious commitment to astronomy -- I wish I had pursued astronomy from the time I was a child.As for the book itself -- watch for O'Neill's ideas about the mass driver. That's one of the cooler engineering ideas he presents. The section at the end of this edition, giving input from many of todays astronomical luminaries, is really inspiring stuff too. Some of the sections about the energy crisis, and overpopulation, may feel a little dated to readers today, but his points are still quite valid. He obviously was not quite accurate in the time frame he envisioned, but hey, O'Neill's a visionary -- at least he HAD a vision. It's up to the rest of us to help him flesh it out.Just to throw in my two cents worth -- anyone out there who reads this and would like to make a personal effort to get involved in this grand scheme, why not try building a small scale version of the life support systems he talks about? Specifically, why not try to create some of the radiation-shielded, small scale farms he talks about? If you wanted to kill two birds with one stone, you could even try to design and build a small scale, radiation-shielded, hydroponic farm built for a bomb shelter. The fundamental idea is exactly the same -- trying to design a viable, self-renewing food source that could work for a long period of time indoors, safe from a radiation-saturated environment. Just a thought. There were tons of conferences and workshops devoted to these topics back in the 70s, if you went to any large university's science library they could help you find all kinds of papers to help you get started. With appropriate selection of crops, and of growing media and nutrients, it is possible to grow enough food to support a family of four in a surface area equal to about three ping pong tables. Anyone could do this with today's technology. Just a thought.Anyway, this book is incredibly inspiring, and unbelievably well worked out, to the tiniest details.

Work spun off from that class resulted in a catapult design that would permit mines on the moon to supply ore to free floating space colonies that could have any gravity or weather they wanted.

Newspapers flood with economy vs ecology-talks, but still climate-negotiations sink into endless bureacracy-talks without moving anywhere. This book, however, serves a complete and feasible alternative to the cut-backs that you Americans fear so much.Gerard O'Neill shows how clean, efficient and plentiful solar energy which presently just flows useless past our planet, can be harnessed and used for all the purposes that we now try so desperately to cut back. This kind of new-thinking, I think, is even more needed today than back in 70's, since it shows that there are other solutions than ascetic living on one side and wanton ecological disruption on the other side.All you pro-industry, anti-enviroment americans - and especially president Bush - should read this book and see that it is both possible to save Earth AND employement, only with a little new thinking in space-programmes. Then you would certainly re-build the lost confidence from enviromentalists around the world."},{"Title":"High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space","review":"I'd read this book in college and wanted to read it again as part of my research for a new book I'm writing.James Ide, The Nintoku Incident"},{"Title":"The Case of the Legless Veteran","review":"A really good gift for someone who likes biographies with some fascinating (and makes-you-proud-to-have-a-backbone) social content. James Kutcher, young socialist militant comes back from the war with no legs - and then Veterans Affairs fires him for his political views. His parents are faced with losing their subsidized apartment because of their son, but stick by him. And he tours the union halls of the US, being given rousing support by workers who are very far from worrying about the red menace in their midst. Makes you realize how deep the support for everyone's right to have their own opinion goes - and why the US administration launched the McCarthy witch hunt. My God, US workers were not a docile bunch."},{"Title":"The Case of the Legless Veteran","review":"A powerful first-hand account of a nationwide campaign against the anti-labor McCarthyite witch hunt in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s. Not just a piece of history, but a story with inspiring lessons for working people in the new millennium. James Kutcher tells of radicalizing as a young man in the 1930s, impacted by the militant upsurge of labor that led to the formation of the autoworkers and other industrial unions; joining the Socialist Workers Party; being drafted and losing both legs in combat in WWII; and then being blacklisted by the government for his political views, losing his job with the Veterans Administration, his public housing, even his disability pension. The heart of the book is the persistent and courageous work of Kutcher and his supporters in waging a fight with big stakes for the democratic rights for all of us. Kutcher traveled the country, speaking to meetings and winning support from trade unions, student and faculty groups, and civil rights and civil liberties organizations. This eight-year fight was successful in beating back the government attack on Kutcher, and provides important examples and lessons of organized leadership much needed by workers and farmers in today's world."},{"Title":"The Case of the Legless Veteran","review":"knew Jimmy Kutcher before I read this book. This book is really his words his speech, and his honesty. What is most important here is the story of a young working class fighter in New Jersey before World War II drawn into the class struggle and the socialist movement by the fight against unemployment, against American fascism, against Roosevelt's war drive, into the Socialist Workers Party. Wounded in the second World War, losing his legs, walking on double crutches, still fighting for workers rights, still fighting for socialism. The McCarthy Truman Eisenhower, Democrat Republican, Liberal Conservative capitalist witch hunt tried to take away his pension. Jimmy fought. The Socialist Workers Party fought. When you fought the witch hunt--and not many did, they denied, they took the fifth, they left the country--but when you fought for your right to fight for socialism, you won.Read this book, learn from a simple basic man, how he came to the worker struggle, to socialism, how he fought, how he won.

Oftentimes the question is unanswerable, as the quality of poetry which makes it poetry is undefinable enough without putting qualifiers on it. But sometimes greatness is achieved simply through the act of putting an old idea in a new way. This is often what makes Ira Sadoff one of the two or three finest poets working in America today.Sadoff's third book of poetry continued the tradition of slow, solid work that has defined his career. This is poetry that demands a leisurely reading, but leaves enough in the open to allow the reader ease of access; much of it is painful, most of it questions incessantly, all of it demands to be read:IncestInbred. Inscribed. Interred. In my house,the doors locked, the lipsstuck to each other (like glue, she said), languishing--each seduction is a slash,an utterance with body parts, a slangof neck submerged in whispers.

This author literally hits you over the head with a whole book of inconsistencies contained in the four gospels of the New Testament. This book is not for those who believe the Bible is \\"The Word of God.\\" In fact, practically on every page there's some statement to disprove that assertion. I personally think he may have been obsessed with the need to \\"shake up\\" the die-hard Fundamentalists who truly believe the Bible is literally \\"The Word of God.\\" (Of course, I don't think such readers would get much beyond the first few pages without throwing the book in the trash!) In my view, the author is a little repetitious of his main themes; but the book was sure an eye-opener for me."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"This was a very heart-stirring book for me. When I reached the end, I found myself weeping.

We believe it is a book that all young women should be required to read."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"I happened on this book in my husband's grandfather's barn. I read it and felt a kinship with the mother depicted in this great story of family life. Motherhood entails small sacrifices that bring great reward. This story will warm and strengthen mothers around the world now as I am sure it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"Kathleen Norris, the California author who wrote some 75 novels between the two world wars, was the Danielle Steele of her day. &quot;Mother&quot; was her first novel which celebrated the sacrifice of motherhood, made her an instant celebrity, and earned her a personal visit from then president Theodore Roosevelt. Related to such literary greats as Frank Norris and the Benet family and moving with the prominent authors, musicians, actors,and journalists of the times she nevertheless wrote of women who overcame the odds of poverty, unfortunate marriages and families, and circumstance to find &quot;love, work, and service,&quot; Norris' mantra for a happy life. In spite of a real touch with the nuance of romance, wealth and celebrity, Norris always remained true to her Catholic faith and saw life as a series of choices. She believed that there must be real gold beneath the glitter. She received heavy mail from woman who, like her heroines, felt caught in circumstances of life that seemed hopelessly limiting and insufferable. She was a great stylist and scholar. After reading Kathleen Norris other romance writers seem insipid. Her many novels crowd rare and out-of-print stores, but she needs to be revived (she was heavily reprinted in the 70's in paperback).Note: I am referring to the Kathleen Norris that lived between 188? and 1968. There is an author writing currently by that name as well."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"I found this book on my grandmother's shelf and couldn't put it down! The story is a great one, of the joy and happiness of family life and what blessings can come when we are serving those we love. I was inspired by this book and given a new determination to do what is really important in life: raise a good family and love them. So often the responsibilities of motherhood are degraded in our society, yet we end up finding that careers and worldly success don't bring the joy that family does. This book illlustrates that so well! What an inspiring story; a real feel-good book! Please reprint!!!!"},{"Title":"Mother","review":"A touching story of a young girl who goes into the world to find what her heart desires. She is rather selfish, and scorns the poor women who stay at home, spending their time on their families. In the end, she realizes that really wants to be a loving, Godly wife and mother, like her own mother. When I began this book, I was a bit sceptical. I thought, \\"This isn't the type of girl I would want to emulate, or bother reading about.\\" But I cried at the end, and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"This book is a wonderful indictment of the ever-strengthening trend of modern day selfishness exalted in consumerism and the fascination with wealth and leisure.The praises of motherhood are sung, especially motherhood which embraces large families for the simple reason that children are blessings. Thankfully, the Nancy Campbell-style legalism (which many believe COMMANDS women to get up off their birthing beds, wake up their husbands and get to work on the next baby) is avoided entirely. \\"And the Lord BLESSED them....\\" How did He bless them? With fertility and children. Look up Genesis 1:28 and Genesis 9:1 and decide for yourself. No doubt children are blessings and no doubt having a large family is a wonderful, wonderful blessing to which I can attest (I have five children and would love to have more). However, the emphasis here is upon the reasons children are blessings - to one another and also to their parents who are given opportunity to live a life of selfless giving.The end of the book appropriately contrasts the impact of the life lived in the light of death. The daughter/protagonist of the virtuous mother has worked for a wealthy, self-absorbed woman whose life is \\"busy,\\" but with details which hold no eternal weight. The other woman, the protagonist's mother, has spent her life in selfless service to her beloved husband and many children. She is happy and content in this, having learned the secret to happiness is living a life in service to others. Although neither woman has died, the daughter/ protagonists imagines the funerals of her mother and her employer in her mind. She then comes to the inexorable conclusion that her wealthy employer would not truly be missed, by her wealthy socialite friends, her husband, or even by her own children. She is not central to their lives or well-being, having abandoned her opportunity to invest herself in them. The book is encouraging and inspiring to those whose vision of selfless parenting is under attack."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"Kathleen Norris was an excellent writer, but there appear to be two. One reader earlier commented on this. You need to differentiate between these two authors. The earlier one died in the sixties and didn't write on religious themes."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"\\"To be encouraged to ask for a favor and then refused it,\\" Kathleen Norris wrote, \\"is an experience all impoverished friends of all comfortably rich persons know. 'You taught me first to bed, and now--you teach me how a beggar should be answered,' says Shakespears's Portia. But it is not only the poor who feels life's endless snubs; they are no respectors of persons.\\" Norris writes about the genesis of MOTHER in her 1959 autobiography FAMILY GATHERING. As a staunch Roman Catholic she and her husband, the brother of the late San Francisco novelist Frank (McTEAGUE) Norris, were appalled by the spread of the birth control movement in the first decade of the century, and she wrote MOTHER hoping to raise the self-image of women who chose to become mothers, and to a certain extent it worked. Former President Theodore Roosevelt named it as one of his favorite books, and honored the impecunious, Bohemian couple by showing up at ther flat for an impromptu dinner. With growing celebrity she became intimate friends with the Lunts, Noel Coward, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Addison and Wilson Mizner, and other famous people of the day.Her friendship with fellow pop novelist Edna Ferber came to a bad end. Ferber could never forgive Norris for going to Germany in the 1930s and accepting the honors bestowed on her by a grateful Adolf Hitler. Norris returned from Berlin to find that her public had largely deserted her due to her Nazi connections. She wasn't really a Nazi, just a Pacifist and you might say an isolationist, like Charles Lindbergh (another of her friends) and like Lindbergh her once proud name was stained with Nazi obloquy. Yet she was a talented novelist and it's a sign of the times that she is so forgotten today and another woman with the same name is reaping the rewards of having a name people think they've already heard. MOTHER, a tract against what she called \\"race suicide,\\" is one of her very best novels."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"Someone recommended this novel on one of the h.s. websites and it was excellent. It was written in 1911 and it could have been written today - the issues about having only 2 children - or no children - women working, needing to provide your children with EVERYTHING if you are going to have them, it went on and on. The arguments of today for not having children were the same as 100 years ago! I was surprised.The Mother in question is s/t looked down upon as being a drudge/ servant with no rewards, and people wonder how she could stand having 7 children. This is what mom thought: She welcomed the fast-coming babies as gifts from God, marvelled over their tiny perfectness, dreamed over the soft relaxed forms with a heart almost too full for prayer. She was in a word, old fashioned, hopelessly out of the modern current of thoughts and events. She secretely regarded her children as marvellous, even while she laughed down their youthful conceit and punished their naughtiness.The story deals with the 20 smthg daughter who wants to be wealthy and limit her kids. By the end of the story she realizes that if her mother subscribed to her weatlhy friends' attitudes, she wouldn't be here. \\"And she had s/t wished that she and Bruce had been the only ones! Yes, came the sudden thought, but it wldn't have been Bruce and Margaret after all, it would have been Bruce and Charlie. That was what women did, then, when they denied the right of life to the distant, unwanted, possible little person!\\" and it goes on and on and I loved it : )It is a beautifully written story, easy to read. I was concerned that it would be too preachy, but it isn't. I didn't want to put it down.This woman wrote over 50 books, but this is the only one still in the Los Angeles library system.I think Doug Phillips' (of Vision Forum Ministries) quote applies here:The Bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing. But in ourculture, we apply for a curse and reject a blessing. Something isterribly wrong with this picture."},{"Title":"Mother","review":"This book \\"Mother\\", so beautifully worded, nicely packaged, and handily edited via the Vision Forum company, is at heart an old-fashioned scare tactic for the first-wave feminists that's been resurfaced by new feminist-haters. It's very possible that Jennie Chancey, who modestly calls herself the \\"editor\\" of this book and is a fellow heroine of the Vision Forum, edited this book to cut the anti-career message even closer, but from what I saw in the original edition, she didn't have to do much.Kathleen Norris has a beautiful way with words, a literary pen that sings with an antiquated melody, so it almost surprises me that the stigma of this flowery book is rather remarkably shallow. I'd read from a dozen people that this book was lovely, moving, and by all accounts didn't seem to be anything more than a story about a woman who realized her heart's dream was to be like her beloved mother. I heard this report so many times, even the brand that the Vision Forum attempted to put on this book didn't faze me. But Kathleen Norris, who wrote this around the time when women dared to see themselves as more than wombs, clearly meant it as a smear campaign against such women, and not a very deep one at that. In this brief book, the heroine Margaret, simple-minded to a fault, abandons all thoughts and seeming respect of her mother's lifestyle and goes on a merry-go-round me-search for success and a job, which resembles a teenager's confused attempt to ditch home more than a rational grown woman's attempt to find her place in the world. Then, after a period of time spent with a discontent family and a marriage proposal, she completes her apparent addiction to single-mindedness and realizes she really wanted to be a wife all along. She then gigglingly retires to her room and spends the next three or four pages mentally doodling her future \\"Mrs. So-and-so\\" name on the small walls of her skull. But it's not all pink doilies and Mrs. monikers now, dear reader; during this time of high self-congratulation, she spares a few paragraphs to dwell on the poor, unloved career women she's met. All of the women with jobs that she knows, apparently without exception, march sadly through her head being branded, one by one, by the ignorant Margaret as women who are discontent and unloved. She calls all her own former plans for a job fruitless and her sister's former dreams \\"idle\\" and indicates they were flimsy thoughts of youth, happily abandoned for her husband as soon as she got married. In case all of this hasn't chilled the heart of any potential feminist yet, author Norris slides the cold knife in completely by painting morbid thoughts in Margeret's head of funerals, the future funerals of her own former employer and every career woman she knows; funerals in which these women are apparently, by and large, unloved and unmourned by those who knew them. And why? Because they didn't choose to be mothers.The message of this book could hardly be clearer, and rather than heartwarming it is coldly judgemental, cruel, and even heartbreaking at times. The Vision Forum has long written a death sentence for women who don't fit their views of womanhood, but to find this seemingly sweet little book promoting the same message and being deceptively praised by many for it is far more disturbing to me. There are far better and far more worthy ways to praise motherhood, and doing so at the expense of women who don't choose it only narrows it and lessens the beauty of it. If you want a book which truly portrays a good woman, a genuine life search, and the complexity of human beings and our God, I highly recommend \\"Not My Will\\", by Francena Arnold.Another interesting thing about Kathleen Norris worth noting is that, according to another reviewer here, she accepted an award from Hitler. For what, I don't know, but the current thought appears to be that she was a pacifist, not a Nazi. For a woman labeled as a pacifist, it's quite sad to me that she couldn't treat career women with more neutrality, or dare I say kindness. I guess she had the same build that so many \\"submissive\\" women have: a soft surface that hides the sharpened claws within."},{"Title":"Under My Elm: Country Discoveries and Reflections","review":"Like the other Grayson books, this is a true delight to curl up with.

Being published in 1980, the volume is now over 25 years old. Still, Wiersbe provides brief biographies on great Christian leaders, and then gives samples of their messages. I personally enjoyed the biographies much more than I did the sermons.Following the biographies and sample sermons, he gives a very dated resource list of classic books for the preacher. He closes by focusing on Dwight L. Moody's theology and personal influences.This book is an easy read, especially if you skip the messages. It will provide much insight into the lives of great Christian figures, and be helpful in better understanding the last 300 years of Christian history."},{"Title":"Philosophical discussions","review":"The paperback book used print on demand technology and is so full or errors that it is nearly unreadable. In one case a footnote that is spread out over the bottom of three pages in the original book is presented as a continuation of the text on each page.

The incisive thinkers and remarkable leaders who have contributed to the journal and to this book open doors, spark ideas, raise signal flags, and help satisfy that universal hunger.&quot;In this context, I summarized partially only four of the thirty-seven essays written by talented thinkers as follows:I. Peter F. Drucker writes: &quot;The three people from whom I learned the most in my work were all very different. The first two were exceptionally demanding; the third was exceptionally brillant. All three taught me a lot...Five lessons I learned from those remarkable men still apply today:1. Treat people differently, based on their strengths.2. Set high standards, but give people the freedom and responsibility to do their job.3. Performance review must be honest, exacting, and an integral part of the job.4. People learn the most when teaching others.5. Effective leaders earn respect-but they don't need to be liked.II. Doris Kearns Goodwin lists ten lessons from the stories of Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, and Franklin Roosevelt for leaders of today's organizations.1. Timing is (almost) everything.2. Anything is possible if you share the glory.3. Trust, once broken, is seldom restored.4. Leadership is about building connections.5. Leaders learn from their mistakes.6. Confidence-not just in oneself-counts.7. Effective partnerships reqire devotion to one's partners.8. Renewal comes from many sources.9. Leaders must be talent brokers.10. Language is one's most powerful tool.III. Warren Bennis argues: &quot;I belive that behind every Great Man is a Great Group, an effective partnership. And making up every Great Group is a unique construct of strong, often eccentric individuals. So the question for organizations is, How do you get talented, self-absorbed, often arrogant, incredibly bright people to work together?&quot; And he suggests ten principles common to all Great Groups:1. At the heart of every Great Groups is a shared dream.2. They manage conflict by abandoning individual egos to the pursuit of the dream.3. They are protected from the &quot;suits&quot;.4. They have a real or invented enemy.5. They view themselves as winning underdogs.6. Members pay a personal price.7. Great Groups make strong leaders.8. Great Groups are the product of meticulous recruiting.9. Great Groups are usually young.10. Real artists ship.IV. J. Richard Hackman identifies a number of mistakes that managers make in setting up and leading work teams.1. Use a team for work that is better done by individuals.2. Call the performing unit a team but really manage members as individuals.3. Fall off the authority balance team.4. Dismantle existing organizational structures so that teams will be fully empowered to accomplish the work.5. Specify challenging team objectives, but skimp on organizational supports.6.

The incisive thinkers and remarkable leaders who have contributed to the journal and to this book open doors, spark ideas, raise signal flags, and help satisfy that universal hunger.&quot;In this context, I partially summarized only five of the thirty-seven essays written by thirty-seven talented thinkers.I. Peter F. Drucker writes: &quot;the three people from whom I learned the most in my work were all very different. The first two were exceptionally demanding; the third was exceptionally brillant. All three taught me a lot...Five lessons I learned from those remarkable men still apply today:1. Treat people differently, based on their strengths.2. Set high standards, but give people the freedom and responsibility to do their job.3. Performance review must be honest, exacting, and an integral part of the job.4. People learn the most when teaching others.5. Effective leaders earn respect-but they don't need to be liked.II. Doris Kearns Goodwin lists ten lessons from the stories of Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, and Franklin Roosevelt for leaders of today's organizations:1. Timing is (almost) everything.2. Anything is possible if you share the glory.3. Trust, once broken, is seldom restored.4. Leadership is about building connections.5. Leaders learn from their mistakes.6. Confidence-not just in oneself-counts.7. Effective partnership require devotion to one's partners.8. Renewal comes from many sources.9. Leaders must be talent brokers.10. Language is one's most powerful tool.III. John P. Kotter argues: &quot;No organization today-large or small, local or global-is immune to change. To cope with new technological, competitive, and demographic forces, leaders in every sector have sought to alter fundamentally the way their organizations do business. These change efforts have paraded under many banners-total quality management, reengineering, restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, turnarounds. Yet according to most assessments, few of these efforts accomplish their goals. Fewer than fifteen of the one hundred or more companies I have studied have successfully transformed themselves.&quot; Hence, he lists eight critical steps to transform your organization:1. Establish a sense of urgency.2. Form a powerful guiding coalition.3. Create a vision.4. Communicate the vision.5. Empower others to act on the vision.6. Plan for and create short-term wins.7. Consolidate improvements and produce still more change.8. Institutionalize new approaches.IV. Warren Bennis argues: &quot;I believe that behind every Great Man is a Great Group, an effective partnership. And making up every Great Group is a unique construct of strong, often eccentric individuals. So the question for organizations is, How do you get talented, self-absorbed, often arrogant, incredibly bright people to work together?&quot; And he suggests ten principles common to all Great Groups:1. At the heart of every Great Group is a shared dream.2. They manage conflict by abandoning individual egos to the pursuit of the dream.3. They are protected from the &quot;suits&quot;.4. They have a real or invented enemy.5. They view themselves as winning underdogs.6. Members pay a personal price.7. Great Groups make strong leaders.8. Great Groups are the product of meticulous recruiting.9. Great Groups are usually young.10. Real artists ship.V. J. Richard Hackman identifies a number of mistakes that managers make in setting up and leading work teams.Mistake 1. Use a team for work that is better done by individuals.Mistake 2. Call the performing unit a team but really manage members as individuals.Mistake 3. Fall off the authority balance team.Mistake 4. Dismantle existing organizational structures so that teams will be fully empowered to accomplish the work.Mistake 5. Specify challenging team objectives, but skimp on organizational supports.Mistake 6. Assume that members already have all the skills they need to work well as a team.I highly recommend this excellent collection as a whole."},{"Title":"Leader to Leader: Enduring Lessons on Leadership from the Drucker Foundation's Award-Winning Journal","review":"I have read many of these chapters in their web form on the Drucker Foundation site. Now everyone can use their Reader's Guide and enjoy 37 chapters by Peter Drucker, Warren Bennis, Frances Hesselbein, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, and others.These chapters explore leadership, innovation, and leading transition.

Now the 'best of the best' has been gathered for this handbook. Harvard Business School Professor John Kotter's insight into the four most common mistakes that cause change efforts to fail are superb and right on the money -- and his chapter is just one of thirty-seven. I wish this book had been available when I started my leadership journey many years ago! Whether you are just beginning your leadership journey or you are well on your way to becoming a SmartLeader, this book is a resource that you will benefit from today and in the days ahead."},{"Title":"Leader to Leader: Enduring Lessons on Leadership from the Drucker Foundation's Award-Winning Journal","review":"Others have already outlined the 7 sections covered in LEADER TO LEADER, so I won't waste time on that other than to say there is something here for everyone. The Drucker Foundation has put together a wealth of information here from some of their collection of past articles written for their magazine publication. With 37 articles in all, the list of contributors reads like a who's who on leadership. There are three different pieces here from Peter Drucker himself, as well as an array of notables such as Herb Kelleher, Stephen Covey, Max De Pree and Warren Bennis.At first glance, I found certain areas of particular interest, but upon reflection, I know even those articles I found less captivating will be ones I will reference again in the future as I am presented with new circumstances and challenges. I think you will too.Most of the work here is in true article or essay form, however there are also a few interviews conducted by the editors, Francis Hesselbein and Paul Cohen. Being from a variety of writers, you will find a variety of styles as well. Some are quite cogent and direct in their synopsis, while others may require a piecing together of the information provided to form your own conclusions.This is a fantastic compilation of articles that I highly recommend. It's been over a decade since this was published. Hopefully the Drucker Foundation will publish Leader to Leader II in the near future."},{"Title":"Leader to Leader: Enduring Lessons on Leadership from the Drucker Foundation's Award-Winning Journal","review":"This is a collection of outstanding contributions from the Journal of the Drucker Foundation, by leaders and thinkers.

AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERARY CRITICISM,1773 to 2000 documents the full range of black cultural criticism, from Phillis Wheatley's aesthetic statements to the poetics of hip-hop. The collection reveals that African American criticism, like the expressive culture it examines, is a &quot;long black song&quot; of many and varied voices. -- Keith Byerman, Indiana State University2. A first-rate reader and reference whose thoughfully chosen selections are unprecedentedly inclusive and judiciusly representative of theoretical and applied criticism. Cross-referencing in the table of contents--by historical chronology, genre, and critical approaches--encourages dimensional consideration of the selections. The generous introduction is an excellent survey of Afro-American criticism that provides an illuminating frame of reference for exploration of the texts. --Theodore R. Hudson, Former Graduate Professor of English, Howard University3. AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERARY CRITICISM,1773 TO 2000 is the best kind of scholarship: comprehensive, stimulating, and accessible. Every serious student of African American literature will want to own this book. --Hilary Holladay, University of Massachusetts, Lowell4. A valuable and long overdue text which is ideally suited to the needs of both students and instructors. For far too long, sustained focus on African American literary theory as a subject area has been subsumed to the chronicling of African American literary history.

The text is unique, because it charts the dynamic course that African American literaary criticism has taken during the last two centuries.

George is such an affable character, and the pictures, well, just make you want to smile throught out. We love George at our house!"},{"Title":"George Upside Down","review":"Unlike some of the other picture books out, kids can really relate to this one. Who doesn't know a child who didn't have some obsessive quirk that only lasted a short time? Kids and grown ups will enjoy this one - for it's fun, easy to relate to story and bold illustrations that really draw you into the pages."},{"Title":"George Upside Down","review":"George likes to do things upside down. Convincing George to conform to the right-side-up way of life is proving to be a bit of a challenge for George's parents, his teacher, school nurse and principal... Until they all decide to outsmart George by joining him in his upside-down antics. Using colorful cartoon-type drawings with humorously expressive eyes, McCarthy conveys both the fun of boyhood and a child's struggle toward individuality. Young readers are sure to identify with this topsy turvy tale!"},{"Title":"George Upside Down","review":"The bad news is my children now think it's great fun to imitate George, and to hang upside down from various fixtures and pieces of furniture. The good news is that we can't help but laugh. George's story is silly, sweet and a delight to share with young readers.The illustrations are fabulous. Even my two year old is engrossed by McCarthy's bold drawings. It makes for a great read aloud to groups of kids, since the pictures can be enjoyed from a bit of a distance. This would make for some great comic relief in the classroom -just set the ground rules first, no hanging upside down!"},{"Title":"George Upside Down","review":"George is lovable, and the artwork is bold and imaginative.

(I'm unaware of another kids book whose main character is an \\"upside-downer\\" like George). The book also has amusing, brightly colored, naive/childlike illustrations that are very \\"kid -friendly.\\" I really liked the first 2/3 of the book -introducing George, aged approximately 5, and demonstrating how he who loves to be upside down no matter what he's doing. This includes riding on a swing, playing the trumpet, painting pictures, reading a book, watching TV, playing with his yo-yo, and dreaming (he's always upside down in his dreams). The problem is that he also likes to be upside down when he's riding in the car, eating with his family, and attending school. His parents, his teacher, his tutor, his school nurse.However, I have some problems with the execution of the ending. It could probably be solved with by clearer or more illustrations, text or both. There are just some things that aren't clear near and at the end where George gets cured of his \\"upside down\\" habit, but replaces it with another one. For that reason, I'd only recommend it for kids that are particularly enjoying an \\"upside down\\" phase and then it needs to be pre-read by the story reader and some explanantion added."},{"Title":"The boys' book of model railroading;","review":"I had a copy of this when I was about 8 years old and loved it.

It's a goldmine of radio and electronics data to this very day. Like many of my generation, age 55, I get nostalgic about vacuum tubes and the golden age of electronics. I have spent plenty of time with younger electronics buffs, who talk about TTL logic, MOSFETS, and the latest microprocessors; but you really haven't lived if you never took a brown paper bag full of clinking vacuum tubes to the local Safeway and scrolled through the charts, setting enough dials to launch your own Space Shuttle. Those were good times.I still like chip-circuits but there is no substitute for the experience of listening to exotic languages and foreign radio broadcasts by the light of softly glowing tubes in the dark. Magic. I went looking for an older copy of The Handbook, hoping to find more emphasis on tubes than the later editions. This book did not disappoint. I was particularly intrigued by the way construction projects simply assumed AM modulation. I gather that in 1956, SSB was still pretty heady stuff. One thing that astonished me is how little some portions of the Handbook have changed in so many years. I recognized whole paragraphs and sometimes drawings from the '56 edition, still used in 2009!The book is also printed on a different kind of paper. It's the shiny stuff they often used in the '50s for book photography. If you have B&W; photos in a paperback book, it's probably the same stuff. It makes for a heavy book that is well bound and seems to be made to last.In conclusion, I recommend this book to anyone interested in old time radio or wishing to extend their knowledge of tube design. A good used book.Oh, and speaking of nostalgia, I just now remembered that today (October 4th), is if I'm not mistaken, the 52nd anniversary of Sputnik and the dawn of the space age.

I never took algebra in high school, so I was lost in my college pre-algebra class by the second week. My professor told me to withdraw in order to save my GPA which was quite high.Fast forward to 2001. I bought this book and it really opened my eyes! I can see where I made my mistakes in class and I can understand the concepts that my prof. and a tutor could not get me to understand. Everything seems so simple now--some of my past mistakes were very simple ones!This book is real easy to understand. The book breaks down each concept and the problems are broken down step by step so it's real easy to see what you have to do. It took me only a half-hour to memorize the Order of Operations and apply that to the problems. If you use this in tandem with a book you have for a class, it will make things really easy. The books takes you from the beginning (what a variable is) all the way to graphing two dimensions on a graphing table.My husband who was a math whiz in school looked at this book and said it's an Algebra 1 book. I'm hoping to understand the concepts thoroughly so I can take a Pre-Algebra placement test and pass for credit.The only negative things I have to say are that there aren't enough problems to work on. And, my husband said it was a shame that there was only ONE problem (at the end of the book) that shows graphing in three dimensions. He said since the author put that in, she should have continued on with more problems for that concept, or she should have left it out.I'm just so happy about the fact that I can finally understand Algebra!

Explanations that didn't require three readings before they made sense.I think the best way to approach the book is by reviewing the previous chapter before you begin a new chapter.A minor complaint: Too few exercises, as is the case with most of these types of books.

This allowed me to take Intermediate Algebra; however, had there been illustrations on diagrams and charts that included cos, tan, sin, etc. I know I would have been qualified to take College Algebra. Not bad for remembering zero from years ago to using this book as my sole learning tool before the exam. I did pass all the equation parts of that test, which made me very happy. (I put down the Algebra The Easy Way by Barron when it lost me on some missing steps and studied solely the Painless Algebra). Now this book does have a few missing steps in explaining how to do problems too, but overall I am very pleased with the book.I showed my 8 year old how to do those Bob is twice as old as Jim math problems & if two trains pass each other going x speed in two hours, how far did they each travel and their speed questions. To my surprise, she remembered how to do the formula I showed her from the book when her 3rd grade teacher asked a simular question in class.Overall, I am very pleased with this book and recommend it.

However, in a quick read-through and working of about a third of the exercises, I found at least 5 errors in the text. Unfortunately, they were not obvious typos. Rather, they were errors that made me wonder whether I was mistaken in my understanding.

My only criticism are 1), I wish there were more exercises) and 2), all of the answers need to be explained - there are a few \\"tricky\\" questions that are very difficult to figure out if one hasn't used Algebra in a long time. It would be very helpful for the author to come up with a workbook that was correlated with each chapter in \\"Painless Algebra,\\" in order to further reinforce concepts covered.The final chapter, on quadratic equations (the bane of my algebraic existence) was the only one that provided much grief. As with most things in mathematics, there is more than one way to find a solution. I ended up using solutions found in other books, that were a bit clearer.

The first half of the book deals with the social and political upheaval in France during the interwar years, and the demise of French military power. The second half covers the debacle from the onset of the 2nd World War through France's fall. Very well written, fascinating and informative. The first book I read by Alistair Horne, and it got me hooked."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"In \\"To Lose A Battle\\" Alastair Horne tells the story of the Fall of France in 1940 in great detail. Beginning with the political and military background which lead to French weakness, the reader is carried through to the final collapse and its aftermath.The parts of the book which I liked the best were the beginning and the end. In the early parts we read how the tragedy of World War I set France up for failure in World War II. France had been badly divided politically for generations, a heritage which contributed to the disaster of 1940. The massive kill-off of 1914-18 followed by the low Depression-era birthrate left France with a much smaller manpower pool than had existed in 1914. The memory of World War I, along with the long-standing divisions in the French body politic prevented the French form preparing an army which could maintain the distinguished French military tradition.During the reading of this book, I gained a deeper appreciation of the role played by the Maginot Line. I has always heard that it was the last stand of fixed fortifications. In this book we see how the costs of the Line and its personnel demands drained money and resources which would have been more productively devoted to other units. During the \\"Phony War\\" the only effective relief that France could have provided to embattled Poland would have been an invasion of Germany. The ultimate irony is that the impregnable Maginot Line formed a barrier, not only to German invasion, but also to a French advance into enemy territory.The massive middle of the book explains the facts of the defeat of France in agonizing detail. Although the credentials, such as thus usage of this book by the Israeli Armed Forces, suggests that this book has real value for the military professional, the endless recital of names and actions makes it difficult for an amateur historian, such as myself, to maintain interest.In concluding sections, the narrative returns to more recognizable themes, such as the breaking of the lines, the collapse of the Belgians, the evacuation of Dunkerque and the last effort to organize a final defense in France. This book introduced me to the depth of irony in the French surrender. I had known that the French were forced to surrender in the same rail car and at the same location as the Armistice signing of 1918. I was unaware that the Versailles Conference had taken place in the same hall in which Wilhelm I had been proclaimed Emperor of Germany in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War.I did enjoy reading about the involvement of Rommel and de Gaulle, two figures who would play major roles later in the War and, in de Gaulle's case, thereafter.Although this book focuses on French failures, it is balanced in that it does note that the British performed no better than did the French.In the end, Horne explores the question of how the defeat of France influenced subsequent developments in Europe and the world.This book may be a great one for pursuing expertise in the Battle of France but it is a bit detailed for recreational reading."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"It's a shame this book is out of print. Horne's book is the best treatment of the Battle of France I've come across so far.Horne prelude's the battle very well with his analysis of French culture and politics during the inter-war years. His detailed descriptions of the major engagements are well written and obviously researched. His conclusions are not forced but seem to flow naturally.The only aspect of the book that I would have altered is to tone down some of Horne's politically conservative prejudices. However, a dozen or so passages does not invalidate this excellent book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Alistair Horne does a masterful job in distilling the political, military and social aspects of the Third Republic's collapse in his third book on the Franco-German wars. Starting with the &quot;Grandeur and Misery of Victory&quot; following the Allies' victory in WW1, Horne traces the path that led to the shattering defeat of the French at the hands of the nation that they had humbled less than 25 years previously. Horne examines the men and women whose influence on events was so important, and avoids the dry recitation of times, places and names as he brings the Battle of France to life not only on the battlefields but in the streets, bedrooms, and ministerial offices where fateful decisions were made and battles lost...or won."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Allistar Horne provides a superbly informative look at the disastrous Allied collapse in May 1940. The author devotes about half these pages to the shaky political and social division within France between the wars (1918-1939), problems that contributed to the disaster. We also learn about calcified military thinking on the part of the French, epitomized by both their foolhardy Maginot Line, and more importantly their Maginot mentality. The latter chapters look at the actual six-week battle, which was largely decided in the first few days after the German armor broke through at Sedan. Readers see how the Allies were not only fooled, but slow to react or improvise, and troubled by chain-of-command problems that ran all the way to the top. Readers also see how in the last few days before the German attack, French commander Maurice Gamelin did nothing despite solid intelligence showing the Germans shifting resources sourthward towards the Ardennes Forest (and thus Sedan). It was if the French command was incontrovertibly wedded to their faulty River Dyle Plan. Additionally and contrary to perception, the Allies (France, plus Britain and Belgium) had more soldiers in the field than their Nazi counterparts, and the heavy French tanks (Char B and Somura) were superior in armor and firepower to the German panzers. As the author shows, this defeat had many causes, and was far from inevitable.The author has done an excellent job here, and readers should also consider COLLAPSE OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC by William L. Shirer, plus SIXTY DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WEST by Jacques Benoist-Mechin."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Alistair Horne's story is an honest look at a battle that has been largely sterotyped and forgotten by the American Public. Post war authors have tended to deal with The Battle of France as a forgone conclusion. We have long been treated a vision of the German Army completly overwhelming the Allies while most of the Frence Army was performing garrison duty. Horne reminds us that it was the Allies who had the Germans outnumbered in both troops and tanks, even without the fortress troops. Horne also notes that the French High Command thought that they were winning while the German High Command was convinced that things would soon go wrong. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about World Two than the general works that simply rehash old well known stories."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"I have tried many books in the past to learn about the military aspects of the german invasion of france in 1940. I wanted to read about the fall of Eben Emael, the tactics Guderian employed to cross Meuse, how Rommel crossed Dinant, the role of Luftwaffe etc.etc. I must say that ONLY THIS BOOK covers all of the above in a very engrossing style.I also loved the excerpts (from the then newspaper headlines) at the start of each chapter. I also liked the quotes that the author uses to make us see things in perspective (eg., when talking about General Maurice Gamelin's preference to experience over technology, the author quotes Fredrick the great - \\"Experience is useless unless the right conclusions are drawn from it\\" !!)I strongly recommend to all lovers of WW2 books. If you have read Stephen Ambrose & Cornelius Ryan, you also want to read Alistair Horne!"},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"\\"To Lose a Battle\\" is Alistair Horne's superbly readable account of the fall of France in 1940, a detailed rendering of a stunning political and military debacle, first published in 1969 and still in print. Horne meant this book as the third piece of a trilogy on the bitter rivalry between Germany and France between 1870 and 1940, but this book easily stands on its own for Horne's excellent prose and matchless grasp of French politics.Horne begins with the conclusion of the First World War, as a victorious but exhausted France attempts to build a secure peace. However, the Versailles Treaty is badly flawed, and divisive French domestic politics will undermine corrective diplomacy and military measures while Nazi Germany rebuilds in the 1930's.Fully two thirds of the book is devoted to a detailed account of the confrontation with Germany in May 1940, as a demoralized France faces the German Blitzkrieg in the Ardennes that produces a catatrosphic breakthrough at Sedan. Horne infuses the narrative with palpable suspense, as the German Panzers race for the English Channel, the French Government collapses, and the British Expeditionary Force retreats to its date with destiny at Dunkirk.\\"To Lose a Battle\\" is very highly recommended to students of the Second World War as the kind of epic narrative that is all too rare in modern histories."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Readers who want a first-rate examination of the political, cultural, and military issues that produced Germany's rapid defeat of France in May 1940 will certainly enjoy TO LOSE A BATTLE. In TLaB, this information is primarily conveyed in Part One, this book's first eight chapters, where analysis strikes the perfect balance between overview and detail. Illustrating the level at which Alistair Horne approaches this material are the section heads, which in Chapter 3, \\"Fortune Changes Sides,\\" are: Hitler Rearms; The \`Revolutionary' Wehrmacht; Anti-Militarism in France; Political Scandals; and Beginnings of Civil War.In contrast, Part Two of TLaB examines the Battle of France as it unfolds. In this section, each of the first eight chapters (pages 257-510) follows the battle developments on a single day. For example, Chapter 11, \\"On the Meuse\\", examines the situation on May 12. Its section heads are: The Low Countries; Guderian Across the Semois; Second Army; Guderian at Sedan; Reinhardt; Ninth Army Cavalry Withdraws; and so on. These sections, in other words, convey what a particular general or army was experiencing during a certain tactical moment in the battle. Here, Horne's command of detail is impressive. Still, the actual evolution of events was not always easy to follow. I'd suggest more maps.After the detailed battle analysis of Part Two, I found the final chapter, \\"Aftermath\\", to be a welcome jump back to the macro level, where Horne delivers great insights about the after-effects of this battle. These include:o \\"But Hitler... had thought no further ahead...; no contingency plan had been prepared whereby a tottering Britain might be invaded immediately after success had been achieved in France...

Horne portrays the Allied generals as bickering and indecisive, jealous of command authority yet unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. By contrast the Germans, outmanned and outgunned, and using clever military propaganda, overwhelmed the French, British, and Belgium forces by a shock and awe campaign that was more bluster than blitzkrieg. Horne's condemnation is well taken- if only the Allies had planned better, been more open to improvisation, had a more clearly detailed command structure, and had they not given in to the overstated myth of German military might, they could have repulsed the Wehrmacht handily. This is a great book that reads like a novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"This book is of a rare quality - history told in a gripping fashion, with all the tension of a fictional thriller. It opens with the Bastille Day 1919 celebrations and follows the Franco-German relations, and the internal French politics from there until the war. If there is any criticism of this book, Horne uses quite a few French colloquailisms that are probably lost on the English-speaking readers - lost on me for the main part. But overall, the book is excellent. The primary characters - Gamelin, Weygand, Manstein and Guderian - are all portrayed very well. And Horne had very good access to sources, including many soliders who were involved in the actual battles of 1940 including some who went on to very notable positions in the post-war world. I'd recommend it to anyone interested both in that period of history, and French 20th Century history overall."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Horne is near the top of his game in this nuanced portrayal of the German victory in 1940. Part of his cycle of works detailing Franco-German warfare (I found his work on the Franco-Prussian war to be a verbose disaster, but his 'Price of Glory' covering Verdun to be the best single historical book on the Great War) this piece benefits from great narrative and subtle story-telling. He does a fine job of exposing the weaknesses of France leading up to the war, and brings to life the gamble that paid off for the German forces."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Normally Alistair Horne has won prizes for style, content and extraordinary prose. IN this book he wins a losing battle himself: it is only his tremendous knowledge, his astounding depth that rescues this book from being too dry to chew. The fact that Mr. Horne is a superb prize-winning scholar with languages to match his subject, the fact that he translates for us from the German or the French or the Latin or whatever as he laboriously climbs each hill as the French lose their country, each hillock, each indepandent farm, each street, each road, each beach, each eighth of an inch of France, thereby hammering each loss into the French \\"coffin\\", the formation of the Vichy government, only his personal skills save the day. Perhaps only the books on the loss of Poland, especially those about the Death roundups in Warsaw from 1939 to 1944, are equally sad. His is a book on the loss of green and lovely hills pf France; the others arebooks which are essentially lists of those murdered, day after day after day. To write of a tragedy is one thing: to write respectfully of a possibly preventable tragedy is another. Here the author keeps a respectful distance, engages in no hind-sight, but allows the people who make the wrong military decisions to speak for themselves on paper, with their misguided directives, thus sealing the fate of France,by nearly giving their own country away, thus isolating England for several years. This book is difficult to read but worth every page for the serious historian of World War II, or of the study of politics in the 20th century."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"There are several very good books about France defeat in 1940. And I have read them all. Some of them are newer, supposedly with advantages of recent research, but nevertheless Horne \\"To Lose a Battle\\" still is unsurmountable in scope, intelligent balance, witty and sharp descriptions of moments and people, style and verve. In my case I read it AFTER I did it with the others, more recent books, but even so I cannot but say that the book by Horne is above head and shoulders all those, no matter how good they are in its own account. Horne rightly can be considered as an historian of genius."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"Alistair Horne has drawn three intense, beautifully detailed portraits of the tragedy that befell the \\"children of Charlemagne,\\" the Germans and the French, which occurred over a 75 year period; three wars, both the ones that claim \\"World\\" status, as well the war of 1870. His book on the later is entitled \\"The Fall of Paris: The Siege of Paris and the Commune of 1870-71\\"; he covers the First World War by focusing on its cataclysmic battle, in \\"The Price of Glory: Verdun, 1916\\"; and \\"To Lose a Battle, France 1940\\" is on the Second. The particular battle that is the centerpiece of the book is the breakthrough at Sedan, the exact same place the Germans broke through in 1870. In 1940, it took only six weeks after the breakthrough until France capitulated. Horne has also written a truly excellent account of the war of Algerian independence, entitled \\"A Savage War of Peace: Algeria, 1954-62.\\" Although he has written other historical accounts, it is these four books that have established his reputation as one of the preeminent historians of the 20th Century. I have reviewed the other three, and will now conclude with this one.In all Horne's works he manages to master an immense amount of historical facts, and then write a fluid, moving account that ranges back and forth from the salons of power, where the personalities interact, and make their decisions, to individual stories of the \\"grunts\\" upon whom the ramifications of those decisions fell. He commences, as so many others have, with the \\"logic of peace,\\" the settlement that was made at Versailles, and how those decisions led inexorably to the \\"logic of war\\" in only 20 years. The first third of the book covers the politically, social, and intellectual life of the post-war period, and how the ossified political process, coupled with equally ossified military thinking, exemplified by the Maginot Line, would result in France's rapid collapse. The second two thirds covers the six week debacle (for the French), and is detailed military history, with strategy, small unit maneuvers, and General Staff drama.Horne manages to capture the detail that seems to explain the general concept. He quotes Napoleon: \\"Above all, be distrustful of eye-witnesses... the only thing my Grenadiers saw of Russia was the pack of the man in front,\\" in order to raise the issue of the unreliability of eyewitnesses. Better than most of us, he manages to present a balanced account of multiple points of view, but occasionally his personal political convictions (conservative) reveal themselves with a dry, acerbic wit: \\"...no form of literature demonstrated a greater revolt away from reality that the existentialism of young Jean-Paul Sartre and his fellow inmates of the Caf&eacute; Flore in the latter 1930s.\\" Or, \\"In their film going, this dread of war led Sartre and Beauvoir to miss Renoir's classic, \\"La Grande Illusion,\\" by preference seeking escapism in such American farces as \\"My Man Godfrey\\"...\\"Speaking of Sartre, despite Horne's jaundiced view, for those interested in this period, I would highly recommend his \\"Les Chemins de la Libert&eacute;,\\" (The Roads to Freedom), which is available in English in the three volumes, \\"The Reprieve,\\" \\"The Age of Reason,\\" and \\"Troubled Sleep.\\"Horne's books are worth reading just for the quality of the chapter epigraphs that he uses. This book is also accompanied by some excellent maps, and a solid bibliography. He normally writes for an upper English class audience, and assumes they know French. In this volume there is very little un-translated French. I always enjoy his epilogue section the most. After following some individuals throughout the 700 pages, it is fascinating to discover what happened to them in later life, and they range the entire spectrum of fates. Horne concludes by pondering how the French and Germans now zip peacefully across the borders, and wonders: \\"did the First Sedan, the Battle of Verdun, the Second Battle of Sedan have to be fought before Germany and France would lower the frontier barriers between their two countries?\\"The past is not dead, as Faulkner famously proclaimed. Isn't it an equally valid question to ask the \\"children of Abraham,\\" the Arabs and the Jews? How many more battles, before the frontier barriers, particularly of the mind, are removed?"},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"This is a superior narrative history of the fall of France in 1940. Horne examines the political and social changes in France following the end of WW I, and how these affected the French military and their ability to resist the German invasion in 1940. Horne examines the diplomatic and political attempts to resist, in addition to the ineffective military response by the French army and air force. Horne utilized an amazing number of sources and his narrative reads as a novel. I was completely absorbed by this book, and what I found particularly interesting was his examination of all aspects of the Maginot Line. I highly recommend this book, as well as his other work, The Price of Glory: Verdun, 1916."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"It's a good forty years since Alistair Horne wrote \\"To Lose a Battle\\", his account of the German Invasion of Western Europe in May 1940. The third part of his trilogy of books on the conflicts between France and Germany it begins with an account of the French victory parade after The Great War, and moves on through the twenties and thirties, charting the disparate experiences of France and Germany up to the eve of the German invasion. This scene setting takes up a third of the book and includes the political, social, demographic and economic developments in France and Germany with a view to the war to come. He does stretch further a-field to paint a picture of the European scene including that in Britain, the Spanish Civil War, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, and the negotiations between the Soviet Union, France and Britain that failed and gave rise to the Nazi-Soviet pact of August 1939.The invasion itself was a highly fluid affair, a textbook example of movement and the combined use of air and ground forces. The reader, unless they has a firm grasp on the geography of the area and the order of battle, will rather rapidly find themselves bogged down trying to picture the movement of the forces detailed in the text and end up in full sympathy with the confusion in the French command. The most interesting parts are those where ordinary soldiers are quoted, which give an insight into the reality of the war from both sides, including the copious adventures of one Erwin Rommel. The French hardly acquitted themselves well, even taking into account that they were to an extent hamstrung by pre-war decisions of which the Maginot line (almost totally marginal to the battle) is the most blatant. That much is obvious, as well as the strengths of the German planning and their militaries execution of the invasion; whether the British were quite as heroic as Horne states appears to me a little questionable, especially giving the extravagant praise he applies to Lord Gort and the lack of any significant account of what the British Expeditionary Forces were up to in the early stages of the campaign.Reasonably well written (though with enough exclamation marks for a medium sized revolutionary manifesto!), I was left thinking that Horne's view of the build up to and execution of the German invasion of France in 1940 is marred by his particular political outlook (much finger wagging at the left in France) which while obvious, is thankfully rather less crassly partisan than the laudatory footnotes regarding Israel, the 1967 and 1973 wars and Ariel Sharon's prowess on the battlefield. I suspect that this in inevitable in a writer who thanks William Buckley Jr in his acknowledgements, and has had the dubious duty of writing Henry Kissinger's official biography bestowed upon him (bravery or foolishness?). That said, it's not a bad book though I would be a bit shy about calling it impartial scholarship (no references either!), it's more one mans view of the build up to the 1940 invasion and the invasion itself, and despite it's limitations it's still an interesting read, though not in the same class as Horne's seminal work on the Algerian War of Independence (A Savage War of Peace)."},{"Title":"To lose a battle; France 1940","review":"This is a fine one-volume history of the Battle of France.

However, once I picked up this book, I got hooked!When Cody's \\"mom\\" died, Cody inherited the magnificent suite at a luxury hotel where he had been living for many years. The author creates a legal scenario that, while not likely, is certainly plausible. Cody will remain in the suite, paying the going rate from his trust fund. Each night the hotel will try to find him a roommate (Cody hates to be alone) who will get free occupancy of the suite on condition of sharing with the dog. The General Manager is reluctant, but money -- and the threat of the money moving to another hotel -- convinces everyone to accept this unusual arrangement.Cody can understand conversation around him, as well as speech of dogs and cats he encounters. His loveable personality encourages guests to talk to him. Cody learns a lot about the guests and they, in turn, find their lives changing after a night in the suite. Cody sometimes helps the situation along. He listens but he can't talk and never steps outside the physical limitations of the canine species. Only one guest seems able to hear Cody and carry on a real conversation, but the others feel Cody's love and are inspired.It's a feel-good story, no doubt about it, on the order of Miracle at St Cecilia's. We learn what the dog thinks, as we do in the Midnight Louie series (Carol Nelson Douglas) or the Mrs. Murphy series (Rita Mae Brown). Cody reaches out to those who are homeless and orphaned. There's only one villain or threat to Cody and the evil stays hidden, like the backstairs region of the hotel itself.This author, Linda Stubbs, can write. Either she had a good editor or she's a natural. I didn't find myself mentally crossing out excess lines. Her dialogue is flawless. She creates a \\"voice\\" forthe dog that is uniquely his and she captures the different personalities that move around him. And she keeps the emotional suspense up throughout the book: we have romantic liaisons and we can't help wondering what will happen to those we meet.If this edition had been packaged with more elegance, we would be reading it at the browsing tables of leading bookstores. It's not for everyone. But if you have someone on your gift list who's an absolute fanatic about dogs, someone who has to be reminded, \\"He's only a dog!\\" I recommend this book.

But the novel, with its abundance of real science (of that era), always made me want to turn the page, even if it took ninety of those pages just to begin their descent, and just over a hundred more for them to enter the subterraneous world of giant mushrooms, prehistoric reptiles, and colossal troglodytes who herd mastodons (I wonder, is it for their meat, their milk, or both?). The novel ends abruptly: instead of making contact with the Ape Gigans, the men skedaddle topside. I wish Verne would would have (also) written the Saknussemm account of the journey, it would have been fascinating. But he didn't. A great read, but 20,000 Leagues is his all-time best, probably because Nemo is really a shadow of Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature. It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth. He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance. From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather. They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures. The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions. Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other. All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth. Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics. \\"Journey\\" is unique among his work. It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry. Moreover, unlike his other books, \\"Journey\\" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic. Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters. From \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Seas\\" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists: the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action. Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast. Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason. The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous. He simply does what must be done, and is steadfastly loyalt. Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition. Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times. Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster. Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure. Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand. Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay. Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here. He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read. Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar. The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition. It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting. Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.In the grand scheme of things, \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is probably not my favorite Verne book. It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo. It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" It doesn't quite have the pacing of \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\" Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I absolutely loved this story.

Alien Voices attempts to tell the story in a way that would suit a modern audience, while still retaining the spirit of the original. Long, descriptive passages can be circumvented in the aural medium with a few lines of dialogue or sound effects, and tighten the pace.

I read this to my children as they were growing up and the story stayed with us all through the years.PROBLEMS: It is of course dated. This book requires imagination. It is long (44 short chapters).

The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive. I would give this book a very strong four out of five stars because of its ability to keep you wondering what is next."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Reading this book is an amazing adventure, as evidenced by a century of avid readers.

They discover a route to the center of the earth (hence the title), and the novel is about their journey. Once you get 100 pages into this book, you aren't able to stop. The things they find boggle the mind, but seem so real.100 years from now, people will still be enjoying Jules Verne, because he captures the imagination of the young explorer."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Recently I read this book for school.

It takes a while before the team finally starts down to the center of the earth. But one good thing about this is the fact they don't use a drill to go down (They hike instead). Also, sorry to ruin the book, but they don't even make it to the center of earth. The book however is still enjoyable.

It extensively concentrated on rock formations, climates, geology, Paleontology, etc. A science fiction should have some science in it, of course, but there was a lot in Journey to the Center of the Earth.Now, this book was written at a time when people didn't have television, internet and color photography was still young I think. Nothing could paint that picture of the mysterious behaviors of the prehistoric animal or the awe of an underground cavern for you. You had to rely on a really good imagination.

Nice to have it on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"***This review may contain spoilers and is based on the English translation that labels the Professor as \\"Hardwigg\\", his nephew as \\"Harry\\", and their Icelandic equipment porter as \\"Hans\\"***Ironically, Harry was right of course about the Earth's composition. Earth's center is fiery molten iron/nickel core, not a prehistoric underworld. But James Verne was probably not aware of this discomfiting fact when he penned his classic science expedition adventure \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (hereafter, JCE). It's inconsequential, because Verne went ahead and captured the true essence of how an expedition begins, how it is prepared for and equipped, and what data the expedition records. Verne also illuminates the vivid but widely diverse personalities of the three men who embark on this stunning trek, the obsessed leader of the trip Professor Hardwigg, his unwilling but scientifically competent nephew Harry, and the industrious, phlegmatic, dependable Hans (but no duck, Gertrude or otherwise).Professor Hardwigg's discovery of a parchment by the late Arne Saknusseum (hereafter A.S.) launches the tale. \\"A.S.\\" is widely believed to be the first person to reach Earth's center and return alive. Hardwigg eagerly believes the parchment is a road map to the center and attempts to decipher it, without success. On the other hand, Harry's last thing on his mind is a mad, dangerous subterranean trip; he is more interested in marrying his fiancee and enjoying his bourgeois comforts. The manic Hardwigg will have none of it; he insanely vows that he (and Harry) will not eat until the parchment is deciphered. Abstinence and hunger are not among Harry's pastimes, as he describes an ordeal he suffered as a little boy, when he accidentally got stuck in a chimney while trying to remove a bird's nest, and waited for hours for rescue. In a bit of foreshadowing Harry absorbingly describes the hallucinatory toll his hunger took on him, until the chimney masonry his belt is stuck on crumbled and he tumbled to safety. At length, Harry stumbles upon the parchment code; it is not in a non-German, foreign language, but simply in cunning backwards German! Alarmed, Harry attempts to keep Hardwigg from learning the answer, too, but his fast and his compassion for his uncle's mental anguish force him to divulge the secret. To Harry's further alarm, Hardwigg resolves to follow the map and A.S.'s clues (and initials) to Earth's center.However, even the impulsive Hardwigg realizes that he needs careful preparation for the trip. First, in a fairly comic chapter, he compels Harry to overcome his acrophobia (fear of heights) by climbing to the top of their town's church spire repeatedly. After all, a lot of climbing and rapelling will be involved. Next, off they go to Iceland by boat (where Hardwigg, to his irritated embarassment, suffers seasickness). Mount Sneffels, an extinct volcano A.S.'s parchment describes as the doorway to Earth's core, is located there. However, before the ascent and descent, Hardwigg secures the services of the brawny, laconic, and reliable worker and porter Hans. Hans is a workhorse, provided he gets his weekly 3 Icelandic rix-dollars. The trio lay in their supplies: food, climbing gear, bedding, and chronometer (which will measure the depth and distance from Sneffels of their descent. Verne devotes a chapter each to the ascent and descent of Sneffels. Then the expedition begins.As I said, Verne realistically captures the obstacles and obstructions of a scientific expedition, from cave claustrophobia, to rock-slides, to wrong directions, and especially the want of water, which really affects Harry. Although he may seem querulous and whiny to his uncle and to us, Harry is actually quite sensible about the necessities of an expedition. No matter how consumed Hardwigg is with his quest, the trip will fail without water. Only the discovery of internal hot springs and Han's patient release of that torrent saves the trio from thrist and incidentally releases a trickle that will lead to the core.However, as the trio follows the stream, Harry inadvertently gets separated from the group and finds himself lost with almost no food and water. Naturally, he panics and despairs. Fortunately, he is in a cavern that conducts sound well and successfully uses it to call his uncle. By deducing sound's speed through rock, Hardwigg informs the faltering, weak Harry that he is 5 MILES away from them. Nevertheless, Harry stumbles forward until he falls down a shaft and loses consciousness.Harry awakes with a head injury and tender care by his anxious uncle. To his amazement, Harry sees a beach with giant mushrooms and an ocean stretching to the horizon. Meanwhile, Hans is methodically building a raft. After Harry's convalescence, the trio set sail on the Central Sea. They endure storms, lightning, prehistoric ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs and even a magnetic ball that lands on their raft. When they finally reach land, they are stunned and disappointed to learn that the wind pushed them back to where they started! Hardwigg fumes until they find A.S.'s initials in a hole in a seaside cliff. Providence is with them.The trio spend a couple of days exploring the beach and find a treasure trove of ancient fossils. Harry and Hardwigg wax rhapsodic about their finds, especially when they discover an ancient blade that could have only belonged to Saknusseum. Even more shocking, Harry and Hardwigg discover a herd of living mastodons (elephant-like creatures) feeding on trees, and being tended by a giant caveman. At Harry's insistence, they wisely don't get any closer.Finally, the trio enter the cave in the cliff and follow A.S.'s trail until they reach an impassable boulder, which fell after Saknusseum's time. The trio decide to dynamite the boulder. Bad move. The explosion does remove the obstacle, but the seismic shock also causes the sea to pour into the new gap. The trio has barely enough time to ride the swell along the shaft. Along they go (with Harry having an amusing but horrifying dream about an \\"Ape Gigans\\" chasing him) until they improbably enter the shaft of a live volcano with lava about to erupt. At length, the volcano (which turns out to be Stromboli in Italy) spews out the trio. Fabricating a shipwreck tale to describe their haggard appearance, they receive aid from Italian fisherman and a voyage home to a heroes' welcome in Konigstrausse, Germany. Hans receives his proper wages from Hardwigg and returns to Iceland. Impressed by Harry's feat, his fiancee agrees to marry him. However, despite the accolades, Hardwigg is upset because the compass he brought along on the journey no longer pointed north. Harry comes to the \\"rescue\\" by explaining that the magnetic ball on the raft reversed the polarity. Now everyone can be happy.Again, if you can overlook the scientific inaccuracies (including the premise, the impossibility of riding hot lava, and being spewed miles away without death and injury) JCE gives you an exciting, engrossing, easy-to-follow, largely realistic scientific expedition. Through Hardwick, JCE also reminds us expedition leaders NEED to be indomitable, obsessed, and even slightly mad to be effective. Nevertheless, expeditions need to balance the Ahab-like megalomania with cautious, quietly competent, hard-working, and loyal followers (personified by Harry and Hans) to be focused and successful. And yet, I noticed a (I think) slight flaw toward JCE's end. The expedition brought NO tangible evidence that they traveled beneath the earth (of course how could they, being spit out by a volcano?). So why is the Professor and company being feted? The movie version of JCE starring James Mason as the Professor at least acknowledges that oversight by modestly stating that he doesn't deserve the celebrity because he brought no souvenirs of his trip. Oh, well, skip that too and enjoy a fantastic but mostly plausible, well-told, politics-free tale."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Thank you Amazon for choosing A Journey to the Center of the Earth as one of your free Kindle downloads.

The science is dated and even a little silly, however it does not take away from the story. Not the most memorable of the (Classics) I have read but an enjoyable read all the same.."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have \\"repast\\". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago. I highly recommend you read this, if you haven't already. This is classic science fiction. Like I said at the beginning, it's an oldie but a goodie."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Yes there are different versions, The best one is the original in French. There are more than one translations into english, one with the Main character's name as Harry, the other as Axel.I read the 'Harry' version first, but only partway through as it was terrible! I thought Verne was a bad writter or something. But, when I was older, I found another copy (Puffin Classics btw), and I thought I'd give it another go. That was one of the best books I had ever read, it funny and imaginative. The characters even had character!Well, I looked into it, and compared my new version with the first book I had read and both of them with the original. Mine was pretty close. The names were kept the same, most of the sentences were similar in structure (so that someone like me who can't read french could tell that they were the same book).The 'Harry version' however, invented entire chapters out of thin air, discarded others and changed significant plot points. I hope this helps some of you decide which one to get, and that there is more than one translation.If the book starts with:\\"ON 24 May 1863, a Sunday, my uncle, Professor Lidenbrock, came rushing back towards his little house at No.19 Konigstrasse, one of the oldest streets...\\"You know you have the good version.Otherwise, I love this book and would recomend it to anyone, whether a science fiction fan or not."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This kindle edition is based on the 1871 translation which slightly abridged and altered Verne's original (for example, the Professor is here named Hardwigg, rather than the original's Lidenbrock, and his niece is here named Gretchen rather than Grauben). That's probably the most generally known English translation (it's the one I read obsessively as a child), and it's still a great read, but sticklers for textual accuracy might want to do a little more searching.As to the novel itself, while unquestionably one of Verne's masterpieces in terms of story, it's probably the one that's aged the hardest of all Verne's works, and almost all of the science in this text has been exploded, modified, or simply changed by the intervening hundred and fifty-odd years of scientific development. Because Verne was in part intending this book to be a source of scientific education, the characters spend a lot of time talking about geology, archaeology, etc., to each other, and since most of that's outdated now, modern readers may want to skip over the more scientific chunks of the book and simply read it as an exploration tale.From that perspective, the most interesting thing about this book might be that it's arguably the progenitor of the \\"Lost Prehistoric World\\" genre, and readers who want more in that vein might want to look up later books that focused more squarely on modern-explorers-in-dinosaur-country stories, such as Arthur Conan Doyle'sThe Lost World, or Edgar Rice Burrough's novel _The Land that Time Forgot_ or his _Pellucidar_ series (explicitly set in the hollow interior of the globe)."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is a classic novel by Jules Verne.

The science in this science fiction flies largely in the face of modern science, yet the read is no less gripping today than it was in its infancy. The story is pretty simple. Professor Lidenbrock, a neurotically impatient scientist, discovers a cryptic manuscript written by a long-dead explorer; with the help of his nephew, he decodes the cryptogram to read an account of a journey to the center of the earth begun beneath a dormant volcano in Iceland. The nephew, Axel, a talented geologist and mineralogist himself, refuses to believe that the core of the earth is not exceedingly hot; additionally, he cares more about Grauben, the eccentric professor's ward, than risking his life on a scientific adventure. He proves unable to dissuade his uncle and thus joins with him on a journey to Iceland. There, they hire a stoic Icelander to lead them down into the earth. Most of the action takes place underground, with the adventurers suffering several trials, daring risks, and finally discovering a whole new world hidden miles below the earth's crust. The ultimate trial and danger they face consists of returning to the surface.Axel narrates the story, and the strength of the novel lies in his character. The professor and the Icelandic guide are unusual personalities, but Axel is very real and easy to relate to. He really does not want to go in the first place, and he is most liable to greet dangers and risks by bemoaning his fate and declaring his party done for in their foolish efforts. It is he who suffers the most privation when the men's water runs out, and it is he who finds himself lost in the utter blackness of the caverns for three days. When things are going well, though, Axel becomes wildly excited about the mission and temporarily forgets about his fears. This all goes to make him a very sympathetic character. Without him, the story would be a rather dispassionate account of an impossible journey by bland, unbelievable characters. You do have to shift your mind into low gear a few times when the characters begin speaking about the different types of minerals and rocks they are encountering, but overall the plot is rather thrilling, and you cannot help but begin early on trying to ascertain a way in which the intrepid explorers can return to share their discoveries with a skeptical scientific community. Verne knows how to tell a story, and you don't have to know a single thing about science to enjoy this novel immensely."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is a wonderful book by Jules Verne but this is just a terrible translation. Just read the first page of the preview and you will see. e.g. \\"Our good Martha could not but think she was very much behind-hand with the dinner\\" Is that even English? Seek out William Butcher's wonderful translation of this great story by Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is an exiting book full of adventure. It is about three people named Hans, Professer Hardwigg and his nephew Harry. The story takes place when Professer Hardwigg discovers a piece of parchment with the name of a famous explorer that went to the center of the Earth. Professer Hardwigg wants to do the same. They climb in to Mt.Sneffles with a guide named Hans. They have lots of adventures with prehistoric animals and travel in places you wouldn't even expect. The ending is very exiting but you will have to read it to find out. I recomend this book to people who like adventure stories. I think it is a great book ."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"THIS NOTE PERTAINS TO THIS AND ALL OTHER EDITIONS OF THIS TITLE. To clarify the isue of \\"two versions\\" and the confusion this creates, any version of this great novel mentioning Professor \\"Hardwigg\\" is a literary fraud, a complete re-write, and not a translation of Verne at all. The would-be Verne-improver changed characters' names and many plot details.The shame is that this old bogus version is still not recognized as such and is still being sold as if it were truly Verne. Sadly, this is the one many of us grew up reading. Any true translation (such as in this Puffin Classic) identifies the professor as \\"Li(e)denbrock\\" (and that is how you can easily distinguish the real vs. the sham). There are old translations that get it right, but in modern times two translations stand out: one by Robert Baldick (this one) and one by William Butcher. They are both good, the difference mainly being a matter of style. Some prefer Butcher; I happen to prefer Baldick. Don't let the fact that Baldick's may appear in a children's imprint deter you from considering it. It appeared first in 1965 as an adult Penguin book, and twenty years later (unchanged) as a Puffin. Butcher's is more recent and, as he is a noted Verne scholar, his credentials certainly carry weight. But that doesn't make him a better wordsmith. We read Verne primarily for fun and for the thrill of adventure. Baldick's translation enables us to do just that. I highly recommend his translation in this Puffin edition to anyone, child or adult. But whichever edition of this wonderful novel you may be considering for purchase, and no matter who translates it, give it the Lidenbrock (READ) vs. Hardwigg (AVOID) test to be certain you are reading the actual story Verne intended."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is some sort of re-write, perhaps for American audiences?

A late 19th century French writer, he influenced many people with his enthusiasm for things scientific. In Voyage, the protagonists are a scientist (who discovers a message indicating a journey to the center of the earth is possible), his reluctant nephew, and the quiet-man native guide. An expedition is organized immediately, and the adventure begins. Once you get past the writing style which may be strange to the modern reader, and you suspend your disbelief on certain things (like just how many supplies they were capable of carrying), the tale can captivate. Here is a writer who relishes the scientific advances and discoveries of his age, and is writing about them. The reader can absorb the geologic understandings of the period, as well as the way in which the scientific community operated. It is the age of the gentleman scientist, the ancestor to Indiana Jones. And Verne's delight is infectious. By modern standards it's less exciting than, say, a Jurassic Park. But there's underground seas, strange animals and plants, delirious visions, and hardships of thirst and being lost in the dark to entertain you. Be aware of different translations: our book group had much hilarity discovering the differences in our editions: some seemed edited and condensed compared to the others (and as it's not copyright protected, some of our tattered paperbacks didn't even give the original date or the translator's name), some had wonderful illustrations, some had illustrations that apparently were for a different book, and some had none. Some editions had footnotes, which were interesting in their own way, apparently dating from the original French. There are even different names for the uncle and nephew. Judging from my translation (one of the uncredited ones), it's no great literary effort. But it's entertaining enough to keep one reading, and to amazed at this seminal storyteller and his influences on many who followed him."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I've just recently found out about the different translations of this book. The Sterling Classic is the \\"good\\" translation.

I had to explain that the movie had references to the book and that the main characters used the book as research. My son was mystified. He asked if he could have the book to read it. I immediately called up the Amazon store on my iPhone and ordered the book for him. This specific version was so terribly inexpensive I could not go wrong (even better with my Prime account). A few days later the book arrived and my son began reading it. About a week or so later he has finished it and loved it. I noticed that he just checked out \\"20000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" so I think he has been bitten by the \\"Big Boy Book\\" bug. These books are among the first books he has read front to back that included NO PICTURES (yeah). It is great to see him dive into it like he did."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"It had been many years since I had read a Jules Verne novel, and to be honest, I couldn't recall his skill as a writer at all. When I dug this book off of my bookshelf I admit, I was simply bored and looking for something mindless to read while the children fought over gluing cotton balls to construction paper.I admit that it took my mind a while to re-acclimate to the writing style of the time, not that it was difficult to read, it was just far too easy to skim. So, bringing my mind to a screeching halt, I sat down and began to truly read this wonderful novel. Let me begin with saying that the science in the novel is extremely outdated but at the time of it's writing, was plausible. If you can get your mind past the huge hurtle of your current scientific knowledge, you can appreciate this book for what it is: a brilliant science fiction/adventure novel. The conventions of the time include misunderstandings of the makeup of the earth, and the propensity to marry one's own cousins.The book is written in the form of a diary at times, and a retelling at times, of events that had passed previously. The voice of the book is the character Harry, nephew and assistant to Professor Von Hardwigg. The novel begins with the professor's discovery of a secret parchment which when decoded gives the location that a previous explorer used to enter the bowels of the earth. The immediately set out to follow in the footsteps of this great explorer of centuries before. Joining them is Hans, the apparent superman of Iceland. He never complains, rarely talks, and saves the lives of those around him on a regular basis. I cannot help but to believe that this is Verne's ideal man, his \\"Adonis\\" if you will. The Professor, though he loves Harry, is a closet ADHD case hidden behind a brilliant and stubborn mind. There is great adoration for his nephew, on those occasions when he stops moving or talking long enough to notice him. Harry, who is telling the story, is easily written off as a coward; however he is so much more than that if you take into account the beliefs of the time. He is following his uncle on a dangerous journey into the unknown to a place he does not even believe exists. (Harry's beliefs are far closer to the reality that we understand, however in this novel they are all completely incorrect)Upon entering the depths of the earth many hardships and terrors await the three, ranging from dehydration, starvation, dinosaurs, many falls, getting separated, raging storms on underground seas and volcanic eruptions. I won't go into great detail suffice to say that the movie, though highly entertaining, does no justice to this story. Spray painted iguanas with horns are far from what is described in this book. If you have spare time on you hands, this is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it to anyone. There is a reason that this is considered \\"Literature.\\"4 of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Journey To the Center of the Earth was always one of my favorite movies and after all these years, I finally read the book. The book is not like the movie at all. Honestly, I liked the movie better however that is not to say I was in any way disappointed with the book. It moved along quickly and drew me in such that I couldn't put it down and so read it in one sitting. A geologist, his eager young nephew and an Icelandic guide make their way to the earth's core following the footsteps of a previous mysterious explorer into the dark subterranean world of weird plants, animals, rocks and unforeseen dangers. There was no woman with them as in the movie but a female companion might have spiced it up a bit. The Icelander didn't have a pet duck along as in the movie but he was an indispensible partner in the venture. All in all, it was adventurous and fun and worth my time. I enjoyed it very much. Sure glad I finally read the book!Betsy"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Lost races, dinosaurs, volcanoes, what more could a kid want?

The German Professor Van Hardwigg, his teenage nephew Harry, and their stolid Icelandic guide, Hans, descend into the dormant volcano, Mount Sneffels, in Iceland at the end of June in the 1860s. According to a centuries old Icelandic manuscript by the sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm--Professor Hardwigg accidentally discovers the manuscript--at exactly twelve noon the early summer light of June would reveal the correct path to take in the volcano. And so, after a few overcast days, when it appears that the mission will have to wait another year, the explorers see their last glimpse of the noonday sun for two months.Verne is brilliant at blending science, history, and art to make his fiction seem realistic. The effect is that a has both a renewed interest in science and history while experiencing a memorable imaginative journey. As the explorers follow false leads, despair of ever finding water and food, become lost and then found, and face unexpected, unreal dangers, Verne captures the sense of confinement of being underground. For much of the early part of the book, the descriptions lack color and the reader almost must adjust his eyes to the light of the men's torches. The center of the book, in contrast, like the near center of the earth, is beautiful, literally creating a new world within a world.In terms of characterization, Harry expresses the explorer's angst while his uncle gives voice to the explorer's elation. Upon seeing the extinct Mount Sneffels for the first time, Harry thinks, \\"To descend into the interior of a cannon when perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of a madman.\\" (Harry's words will later ring true). According to Harry, his uncle seeing the same sight \\"looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.\\" Meanwhile Hans, the guide, is imperturbable, steady, and taciturn; he adds comic relief to the uncle's and nephew's extremes. As long as Hans receives his weekly wages, paid on Sunday, he is oblivious to all danger.Of the Verne novels that I have read, this is my second favorite novel, next to_ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_. There are two harrowing middle chapters, \\"Alone\\" and \\"Lost\\"--the sentence for the review comes from these chapters--in _Journey to the Center of the Earth_ which are unforgettable, and the conclusion of the book is ingenious. The plot is unpredictable and clever. Verne conveys the triumph and fear of the explorer during the nineteenth-century, a period when science became ascendant.The book delighted French readers in the late 1800s--in fact, French children would eagerly look forward to Verne's latest before the Christmas holidays. Similarly delighted, I read much of the book on my commute to work on the subway, and looked forward to it in the morning and early evening."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center was an excellent book because instead of the usual facts that are written down he tells us a story that has theories and facts of the earth included with in the storyline. Most of the book takes place in the earth itself, but in the beginning most of it takes place in Iceland. This book is about a professor and his nephew that make a discovery that there is a way down to the center of the earth if they ascend down a mountain in Iceland. On they're way they meet a guide that leads them to the mountain called Mt. Sneffels. After that they descend down in to the mountain. They keep going down toward the center. They face many dangers and difficulties, such as thirst, light, getting lost, some injuries and fatigue. Later in the book they make discoveries that other scientist would have thought that they never existed. Jules Verne went straight into the story after giving the characters an introduction. The story was really good because it kept you in to the book and it also was fun to read while you learn something's as well. Compared to other books like this one I find that Journey to the Center of the Earth was better than the others. That is just my opinion though. Jules Verne did an excellent job on writing this book. He includes facts like how the earth is made up. This book is very informative without you realizing that you can learn things. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and science related books because this book is packed with adventure and has a lot of facts related to science. When you finish this book you finish it with new knowledge."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen. Overall I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that this review will help anyone interested in reading it or people just reviewing it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's classic novel Journey to the Center of the Earth is a must read for any science fiction book lovers. I rate this book four stars because this book has great imagery and is very believable considering the fact that this journey never took place.This book deserves four stars because Verne's imagination makes this book an easy read with his use of vivid descriptions of the journey. The journey starts off with a scientist who finds a map to the center of the earth. Himself, his nephew, and a guide journey down an old volcano towards the center of the earth. On their journey they find all kinds of, thought to be extinct, animals and cavemen.Although the three men find many exciting things they also encounter many hardships. The men are suffering from lack of food because they are miles from the surface of the earth, and they lack water because there are no water sources nearby. The men somehow find a river that is boiling hot due to the fact that they are inside a dormant volcano. When they find the underground world they also get food from the wild plants growing around them.In my opinion this book is one of the greatest science fiction books that I have read. Jules Verne is an excellent writer who wrote many great books. This book is about three men who go on an expedition to the center of the earth. The question that you have to ask yourself before you read this is will they make it out alive. Well you will have to find out yourself by reading this great novel."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Read this translation and not the British newspaper serial one. In some of the other Journey editions the names and nationalities of characters are changed and the first chapter reads differently. To check if you have an honest translation, see if the professor is named Lidenbrock (correct) or Hardwigg (fake).The characters on this mission boldly go where no man has gone before. They resemble some of the cast on American space voyage shows of the sixties. The Icelandic guide Hans is like Spock, stoic, unconcerned with ordinary problems and fearless.Prof. Lidenbrock is not really like Kirk, because he is not emotional. He is actually a lot like Spock also. In fact, Hans and Prof. Lidenbrock are both heroic figures.Axel the teenager(?) on the trip is more like Kirk. He feels emotions, often fear or regret. He also never wanted to go on the journey in the first place, and thus has some aspects in common with Dr. Smith of Lost in Space. However, morally Axel is as upright as the others.Verne took great care to place realistic details in his story. The early chapters where Lidenbrock and company visit 19th-century Iceland are not so much science fiction as they are travel literature, and Verne mastered that genre as well."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is definitely a must read for science fiction aficionados and classic fiction lovers alike. Verne's sense of humor and incredible imagination make for a mostly credible, and quite enjoyable tale of a young man who accompanies his uncle on the journey of a lifetime.For the time in which it was written, it was groundbreaking in citing evolution. Darwin had only published his Origin of the Species 7 years prior to this novel's publication 1867. Verne embraces the theories presented in Origin of the Species, as well as drawing in other discoveries made in scientific circles of the time that support such theories. Verne also takes care to describe and explain many of the other scientific theories and ideas of the age presented in the book in such a way that he ensured Journey to the Center of the Earth will remain a classic for years to come.

The book requires some suspension of belief that three men can travel hundreds of miles underground for months without fresh air and limited supplies, not to mention find fantastic prehistoric creatures living underground, but if you can look past the logic you can still enjoy it. The professor's arguments for the center of the earth not being a molten core are almost convincing, even if we know he's wrong. I found the professor to be the most interesting character in the novel.

Verne conveys the triumph and fear of the explorer during the nineteenth-century, a period when science became ascendant.The book delighted French readers in the late 1800s--in fact, French children would eagerly look forward to Verne's latest before the Christmas holidays. Similarly delighted, I read much of the book on my commute to work on the subway, and looked forward to it in the morning and early evening."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen. Overall I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that this review will help anyone interested in reading it or people just reviewing it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Read this translation and not the British newspaper serial one. In some of the other Journey editions the names and nationalities of characters are changed and the first chapter reads differently. To check if you have an honest translation, see if the professor is named Lidenbrock (correct) or Hardwigg (fake).The characters on this mission boldly go where no man has gone before. They resemble some of the cast on American space voyage shows of the sixties. The Icelandic guide Hans is like Spock, stoic, unconcerned with ordinary problems and fearless.Prof. Lidenbrock is not really like Kirk, because he is not emotional. He is actually a lot like Spock also. In fact, Hans and Prof. Lidenbrock are both heroic figures.Axel the teenager(?) on the trip is more like Kirk. He feels emotions, often fear or regret. He also never wanted to go on the journey in the first place, and thus has some aspects in common with Dr. Smith of Lost in Space. However, morally Axel is as upright as the others.Verne took great care to place realistic details in his story. The early chapters where Lidenbrock and company visit 19th-century Iceland are not so much science fiction as they are travel literature, and Verne mastered that genre as well."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is definitely a must read for science fiction aficionados and classic fiction lovers alike. Verne's sense of humor and incredible imagination make for a mostly credible, and quite enjoyable tale of a young man who accompanies his uncle on the journey of a lifetime.For the time in which it was written, it was groundbreaking in citing evolution. Darwin had only published his Origin of the Species 7 years prior to this novel's publication 1867. Verne embraces the theories presented in Origin of the Species, as well as drawing in other discoveries made in scientific circles of the time that support such theories. Verne also takes care to describe and explain many of the other scientific theories and ideas of the age presented in the book in such a way that he ensured Journey to the Center of the Earth will remain a classic for years to come. A wonderful work definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I can't believe I'm only the 3rd person to review this masterpiece of science fiction! And that's what it really is, a masterpiece. Writing a good story doesn't need to have symbolism, satire, cariacature of modern people or place. It need only have the basic aspects of this book: Good story, feasible plot, interesting characters, and a vivid imagination.I am not a scientist, not in the least, and so I cannot make any disclaimer about scientific information as printed in the book (ie; is heat stored in the core of the planet vs. just in the crust, etc.) but from the time the Professor, his nephew, and Hans enter the volcano on Iceland, you *will* be hooked, because the manner of storytelling is very strong here. Every word printed comes to life in your mind as it would on the big screen. And when you go on that journey with them you will find treasures that you'll remember. Realistic this book might not be, but Verne was definitely a man ahead of his time.You won't be able to put it down, this I promise!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Just before I forget, make sure to check out the movie &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; with Jeremy London and that other guy whose name I just can't remember.

Becuase the story is told in a journal-like fashion, the action sequences are abridged somewhat; but there is still some excitement in this book. Though somewhat dated (many of the theories Verne relied on when writing his descriptions about the center of the Earth have since been disproven) this book is still an excellent read.

We read this book together as the school bought multiple copies. We graphed an excitement level graph to keep track of the adventure.

I think we owe it to this brilliant man to at least read his books the way he intended them!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"For those interested in the history of science fiction, it can be debated as to who wrote the first science fiction story. My personal choice has always been Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein, but others have argued for Poe or others. Then there are Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, who were more-or-less the first true science fiction authors, that is, authors who really wrote in that genre.Verne predates Wells, but I still can see argument for Wells being given priority. Wells seems to have done more to give the genre definition; Wells is more interested in using the fiction to speculate about the future and the nature of man. Verne, on the other hand, uses science more for a plot device to tell adventure stories. Probably it's impossible to ever settle the matter, but the way I see it, Wells was the deeper thinker, but Verne was the more entertaining writer.Journey to the Center of the Earth is a typical Verne story. In it, the narrator Axel relates the story of an adventure with his uncle and guardian, the esteemed Professor Otto Lidenbrock. Lidenbrock has stumbled upon an old parchment, which when translated, tells of a passage to the center of the Earth through a volcano in Iceland. Axel, well-educated himself, is more skeptical than his obsessed uncle, but is compelled to go along (it doesn't help when Axel's fiancee thinks the journey is a good idea.The bulk of the novel deals with the trip to Iceland (where they pick up an assistant, Hans), then to the extinct volcano, and finally into the bowels of the Earth. What they find there defies their expectations, and I won't spoil any of the fun by revealing it.Like other Verne tales I have read, this one is written with a light touch and is an easy read (Wells is a bit more inconsistent in this regard). Compared with today's works, this is pretty tame and simple, but for its time, it must have been a lot of fun. In fact, it's still pretty entertaining, and if you're a science fiction fan, this is a good look at one of the early works in the field."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"First, let me say, try to get your hands on the \\"complete unabridged\\" translation of this novel, since there are several apocryphal (i.e., abridged) translations, which are more like adaptations than faithful renderings of the French.The Deus ex Machina at the end is a bit cheesy--how in the world could three men on a raft survive a volcanic gunshot to the Earth's surface? But the novel, with its abundance of real science (of that era), always made me want to turn the page, even if it took ninety of those pages just to begin their descent, and just over a hundred more for them to enter the subterraneous world of giant mushrooms, prehistoric reptiles, and colossal troglodytes who herd mastodons (I wonder, is it for their meat, their milk, or both?). The novel ends abruptly: instead of making contact with the Ape Gigans, the men skedaddle topside. I wish Verne would would have (also) written the Saknussemm account of the journey, it would have been fascinating. But he didn't. A great read, but 20,000 Leagues is his all-time best, probably because Nemo is really a shadow of Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This was an entertaining read, but kind of ridiculous, and ultimately not very satisfying. The main premise of the book is that there exists an entrance (through a volcano) into the depths of the Earth, that leads to an entire subterranean world. When the book was written, I believe this was considered - if not plausible - at least a possibility. And that's fine. Even today, the deepest hole ever drilled is only 7.6 miles deep, and we know surprisingly little about what lies beneath the Earth's crust. So I'm on board with ignoring the inconvenient matter of geothermal heat. You want me to imagine a subterranean world? No problem; I'm happy to suspend disbelief.But then Verne goes and botches all the details that needn't have been botched! His protagonists go without water for seven days, while wandering through underground passages. They get thirsty - yes - but they still have energy enough to chip through a foot of granite with a pick axe and a crowbar. Reaching a subterranean ocean, they build a raft out of a few logs, and sail it through a veritable gale, without the craft falling apart, and without losing any of their provisions. Later, they ride this raft at 120 miles per hour as it first descends and then ascends through a giant hole in the earth. And eventually, they are blown out of the top of an active volcano, whence upon they casually walk away from the flowing streams of lava.I am an evangelist for what I call \\"realism in fantasy\\". My opinion is that a good story requires consistency. In this case, Verne wants us to imagine that the world we live in contains a hitherto unexplored land beneath its surface. Cool! But in the real world people need water. People can't chip through 1 foot of granite with a pick axe. And people do not ride rafts through storms on oceans. The alternative that we are left with, then, is that the world Verne describes is *not* the real world...which of course ruins the magic of imagining that it is. I think this could have been a great book. Instead, Verne misses the mark by a mile."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I grew up on the James Mason movie, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (1959), so it was quite a shocker to read the book. You could imagine to my dismay the absents of quite a few characters and the center of the story is Germany not Scotland.Now for avid readers you could care less about old movies, I can truthfully say that this is one of Jules Verne's best stories and well told.What you will find more interesting and fun about this tale is the characters and their interaction. One of my favorite parts is when Harry who did not want to go to the center of the earth with his uncle, Professor Hardwigg; he turned to his affianced, Gretchen, and was planning on her to stop him. Her answer is shockingly disappointing to him.\\"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long as man's heart beats, as long as man's flesh quivers, I do not allow that being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair\\"Be prepared as the bulk of the book is really a geological journey back through time and forward again painfully spelled out by Harry whom is the first person narrator.The Kindle version does not have actual picture of the runes in chapter 1. Moreover, a tad off on pronunciations. Other than that, it is more than worth obtaining along with a hard copy for your library.Journey to the Center of the Earth"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature. It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth. He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance. From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather. They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures. The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions. Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other. All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth. Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics. \\"Journey\\" is unique among his work. It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry. Moreover, unlike his other books, \\"Journey\\" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic. Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters. From \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Seas\\" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists: the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action. Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast. Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason. The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous. He simply does what must be done, and is steadfastly loyalt. Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition. Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times. Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster. Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure. Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand. Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay. Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here. He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read. Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar. The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition. It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting. Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.In the grand scheme of things, \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is probably not my favorite Verne book. It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo. It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" It doesn't quite have the pacing of \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\" Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I absolutely loved this story. The beginning dragged some but after 20 pages the story is rolling. Verne's imagination into unknown territory and his scientific reasoning is fascinating. Very good read!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I have never read the hard cover version of Journey to the Center of the Earth. I have only seen the movie done a number of years ago by British actors so my review may be tainted. I very much enjoyed this Audio tape. Nimoy and deLancie are definately sci-fi favorites. I feel the portrail of Professor Lidenbrock was too harsh while at the same time the portrail of Axel was too weak. Professor Lidenbrock seem angry all the time rather than a curious scientist. Axel was afraid all the time and did nothing but wish to return to the surface. The music and sound effects added very much to the overall story and was done very well. I would recommend the audio cassette to anyone interested in a different format but don't expect something as riviting as a book or the movie. I will try other Alien Voice cassettes but hope others will be played out more interestingly."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This classic is a decent to good read, although the science may be a bit out-dated (I am the master of understatement) and the modern reader might find the prose a bit dry. Still a good read for the avid reader."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I found this book to be dissatisfying. Joseph Campbell speaks of the Hero Cycle involving many things, such as a dismemberment or crucifixion being associated with the threshold crossing. As the trio enters the volcano, there is nothing horrendous about their passage. There is no \\"elixir theft,\\" although Arne Saknusemm's dagger could have fit the bill. Lastly, there is no real character development. You have the clash and tension between Harry and the Professor: young-old, scientist-novice, driven-reluctant. But there is not enough to drive the story, and no enchantment.There are some mythic elements, but they seem a bit haphazard. They exit the earth, the \\"belly of the whale,\\" by way of a torrent and lava, the Masonic fire and water trial. IT pushes them out and up, in a mock rebirth. Then they land in paradisiacal Italy, contrasting with cold and dead Iceland. This is the motif of a \\"sacred grove,\\" but it is never utilized fully.Furthermore, there are some structural problems. Specially, Verne has two backtracks. The first is in Chapter 18, when they take the wrong road, and then Chapter 33, with the storm blowing the raft back to the starting point. Aesthetically, this is wonderful parallelism, but by the time you get to the discovery and the back track, you feel cheated. All the reading you have done up to that point was pointless.The ending is rushed, and the denouement seems like a slipknot at times. I would have preferred a bit drawn out enduing and the possibility of a sequel. After all, who is Arne Saknusemm, and is there more to mysterious and even Christic figure? He is a Buddha, an enlightened one who leads the way for other to follow as they go through the underworld that is middle earth.It is Verne's second book, so he is still in the process of becoming \\"Verne\\" or the icon we have depicted in \\"Back To The Future III.\\" Despite my criticism, you do see the wonderful characters and Technicolor and three-dimensional scientists at work. They are not the flat logic boxes or computing machines, like Sherlock Holmes, or the campy \\"Professor\\" cutout character on bad TV programming.Vern can spin a yarn, and mix enough technical scientific detail to make it believable. I am not familiar with Verne's scientific background, but he understands that science is merely part of the backdrop to any science fiction story.Leonard Nemoy's afterward in the Signature Books Edition (0451528964) is worth reading. He does an analysis between the father-son relationship of Harry and th Professor. He caught things that I had missed, in my frustration of the backtracking problems. Read after reading the text."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Yea, yea, I know this one is a \\"classic\\". But sheesh, it's just not a good story imho. So much of it spent in the bickering between the professor and his nephew, and the \\"science\\" part of the science fiction really seems to be missing in most places. And I just flat out didn't like the reader for the audiobook. I go through a lot of audiobooks, and I consider this to be one of the worst I've listened to."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"A lumbering read, alot of talk about the ground. Three characters, one is monosybolic, one is TOTALLY commited and the first person account whines all the time. He wants to hook-up with his cousin. Hmmm. A read to say you have read it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"One thing I did not realize about the book Journey to the Center of the Earth was that it was originally written in French by Jules Verne. This book is my first reading of any of his works, and after reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, I am somewhat apprehensive but feel confident in reading more of his other books. The story of Journey to the Center of the Earth is started out beautifully &agrave; la in the prose of John Steinbeck, and I thought I was going to be taken on a great ride. Somehow, I was getting more disappointed as the more I got to know to Professor Lidenbrock, who of course influenced the creation of the Doc character from Back to the Future, because he is such a hard-headed a-hole. I just didn't like the one-dimensional mindedness that he carries along with his absolute pedantic method that makes me want to punch his nose every time he goes on his \\"I am right, and you are wrong\\" argument. Therefore, I felt sorry for the nephew who had to put up with him. In the meanwhile, the journey to the center of the earth begins in Iceland which influenced me greatly to look up the internet the history of the country and the pictures, so anytime I think of the book, Iceland will come to my mind, or vice-versa. Of course, the feeling of the adventurous trip is much akin to Indiana Jones movies except the sacrilegious fourth part. Before that journey was embarked, I just can't help but feel how utterly stupid the idea is and the nonsensical undertaking is. Then again, I have to remind myself that the book is purely science fiction. I want to make two points of mention from early chapters of the book. The nephew is right in calculating the number of combinations twenty letters can make but only twenty distinct (no repeats) letters. How the math is done is that it is 20 times 19 times 18 times 17 times...3 times 2 times 1 letters (multiplication format, as I mean). Actually, this is not a combination but rather a permutation. So, that's a small change in the wording but a big difference because the ordering of the words does not matter at all during combinations yet the nephew is concerned about putting the words in an order which is exactly the definition of permutation. The next point which I think the uncle made a serious error when it came to calculating the temperature of the center of the earth. He said that the radius of the earth is over 4,000 miles and to go to the center, it takes one degree for every seventy feet below. In end, he calculated the temperature of the center to be over two million degrees. Whether that is in Centigrade, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, he doesn't say. There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so in 4,000 miles, we have 2.1 x 10^7 feet (or 21 billion feet) and then to divide that by 70 feet, we get 301,714 degrees. If that is in Centigrade, then it is 543,117 degrees Fahrenheit. If it's the other way, then it is 167,601 degrees Celsius and also 167,874 Kelvins. So, the uncle is wrong, wrong, wrong! Of course, he goes further with more techno babble elsewhere in the book that I can't really say if he is right or not because I have zero expertise in geology. In short, a guy like Andy Dufresne would immensely enjoy reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if that book influenced him to take up geology. On a second thought, as for myself, I think I will do so the same and credit the book for sparking my interest. As for the reading of the adventure to the end, I think Jules Verne has really captured my attention because of the rush and tension that came with the journey, but too bad that every chapter was spoiled by its heading. For example, Chapter 22 is the search of water, and the next Chapter kills the suspense with its heading \\"We Find Water.\\" Another is Chapter 28 where the nephew is in the dark the whole time and is completely lost and I wonder if he gets rescued. The next two chapters come with the heading \\"I Hear Voices\\" and \\"Saved.\\" Hey...thanks a lot...way to go...lovely....really lovely. Of course, during the trip, I can't stand the uncle and was dying to finish the book and be done with it because of him. All in all, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a great read that is suitable for all ages although a great deal of suspension of disbelief is required, and I only ask for the uncle to be replaced with somebody else with a better personality."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This book was the equivalent of a 3D movie in the 1800's, meaning it had virtually no plot, but lots of visual effects.

While some people like this kind of writing, I certainly didn't."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"The book Journey the the Centre of the Earth was not as good as I had expected it to be considering that the other novels that Jules Verne has written have been better. In my view, I would have to say that there was too much science terms and in doing so it made things extremely confusing. I would definetly never reccomend this book to anyone unless they really like science novels. I think that the book described things a little fully and at a point I was bored. I only found about three pages that actually engrossed me into the book. There was a beginning middle and an end but the middle was very long. There was no lesson learned in the story therefore not alot of meaning.

It was detailed, which is usually good, but add too much detail as Verne did in this novel and you begin to lose interest while waiting for something to happen. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old son and he really liked it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"The book A Journey to the Center of the Earth, by Jules Verne has many different pros and cons. One of the pros of the book is that it sometimes has some explanations of difficult or important things. Another pro is that it is on a very interesting topic, which of course is going to the center of the earth. It has a few attention-grabbing parts as well. It is a very good book if you are interested in rocks and geology and science in general. But this book also has many cons. These cons outweigh the pros most of the time. An important one is that it gets very confusing. The main character is known by two names, either Harry or Henry. It makes it harder to understand what is going on. Another thing that makes it hard to understand is that Jules Verne's choice of words do not help the reader work out the actions taking place well. Another con, and probably the biggest one, is that sometimes it becomes quite boring because it is like reading a textbook with endless explanations of different types of rocks, theories, and scientific happenings. It is also repetitive because the narrator goes over the theory on how the earth formed several times. The ending was pretty disappointing as well. I would only recommend this book if you have a great interest in scientific theories or geology. It goes extensively through the different stages or the formation of the earth, the stages of evolution, about the different layers of the earth and how certain features below the earth's surface were created. If you aren't interested in that type of stuff you may find most parts of this book extremely boring. Overall I think this book was average despite of its many errors."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"No doubt about it, Verne and Burroughs invented the &quot;under-the-earth&quot; fantasy genre. Any geology fan or &quot;rock hound&quot; must read these novels! Even today, the genre continues. Witness modern examples like, Emerson's &quot;The Riddle of Cthulhu,&quot; and the new movie, the &quot;The Core.&quot;"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"As a person living in a country with about 130 active volcanoes, I like the story about them. I myself like to have a journey to the crater of a volcano. One of the exciting story about volcanoes is this book. Though it is somewhat surealistic, Jules Verne was able to present a life-like story that is able to draw the readers' minds, as if as they were in the story themselves. Through his words, we can feel the beauty of the scenery in Iceland, the suspense and thrill of the characters' adventure, the imagination of the living creatures inside the earth, and the joy of the characters after their success in 'go down to the centre of the earth and back in three pieces (the Professor, Harry, and Hans)'. After all, this book is pleasant to read, especially if you like an adventure story!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is the most exciting and adventurous story ever written. Here's the deal: you got a bunch of people trying to tkae a walk. Where are they walking, do you ask? Why, only the the center of the Earth. The images that this conjures are just breathtaking and it's full of suspense and edge of your seat excitement. Verne just takes a painting, a masterpiece and depicts a massive underground ocean and a raging storm, all while in the center of the Earth. No, they don't actually make it all the way, but you root and you cheer, crossing your fingers, hoping they don't slip and fall. Then you're sort of disappointed when they don't make it, but who cares, they went on a journey even the slightest fraction of a way through the center of the Earth, it's utterly fascinating."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Narrated by Spock & Q?Can life get any better than that?Cheers"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"JULES VERNE BOOKS ARE AWESOME WHEN I READ THEM IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY THERE EVEN THE MOVIES"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"no much comments, classic fiction novel. help me understand more in my literature class but I do not remember where I put it now..."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"Before you read this, please understand that I liked this book in some places. Here is a timeline (that may contain spoilers) of my thoughts on the book.The beginning was epic. I was thinking, \\"Heck yea, I'm reading a classic that has dinosaurs, rocks, science, etc. I'm reading heavy stuff.\\"The start of the book was amazing. With Leidenbrock finding the code in the old book by A.S. and they make their way to Iceland. I especially loved the dealing with the code and the confusing and fear of Axel. Grauben sounds like such a doll.When they get to Iceland it was still kind of interesting. Axel has to deal with his fear of heights and I liked the idea of climbing the tower every day.Here is where the book starts to get a bit dull. From around page 60 to page 90 I call it Journey to the Center of Boredom. I don't need 30 pages to tell me they went here, stopped here, there was grey rock here, they stopped for the night there. Realistically, this is what would happen. Then again, I want to read a fictional novel, not a travel guide.Getting inside the mountain was quite clever. I specially liked the idea they had for rope. Their travels inside of the darkened hall was most excellent, but then, again, the book takes a turn for the worst. Magically they find a stream when they are about to die of thirst. And, as one reviewer said, they magically have enough stuff to be able to survive for so long. I mean honest to God, they are literally carrying hundreds of pounds EACH. Ladders, 400 feet of rope, 3 months supply of food, sleeping wear, medicine kits, rifles, 50 pounds of explosive powder, a torch, lanterns, that's just the beginning! Don't forget the compass, the 5+ different types of equipment they have to measure the temperature and their depths, etc. Then you have the books they carry to mark everything. It all starts to add up. And, keep in mind, they are walking around 90 leagues a day (a league, if you look it up, is around 3 miles). So they are wearing hundreds of pounds, going downhill, and walking so fast when the average person in a 12 hour period walks about 36 miles without wearing weight. Doesn't that seem a bit odd? And as for a gripe about the water, they started a stream they nicknamed the Hansbach that was a little trail of water that went downhill. They followed it and when they needed a drink they stopped and got from this stream. If you think about it, though, a little stream going downhill for even ONE mile would be SO polluted with sediment that it would make you sick to drink it.So they get into the interior of the Earth after the ungodly smart 16 year old narrator, Axel, has passed out about 3 times already. It's possible that life could, technically, survive down there. Plants CAN grow without sunlight.Perhaps it was because I saw the movie before I read the book, but I was disappointed that there were no T-rex's! I won't hold it against the book, though. What I WILL hold against it is that for a book so heavy with science, Verne should have known that these creatures would have evolved. In this book the fish didn't have eyes and there were mastadons. Technically that wouldn't happen. They would all become different over time.The last of the book was kind of a pain in the butt. I had this problem with the movie was well. They are on some type of floating device (the movie had a dinosaur skull, these guys had a raft) that, for some reason as they are going around 90 miles an hour with the water pushing them that fast, NEVER clip the side even a smidgen. Their floating device stays in the same position for literally a whole day in the book whether it's when they are being shoved at a high speed horizontally or through the geyser at the end. That doesn't fly with me. Not to mention, if they were shot out the top of the volcano on a raft that had been under intense heat and being weakened with water for hours, they would have been decimated as they hit the ground. How does Verne get past this? They are going up, up, up, all of a sudden Axel wakes up outside with Hans over him. They landed.The writing in this book is absolutely excellent, but I am asked to believe just too much for this story to be real. It's a great book if you want to stretch your imagination so much that it will leave marks, but not for a reader of fiction that wants realistic fiction.John McAdamEnoch and the ExtraterrestrialsAreothWesth: Sun Thieves (Areoth Adventure)"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is better than any movie version I've ever seen or will probably seen.

Action, Adventure, Sci-fiey goodness, it has a good plot followable text (for my lexile level that is). I've always been a fan of sci-fi so if your like me dont miss out on this book by Jules Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time. True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible. Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist. Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno. I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint. Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time. Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth. Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body. And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.However, I do have a couple minor gripes. Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel. Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line. Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., \\"the bends\\"). Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time. A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world. Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This book is great! It blends amazing scientific theories with non-stop adventure and excitement. I wish that there was a sequelto this incredible book. I highly suggest it to sciece critics andpeople who love adventourous writing."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is a great adventure story that can be appreciated by kids and adults alike. While science fiction, it is admirably well-suited for inspiring an interest in the science of geology. I recommend this book to anyone who likes tales of adventure, iceland, or geology."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I liked this book a lot. It is about a guy named Axel and his adventourus Uncle Lidebrock. He finds a map that shows a path to the centre of the Earth. So they go to Iceland with their silent guide Hans. They go thruogh volcanoes and tunnels and across treturous underground seas to reach the centre of the Earth.Their trip to get out was not as easy as their trip getting in. They need to go out of a volcano.Fortunatly the volcano is about to erupt.They get shot out of the volcano and arive safely back home.This book was very exciting. They made it sound like it was possible for them to get to the centre of the Earth. I just would have made it have more action and less scientific talk. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is one of Verne's best works. The characters wonderfully believable and the plot is absolutely brilliant. Okay, so you're not going to find many people that believe in the hollow earth theory these days, but who cares? It's easy to suspend your beliefs and just get caught up in the story. Admittedly, the discourses on geology can drag a little for some readers, while others may find it part of the 19th charm, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I love the 19th century \\"info dumps\\" it's an insight into how people saw the world at that time. Verne had a reputation for writing fast paced adventures full of unexpected twists and turns and Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"A breathtaking fictional journey through the bowels of the planet that we the readers live on and think we know so much about. Cleverly worded, the novel grabs the readers attention from the beginning and doesn't let up until the end. Also Jules Verne's choice of plot scheme made the book a very enjoyable read. In this epic tale, A Greek professor finds a secret parchment stating that another scientist has been to the center of the earth. Taking on the adventure as a number one priority,He packs his things and literally drags his nephew with him to Iceland, where they are to begin their awesome journey. It seemed to me that everything that took place in the novel took place where it should have, one of the marks of a true author.Also, the novel was not rushed, which is one of the most common problem with adventure stories. This book made me want to read more of Verne's writting. The novel definitely deserves to be aclassic."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"One problem about ordering books on-line, is that you only have as much or as little imformation as the seller gives you. I was looking for a decent hard back copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth. This seemed to be what I was looking for. However, what the seller does not tell you, and something you can't see in the photo, is that this is a Barnes and Noble \\"Children's Classic.\\" I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that this type of relevant information is included in the description. On top of it all, the particular seller I used listed the book as \\"New\\", which it clearly was not."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"The version of the Jules Verne classic I read was the very old English translation that transmogrifies the protagonist into Harry Lawson, I guess to appeal to English readers.The idea is good, and the science very convincingly conveyed...but I was underwhelmed with the action, or lack thereof. Pages upon pages are devoted to the prosaic trek to the Icelandic volcano which serves as the ingress to the abyss, and, once inside, pages upon pages are devoted to the mundane exploration of rocky tunnels. (\\"Look at that magnificent feldspar, Uncle!\\")The protagonist gets lost (and found), the water supply runs out, and sundry other non-exciting events occur. I wanted more ichthyosaur vs. plesiosaur-type happenings...which alas, were barely represented.The treatment of Saknussemm defies credibility, and the fact that the main characters survived being erupted out of Mt. Etna beggars belief. I'll grant a lot of latitude when the premise is such an interesting and promising one. But don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.I wanted to enjoy the book more, but couldn't. Maybe it was the translation...I'd like to think so."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This book by Jules Verne chronicles a \\"journey to the centre of the earth\\" in 1863. This was one of the earliest of Verne's \\"voyages extraordinaires\\". Alas, it's not as exciting as some of his later books. The trek down to the earth's core is long and often monotonous. Verne tries to make the whole thing as plausible as possible, using the scientific information available at the time, but of course the whole thing is totally implausible based on what we now know. Still, it's an important early science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I've begun buying up as many of these Illustrated Classics as I can find.

A short and simple story that will be enjoyed by readers of all ages, this is a 'Must Read' for all fans of science fiction. With a heavy dose of legitimate science, Verne gives this story a strong feel of authenticity that has been forgotten in much of today's SF novels. Verne's imaginary subterranean world reveals the powerful vision of the fantastic that he has become known for as a pioneer of SF. Richly detailed and certainly out of this world, Verne's creation has inspired science fiction writers and even scientists themselves for over one and a half centuries.The characters that people this novel are some of Verne's most unforgettable. The eccentric and reckless Professor Liedenbrock presents the stereotypical scientist obsessed with discovery even at the expense of safety and practicality. The stoic Hans represents the fearless devotion and calmness under fire that we still proscribe to the man's man frontiersman. And the frightened and pessimistic Axel provides the perfect reluctant hero. Each of these characters have helped shape the personas of innumerable other characters since their creation.A non-stop adventure to a fantastical world, this book remains one of my favorite in its genre.

In this book, he chronicles the adventures of a German professor, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide into the depths of the earth. When I read it, it was very different from what I expected. Having been exposed to various film and television versions of this story, I imagined some sort of drilling machine was involved. Also, I had thought that there was some interaction with primitive tribes in the underground realm.On reading this book, you'll discover a very different story. The professor buys and old book, and finds an ancient manuscript written by a famous alchemist in which the alchemist claims to have journeyed to the center of the Earth. The professor inspired by this claim rushes to Iceland to retrace the alchemist's footsteps. He drags his reluctant nephew along with him, and hires a guide in Iceland. These three men proceed to walk into the crater of a volcano, and they follow the empty lava tubes into the depths of the Earth. This is more of a survival story than anything else. They face shortages of food, water, light, and more. Verne really knows how to keep a story moving. For adventure fans, this is a great book to read!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"\\"Et quacumque viam dederit fortuna sequamur\\"\\"And whatever route fortune gives, we shall follow\\"This IS your great-great-great-grandfather's adventure story, so reader beware. There's a lot of walking, a lot of exposition, and quite frankly, not a lot of action. But keep in mind...this is an original. Our modern day sensibilities expect high action out of our adventure stories...monsters, critters, thrill-a-minute. But in a much different time when society was in a much different state, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" set the table for the adventure/scifi stories of the future.The story revolves around German Professor and \\"Savant\\" Otto Lidenbrock, though is narrated by his nephew, Axel. The two come across a manuscript that references an Icelandic explorer's expedition to the center of the earth. Upon deciphering the document, Lidenbrock exclaims: \\"Let no one take it into his head before us to try and discover the center of the earth.\\" And off they go.While much of the middle third of the book reads like a travelogue of northern Europe and anthropological tour of Iceland, the driving force of the story is the eccentric genius of Professor Lidenbrock. The professor is characterized by a certain \\"madness\\", as described by Axel. This obsessiveness is a driving characteristic that one can see across the literary spectrum of those who break new ground. In fact, one can see it across the spectrum of real life explorers as well. For without a little \\"crazy\\", who might have the strength and fortitude to forge ahead almost heedless of circumstances. Without the single-minded obsession and force of will, how would humans be driven to the hearts of darkness that lie at the root of all discovery?Like modern science fiction, Verne delves into the 19th century equivalent of cutting edge science with much speculation on portable artificial light, and various natural sciences related to deep earth biology and geology. Whereas Michael Crichton turned the real science of the possibilities of cloning extinct dinosaurs, Verne speculates on evolution, and deep earth temperatures.I couldn't help but compare the early chapters of Jules Verne's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" to H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Lost World\\". They share a certain vibe in their respective late 19th/early 20th century writing style and tone. They're reminiscent, but different...\\"Journey\\" has much more of a sense of humor, and is particularly light-hearted during the early stage-setting scenes in Germany.I liked it. I didn't love it, but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen. Overall I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that this review will help anyone interested in reading it or people just reviewing it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"I would reccomend this book to anyone because of it's adventure and detail, and also there is a beautiful love story twisted in it too and it's truly romantic.

An amazed and fascinated France eagerly awaited the weekly installments, as the unbounded genius of the young author captured the imagination of Europe and soon the world. Countless boys and even adults were inspired by Verne's ability to grasp the potential of inventions for the future, and to focus serious attention on hitherto unexplored regions of the earth (or beneath it, or the ocean), or over it. Obviously for such literary spotlighting of mankind's present and future endeavors, Verne required a new kind of hero--the Scientist, rather than the swashbuckling romantic of the Romantic era.JOURNEY is admittedly Verne's most improbable adventure, yet readers marvel at his detailed foresight in the provisons required, plus in his ability to insert theories of the earth's formation into the actual plot. Unlike most of Verne's protagonists, this one is neither French, English nor American but German. Young Axel is both orphaned nephew and student assistant to his brilliant geologist uncle, Professor Lidenbrock of Hamburg. When the latter discovers an ancient manuscript in an antiquarian book purchase, he becomes instantly obsessed with its translation and then with the passion to follow in the footsteps of a medieval Icelandic exlporer, Arne Saknussem.Axel is wary of such folly and argues the dangers, but the single-willed professor counters all scientific reasoning with a logic of his own, both before and during their arduous journey. With their stoic but resourceful guide, Hans, the three men undertake to seek the center of the earht, using the Icelandic volcano of Sneffels as their portal to mystery and danger. Is academic fame a sufficient lure for one, or mere weekly salary for another? Axel's own personality (often dreamng of his beloved cousin)undergoes a true metamorphosis as the result of months of hardship in the bowels of the earth. Still fresh almost 150 years later, this adventure tale is certain to entertain and enlighten. (Ignore subsequent movie versions with change the cast.)"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"The Great Illustrated classics are great (no pun intended) Journey To The Center Of The Earth is so cool.

READ IT!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This was much better than I thought it would be. I'm not exactly sure what I expected from a novel written so long ago, but I was pleasantly surprised. Verne has a wry sense of humor that keeps this book rocketing along, while maintaining a (somewhat) serious tone at the same time. I thought I was in for a cheesy, unbeliveable story but found that Verne's work is so much more than that. Credited with beinng the father of science fiction, Verne lives up to the hype, especially when you consider that this was written around the time of the Civil War! Without spoiling the plot, let me just say that I very much enjoyed this tale, and I am now in the hunt for more Verne works."},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","review":"This is the best book i've ever read....the plot is good as it gets u addicted to it! i love the wild imagination of verne...making me almost believe that it was possible to travel to the centre of the earth.

And that's what it really is, a masterpiece. Writing a good story doesn't need to have symbolism, satire, cariacature of modern people or place. It need only have the basic aspects of this book: Good story, feasible plot, interesting characters, and a vivid imagination.I am not a scientist, not in the least, and so I cannot make any disclaimer about scientific information as printed in the book (ie; is heat stored in the core of the planet vs. just in the crust, etc.) but from the time the Professor, his nephew, and Hans enter the volcano on Iceland, you *will* be hooked, because the manner of storytelling is very strong here. Every word printed comes to life in your mind as it would on the big screen. And when you go on that journey with them you will find treasures that you'll remember.

Becuase the story is told in a journal-like fashion, the action sequences are abridged somewhat; but there is still some excitement in this book. Though somewhat dated (many of the theories Verne relied on when writing his descriptions about the center of the Earth have since been disproven) this book is still an excellent read.

It just doesn't get any better than that, this book could have been very, very exciting. Instead it is one of the slowest books I have ever read.When the \\"action\\" does begin in the last two chapters...you really don't care one way or the other, nor do you understand the majority of the problem, because it has been so poorly developed.Bought this book for $1 at the bargain bargain table at my local book store hoping for a gem.

Anyway, I was wrong...it was just $1 because it was incredibly boring.I don't reccommend this book...however, if you would like to read it...I've got one that I'll sell you for $1.50. :-)ukmatt78@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"The &quot;business&quot; of the title is a vast two-thousand-year-old entity that has been around since early in the life of the Roman Empire. However, this is not an &quot;Illuminatus&quot; novel; there is no conspiracy to take over the world here; no secret cabal controlling presidents and monarchs; no &quot;Protocol of the Elders of Zion&quot;. This is a business, and they just want to make money. Of course they do it on scale that even General Motors might envy; much of the book's plot turns on their desire to get a seat at the UN by getting control of one of the tinier nations. (Quite openly, and with the agreement of that nation's government.)The protagonist is Kathryn Telman, adopted into the business at an early age, and now, at 38, a rising executive with a sharp eye for company politics and a strong sense of ethics. She is faced with several ethical choices in &quot;The Business&quot;, and she makes, by and large, intelligent decisions. However, the book is also, in a quiet way, a political thriller, and though there are no actual dead bodies, there is certainly some skulduggery for Kathryn to get to the bottom of.One of Banks' greatest assets is his ability to weld a good story to a worthwhile problem, and tell the whole thing entertainingly. &quot;The Business&quot; is no exception. It's not his best book: I'd recommend &quot;The Bridge&quot; or &quot;Complicity&quot; if you want to start somewhere else, or &quot;The Player of Games&quot; if you like science fiction; but it's a fine, smooth, and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Iain Banks was born in Scotland in 1954 and published his first book - \\"The Wasp Factory\\" - in 1984. In the years since, he's won critical acclaim, topped best-seller lists and has even written Science Fiction books under the cunning nom-de-plume \`Iain M. Banks'. \\"The Business\\" was first published in 1999, and is his tenth non sci-fi book.The origins of the Business predate Christianity, and it - technically - owned the Roman Empire for an exceptionally short spell. (It turned out to be something of a mistake). The world headquarters are at Chateau d'Oex, in Switzerland, where there are - allegedly - some rather interesting items in their vaults. (These are rumoured to include a book that might just have made it into the Bible and some rather erotic doodlings sketched by Michelangelo). Although the Business has 'understandings' with several states and regimes, it is now planning to 'buy' its own country - allowing for a seat on the United Nations and diplomatic immunity for its senior executives. Officially, the country being considered if Fenua Uans, a small island in the Pacific.Kate Telman is senior executive officer, third level with the Business. She started with Security, though has been keeping an eye on technology trends in recent years - luckily, her suggestions on where to invest have been paying off significantly. (As a result, she reached Level Three a good deal more quickly than she had dared hope). Kate is thirty eight years old and was born in Scotland, but holds joint British - US citizenship. Although she is currently on sabbatical, she has been with the organisation since she left school. She had been effectively groomed for the Business by Elizabeth Telman since childhood, following a chance meeting on the roadside in 1968. Elizabeth adopted Kate after her natural mother died, four years later. Now, with Elizabeth also dead, Freddy Ferrindonald is the closest thing to family she has left. Freddy, a step-brother of Elizabeth's, is also a high-ranking Business employee, not to mention exceptionally rich and just a little odd. He lives at Blysecrag House, which might just qualify as a stately home. (It has three hundred rooms and its cellars extend for two miles). The pair certainly get on very well together, and Kate admits to being very fond of Freddy.Blysecrag is soon to be playing host to a very high-level meeting and some general hedonism - Kate is rather excited (and relieved) to have been invited. Unffortunately, Prince Suvinder Dzung from Thulan will also be among the other guests. Suvinder is a noted admirer of Kate's, but the admiration is entirely one way. Kate prefers Stephen Buzetski, another Business executive - unfortunately, he is proving to be stubbornly loyal to his wife. Events at Blysecrag lead to Kate doing a little more travelling and attending a few more meetings - leading to an offer she never seriously expected and didn't necessarily want. However, as time goes by, she becomes increasingly suspicious that the more senior executives are not being entirely straight about things...Generally, I've found if a book has the name \\"Iain Banks\\" on the cover it's well worth reading. \\"The Crow Road\\" and \\"Whit\\" would both safely be included in my \\"10 Favourite Books of All Time\\", while \\"Canal Dreams\\" and \\"The Wasp Factory\\" would probably be knocking loudly on the door. In all those books, Banks has developed a strong 'lead' character whose past has contributed as much to the book as the 'current' events of the story. In comparison, \\"The Business\\" is a little weak : Kate's past isn't developed in the way Prentice McHoan's or Frank Cauldhame's are developed, while the story's 'current' events - meetings, parties and sightseeing - aren't quite as absorbing as the events of \\"Whit\\" and \\"Canal Dreams\\". However, \\"The Business\\" is still an Iain Banks book : even on an off-day, he'll tell a story a good deal more readable and a great deal more enjoyable than your average writer is capable of producing."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Banks is a very prolific writer of both \\"regular\\" and speculative fiction. Prior to this, I'd read two of what are generally considered his better books: the intensely creepy \\"The Wasp Factory\\", and the fantastical \\"The Bridge\\". I'd enjoyed those, so when I saw this at a yard sale for $1, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, I discovered there's a good reason the person was getting rid of it.The story starts out with a lot of promise, as we meet likable 35ish heroine Kate Tellman. Plucked from poverty in Scotland by a benefactor and sent to boarding schools, the smart, stylish, funny, sexy, cunning, empathetic Kate has used her tech savvy to rise quickly in the ranks of \\"The Business.\\" This mysterious firm is a massive global force, hidden behind a myriad of holding companies and silent partnerships. We first meet her in a comic scene in the dead of night, when a colleague about to embark on a key business trip wakes her up in a panic. It seems someone has drugged him and removed a good portion of his teeth...This plotline is quickly left behind, as Kate stumbles onto some kind of shady business at one of her firm's factories. There may be high-level involvement in some sort of embezzlement -- but before she can dig too deeply, she's off to a lifestyles of the rich and famous type party hosted by her adopted Uncle Freddy at his vast Yorkshire estate. There, we learn of her yen for a married colleague, as well as of a Thulahnese prince's amorous designs on her. Thulahn is a kind of Bhutan/Nepal nestled in the Himalayas, and before long, she is sent there to inspect it for a top-secret Business scheme.But despite all this jet-setting, and nice scene-setting, humorous descriptions and dialogue -- nothing much happens. The plotline concerning fraud at The Business kind of drifts in and out without any vigor, and ends up being rather easily (if unconvincingly) resolved. The other plotline, revolving around Thulahn, is wrapped up with such perfunctory haste that it smacks of Banks having totally lost interest in his book partway through. The book feels somewhat like \\"Banks lite\\", as most of the characters are one-dimensional eccentrics (Uncle Freddy is a car nut, a senior American boss is a munitions nut, a senior Malaysian boss wants to ram a ship into a beach, Kate's main girlfriend spends all her time berating her, Kate's love interest is Mr. Perfect, the Queen of Thulahn hasn't left her bed in 30 years), and you keep having to remind yourself what the plot actually is. Alas, the ending is so abrupt and anticlimactic that many readers will be checking their copy for a missing final chapter (or two). There are some nice definitely some clever turns of phrase, but overall, this is disappointingly thin stuff."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Without simply regurgitating what other reviews have said, for me it basically comes down to this: the book was boring. Sure, there can be slow parts for pacing of a storyline but the &quot;slow part&quot; lasted through the first half or more.I REALLY like this author, but check the classic Wasp Factory or Song of Stone...those books are engaging and interesting."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Smooth writing, rapid pace, wonderful characters; all in all a really fun book--but it has a plot that wouldn't hold up a novella. Hell, I'm not even sure what the plot was supposed to be. Maybe buying a third-world country? But that always seemed to be in the background. The conspiracy thing? It dissapeared for a few hundred pages in the middle of the book. I don't know. It was fun, but when I get to page 300 and ask myself what the plot is, I think there's a problem.Why three stars, then? As I said, for sheer mechanics (other that plot) and readability it's a wonderful novel. And, as other Banks fans will attest to, even his occasional sub-par outing is better than most of the dross out there.As to the question of why Banks doesn't have the status in the States that he does in the UK, I would suggest it is the fact that he never does the same thing twice and that his books are, more often than not, somewhat downbeat. I don't think his SF output is responsable for this--in fact, all of his SF books have been published in the US, while many of his mainstream work has yet to make the transition (ie. Walking on Glass, Canal Dreams, Espedair Street, Crow Road, Whit). Also, he published three mainstream novels before Consider Phlebas (his first published SF), so any image of him as an author trying to escape SF is a misconception--moreover, he has stated that if he had to choose between mainstream and SF, he would choose the later.All his novels are still in-print in the UK, so if you're a Banks fan, go help Amazon.com's sister company."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Up until this book I had only read Iain Banks science fiction novels, and if it is representative of his mainstream fiction, I shall restrict myself to his science fiction in future.The story was predictable on both the small and large scale. For the most part the characters were unintersting stereotypes, with the exception of the main character and her eventual partner.Little effort was made to establish The Business as a believable entity, and the story relied on almost-but-not-quite incompetance on behalf of the bad guys. The author seemed to be trying to create the flamboyance and power of The Culture (from his sci-fi novels), but writ small. It did not work.On the positive...it was not badly written, more than anything just disappointing since I have come to expect a lot more from Mr. Banks."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"This is the first work by Mr. Banks that I have read. Based on this reading experience I will try his work again, but the decision to do so was close for two reasons. Firstly, the plot was hardly new and there was not enough to make it a good spin on an old idea. Secondly, every blasted item the main character touched was branded. Just a few examples would include; her watch, her sunglasses, most of her designer clothes, about half a dozen car companies, at least three planes, and three helicopter firms, hotels, Champagne, and enough detail on a car that was not hers to fill a brochure.On the very positive end I thought Ms. Telman, the book's central character was great. Bright, a wicked wit, and a female character that is strong as opposed to clich&eacute;. The fools and the typical weaknesses are generally the domain of the male, and I found this to be a pleasant change. The best example of this was her slow and painful destruction of an extremely expensive sports car while the male owner sobbed, cursed, and had his digits damaged by turn, as she convinced him to chat. The car's owner could have bought a fleet of them, so the Author's portrayal of his insane behavior about the car, was all the more entertaining.Like other books of this type the story travels around the globe a few times with the expected national Capitols making an appearance. Thrown into the mix is a Prince, a Dowager Queen who has kept to her \\"bed\\" for nearly 3 decades, and an endearing curmudgeon with a taste for fast cars.The book is entertaining but I doubt the Author's best. While there are books of this type that are better, there are far more that are worse.Call it 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"As I worked my way through this book I found myself becoming frustrated and disenchanted. This author had been recommended to me by a friend who revels in Bank's science fiction efforts but who suggested this one in view of my prediliction about economics. I have always enjoyed a good read but tend to find myself in the company of rather esoteric texts rather than with novels. Others have indicated that there are flaws in this book concerning plot and have issues and to a certain extent I would concur. Until, that is, it dawned on mewhat the book is all about.Now perhaps I may be wrong. Perhaps I am attributing too much to the author's intent here, perhaps I am reading too much into what I have read I could be wrong but this is why I find this a clever little book.I enjoyed the whole concept of a sustained business empire existing through the millenia with locations in places one would never dream of. I enjoyed the imaginative way Banks describes some of the places like the house in Yorkshire and Switzerland. What I did not realise until I was someway into the book was the degree to which he melds together the products he mentions with the corporate lifestyles of the executive. My realisation came with the references the author makes to popular music. It is not the fact that Banks displays a wide appreciation of adult orientated rock but his use of the artists names and some song titles. Given that the publication date precedes I-Pod the fact that the hero can access at will a whole variety of tunes without lugging around a huge box of CDs seemed odd. Why would a high powered exec carry them? However, given the current exhaltation of celebrity and popular culture in Western post-industrialised societies it has meaning within that context. As I looked back over the earlier pages I had read it dawned on me that in the present world of television and TIVO producers resort to product placement on their shows so why not in novels?Eureka. It all started to make sense to me that business is pervasive throughout the whole book. Banks praises business in a sense and lays out a whole panorama about the benefits resulting from it but he does so while at the same time poking fun. Sure there are benefits to the elite few but underneath it all is the constant temptation to sharp practice. Opportunity has two sides both of which are highlighted here. The world of the rich is distinct from the world of the many. Banks holds out hope that good will vanquish bad and in the end the hero wins the prize in a display of rejection of some corporate values but does so in the context of becoming the spouse of a monarch of a poor country who is independently wealthy but who will be on a course to many more riches.Banks' novel is therefore much more subtle than your average whodunnit although at the end of the day a whodunnit it is. I enjoyed the book from a consumer's point of view but not from a detective story point of view but I must give the author credit. If it is done deliberately he has achieved a great success and written a subtle, humourus and satisfying clever little book. Did I mention how much I like diet coke with lemon?"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"If I were inclined to find a quick description of Iain Banks' &quot;The Business&quot;, it might well be &quot; 'The Firm' on Prozac.&quot; Like the protagonist of Grisham's novel, Kate Telman- the main character of &quot;The Business&quot;- works for a decidedly low-profile but very influential organization, in which she has great prospects. But the comparison ends there.Based on Banks' other fiction- &quot;Complicity&quot;, &quot;Against a Dark Background&quot;- the reader would be forgiven for expecting Kate's carefully-ordered world to be in tatters at the end of the novel. Happily for her- but somewhat less so for the power and effect of Banks' novel- this never actually happens: despite its global reach, ambitions toward statehood, and presumably vast power, The Business is apparently a benign organization; the car accident affecting her uncle, a highly-placed Business executive, never turns out to be more than that; and Kate's uncovering of illicit maneuverings at the highest levels of the enterprise have an ultimately innocuous result. It also sports about the closest thing any Banks book has ever had to a happy ending.After the reader gets over the fact that the other shoe doesn't exist, much less that it's not going to drop, &quot;The Business&quot; is a reasonably entertaining read. In some ways, given the much more eventful but more depressing ends of &quot;Complicity&quot;, &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, and other novels, it's refreshing to close a Banks book with the majority of characters neither dead, bereft or outcast. However, it doesn't seem to make for nearly as good a story..."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I found this book to be far too predictable and, to be honest, quite boring. Though Mr. Banks is undoudtedly a fine writer, it seems as though he 'phoned it in' on this outing. At times it feels as if the story is heading in the right direction -particularly near the end - but then it hits a brick wall. I found the ending of the story very bland. What happened to Kathryn? What about Hazleton? All in all, a let down."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"The Business is not a bad book but it is does not have what I've come to expect from a Banks novel. I am actually a reader of books written by &quot;M.&quot; Banks (i.e. a Culture fan). This book is the third non-scifi novel I've read from Banks, the others being a Song of Stone and Complicity.The backdrop for this novel, involving a discreet outfit of businesspeople with a long history deciding to buy a small nation in order to have a corporate HQ and other fringe benefits such as a seat in the UN and diplomatic passports, sounded pretty interesting. The fact that it was Banks telling the story had the promise of fine woven details and a mind boggling plot.The nice touches are there but the main plot was, well, straightforward. In the presence of masterpieces like Use of Weapons, Feersum Endjinn and Complicity, the plot in this book doesn't do justice neither to the reputation of the author nor to the potential of the subject."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I am an avid fan of all of Iain Banks' work but this book I found to be a big letdown. At times I had to force myself to keep reading because unfortunately the plot wasn't enough to retain my interest for the duration. The only reason I read it in it's entirety was because Iain Banks wrote it and I am too big a fan to give up. The base idea was fine but I got the impression that this was a book only in the draft stage ergo released before it's potential was reached."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"A fortunate encounter plucks Kate Tellmann from a life of poverty and she is inducted into an organisation, The Business, which, since Roman Times has been a world-wide financial force. Kate rises through the corporate ranks and finds herself to be the love-interest of the prince of a small Himalayan country, which is also of interest to The Business. Kate's feelings lie with one of her colleagues, however, who refuses to be disloyal to his wife. But in the end, Kate has to balance what is good for The Business, the prince and his country, and her feelings.The Business is something of a departure for Iain Banks in that there isn't any of the grisly stuff one would associate with his books. I think this is a good thing for he has at last broken away from the type of material he is expected to produce, and has come up with something new to get his teeth into."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Known for his dark, wry wit and his speculative imagination (his SF novels are cult classics) Iain Banks' wide ranging novels (&quot;The Wasp Factory,&quot; &quot;Complicity&quot;) explore numerous facets of contemporary culture, duplicity and character. His latest, &quot;The Business,&quot; takes on the comedy of corporate globalization.Narrator Kathryn Telman is &quot;a senior executive officer, third level (counting from the top) in a commercial organization which has had many different names through the ages but which, these days, we usually just refer to as the Business.&quot; Urbane and ambitious, Kate is a girl on her way up. She has a flippant, ruthless wit and an outspoken weakness for the vital concerns of the less fortunate masses, which has never prevented her from advancing the interests of her employer. Kate herself was plucked from bleak Scottish poverty at age 8 and groomed for success. Now, with her mother and benefactor both dead, Kate regards the Business with gratitude, loyalty, admiration and a sharp, observant eye. She will need all of these qualities for the new task the Business has set her.The Business dates back to the Roman Empire (which it actually owned for a disastrous 66 days) and has a finger in almost everything, from the latest technologies to a collection of Michelangelo's pornographic paintings. Internally democratic - promotions are advanced by a vote of one's peers - the Business requires an atheistic oath from its management levels. Its highest level executives indulge themselves in hobbies firing barrages of heavy artillery and running derelict tankers aground.Notwithstanding their costly lesson in running an empire, the Business feels its lack of political clout in this increasingly borderless world and hankers after a nation, something small and manageable with a seat at the United Nations and that ingenious smuggling tool, the diplomatic pouch.Kate believes, like everyone else, that negotiations with a tiny Pacific Island are advancing despite occasional obstacles thrown up by the US and other nervous nations. But in a top-level meeting at a rambling Scottish castle she is informed that the island is a diversion. The Business has actually chosen a tiny Himalayan monarchy to acquire. And they've selected Kate to take charge; to go to Thulahn and judge how the Business's interests will mesh with those of the Thulahnese people.Initially terrified by its terrain (landing requires serious aerobatics), appalled by its lack of amenities (no TV!), vicious weather, cantankerous Queen mother and sticky children, she is slowly won over by attributes that have nothing to do with business, only to discover that the Business has not - surprise - been entirely frank with her.The fun is in the details - the little subplots, the maneuvering and manipulation, the over-the-top excesses (echoes of Richard Condon abound). Kate, by virtue of her lively narration, comes across as a real person who lives primarily by her wits. She's opinionated and articulate, sympathetic and humanistic, but not introspective. She lives in the moment and advances socialistic arguments at the dinner table while reveling in the prospect of her own private jet and a home on several continents.The other characters are defined mostly by their excesses and eccentricities. Kate's true-love interest is bland and blurry while the Thulahn prince, in pursuit of Kate, is amiably pathetic.Banks' energetic, imaginative prose and sharp wit bring the multinational corporate behemoth, if not to its knees, at least to its bottom line."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"let me say up front that i was prepared to like this book. i like both iain banks and novels about business. perhaps somewhat naively, i expected a better synthesis of the two. unlike his other novels, 'the wasp factory' and 'complicity' most especially, the story here was utterly predictable less than half way through and, most damningly, the characters entirely stock and uninteresting. the only interesting thing about this novel is the feat of imagination that created the history-eating corporation of the title. for me atleast, that creation, read about in the back blurb, intrigued me enough to buy the book; that iain banks wrote it reassured me that i was going to enjoy it. i was disappointed. i think u'll agree that on whichever side of the seattle protests u find yourself, global capitalism is about to become, over the next couple of years, the background for any number of morality tales, much in the way that the renaissance or victorian england have. perhaps it is the newness of the subject matter, literarily atleast, that has resulted in a distinct lack of success so far. banks has company in this regard; john ralston saul comes to mind. thus far, the only writer i can think of to have satisfactorily got his writing pen around the topic is, peculiarly, robert ludlum, but his difficulty is that he can't write (neither can the man who comes in second in that particular contest, tom wolfe). if only we could combine ludlum's way around a business story and banks' writerliness, we might have a decent business novel"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"The Business should be an interesting book - the summary on the back cover about an ancient enterprise trying to buy a country in order to gain a seat at the UN sounded good. (And I also bought the book from the bargain table, so 1 seemed worth the \\"risk\\")The problem is that the book is mired in cliche. The heroine (herself a femme fatale cliche) lives the high life, brand-name dropping as we go, mingling with highly suspect people (themselves all two-dimensional cliches) The twists and turns of the story weren't satisfying - why indeed is Kathryn called over to America to talk an executive's nephew out of a bad play? As for the queen who doesn't leave her bed, I was extremely disappointed that it didn't turn out that she was a former Business level two or one, having herself been cajoled into marrying the king to try and win Thulanh for the business! All in all, The Business was a disappointing book, especially with the tough-as-nails heroine suddenly going all girly and soft at the end. I keep hoping there's a hidden message, some kind of parody going on (what was with that damn netsuke monkey, anyway?!) that will save this rambling book, but I can't find it. If the book is indeed a big literary commercial, then I feel someone should pay me for having struggled through it."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"This book was sooo good. Iain Banks has created a heroine for even the most accomplished woman. If only women got roles like this in the movies. Kudos to the author for creating Kate, a truly cosmopolitan character that epitomizes what we wordly women truly aspire to be: savvy and mysterious, smart and powerful, fun and heroic.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"The story is entertaining. The commentary is alternately scathing and profound. There's a salient and relevant lesson in the end. You should read this."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Banks is strangely not known that well in America. After a long series of novels all over the map, he still doesn't get the kind of play that you might think he would. I think that has to do with his SF beginnings, and the bias here against writers who've come out of that mold, regardless of the subjects they chose. And in &quot;The Business&quot; he sets his sights on another genrified topic- the big international conspiracy consortium. This choice is his unfortunate mistake, because he nevers gets ahead of the game in subverting this tried and true form.While Banks attempts in many ways to improve on the likes of Robert Ludlum, this book becomes another one of its type. The flair that it does show is in the narative. The female lead has a good strong voice. This is swallowed up by the subject matter, though. The plot is not so ho hum as I make it sound- but I felt that someone as accomplished of Banks would break the shackles of the page-turner form with this. So while it is suitable for the beach, or the airplane, it isn't going on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Our Scottish heroine in the novel works for 'The Business', an organisation that has been around for a very long time.

Has Banks gone off the boil a bit? The Business strikes me as a fairly run-of-the-mill thriller about corporate shenanigans, with a bit of historical intrigue thrown in. Whilst it is perfectly readable, (sometimes reminding me of the far superior Complicity) it never quite grabs the reader in the way earlier Banks' novels do. This isn't the first time Banks has written from a female 1st person perspective (check out Canal Dreams and the excellent Whit), but in The Business, the adventures of our amoral Jackie-the-lad (Kate) struck me as less than convincing. Some elements of the plot certainly strain the reader's credulity too; sending an encrypted bank account number via some imaginative dental work, and the astonishing amount of micro-control some cars' electric windows possess, will probably provoke a few snorts of derision. But hang on a mo. Perhaps I'm being too harsh? If this were a debut novel from an up-and-coming author, it would be hailed as a powerful and impressive work. I guess it's just that Banks has set the standard so very high with magical works like The Bridge and Wasp Factory, that anything falling short of such class will inevitably pale in comparison. So still a worthwhile read, but cannot be counted amongst his best."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"It's been said of the \\"Star Trek\\" movies that one should avoid the odd-numbered ones and see only the even-numbered. I'm not sure that such a rule applies to Iain Banks- but if it did, \\"The Business\\" would definitely belong in the odd-numbered category.\\"The Business\\" presupposes the existence, since pre-Christian times, of a commercial concern which, without being the Freemasons, the international conspiracy of Judaism, or the Bavarian Illuminati, has managed to outlast, out-earn and out-entrench any or all of the above. Its protagonist, a mid-upper-level executive in this merito-bureaucracy (female, self-made, of humble Scottish origins), is a character with whom it becomes increasingly difficult to identify- neither sufficiently conflicted to be interesting on that count nor hubristic enough to topple satisfactorily.On top of which, nothing much actually happens in the course of the book. A vague threat to the Business is resolved via minor automotive violence, every thread that could have led to an interesting conspiracy theory is cut off short, and all ends happily (we must assume) for our heroine, but the bottom line is- who cares? If I hadn't started this book on a transatlantic flight, with a predisposition to like its author, it's unlikely I'd have finished it. Banks' skill as a storyteller is sufficient to warrant a two-star rating- the story itself gets nothing."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I have to start by saying that I had to quit after about 300 pages. While \\"literary\\" fiction or science fiction can be slow paced plot-wise, this one just seemed slow without anything interesting to take up the time. I usually love big conversations between characters concerning social issues, but the conversations in this book lacked something. Maybe reality, I don't know exactly.

Probably not for a while though."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"What happened here iain - did you get board or just loose the plot?Have to say I realy like this guys work (for the most part), but this book has so much promise, but just completely fails to deliver. It's as if the author got bored of the story and decided to most end it ASAP.Not is best by a long shot!"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Though having read sixteen other Banks novels (four of which have been without the \\"M.\\"), I must say that The Business is the most linear plot thus far, almost bordering on vapid when taken in its general sense like looking at a lifeless body, but its pulse can be found upon close inspection, which reveals a growing characterization of the heroine/femme fatale Kate Telman. The backdrop for Kate's growth isn't only The Business where she is employed, but it's also the entire world with financially impoverished fictional countries whose warm innocence and charm can melt the icy facade of a corporate queen.Rear cover synopsis:\\"Kate Telman is a senior executive officer in The Business, a powerful and massively discreet transglobal organization whose origins predate the Christian Church. Financially transparent, internally democratic, it want to buy its own State to gain a seat at the United Nations.Kate's job is to keep abreast of current technological developments and her global reach stretches from Silicon Valley to the remote Himalayas. In the course of her journey Kate must peel away layers of emotional insulation and the assumptions of a lifetime. She must learn to control the world at arm's length.To take control, she has to do The Business.\\"Kate was raised in western Scotland by an alcoholic and careless mother, which left Kate to find her own street-smarts while mum was away. On one fateful occurrence when she was eight years old, Kate was approached by an older lady. Kate's effortless business skills and cleverness impressed the lady, who organized a meeting with the mother. Thereafter, their lives improved with her mother getting steady jobs and Kate getting an excellent schooling--all for free. Kate was on the fast track to becoming part of The Business.Now thirty-eight years old but still a vixen with the men, Kate has risen high on the tiers of Business control to Level Three. Her instinct for predicting trends on technology have boosts her influence within The Business and her influence isn't limited to her Level Three tier--she woos men of lesser tiers and wins the admiration of others in Levels Two and One. She finds herself slowly being enveloped in a developing Business scheme involving not only the upper Tiers of The Business, but also the heads of state for various tiny nations.The father figure of Uncle Freddy (Level Two) cannot mention much of her place in the scheme of things, but it does take into consideration the Business's feigned interest in the island nation of Fenua Ua and the landlocked Himalayan kingdom of Thulanh. Level One Mr. Hazelton has his fingers in many Business pies and Kate will later question the motives of his grand weasel-like motions. But beneath her involvement in procuring a nation for The Business, there's something fishy going on in a chip factory under the influence of The Business. Kate can't pinpoint the odd behavior of the factory staff, but one room within draws her attention.Her influence with other members of male Business staff in obvious with Mike... an agent who has recently had random teeth knocked out and replaced at a Parisian dentist. The circumstances are bizarre and Kate feels that he's simply a muddling fool, but will later attachment great importance to the missing molars matter. Then there's Stephen... a morally obliged man dedicated to his wife through the sacrament of marriage. Kate finds herself continually attracted to the man even though he denies all of her blatant advances. She'll eventually try to dissect the relationship when she comes into possession of a sex tape that will have a huge impact on Stephen. She treads lightly.Unexpected external factors force Kate to internalize her own pleas for attention; reassess her place in The Business, the lives of others, and the world; and when and when not to stick to your prerogatives.------------When the reader is introduced to Kate, she's a powerful woman in many regards: she controls many Business operations, she is well liked by her peers, and her self-confidence is high as she struts, flirts, seduces, and lays. Her gratefulness for her rise from the slums reflects her appreciation for the job she has. Kate uses her business oriented mind to propel her through the rungs of Business hierarchy and puts little between her and her success but still maintains a loyalty to the people within the organization.Later, through the plot twists of her personal trials and tribulations, Kate is transformed into a woman of sympathetic human action rather than materialistic gain. With a growing window of insight into others' subjective worldviews and the doors of greater responsibility knocking at her door, Kate finds herself not only at the start of her midlife crisis, but at a crossroads towards either (1) an external personal advancement in doing what is right for The Business or (2) an internal personal advancement in doing what is right for the parties involved. This change in outlook is what characterizes Kate to such a degree that she can make changes in the centuries old Business and in the budding kingdom of Thulanh.Obviously, the science fiction element to the novel is The Business itself: pre-dating Christ, the commercial interests on the organization spans centuries and has always been financially transparent yet hermetic in allowing membership and advertising its existence. Its profits are shared among the tiers of authority (Level Six to Level One) but the individuals are unable to transfer Business-derived income to their family, thereby amputating descendant plutocracy. The Business's interest are widely varied, ranging from an ultra-exclusive cigar factory in Guantanamo Bay to investment in Hollywood movies to property investment. It's wildly interesting at first as a science fiction concept but it tapers off when the focus s shifted to the characterization of Kate. Not an all together bad switch, but a tad unfortunate.Being one of the most non-traditional Banks-ian novels, I was expected to be baited, hooked, and reeled in but the plot plods along on a globe-trotting trek from Scotland, Nebraska, the Indian Ocean, and the fictional kingdom of Thulanh (a country similar to Bhutan). Everything is easily understandable: the characters, the locations, the cars owned by Uncle Freddy, the long history of The Business, and the movement each piece plays on the fictional global chessboard. The slowly progressive plot moved all the plot pieces and people pieces in synchronism to form a coherent conclusion but, sadly, it didn't have a drastic effect on this reader. The ultimate truth of the situation fell flat; it just wasn't spectacular enough to invest 392-pages of reading simple structure with implications spanning the entire globe... *poof* *fzzzzt* *pop*This definitely isn't one of Bank's most delightfully convoluted novels nor one of the most intricately structured. The internal growth of the character of Kate is the apex of the novel with little else supporting the book besides the limited interest of The Business itself. Banks drops names of more fictional nations but the names are only cursory with detail only being focused on the mountainous Thulanh:\\"places like Dasah, a trucial state on a small island in the Persian gulf, [...] or the Zoroastrian People's Republic of Inner Magadan, between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Arctic Ocean, or San Borodin, the only independent Canary island.\\" (51)Like the fictional nations names, most things are cursory while Banks takes an active pleasure in describing the engines and specifications of famous sportcars and even takes a stab or two at British and American politics--these real life element fold the reader into tepid fictional plot, albeit, also, at a very cursory level. If Banks were to expand this either into a 600-page novel with more of a science fictions slant, it may have peaked at 4 stars, but there's just not much plot-point tinder under the fire to light the logs of greater interest."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Kathryn Telman is employed by \\"the Business,\\" an international (non-national?) conglomerate, centuries old, and dedicated to profit. Kathryn rose through the ranks to a \\"third level\\" because of her talent, and she finds that the intrigue involving the second and first level executives is complicated and devious.The Business is considering buying a nation, with the understanding that having true international status as one, with its ambassadorial duties and obligations, would be good for business (small \\"b\\"). Kathryn is more involved in the development of this arrangement that she ever planned to be.I found The Business to be an entertaining book, and the most conventional of the many Iain Banks and Iain M Banks I've read to date (probably a dozen). Banks has pushed the envelope of imagination and human situations in most of his book, and this one can't be placed in that category. However, it is a decidedly good tale, and one that would probably also make an entertaining movie script. So being \\"conventional\\" isn't a bad thing; it's just that, if Banks name had not been listed as author, I don't think I'd have guessed it was him. I enjoyed the story, and found myself caught up in Kathryn's web.This is just another reminder that Iain Banks is a talented author, who can make a variety of stories come alive."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I have become a true Banks fan, and was concerned that the subject matter of this book wouldn't be peculiar enough for me to find engrossing. Fortunately I was wrong, and the creepy reality of a business as old as anyone can guess that has managed to stay as powerful as ever through clever and progressive investments into modern times was entirely compelling. The characters are believable and the story well-paced and intriguing, but I still think Banks' best works are those in which he has to be more creative with the unusual psychological realities of his characters."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I read this book when it came out, and liked it well enough. However, I just \\"read\\" it again via the unabridged audio version narrated by Barbara Rosenblat, and it really came to life. A lot of the book is told through dialogue, and her skilled portrayal of the many character voices brought out the humor and finally the humanity of the main characters especially well. The plot does meander a bit, but the reward is worth your patience. Fans of audiobooks should make an effort to track down this version."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Banks is so consistently excellent that when he stumbles just a little bit it can mean two things. One, the results are still highly readable because at the very least the man knows his way around a sentence and two, its a mild disappointment because we know what he's capable of normally.With the exception of \\"Crow Road\\", I find that I enjoy his \\"Iain M Banks\\" SF books better, his archness and sly sense of the absurd seems to lend itself better to snarky spaceships and farflung planetery politics. Here we have farflung global politics, all strung through the heart of a gigantic multi-national corporation that seems to have existed forever and is kind of doing a little bit of everything. Enter: the Business.On some level the Business seems to be a forerunner of the Culture from his SF novels, it has that same liberated and focused \\"anything goes\\" sensibility, a slight amorality and an aura of \\"we know what we're doing, so back off.\\" Our narrator this time out is Kathyrn Tilman, a Level Three in the Business (going from top down) who has been working for them throughout most of her life. Through her eyes we see the inner workings of this huge nebulous company as they do their best to buy a country so they can get themselves a seat at the UN. Why? It's not quite clear, either because they think it will give them more leverage or simply because it might be fun to try.Tilman is one of Banks' usually excellent stabs at characterizations, never coming across as anything but real, confident in what she's doing but human enough to make mistakes or know when things are quickly spiralling out of control. Her story here spans the globe as the Business attempts to manuever her into their future plans, while she does her best to figure out what she really wants. Along the way we get flashbacks and snippets of her life and how it intertwines with those we meet along the way, princes and mad uncles and various sinister types.The problem is, this is all very nice, but it doesn't seem to add up to much. In some respects it seems like Banks is trying to write a full fledged extended family like he did so brilliantly in \\"Crow Road\\" while also making the book a fast paced Grisham-like thriller. But there's no real sense of peril or imminent danger here . . . while it's clear that the Business has some monkey business going on that we're not aware of, the plan is so nebulous and the extent of Kate's involvement isn't so clear until much later that even when the plan is explained, I'm still not sure whether I should be impressed at the plotting or gripping the pages in white-knuckled terror. The pacing never races above leisurely and the action consists of Kate visiting various places and interacting with people there, as a gradual plan begins to unfold. Even when a deathbed confession leads us to think that more is going on than is apparent, it's more like, \\"Oh, good, now we're getting down to it\\" than \\"Kate, run for it! Run for your life!\\"Yet, you don't really miss the thrills because Kathryn is so well characterized and the nuances of his company as so interesting that its not until you're nearly done that you notice that not all that much has happened. Which means that the book winds up being a pleasurable, but somewhat empty experience, readable but not especially memorable. Banks being Banks, you'll enjoy the ride and the characters and the situations, but if you're looking for something a bit meatier . . . well, the man has practically an entire bookshelf of novels to start with first."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"I thought this book was very well put together until the very end where it seems like the main character's personality seems to unravel and ceases to be strong as she appears to be in the majority of a book."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Such enjoyable and easy to read prose. Banks feels so comfortable and natural in what he's talking about, although he could easily sound nerdy or as if he's trying to show off with so many contemporary technology references.There's a bit of a background thriller plot of some covert illuminati 'Business' of vast wealth, power and history, but it is largely that, just background. The foreground is the ramblings and reflections of the central character, a technology investment advisor in her late 30s. She's smart and won't compromise her views to flatter anyone, despite stating them with wit and respect. We get to like her and some of her close friends, and are buoyed along by settings and activities of outrageous extravagance and opulence.I found the thriller ending a bit unconvincing: I suspect Banks doesn't want to insult his readers by spelling it out too much (something which makes him far more enjoyable to spend time with that the usual blunt Clancy's et. al), but the crucial 'clue' to me seemed pretty weak. Also our heroine seemed foolish in her final confrontation - just created a powerful foe without giving herself any protection as far as I could see.But if we leave the thriller conclusion aside (which we can with Banks), the ride is quite enjoyable enough on its own. There's a bit of the 'noble savage' myth happening with the visit to a poorer country, but it's still interesting that he even bothers to juxtapose the two worlds. Banks seems to enjoy playing with cool characters with massive wealth and power, the most extreme I've seen being the 'culture' of some of his excellent SF novels (when he adds his middle initial 'M' to differentiate), but it's also there with his millionaire bassist in Espedair Street."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"'The Business' is an extremely well written novel, and I managed to get through it without too much of a problem. However I can't say I enjoyed it that much. It was a little too wordy for my liking and the central character, Kate Telman, was not altogether likeable.I think it would perhaps transfer to television as a mini-series more effectively than as a stand alone literary work."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"This is by no means his best writing however it's a much better book than it lets on to be and unlike a previous reviewer I rather liked the fact that we get hardly any insight into the mechinations of ' The Business .'Telman's character is believable and it's an interesting enough journey she takes us on albeit a little too superficial. Once again though Mr. Bank's can't quite capture the nuance and timber of North American dialogue in spite of his brilliant skills in so many other ways."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"He is one of modern fiction's most original and inventive writers, but this time Iain Banks has gotten lazy with \\"The Business\\".He creates the menacing, powerful and secretive organization known only as \\"The Business\\", then spends the entire novel not talking about it! Sure - we don't need to know EVERYTHING, but why make it the premise (and title) of the novel and then studiously avoid any details?The main character, Kate, has some very interesting moral decisions to make, but the book is spent with her deciding to decide to decide on her decision. When she FINALLY makes her choices on her various interesting dilemmas the book is over!I would have preferred to see Kate make her moral choices early (like say - in the first 100 pages), then see the CONSEQUENCES of her actions. Good drama is almost always about the decisions people make, right or wrong, and how people deal with the results.Don't write Banks off though. I prefer: \\"The Use of Weapons\\", \\"The Player of Games\\" or \\"Whit\\"."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Other reviewers have criticized The Business for not having a strong plot. There's some validity to this, but at the same time this is somewhat beside the point: the book is all about lush description and ambiguous emotion.
