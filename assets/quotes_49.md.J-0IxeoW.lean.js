Any Catholic (or Protestant who is knowledgeable in the least about theology) could refute this book without much effort.The case for Catholicism is made more by this book than by many modern Catholic apologists. Such slanderous attacks, having no foundation in truth, led me to consider that the Catholic Church is the one Church which Jesus promised would be so hated. This search led me to the deepest of convictions, and one which as a former Baptist I did not even want to consider, that the Catholic Church indeed is the Catholic Church mentioned in the Apostle's Creed and the Creed of the Council of Nicea.If your view of the Catholic Church is formed upon this book, you will have a very warped and inaccurate view indeed. It is my prayer that people will not be deceived by the elementary- school level of presentation available through a reading of this book."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is based totally on prejudice. How could anyone take it seriously? I nearly laughed out loud when I saw people recommending it as a book to learn more about Catholicism, but they were serious. I hope they are seriosly misinformed about Catholic teaching, so it's not totally their fault. If that's the case, then I suggest they read the Catechism (so they can know what the Catholic Church actually teaches). However, if they do know what Catholics believe, then I want to know why they feel it necessary to instead look to a book filled with straw-man arguements, misquotations, misrepresentations, lies, deceit, etc. such as this one? The only reason I can think of is if they're afraid of the truth. Now don't get me wrong. I have no problem with people simply disagreeing with Catholicism; that's one thing. Many Protestants have sincere questions about Catholicism. But this book is more than simply disagreement; this is plain trash. It relies on people's total ignorance and prejudice. If anyone thinks this book is an &quot;excellent book&quot;, then I think they need to do a little more research. Because either they are very ignorant of Catholic teaching, or they just like Catholic-bashing (as opposed to honest disagreement, which many good Protestants have)."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Bishop Fulton J. Sheen once said something along the lines of, \\"Few people in America hate the Catholic Church, but many hate what they mistakenly think is the Catholic Church.\\" There is a great deal of truth in Sheen's observation. Oppositions to the Catholic Church are often full of misrepresenations and misconceptions concerning its teachings and practices, such as the accusations that Catholics worship Mary or think the Pope is sinless. In some cases these misrepresentations may be deliberate, the result of hateful bigotry. More often, however, those who make such assertions have been unfortunately misled by anti-Catholic propoganda - propoganda like Lorainne Boettner's Bible of anti-Catholicism.Whether Lorainne was himself misled or in fact deliberately misrepresented the Catholic Faith, his book, Roman Catholicism, is full of inaccuracies.Here are some of his historical inaccuracies in his list of \\"Catholic Inventions\\":Transubstatiation was not invented in 1215. It had been believed for over a thousand years prior to this. 1215, however, was the first time it was formally defined and given the name Transubstantiation.Contrary to Boettner's claim, the Bible was not forbidden to laymen and placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1229. The Bible could not have been placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, which did not yet exist and would not for another several hundred years. At the Council held at Toulouse, France (which is certainly the council Boettner mistakenly thought was in Muslim occupied Valencia and called by that name), a inaccurate translation of the Bible published by an heretical sect (which claimed that there were two gods and that marriage was evil) was condemned.The Sign of the Cross was practiced by Christians since before Tertullian wrote of it in 211 (not 300, as Boettner states), perhaps even since the time of the Apostles.The worship of images was authorized in 786. In fact it was never authorized, as Catholics do not worship religious images anymore than the United States worships the Lincoln Memorial or Mount Rushmore, but merely use them as reminders of God and his followers or as aids in prayer. In 787, a council condemned the iconoclastic heresy which asserted that statues of Jesus were unacceptable. The council did not condone worship of such images, however.Confession to a priest existed long before 1215. Cyprian, Origen, and others refer to it nearly a millenia earlier. Nor do Catholics go to a priest instead of to God for the forgiveness of sins.Finally, the \\"Apocryphal books\\" (seven dueterocanonical books which Protestants do not accept as Scriptural) were not added to the Bible at the Council of Trent. Rather, Martin Luther had removed them, and the Council affirmed what had always been held - that they were truly books of the Canon of Scripture which was established definitively at the Councils of Rome, Hippo, and Carthage in the late 4th century.These are only some of the inaccuracies contained in Lorainne Boettner's inaccurate, unreliable, and seriously misleading book, Roman Catholicism. It is unfortunate that many have been led into a false view of history and the Church by this book, and whether one is Catholic, Protestant, or otherwise, nothing should justify going to it for information regarding the Roman Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"The anti-Catholics' Bible, it contains lots of misconceptions about the Roman Catholic Church, plenty of alleged quotations but without many citations to any source.

They often point to the dates when the Church officially names such previously shared and accepted beliefs. They say 'That proves that it was &quot;invented&quot; by the Church because it was documented well after the death of the apostles.&quot; The Catholic Church, when a long standing, all the way back to the first and second centuries, tradition becomes challanged or distorted will establish a special council to lay out the exact meaning and often name to a doctrine (example being - The Trinity) to do away with misconceptions. I use the example of the Trinity because most protestants are unaware of the Council of Nicene back in the fourth century that officially defined and named what was considered to be a commonly held TRADITION, but had at that time come under attack from various heretics. The word TRADITION scares most protestants because in order to discredit the Catholic Church they have decreed that all TRADITION passed down from the earliest of times is false if not found in the Bible. If you are a protestant reading this, read about the history of forming the New Testament. It wasn't handed directly from God's hand to Christians, but was a long process of evaluation in determining what was divinely inspired and what was not. Many books were left out that some wanted to include - they are known as the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot;. It was the Catholic Church who determined which books were to be included and which ones were not. This was 300 years after the Apostles. Please tell me what bible were the earliest of Christians using to verify and justify their beliefs prior to the fourth century. They relied on TRADITION. I could go on forever about the many gross misconceptions that protestants have concerning Catholic beliefs, but there is already a good number of sites and books that could properly educate if people are truly interested in the truth."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"The problem with this book is that is wholly unscholarly.

Went to Catholics schools, and entered the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange where I received an extensive education in the Catholic theology.After I left the Order, I spent many years searching for the truth. I have spent the last 30 years in the Protestant Community, and have experienced various Denominations.During that time, I studied the Bible, learning the Greek, studying it in the original. So I don't think I could be called ignorant of what I speak of either Protestants or Catholics or the Bible.I found Loraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism in the library of the small ChristianCollage I was attending. What he wrote was inflammatory, unjust, uncalled for (especially against the nuns). Strawmen were thrown up and torn down. The most ridiculous and humiliating things were stated as facts. So little was based on fact that I was appalled.I reported the book to the President of my Collage and he backed up the book. This for me precipitated a crisis. I left the School but not the study of Scripture. I will never forget the deep humiliation that had been heaped on Christ. What Boettner never realized is that in his hatred of the Catholicism he left, his lashing hate ridiculed and degraded Christ himself. How this hate can be tolerated in Churches that dedicate themselves to Christ I do not know. Jesus was clear that we were to love our enemies, our perceived enemies here.Those afflicted with this kind of hate should be prayed after. They are burdened with a cancer that can only eat them up and kill the freshening of the Spirit. I was saddened to find that instead of healing what was eating into Mr. Boettner, his cancer has been encouraged.We are moving into a new age where Christianity is being attacked on all levels both in America and without.

I will print the jacket of my copy below for reference..................................................................Roman Catholicism By Lorraine Boettner The widespread activity of the Roman Catholic Church makes it imperative that all Christians regardless of denomination should know something about it's doctrines, it's practices and it's goals for the future. Dr. Boettner has written an interesting and informative book from the viewpoint of evangelical Protestantism which presents the two systems in strong contrast. The present day Roman Catholic Church is compared with the Church of the first century. And Protestantism is shown to be not a new system that arose at the time of the reformation, as some have attempted to represent, but a return to New Testament Christianity and the simplicity of the apostolic Church. Constant reference is made to Scripture teaching,and the material is presented in non-technical language that the average Christian can follow with ease. Some of the major subjects discussed are: The Church, The Priesthood, Tradition, Peter, The Papacy, Mary, The Mass, The Confessional, Purgatory, the Infallibility of the Pope, Penance, Indulgences, Salvation by Grace, Ritualism, Celibacy, Marriage, The Parochial School, Contrasting Moral Standards, Intolerance and Religious Persecution. Historical aspects and the relationship of Church and State are also dealth with. Designed to be a standard work on the subject, this book undoubtedly will live for years as the most comprehensive and penetrating analysis available fo the two systems. It is an Evangelical Book Club selection................................................................My name is Scott D. Berner, I am a Baptist minister and have studied the Roman Catholic Church for many years. Dr. Boettner's book is an EXCELLENT reference work and highly educational. I value it highly as part of my personaly library and refer to it's documentation regularly in sermons and radio broadcasts. It is a work of Truth.The chapters on Roman Catholic doctrine are witout error or misrepresentation, I can assure the customers of Amazon of this. To the very best of my ability and study of these matters I do so attest this to be true.In chapter 18 of this great book, &quot;XVIII - Intolerance - Bigotry - Persecution&quot; , one may find a rare expose of the true historical record of this religious institution. To rate this book anything but FIVE STARS is almost a sin. I just thought I would take a minute to set the record straight. May God bless all who read this book with understanding and boldness to stand for the Truth.Just for the record I would disagree with Dr. Boettner on numerous of his doctrinal teachings. I do not espouse the Presbyterian doctrines, for I am a Freewill Baptist and find this to be closer to the &quot;faith ONCE delivered to the saints&quot;. However, our differences being what they are, still, I cannot but recommend this book for all students of history and the Roman Catholic Church. It is a worthy book. I thank Amozon for making this book available to the masses. It is my staunch opinion that every faithful Christian should have a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Catholic apologetics cannot ignore Boettner's account of the Inquisition, the Hugenot Holocaust of 1572 or the overall political machine which smokescreens its hidden agenda behind a non-scriptural, works-oriented system.

From there, branch out into the other Ante-Nicene Church Fathers, like Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, and continue into the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers like Athanasius, Jerome, Augustine, and John of Damascus. Check out Eusebius' &quot;History of the Church (Ecclesiatical History)&quot; also available from Penguin, and Jurgens' &quot;Faith of the Early Fathers vols. 1-3.&quot; Why read a modern Prebyterian like L.

Has intellectual honesty gone out of style? It seems that Boettner's hatred of the Catholic Church lead this pitiful man to throw truth and accuracy out the window when he wrote this forgettable work of lies and distortions. In fact, the reader can visualize Boettner with clinched fists and gnashed teeth as he swerves recklessly from one mistaken conclusion to another. WHY IS THE TRUTH SO SCARY TO SOME? Disagree with the Catholic Church all you care to. But for goodness sake - disagree with what the Church REALLY believes and REALLY teaches. Even some scholarly sounding types who attempt to quote from Church documents in these reviews reach completely erroneous conclusions because of the same anti-intellectual approach that Boettner takes. Instead of this baloney, try some real food for the brain - Rome Sweet Home by Scott and Kimberly Hahn, Born Fundamentalist;Born again Catholic by David Currie, Surprised By Truth by Patrick Madrid, Answering a Fundamentalist by Albert Nevins, By What Authority? by Mark Shea, or try the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

Indeed, I would even say that most fundamentalists who rely on this book as their source manual, or \\"anti-Catholic Bible\\" as Karl Keating put it, are aware of the dishonesty, but continue to use it in hopes of swaying the uneducated with sensationalist and inaccurate citations.For example, Boettner claims that extreme unction, the Catholic sacrament also known as anointing of the sick, was invented in 526 AD. The implication being that it was not practiced by the early Church, but was, as the story goes, Roman paganism incorporated by the state. What he doesn't tell you is that this practice can actually be found in the Bible. The Epistle of James 5:14-15 reads \\"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\\"I dare any person who finds accuracy in this book to support the vicious claims it makes. You won't see it. Jimmy Swaggart, Jack Chick and Bob Jones University avoid open debate; the reason being, as Plato predicted, because they know they are spreading malicious propaganda. To confront those they persecute would give them a chance to defend themselves, and with reasonable argument comes a clearing in the fog. The lies fall apart.Look at some other claims \\"Roman Catholicism\\" makes. Boettner believes that transubstantiation, or the idea that Jesus is literally present in the Eucharist, was invented in 1215 AD. In reality, that's when the term \\"transubstantiation\\" was deemed fit to describe the miracle of the Mass. The actual doctrine of the Real Presence comes from the Gospel of John, chapter six: \\"Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you\\" (verse 54). Boettner claims to derive his theology from the ante-Nicene Fathers (that is, early Christians who lived after the apostles but before Constantine). In actuality, EVERY SINGLE Church father believed in the Real Presence.\\"They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again.\\" Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to Smyrnaeans, 7,1 (c. A.D. 110).\\"For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\\" Justin Martyr, First Apology, 66 (c. A.D. 110-165).\\"He acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as his own blood, from which he bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of creation) he affirmed to be his own body, from which he gives increase to our bodies.\\" Irenaeus, Against Heresies, V:2,2 (c. A.D. 200).\\"For the blood of the grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood is mingled with salvation. And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality. And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul.\\" Clement of Alexandria, The Instructor, 2 (ante A.D. 202).Don't buy the vicious lies."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"As an ex-protestant seminarian and now a Catholic priest I know how wrong Boettner is first hand.

He makes claims that can be easily refuted by actually opening the texts he claims (very badly) to quote.

He relies on academic laziness in the hope that people won't actually go hunting and fishing to find some of his secondary heresay.

He states correctly that the Pope must be speaking \\"Ex Cathedra\\" but in the footnaotes makes is seem that the Pope must be literally sitting in his Papal chair, instead of the \\"Seat of Authority\\" of his office.The rest of the book is filled with much of the same.If Boettner had done the tiniest bit of research maybe he might not have presented some of these, maybe.If it wasn't so sad it would be funny.

For the Catholics here, you might want to read Martin Chemnitz's Tridentine Commentary available through Concordia Publ House. Three volumes. Good stuff. Good history. Good review of the fathers. As a Protesting Roman Catholic, those fathers are our's, given Rome's perversion of the Gospel and excision from the continuing church. The terms of readmission remain the same as in the days of the Reformation. Repent and embrace the apostolic witness of supreme guidance. Thanks. Have a published lined up and maybe will do alot of research, writing, and updating. But the rubbishy comments below by Cath's are one-sided. Can you folks still read Reformation materials? While the Index of Forbidden Books was in effect until the 1960's (talk about anti-intellectualism and control), have any of the Prot-bashers below read, let's say, 200 books for starters from the Reformation period?

He goes through &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; piece by piece. I gave this book one star because of all the reasons listed in the other reviews above. He does quote pretty accurately (assuming he has a source at all), but he quotes all of it out of context.

Boettner presents Catholicism as HE understands it, without any real effort to ask real Catholics why they believe what they do, and cites as sources many ex-Catholics, ex-priests and ex-nuns. Sadly, many people have taken this book at face value, without bothering to look any further, and have grown up with a vision of Roman Catholicism which is hideously wrong. A book which has been refuted over and over again for its bias, and which should have gone out of print a generation ago."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church.

As a life-long Catholic, I must say that her book betrays a fundamental (no-pun intended) ignorance of the true history and nature of Catholicism. The author describes a Catholicism based upon her own misconceptions (and those also held by her fundamentalist colleagues) rather than the reality of the Church itself. This distortion is not surprising, as the purpose of the book is to foster the author's own personal point of view by castigating an institution which, while flawed (as any human endeavour is flawed) is Christianity.Even worse, the book also shows a fundamental ignorance of the Bible and contextual scholarship itself; rather the author twists and parses words and phrases to suit her own purposes without.The author would do well to actually read and understand the Bible. Perhaps she would better understand what Roman Catholicism and even in a broader context, all of Christianity is about."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts.

If you read \\"Catholicism vs. Fundamentalism\\" by: Karl Keating to obtain the REAL beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church, and then you read this, you will realize that this book doesn't present Catholicism fairly, honestly or correctly...in the least! Not even close. This has to be one of the worst books, right on par with Fundamentalists like Jack Chick and Dave hunt.Trust me, this book will not, in any way, help you to understand what the Catholic Church truly believes at all. It's only success, besides consistently lacking footnotes, is to MIS-represent the Catholic faith with straw man arguments.If you really want to know what the Catholic Church teaches read:1. \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism,\\" by Karl Keating2. \\"Surprised by Truth,\\" By: Patrick Madrid3. \\"Pope Fiction,\\" by Prtick Madrid4. \\"What Catholics Really Believe,\\" By Karl Keating (Answering 52Misconceptions about the Catholic Church)5. \\"The Catholic Answer Book\\" (4 books in set - All are great), ByPeter M.

Boettner was horribly misinformed about what Catholics actually believe or was so blinded by anti-Catholic bigotry that he didn't care to get his facts straight. Any fool can knock down a straw man, which is all that Boettner does in this book. If you believe that fundamentalists are right and Catholics are sadly misguided and bound for Hell, I dare you to read Keating's book, cover to cover."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I bought this book in hard cover at a Protestant book store and was surprised at the low price.

So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)&quot;Roman Catholicism etc&quot;. To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is full of problems (like implicit christological errors), but my favorite errors in it are the historical ones.The best example regards the use of icons. Boettner mentions the iconoclastic controversy which ended with the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea II), then goes on to say that one of the chief issues dividing Catholics and Eastern Orthodox today is the use of icons: according to this book, the Eastern Orthodox refuse to have icons! This is not only historically inaccurate (the Eastern Orthodox have always accepted the Nicaea II Council), it can be disproven by simply walking into any Eastern Orthodox church. Eastern Orthodox churches are full of icons and sacred images! If a book doesn't have simple facts like these straight, how can one trust it with more nuanced questions of theology and philosophy?Boettner's Roman Catholicism, with its shoddy scholarship throughout, reminds me most of God's decree &quot;You shall not bear false witness.&quot;If you're curious about the history of Christianity and the development of Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"As a biblical scholar of sorts, I thought that I would find some interesting arguments in this book. However, what I actually found was a book FULL of claims with virtually no referencing to sources. This book is such a farse of intellectual trash that it does not warrant reading.The sad fact is that this book tells you less about Roman Catholicism and more about fundamentalist bigotry. His list of Catholic inventions is a ridiculous attempt at scholarly insight and he actually has factual errors in the list. Some dates are totally wrong and other &quot;inventions&quot; can be seen in practice long before the &quot;invention&quot; date, even in non-Catholic writing! Mr. Boettner, thank you for retiring. When you eventually pass on, I hope the anti-Catholic sentiment of your work passes with you."},{"Title":"Devotion","review":"Devotion is based on the movie of the same name. Comedienne Sheila Caston is content with her partner, Julie Rosen. Julie is very happy with Sheila, but can't understand why Sheila is hesitant to take their relationship to the next level (i.e., move in together and make a family). When Lynn Webster and her husband of 14 years come to town to offer Sheila a TV contract, Julie is at first excited. However, she's not aware that Sheila was once very much in love with Lynn -- and maybe still is. Neither of them is aware that Lynn has finally decided she's ready to admit her love for Sheila as well. In the end, some win and some lose, but the author keeps the reader guessing until the end.I'm not sure, but I assume the movie came first. The story behind this book is a good one. However, the writing seems to assume the reader has seen the move. Although there are many pictures from the movie scattered throughout the book, they are generally poor quality. The writing generally does not enable the reader to understand the scene in the nearest picture.I have recently purchased another of Kaplan's books. I hope it's better than this one. I'll post that review when I've read it."},{"Title":"Healing Image: The Great Black One","review":"This is a fascinating spiritual diary by a Western scholar of profound intuitive depth.

Chapters 1 &amp; 2 covers memory organization, interrupts, and timers. The tutorial at 8052.com(free) does a lot better job at explaining this material. The book has some assembler programs, but it doesn't explain the basics of assembler at all- doesn't explain directives like org, equ, and rs. The course at hkrmicro.com(free)does a lot better job of explaining assembler than this book. Then chapter 3 gets into interfacing the micro. It has some good material about swtiches, but then jumps into more advanced material like switch matrixs, encoding and so on. Why jump to this material when you haven't even explained the very basics? Why not start with some simpler interfacing , explain it, show the code, and build up from there? I skimed through chapters 4 -7, which cover c programming and more interfacing examples,but they looked kind of advanced.I kind of hate to bash the book because I'm sure for the right people it does have some good information. However, the books description says... &quot; it would be helpful if the student is familar with personal computers, binary and hex numbers, and had introductory digital devices(I'll admit I'm weak on digital).&quot; The description I think leads you to think the book is going to cover the 8051, assembler(explains very little)&amp; C and interfacing at a level begineers can understand-I didn't find that to be the case at all .

Death of a Dissident, while acknowledging the Communist state, is much more a book of real people living and working in this world. Just because they're communists doesn't mean they don't commit crimes of passion or worry about their children or whether they can win an athletic competition.This is the debut of the long running series feature Rostnikov and his two assistants. I'll certainly be reading more. It's fundamentally a police procedural -- but with both a Russian mind and the Russian system to work within.In this book a dissident is murdered the day before a show trial where he had hoped to get his message to the western media. It quickly becomes clear that this isn't a KGB murder but that a mad man is out there. Kaminsky guides the reader through a fascinating mix of genuine clues and red herrings. A good read.I haven't read later books in this series but so much happens in this book to establish the chemistry of the trio of detectives. It's worth chasing down a copy to start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Death of a Dissident","review":"This is the first book in the Rostnikov series. Kaminsky has managed to create distinct characters that you like and care about and also an interesting mystery. In the process you also learn about the difficulties and coping mechanisms needed for living in Russia. This series is almost on par with the greatest of the foreign mystery series-the Martin Beck series beginning with the Laughing Policeman."},{"Title":"Death of a Dissident","review":"Porfiry Rostnikov is a man of his time and country, a war hero, who has been a Moskow Detective for 18 years, he knows the score and the system. When he is called to find the murderer of a dissident he knows that he has to be careful in what he finds since the man has been under surveillance by the KGB.Everyone agrees it would be better if they can find some one not involved with the party, or state security apparatas, to be the murderer and not have a political reason for doing it. It falls into their lap that one of his neighbors who is a taxi driver is the perfect fall guy. He may not have done this murder but he probably did one at sometime so it all evens out.Even though he can't get his toilet fixed (our hero is busy teaching himself plumbing), he lucks out with the KGB, who thinking he has found a fall guy for them, bring his son Josef home from Afganistan, as a thank you. Unfortunately, they will have to bury the truth that the real murderer, is the son of a very powerful (black market) industrialist. But since he has also murdered his wife and some others, they will be able to quietly commit him to a psychiatric hospital and forget that the whole thing even happened.Most interesting of all, is listening to the day to day troubles that people have with plumbing, housing, food; that make the people's paradise less than what Marx expected."},{"Title":"Death of a Dissident","review":"Rostnikov the stubborn genius of the police is very likeable as all of the characters in the series. It's hard not to when all their faults and virtues are described so nicely.In this book and others in the series the author routinely lets you know very early exactly who committed the crime but he doesn't often explain why. The mystery often turns out to be why are these people committing these crimes and that is what makes this so interesting.I can only hope though that Russia is not as depressing as it is described. If it is then thank goodness I live here in this capitalist world with no morals.So if you like a good mystery that's a quick read then enjoy."},{"Title":"Death of a Dissident","review":"Buy them all!

Hildebrand confronts the differences between Neo-Pragmatism and the classical figures (especially Dewey). He argues thatalthough Putnam and Rorty consider themselves pragmatists they have failed to understand the more radical and significant insights of Dewey's philosophy. His criticism is not superficial. Hemakes an effort to understand even the particular differences between Putnam and Rorty. Bravo!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"Although many essays (and anthologies of essays) have appeared on the topic of classical pragmatism versus neopragmatism, this is the first book-length project I know of to tackle the controversy from a viewpoint fully conversant with and sympathetic to Dewey's signal contribution. It is quite refreshing to discover a scholar who not is not only aware of, but champions, the vital Deweyan conceptions of having versus knowing, primary experience, and the centrality of inquiry. Hildebrand's grasp of Dewey's engagement with direct and critical realism is exemplary, and his \\"deconstruction\\" of Rorty's antirealism is nothing short of amazing-\\"wicked\\" comes to mind! Although Hildebrand's alternative \\"practical standpoint\\" falls short, in my view, of Dewey's full transactional integration of experience and nature, this book opens up an area of research of vital importance. It is well written, informed, and cogent."},{"Title":"Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"Hildebrand's book sets the record straight regarding Rorty and Putnam's failure to properly understand Dewey's metaphysics and epistemology--a failure that results in their unwitting support for the very philosophical positions that Dewey had explicitly rejected. But the reader is in for much more than an informed correction of two prominent neo-pragmatist philosophers. This book offers a compelling interpretation of Dewey's metaphysics and epistemology, the key to which, Hildebrand argues is Dewey's practical starting point. This thesis is well researched, clearly presented, and rigorously argued. Finally, Hildebrand concisely presents some of the key debates between Dewey and his realist and idealist critics. The reader gains much from this book: a thorough account of contemporary debates in neo-pragmatism, a compelling interpretation of Dewey, and a concise overview of some of the most important philosophical debates in early twentieth century American philosophy. And all of this is presented in clearly written prose. Additionally, the book has many helpful diagrams of key philosophical concepts. This is the sort of book that will benefit analytic philosophers and those interested in American pragmatism. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"Hildebrand is quite fair in rectifying the philosophically muddled caricatures of Dewey and the classical pragmatists that have been popularized by neopragmatism. This is a must-read for anyone who has been introduced to Dewey via Rorty or Putnam. Not only does it provide brilliant scholarship in sorting out the misinterpretations made by neopragmatists, it offers a thoroughly comprehensive articulation of Dewey's actual philosophy as well as the sorts of debates that framed much of Dewey's writing.The greatest strength of Hildebrand's argument is found in his technique of casting neopragmatism's preoccupation with much of the philosophical conversation surrounding realism vs. anti-realism in the context of these early idealism vs. realism debates that Dewey effectively overcame. The moral to take away from this story is that it is often all too easy, despite these contemporary attempts to recapture the spirit of Dewey, to become caught up in the underbrush of one's own theoretical discourse. Hildebrand makes a convincing argument that by rejecting Dewey's metaphysics and method of inquiry (as Rorty does), pragmatism becomes anemic--unable to fall back upon the \\"practical-starting point\\" that enabled Dewey to so elegantly diffuse criticisms from both idealist and realist camps. While the work of Rorty and Putnam may face similar challenges today, it seems that without the insight that Hildebrand explicates in Dewey's view, neopragmatism is unable to deflect many of its major criticisms."},{"Title":"Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"The scanned copy of this book does not have the back cover blurbs, which I think are worth reading:David Hildebrand's attempt to restate Dewey's central message is intelligent, well-informed and well-argued, as are his polemics against what he takes to be Putnam's and my own misunderstandings of Dewey.--Richard Rorty, Stanford UniversityPragmatism was revived, in the 1970s and 1980s and was led at once into philosophical dead ends that John Dewey had already skillfully dismantled. Now, David Hildebrand corrects the record; provides an informed, splendidly argued, indispensable part of the recovery of Dewey's analysis of realism still hardly bettered by anyone today.-- Joseph Margolis, Temple UniversityBeyond Realism and Antirealism packs a double punch. Mobilizing a meticulous study of early twentieth-century classical pragmatism, Hildebrand engages the key neopragmatic positions of Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam.

The novel's &quot;young man in chains&quot; is a French student caught in a dilemma between his idealism, his longing for love, and his inability to break out of his self-imposed isolation and risk real involvement with other people. Written in the 1910s, this work to some extent reflects the young Mauriac who was attracted to Le Sillon, a vibrant social democratic Catholic youth movement that was eventually condemned by the Vatican for its efforts to root French Catholicism in the libertarian soil of the French Revolution. The character of the religious youth leader in the novel is modeled on Marc Sangnier, the leader of Sillon whose charismatic personality drew many young Catholics to his cause. Mauriac admired Sillon's idealism but experienced disillusionment with the movement's growing &quot;cult of personality&quot; around Sangnier."},{"Title":"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow: Living God's Dream for Your Life","review":"\\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow\\" is Reverand Robert Schuller's best book ever. In this very well written book, Schuller distills his fifty years of building, bridging, and ministering down to the truths of daily living.Imagine having an opportunity to sit with a very wise person for a day or two...One who is willing to openly share his personal knowledge about the stuff of life - who and what is most important, how to face and overcome the struggles, how to achieve authentic happiness, and when the race is nearly done, how you can look back with satisfaction that you became what God wanted you to be.Robert H. Schuller is no ordinary elder statesman. While labeled a televangelist, Dr. Schuller is not just a televangelist. He has a broad mix of experiences that set him apart from his peers and others with his years. While a preacher and a very good one, he went against the grain of his own denomination by focusing not on sin but on HOPE. His entire ministry has been dedicated to helping all of us to \\"become what God wants us to be,\\" the essence of his \\"Possibility Thinking.\\"He gained great wisdom while pioneering (an entrepreneurs' entrepreneur)the creation of a mega-Church , the Crystal Cathedral; pioneering an international outreach via TV; and creating innovative ministries to heal and help many of those who are hurting or are in need.His influence here and abroad is readily apparent when one looks at the creation and expansion of other Churches who have adopted his \\"Mission\\" approach in reaching those who are seeking. The work of Rev. Bill Hybels, Willowcreek Church, (near Chicago), and Rev. Rick Warren (A Purpose Driven Life), Saddleback Church, (Orange County), are just two of Dr. Schuller's many students who bear witness to the fruit that has fallen from the Schuller tree.In \\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow,\\" Dr. Schuller, with great personal stories and anecdotes, discusses the power of optimism; the importance of determining one's mission; choosing the values that are most important; living with a \\"right\\" conscience; measuring tomorrow's risks and rewards; communicating with honesty and clarity; understanding life's contradictions and one's assumptions: and the overall importance in believing for grand tomorrow.This is Dr. Schuller's finest book yet! While it is an easy read, it is one that you will want read slowly and savor. It is full of golden nuggets of wisdom gained over his 50 years as a committed minister, entrepreneur, healer, and possibility thinker. Dr. Schuller has been fully committed to helping each of us be all that God has enabled us to be. His underlying life philosophy comes through loud and clear. This is a book many will enjoy. Many will keep this next to their bed stand for years, and many will provide this as a gift in helping others become what God wants them to be!"},{"Title":"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow: Living God's Dream for Your Life","review":"This is not Schuler's best book. I am fan of his weekly show, \\"The Hour of Power\\" and while his previous books have been outstanding, it's because most of them have dispensed practical advice and positive attitudes to his readers. As you can see if you watch his show, though, he seems to be getting a little more \\"loony\\" with age, for lack of a better term, and \\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow\\" continues on that path. This is less his typical style of writing and more a pat on the back for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of his ministry, which don't get me wrong is well-deserved, and also an extension of his autobiography of a few years back, \\"My Journey\\". A little too much \\"rah-rah-sis-koombah\\" for my liking in this book. But it's Schuller, so if you like him, I recommend it still. Just don't expect anything new."},{"Title":"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow: Living God's Dream for Your Life","review":"Robert Schuller has ever been my inspirational role model and all his books are greater wisdom. Another author Paul Coelho comes to my mind apart from Harold Kushner,Deepak Chopra, Robin Sharma, Osho,etc whose book collection I cherish the most. However, Robert Schuller's books are great guiding light and stand a class apart in spiritual training. Robert schuller speaks the wisdom of living - Motivating, Inspiring and changing Attitudes for a better Positive living lifestyle. This book of RS reflects the most positive flow of thinking 'Be what you are, what god what you to be'. Rob shares his wisdom and power of positive thinking to be optimistic. With great personal stories and anecdotes, likewise his other books, this one has a fine line down the read that speaks of wise advice 'Don't throw away tomorrow - Live the dreams'. Among his best reads I like are:Tough Times Never Last, Tough People Do!Life is Fair but God is goodTough Minded Faith for Tender HeartsThe (Be) Happy AttitudesSuccess is never Ending, Failure is never finalIt's going to be me, It's upto me.Though my best choice pick is Tough minded Faith for tender hearts, this one is an exceptional book as it really has the insight to think ahead to future and turn dreams to reality. I've read all his books and they are best in my library. I also make it a point to gift to the people I like and feel I wish to share Rob's wisdom.

He tells us...\\"scientists are now beginning to recognize the existence and importance to our overall health of 'spirit.'\\" He uses the term \\"theosomatic\\" to describe that we're body, mind, and spirit. This contrasts with the \\"somatic\\" approach that looks at body and \\"psychosomatic\\" that views body and mind.Dr. Schuller has a chapter on contractions. He explains how we're faced with realities that seem to be in conflict with each other. He concludes that section that talking about the ultimate contraction, i.e., life and death. \\"I put my trust in one person, Jesus Christ, who combines this ultimate contradiction through His resurrection. Jesus is in the land of the living--heaven. Every one of us can think of somebody very precious to us who has left the land of the dying and is now in the land of the living.

He creates a character for each tool based upon its physical attributes. In the process of developing the characters, he includes explanatory remarks which develop a philosophical backing for the actions and purpose of each tool. &quot;The Toolbox&quot; offers a unique investigation into objects normally overlooked as mundane; the reader is encouraged to look again at the simple objects within everyday environments to see if they are really as simple as they appear."},{"Title":"Tool Box","review":"The abstraction to personification has a long ancestry in literature: from the bible, to Romance of the Rose, to this book of tools. So what is exceptional about Toolbox is not what Morabito does, but instead how [darn] well he does it. I could not read this book in one setting - it was far too rich for that. And I can see that for many years I will be returning to this book for that lemon twist taste on life. The hard cover edition makes a great coffee-table book, ensuring the regular attention it deserves. The only aspect of the hard cover edition which didn't appeal to me was the lame graphics (some of which can be seen on the cover). The graphics are not by Morabito and I found them a great waste of space and a boring two-dimensional accompaniment for such outstanding writing. I would have preferred to have seen some photography to match the quality of the text. Photographs may push up the price, but the writing commands excellence and it is a shame to see it brought down by ordinary graphics.

Author Morabito tells it like it is and metamorphosizes the rag into a vampiresque dependency that not just sucks, but cleans everything it touches. The knife is moved from a utensil that cuts into an imbecilic cold-hearted mystic who only moves forward without looking back and has only one pointed concentration. Each page is designed with a graphic remeniscent of medieval torture devices by Mexican graphic designer Bernardo Recaimer. As a package this book looks too enticing not to turn away, however, once one is embarked on the kitchentop journey of fancy articles into the linguistic world of poetic merchandise, one is not all that excited anymore. This book serves more as a fantasy world of Alice in the Toolshed rather than any real commentary on our kitchendary needs. After reading the first half of the selections, you will get the sense of where the author is headed (which many times the author seems to have a spontaneous direction in his writing). By the sixth essay, you will get the point very clearly that life in the kitchen happens when you are not there (or least not paying attention), which, unfortunately, the essays become somewhat repetitious thereafter.

Not that one is a subset of the other, but you can imagine the 2 games interfacing well in that time and place. As I read more of the Deadlands universe, the more impressed I was with the setting by itself. It has its own flavor of gritty cosmic horror which I find quite amenable.So what do you do with 2 complementary flavors? You smoosh 'em together!I find the Deadlands dime-novel format to be quite, er, novel. The adventure is in a small paperback the size of a cheap novel. The first half is a story set in the Weird West; in this case (ADIOS, A-MI-GO), the protagonists are familiar faces from the Deadlnads series, along with an interloper from CALL OF CTHULHU. Plus a scientific expedition from the Fungi from Yuggoth. The story does a nice job of adding flavor to the mechanical presentation of the adventure in the second half of the book. There is also a \\"third-half\\" of the book that gives conversion rules between Deadlands and Cthulhu.The adventure looks as if it would be pretty tough for Deadlands characters. Cthulhu PCs would be lucky to just survive the encounter while the novel seems to assume that the characters will actually do some fightin'.

The quality of the art alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Seraphic Feather Volume 5: War Crimes (Seraphic Feather (Graphic Novels))","review":"Seraphic feather is a futuristic story that takes place in the moon, i quite don't understand whats the role of each character yet, but they all gather in the moon after some tragedy ocurred, each character looking for a mysterious item called the emblem seed.The story in itself is not as interesting and the way is told is very complex...it has a lot of flashback that instead of adding to the mystery of the characters just confuses you...but who cares? hiroyuke utatane is one of the best manga artists i've seen...his style is unique the moment you see the interior art it will grip you...the sexyness of the characters (both male and female) and the action scenes are worth taking a look"},{"Title":"Surfboats, Rockets, and Carronades","review":"A wonderful addition to any historian's or researcher's library interested in the area of the Life Saving Service....later to be known as the United States Coast Guard."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"What could be more fun than a female secret service agent and a hair-raising adventure? I figured out one plot secret in the first 50 pages, but I still enjoyed myself. If this book had been edited better, it could have been great. If you can get by a few unplausible events, you're in for some good entertainment."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"The Day of Drums was very well written. The good guys did not always win, but neither did the bad guys. The Secret Service Agents, Johnson, Tylo Bryant, and Smith were up against a corrupt group of Senators, The Cardinals. The Preacher, was an assasin brought out of exhile to help take away the evidence Senator Westbourne was blackmailing the others with. The power struggle finally ends in the Oval Office.Holland Tylo, Arliss Johnson, Croft, Smith and The Preacher all have a history that is tightly enmeshed by the author Philip Shelby. Their history fuels the fires burning between the adversaries. Some actions, thought forgotten or forgiven, end up being the driving force behind the vicious revenge plots.A good political thriller to read quickly, it is very fast paced. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"This Pelican Brief wannabe has a lot of things going for it: a likable main character and a plot that grabs you from the start. However, Shelby compromises believability by using character lapses to move the plot forward. For instance, the assasin goes from slick to sloppy to explain Holland's life being spared. This book also leaves many loose ends dangling as a mystery from 15 years ago is often alluded to but never fully explained. Finally the ending seems way to contrived (just had to get the oval office in there somehow!) that makes for a rather hollow ending"},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"There was a good book here somewhere, but it was hidden behind too many inconsistencies in the plot, in the characters actions, and in implausible events. Many times you find yourself wondering how, or why something happened because when you think back to other events it just makes no sense. And some of the events are very implausible as well. The murders at the start of the book are a good example of this if you really think about it.On top of this, the writing isn't particularally good either. He jumps around with multiple viewpoints in almost every scene for starters. And many sections are not really clear either, you end up reading over parts twice to figure out what is happening. Still, the book isn't that bad. It is definitely readable if you like this kind of thriller, but there are a lot of better options. It will probably make a good movie someday."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"This is a fairly entertaining thriller following the current trend of male authors in which the protagonist is a female spy, cop, detective, etc. In this case our heroine works for the Secret Service. There is some unintentional hilarity in this book: The author has serious problems with similes and metaphors. The author has our gal lying in bed. Does a sensuous word picture describe the scene? Not really. He has her lying there &quot;curled like a shrimp.&quot; Ideas take hold of her like fishooks lodging in her brain. She senses events &quot;moving on the horizon, arranging and rearranging themselves the way a lava flow crushes and mutates the landscape.&quot; Here's an experiment for you. Fill a manila envelope with photographs. Hold them up in the air and dump them out on a desk. Do they fall out like &quot;butterfly wings?&quot; Mr. Shelby thinks they will. Later, our sweet heroine finds that her,&quot;mourning and guilt had been cauterized, like a white hot iron pressed against an open vein, leaving her swollen with contempt.&quot; Light continually &quot;crawls&quot;, sometimes through the window at dawn, at another time over tinted glass. There are some even better ones, but they have faded from memory. I would have rated the book a &quot;4&quot;, but upped it to a &quot;6&quot; because of the humorous similes and metaphors; Days of Drums is worth reading just for those."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"Excellent story line with intrique and interesting characters. Holland Tylo,the woman in the book is intellegent and strong. Some of the violence is graphic but you can read quickly through those sections and find yourself caught up in the twists and turns that are probably a realistic look at the Secret Service."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"First of Phillip Shelby's books I have read. Will read more. He is very good with his twists and turns and a lot of mystery. I also enjoyed the end were he explained everything out and you could see where you had guessed incorrectly. I will read more of his writings."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"I first read 'Last rights', in which I thought was a great book. I then picked this one up. Well this one is even better than 'Last Rights'. The intrigue of each character made the book more and more intresting, made you want to know what was going to happen next. Holland Tylo wanted to know what really happened at Westbournes estate, she has to set the record straight because she does not want to be the scate goat. I will not give away to much, all I will say that is you will enjoy this book for its shear brillance. It is action packed, fast moving and gritty. What else do you need in a good book."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"The novel is a fast-paced thriller. If my calculations are right, the whole story took place in just five days and four nights. It ranks way up there with David Baldacci's &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, except that &quot;Days of Drums&quot; doesn't give you time to catch you breath. The reader knows immediately who the good and bad guys are because the author allows their names to come out one by one once their machinations become obvious. If this was a movie, you'd know what I mean. Only the characters don't know who the enemy(ies) is/are until the very end. Good material for a movie. I just hope Clint Eastwood doesn't do the producing nor directing or he may botch it up like he did &quot;Absolute Power&quot;."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"This is the first book of Philip Shelby's that I've read...and it won't be the last. Every part of the book kept me turning the pages. I liked the entertaining blend of action and thinking. With rare exceptions, the plot stayed a step ahead of where I expected it to go.I found Shelby's name through Amazon.com. I like many of David Morrell's books, and Amazon &quot;suggested&quot; that I would probably like Shelby. &quot;Days of Drums&quot; does contain a number of bloody scenes with graphic descriptions. Readers averse to such scenes might want to choose a different book. This characteristic, however, does not dominate the book. Compared with Thomas Harris' books, such as &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; this book is mild in this respect."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"I hardly ever latch onto a book at the beach, but did this one. It was laying on a table at our beach house and I finished it in 2 days. Lots of action made for quick reading. Character development on the main characters was pretty good and the story was neat to follow. Makes you wonder how much of what we hear about is actually true."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"Authorities on overcoming fear advise people to get closer to their fears. That advice taken to extremes can lead to some pretty dangerous activities. That's the premise of Days of Drums which takes the daughter of a slain senator working for the U.S. Secret Service protecting other politicians, including Senator Charles Westbourne.When a deadly assassin targets Westbourne, Holland Tylo finds herself in the cross-hairs of a plot that threatens her career, more lives, and to reveal ugly secrets. The assassin's clever plans put Tylo at a disadvantage . . . one from which she has a hard time recovering.The plot is pretty straightforward, and the action's pace is fast. If you are like me, you'll find this book to be an enjoyable way to pass the time during an airplane trip or a long wait.The opening scenes in the book are the best parts. The book ends up being less interesting at the end than in the beginning. Those who enjoy reading about investigations will enjoy the solving-the-crime aspects of the story. Character development and intriguing insights are at a minimum."},{"Title":"Days Of Drums","review":"Excellent story line with intrique and interesting characters.

The work is based on historical research by eminent research historians and underwater archaeologists that enabled the author to piece together a more accurate narrative of the events.Whiting writes about the preparations of the Spanish, the counter-moves of the English, the battles and the aftermath. The story includes Drake's daring raid on Lisbon where he destroyed 30 ships and captured 6. The author believes that Philip, the king of Spain, wanted to intimidate rather than conquer England and also points out that England was by no means defenceless .Whiting paints a sympathetic picture of the ill-fated Duke of Medina Sedonia and the beloved Elizabeth, queen of England. Elizabeth's loving letter to her people provides some of the most poignant moments in the book.Appendix A is a Comparison of Santa Cruz's 1586 estimate for an Armada with the Armada which sailed in 1588. Appendices B and C provide the Composition of the Armada and Spanish Loses. The book concludes with a bibliography and an index. It is a vivid and highly readable historical narrative."},{"Title":"Enterprise of England the Spanish Armada","review":"This is a good history of the Spanish fleet's attempted grand scale invasion of England in the 16th century. It discusses the reasons for Spain's failure and England's success - an incredible mix of reasons and results, many of them well-known and many surprising. In fact it is interesting that many of the factors were not understood at the time but have been discovered by historians and ocean scientists over centuries of research. Although the book has lots of detail and even a fair amount of technical information about the ships, it is easy to read. It gives a good flavor for the politics and economics of the age, the competing religions, the persons who played key roles and their motivations and limitations. I can't say if a serious historian could use this book as a resource, but for the history buff it exactly fills the bill - much more than cursory review but not too much to digest."},{"Title":"Forever","review":"Forever by Evelyn KennedyI bought this book based upon the previous 4 five star reviews. The writing was adequate, the plot was adequate but, for me, there was a depth of emotion that was missing. There didn't seem to be much of build up for their falling love. One page they were friends, the next in love. Maybe I was feeling funky when I read it and therefore couldn't appreciate it as well as the other reviewers. Or maybe it was just adequate. Not really bad, not really good, but okay. It won't be a keeper for me and if I'd missed reading it that would have been okay, too.On the hot meter this was 2; on the love meter it was a 4.**Remember - if you want your favorite authors to keep writing for us they have to be able to earn a living doing it. If at all possible try to buy the book NEW.

I could stop there, but it doesn't seem like enough.Diana Colletti is a nun. The story should end there, but it doesn't. Diana always wanted to be a nun and her parents embraced Diana's choice after her older brother decided not to become a priest. Diana, also a nurse, has been selected to live and work in Kenya. Before she can leave, Diana must complete coursework and training as a Nurse Practitioner. For training, Diana has been assigned to Doctor Torrie Lassiter, a woman who is married to her job and takes her physical pleasures casually.Diana and Torrie quickly become friends and soon Diana moves into Torrie's guest room. However, after seeing Torrie with one of her flings, Diana becomes jealous and has to face her confusing feelings. She admits her thoughts to Torrie, the two share a passionate kiss, and Diana freaks out. The nun takes a week to think things through at the convent and comes back to embrace her new feelings for the doctor -- regardless of the consequences.As soon as they find each other, Torrie discovers she has an inoperable brain tumor. The best part is still to come. I won't tell how Torrie or Diana deal with the diagnosis. All I'll say is this book left me speechless. I wasn't sure whether to cry or yell, smile contentedly or go into a deep depression... you catch my meaning.This 10-year-old book finally made its way onto my bookshelf and into my thoughts... I'm sure for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Forever","review":"There is nothing more tragic than a perfect relationship that is doomed for an early termination by something that neither one of the people can control. Torie and Diana will win you over to their story, but once you know where it's headed, you'll spend the rest of the story hoping that a miracle saves them. It doesn't, but then that's how life is.

Besides wanting to manage a five-star restaurant, the prim and proper Mitch feels a lingerie and sex toy shop is unsuited for a real businessman.Jill Sheldon enjoys life to the fullest, as she believes girls just want to have fun. Jill believes her place of employment Just 4 Play needs to stay open not just because she needs a job, but because she believes this store provides a real service helping people fulfill their fantasies. She refuses to sit idly by as Mr. No Fun serves up lo mein noodles as Jill plans to become Mitch's mentor in the art of enjoying life starting with a seduction that will leave Landry dreaming of something besides chop suey.This tale is hotter than Szechwan style food as the lead couple heats the sheets. The story line is often amusing and the secondary cast adds depth especially in the shop. Though Mitch takes responsibility to a degree that is irritating (get a life bud) and Jill takes irresponsibility to a degree that is also exasperating (you're an adult sweetheart), together these two minuses multiply into a positively engaging sexy novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics","review":"In the mid 80's there was a drastic change in the world of comics. Books like WATCHMAN, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS came on the scene and industry took a turn. No longer were comics aimed at a young audience, superheroes were now \\"dark avengers\\" now inhabiting worlds where death and violence were commonplace. Mark Voger does a fine job of presenting an overview of this period in this book. The book itself is a potpourri; it sacrifices order for a scattershot mix of interviews, synopses, and commentaries. Exceptionally well-illustrated and with tongue firmly planted in cheek on many occasions, Voger keeps things moving and the book never gets boring. While the obvious candidates for inclusion are here (Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Todd McFarlane) are all included; it's nice to see creators like Doug Murray (THE NAM) and Dave Lapham (STRAY BULLETS) getting a few pages as well. THE DARK AGE really captures both the grand and the goofy with aplomb; from Spiegelman's incredible MAUS to the ridiculous poly bagged, multiple cover, sales ploys that eventually crippled the industry. It's all here; not an in depth examination, but rather a reader friendly overview of the last big change in comics."},{"Title":"The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics","review":"Whatever these other reviewers were inhaling at the time that they posted their reviews...I want some. Because they loved this book MUCH more than it warranted.I love books about comics. I have a particular interest in the 1980s-2000 and the rise of Image, the rise of glitter, and the spectators' rush to the false gold of comicbook collecting. The Dark Age by Voger promised to go into detail about all of this -- and these other reviewers said it delivered as much, which is why I bought the book -- but it didn't happen. This isn't an inclusive book about a fascinating era; it's a clip book, with a bunch of short interviews and short articles. Lots of pictures in its 165 pages...you're looking at maybe 90 pages of prose. And I think I'm being generous at that.An example of where The Dark Age fails? You'll find a longer article about the executive producer of the Batman movie than you will about ANY of the comic creators. There are huge gaps in information -- some of the most important publishers, writers and artists of the age aren't even interviewed...hello, Rob Liefeld, how are you, Neil Gaiman?...while Alice Cooper warrants a full page of blather.It's worth buying if you can get it at a discount. Just be aware of what you're really purchasing."},{"Title":"The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics","review":"The Dark Age is a magnificent look at the comic book industry of the late 80's through the mid 90's. While not an \\"official\\" age, the term Dark Age works first two describe the change in tone of many characters from their more boy scout, truth, justice, and the American way roots, to a darker, grimmer, do-what-it-takes style, perhaps best epitomized by Frank Miller's watershed \`Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\". But Dark Age also describes the state of the comic book industry. Driven by greed and spurred on by speculators, the comic book industry teetered on the brink of destruction thanks to the mindless waves of multi, poly-bagged, foil, hologram, and die-cut covers, and trying to create instant collectibles.Writer Mark Voger points to DC's \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" as the start of this dark age and provides a synopsis of each of the twelve issues along with notes on who died and other events. Voger interviews artist Dave Gibbons about the creation of \\"The Watchmen\\", the book that allowed us comic fans to say, \\"See! Comics aren't just for kids and nerds!\\" Gibbons discusses what went into creating these new characters as opposed to using the actual Charlton characters they were based on.Much of the content of \\"The Dark Age\\" is in the form of interviews with creative talent and Voger truly shines in this area. One of my favorites is his interview with longtime DC writer and editor Denny O' Neil who was the editor of the Batman titles during the \\"Death in the Family\\" and \\"Knightfall\\" storylines. Denny discusses how the Jason Todd Robin character really took on a life of his own and even he was surprised by the results of the fan voting that resulted in Robin's death.Another important event in the Dark Age was the rise of Image Comics and the artists who founded it. This may be comic's darkest period. Suddenly every hot artist also decided that he was a writer as well and we had shelves full of comics that featured impossibly proportioned heroes in comics that were basically 22 splash pages long. Artist Greg Capullo, who was pushed into some of Marvel's top books when guys like McFarlane, Liefeld, Lee, and Silvestri left talks about the state of Marvel at that time and why he eventually chose to join Image's ranks. Sadly Mr. Capullo, like so many of these hotshot artists, just doesn't get it. He complains that after these guys left marvel started emphasizing the character over pushing the artist's talents. Don't you just think that Jack Kirby is spinning in his grave! These characters have been around for decades and will still be around long after these \\"hot\\" artists have come and gone. It is precisely this type of egomania that almost destroyed the industry.Other interviews in the book feature James O' Barr, Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee, Mike Carlin, Erik Larsen, and Mike Mignola. To Close things, Voger lists the Top 10 best and the top 10 most ludicrous books of the Dark Age. In a twist of irony, Superman #75, in which the character dies, makes both lists. The Dark Age is an absolute must read for comic fans, especially those who were fans during this very unique period of comic book history.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics","review":"I grew up reading comics during the so-called \\"Dark Age,\\" a period bookended by the mid-80s release of such important books as THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and WATCHMEN on the one end, and was essentially ended by the implosion of the early-Nineties speculative/collector bubble on the other. Because of that, this book really had a lot of nostalgaic appeal for me, and for the most part it delivered.THE DARK AGE is a hodgepodge of topical essays, interviews, and lists (such as Dark Age Cliches, 10 Most Important books of the Dark Age, and 10 Most Ludicrous Books of the Dark Age) by writer Mark Voger. For the most part, I found it an enlightening and entertaining read. Voger's a good writer. My main complaint was that I wanted more -- more interviews, more details, more research, more perspectives. Maybe it's because of my training as a historian, but I just felt the book wasn't a complete narrative of the era. More like an overview.Not that I neccessarily wanted Voger to have detailed every comic of any importance to the era. That would have been tedious and unreadable to all but the most die-hard comics fan (which I confess I am not, or at least haven't been since about 1994.) But the book was well under 200 pages, and had lots of illustrations -- which I'm not complaining about, obviously it's vital for a book on such a visual medium to be heavily illustrated. My point is that I would've liked more info packed in. Also, I wish Voger had tied things together a little more. Last, I thought he made an important omission in not covering the comic hero trading-card craze. In my experience as a youngster in the late-80s and early-90s, comic cards were absolutely huge at my school for a while. Even students who didn't read comics were into them. I thought they at least deserved a little coverage as an important part of the era that brought a lot of new people into comics.That said, I still enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who can remember the days when comic heroes all seemed to be dark and violent, when comic artists were rock stars, when books constantly came in polybags, or with holographic (or metal foil) covers, when Image seemed to come out with a new super-team series every week, all of which kinda seemed the same and most of which didn't last beyond 2 or 3 issues, etc, etc,....."},{"Title":"The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics","review":"If you love comics like Spawn!If you know who Marc Silvestri is.If you consider \\"The Crow: By James O'Barr\\" The Best Graphic Novel Of All Time!

Happy reading"},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"I work for a venture capital firm in Chicago and find only a few rare moments to actually sit down and read a book. I found Savage Art in the airport on a trip and grabbed it as a quick read for the plane. It had me rivoted to my chair! I had to drag myself from it to get to work the next morning and couldn't wait to return at the end of the day. Everything suffered for a couple days but the ride was worth it! I've got one word for potential readers: THRILLING!"},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"All of these reviews tell you how scary Savage Art is, and I second that. But the thing that really impressed me was the sheer magnitude and skill of Ms. Girard's plot architecture and brisk narrative style -- she brings the sensibility of an old pro to this work, and if you look at the picture of her in the back of the book, only one of those two adjectives applies. This is a writer to watch, and of course read. She will be HUGE if she can continue to play at this level."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"A terrific read...great plot, fantastic character development and unforgettable characters.

Wonderfully written and remarkably well versed in all aspects of the plot (FBI Profiling, Anatomy and Psychology), this book will have you opening your closets, scanning crowds of people and wondering just how many psychos exist out there, in the real world, like the elusive Leonardo.If you want a &quot;movie like&quot; experience, with a strong plot, multidimensional characters and wonderful prose, then buy this book! If you're comfortable with books that lack originality, then keep reading what you have been!Hat's off to Girard and other first time novelists whose talents are all too often unseen and over shadowed by more prominent names. Girard's novel is evidence that lesser known authors often make more of a contribution to entertainment than well known authors."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"Savage Art is not for the faint of heart. Cruel, vivid physical torture is the main thrust of this book and the author's precise descriptions transport you into the same room, same location, and even into the body of the victim.

Once again, the killer has the escape skills of Houdini combined with the disguise skills of Lon Chaney. The psychology is especially weak, as we never really get into the head of the psychopath, leaving him a shadowy figure at best. Some of the situations seem a little too contrived to be totally believable, the FBI profiler's bitterness seems to overwhelm the rest of her personality, and the ending seems especially forced so as to result in the classic (now cliched) mano a mano showdown."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"I loved this book, it was really interesting. The various characters were interesting to read about. I guess anyone who enjoys a great book should read this."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"This is a good book, and the main character is very compelling. However, I must warn you this book is very gruesome. It contains being being cut up while they are alive and are very damaged, including the main character. Then the killer moves on to children and it was hard to read. There are twists and turns but it just depends on your tolerance."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"Savage Art is a well-crafted novel about the deadly game of cat and mouse being played between the serial killer dubbed Leonardo, because of his skill in \\"sculpting\\" his victims with a scalpel and former FBI criminal profiler Casey McKinley. When the book begins, the reader is introduced to Casey who had the misfortune of being a victim of Leonardo's lethal surgical skills, which have left her maimed both physically and psychologically. After her last encounter with Leonardo, Casey moved to a new city, went into seclusion, and tried to completely forget about her former life as a top criminal profiler and the fact she was the only one of Leonardo's victims who survived his horrific surgical procedures. However, Leonardo reluctantly pulls her back into the game when he begins committing a string of child murders. When the final victim chosen to be Leonardo's greatest masterpiece is revealed, Casey realizes she must face her nemesis for a final showdown that only one of them can survive.The novel is tightly written and fast paced. You will keep turning the pages to find out what will happen next in the battle of wits between Casey and Leonardo. However, Savage Art is definitely not a book for anyone who was unable to stomach dissecting a frog in high school biology class.The first third of the book was bogged down with too much descriptive detail about secondary characters that only play a limited role in the remainder of the book. However, I balance that criticism against the fact that Savage Art is the author's first book. As Danielle Girard continues to grow as a writer, she will refine the tremendous talent, which is already evident in this book. I certainly look forward to reading any follow-up novels from Ms. Girard, because this is a very promising debut from a new author."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"I found this book an easy read and was suitably horrified when I realized that Casey had survived her ordeal with Leonardo at a terrible price. Her attack leaves her disabled in a way most people wouldn't wish on their worst enemies. Her scars are not only superficial, but run deep. As a set of new murders begins, Casey is once again sucked into the world of profiling, trying desperately to catch a killer before he catches her. This really was a fine debut for a new writer and I can't wait to see what else this author comes up with.Thanks for reading!**Pandora"},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"Although I thought the book was a good read- it reminded too much of the movie &quot;Copy Cat&quot;.

As before, his art tool of choice is a scalpel but the subjects of his canvas are now children. With the help of Inspector Jordan Gray, it becomes a tense race to catch the very evil Leonardo before he makes Casey his ultimate masterpiece.Ms. Girard weaves an extraordinarily well-crafted tale of chilling suspense which will have you riveted from the first page to the last.

However, I got my copy of Savage Art yesterday and promptly stayed up until 3 AM devouring it, despite the fact that the later it got the more scared I became of every noise in the night. The story is fast-paced, intelligent, and extraordinarily suspenseful. And the protagonist, Casey McKinley, is the kind of character we'll want to read about in future books. I highly recommend it, and am waiting impatiently for the sequel already."},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"SAVAGE ART is a clever tale of an ex-FBI profiler, Casey McKinley, who is drawn back into the hunt when the crafty serial killer that scarred her for life resurfaces, this time with children as his target.

He uses street people as his personal source of stone. FBI profiler Casey McKinley has a perfect record of solving a case within three months of receipt. She travels to Cleveland to assist local authorities' efforts to bring this monstrous sculptor to justice. However, this time things go wrong and he captures Casey. He breaks the bones in her hands before fleeing to avoid apprehension.One year after the assault, Casey remains traumatized to the point of near paralysis. She remains in bed and refuses to work on her physical therapy. She sends her husband and daughter away because she needs to stay away from people, even her loved ones. However, Leonardo has not forgotten the one victim whose sculpting remains unfinished. He intends to complete his latest masterpiece using Casey's daughter as his material.Danielle Girard's first novel, SAVAGE ART, is a thriller that rivals the best of Illes, Pollinger, or Goldberg. The fiendish villain acts similar to Hannibal Lechter, leaving those with a squeamish stomach wanting to skip some of the more graphic sections. The heroine is a fascinating character who will remind the audience of Crais' Demolition Angel due to her vulnerability and inner strength. This serial killer tale is so good fans will want sequels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"I will admit that this is NOT usually the kind of book I read; for one thing, it's a serial killer novel, and for another, it deals with the murder and mutilation of children. However, a friend gave me a copy and I plunged into this dark, dark tale. I think FBI profiler Casey is a wonderful character, and the book is so suspenseful that I could barely put it down until the chilling climax. But &quot;Savage Art&quot; is definitely not for the squeamish. It's pretty graphic and violent.

The plot develops very well, the pace is excellent, and the main characters are well portrayed.

Also excellent!"},{"Title":"Savage Art","review":"Savage Art is a great first effort by a writer who will go on my list of authors to watch. Although the book's premise is complicated and the characters likewise, the book is a very fast read and almost impossible to put down.

The white South Africans may have been greedy and grossly insensitive to the black Africans, but they brought them into the 21st Century and increased their lot materially though they eviscerated them spiritually. While most whites benefited from apartheid, many risked their lives opposing it while others viewed it as a guilt-inducing form of survival and they emerge a more complex and human breed than we were lead to believe -- especially, that is, the Afrikaner majority of the minority whites whose roots trace back to 1654. What were they supposed to think when the whites in power viewed the chaos of the Africa north of them? Boynton says that when the first refugees from Congo arrived in Zimbabwe with tales of unimaginable brutality they could have begun a program of educating the blacks so that when the day came, they would be better partners in a transition to majority rule. Instead, the whites closed the doors hoping to ensure blacks would never have power. But by trying to ensure they didn't give up power and go the way of the Neanderthals, the whites evincing a lot of Neanderthal behavior. Now, after black rule has come to South Africa as well as Zimbabwe, a residual Neanderthal behavior survives in the form of brooding Saturday night &quot;razzes&quot; and a taste for senseless barbrawls. Yet the sweet paradox of the book is that you wind up feeling sympathetic for this ill-fated white tribe. They are split in two: one part of them swearing they were right about &quot;swart gevaar&quot; (black danger), that predilection for African countries to go to hell in handbasket with corruption and crime (two big issues in South Africa today), and spending their evenings crying in their beer at out-of-the-way &quot;bush bars.&quot; Others are willing, against great odds, to go on with the show as cops who really get the job done and game rangers who know how preservation really ought to work (hint: make it self-funding through legitimate game sales and let the do-gooders in New York and Oslo or wherever, stay there and shut up). While perhaps not as studied as Allister Spark's &quot;The Mind South Africa&quot;, a standard liberal analysis of the Afrikaner personality, it is far more vivid. Boynton's book does not play to a political chorus line either, which is what makes it refreshing. Some will argue that anything less than adulation for the &quot;cause&quot;--black majority rule--and its lead players is &quot;right wing&quot; but then they haven't been hijacked lately or had to put their family on the next plane out of the country while praying to get a green card. Nor have they tried to start a political party in Zambia or buy their choice of car in Zimbabwe. Then there's the 20 year war in Angola..... You get the idea that the Neanderthals would have had a better chance if they had borrowed some good ideas from the Homo Sapiens and vice versa. And in a strange way you also get the idea that if both sides come to terms with the fact that while apartheid was wrong, the context was also forbidding: the whites were being asked to bridge a culture gap measured not just in centuries but in Ages. Underlying the stories of Cuckooland is the unexpected idea: that the last whites in Africa (the original title of the book) turn quiet, inward, feral and disappear in the wilds. The best white cops we hear about are the ones working in game control, while the most centered whites appear are the ones in animal conservation. Even the Afrikaners drowning their sorrows at bush bars suggest the possibility of going out into the wilds before getting their heads straight and getting back on track to take up a realistic role in the new South Africa. Unfortunately, its just a thought and is not one that any post apartheid writer has been able to make stick: Rian Malan's 1990 book, &quot;My Traitor's Heart&quot; which addressed the need for whites to confront their black majority not just as equals but as friends, could not (Death becomes the whites who went native and lived in the black countryside.) Sebastian Mallaby in &quot;After Apartheid&quot; (1992) affected a belief in true normality as what would happen after apartheid--nothing. Rather than end on a negative note Boynton lets his own dream give the finale: it is a kind surreal episode where the whites simply recede and then disappear, leaving one last white man who emerges, astonished at the sight of an all black South Africa. The question is whether that is a dream or a nightmare--and if it is a nightmare, whose nightmare is it, the blacks or the whites?"},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"I'm an avid reader of books on southern Africa, and this is one of my favorites -- I'm actually in the process of reading it for a second time. Boynton's stories about 'white Africans' of varying backgrounds come together to form a thorough picture of the decline of white minority rule in Africa from the 1960s to the present. The sections on Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, the author's native country, are of particular interest and value. Boynton's conclusions are controversial, to be sure, but they are refreshingly so, adding a perspective to the debate on Africa's past, present and future that are rarely expressed. If you're interested in the subject, it's well-worth trying to find a copy of this great book."},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"Set in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The author clearly never supported apartheid policies, nor white conservative politics. The book relates several accounts of political activities in Southern Africa, from the Belgian relase of the Congo (1960) to Nelson Mandela's release in the early 90's. The author has managed to portray the injustices perpetrated by conservative white rule on black majorities as well as the frustrations of living under black rule, which led to general decline in Africa due to widespread corruption, bribery, poverty and crime. The book does not praise and promote one race at the expense of another, but clearly points out that those who were opposed to the injustices of white conservative rule over a black majority are still fighting atrocities perpetrated by a government run by black majorities. The book describes the effects of black rule and the frustrations of Africans (black and white) who would like nothing more than to live under an African government that does not rob one race of its dignity (Old South Africa) and threaten the existance of another (Kenya, Mozambique and Zimbabwe after independance). A thought provoking book that carries the powerful message that some Africans and sympathisers of black African suffering are actually white."},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"AS AN AMERICAN WHO HAS FOLLOWED SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY, GRAHAM BOYNTON'S BOOK IS A TREASURE. WHAT THIS READER LIKED THE MOST WAS HOW THE AUTHOR LET HIS READERS KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE AN AFRICAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE WHITE. HIS BOOK IN MY VIEW DENOTES HOW SADLY PREPARED THE BLACKS ARE TO GOVERN THEIR OWN AFAIRS OF STATE AND ECONOMY.

Boynton imparts some interesting information about his native Rhodesia and its final white rulers &#8211; knowledge that doesn't appear in too many popular histories, plus some in-depth coverage of the drama of South Africa and the end of Apartheid. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't come together too well. Boynton's vignettes are scattered and detached, resulting in a collection of short reports that don't work as an informative history of the region or its leadership. Side coverage of the famous (in South Africa) story of two mass murderers, and a look at modern wildlife conservation efforts, go off on tangents of dubious usefulness, and Boynton's attempts to tie these topics in to his larger point are unsuccessful. Boynton's writing is also rather inconsistent in tone, and his attitude toward the black and white populations of his homeland (which is most likely common among his compatriots) will also seem very inconsistent to outside readers with an interest in the subject. There is some interesting historical and social knowledge here, though it is doubtful that Boynton has added much to the world's ongoing interpretation of white rule in Africa, along with its end and its long-term effects. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"I found the book's structure faulty; I did not see why he included some chapters, such as the one on the murdering couple in SA and the Durban movement, which may have seemed important when the author was a student - therefore maybe valuable as a memoir - but certainly irrelevant today.Boynton may be a &quot;reactionary&quot;, but the fact remains that almost all African countries have declined in absolute terms since the end of colonialism. Congo's (ex-Zaire) road system is only 15% of that left by the Belgians in 1960. South Africa is clearly in a process of long-term economic decline. Add the AIDS catastrophe, which is going to wipe out 20% of the population within the next 10 years, and then it is impossible not to realize that something does not quite work in Africa."},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"What a waste of valuable stoutheartedness the story of the Afrikaners is! These incredibly tough pioneers carved a stern Calvinist home for themselves out of native territories and raw bush, survived defeat at the hands of the British Empire at its peak, and hung on to their atavistic racial creed decades after it was abandoned elsewhere in the anglosphere.In retrospect, the idea of a pluralistic democracy in Zimbabwe was foredoomed, given Africans' historic loyalty to their own tribes. The only example of democracy they saw firsthand was the Anglo-Afrikaner model, which had done them few favors in 350 years. And yet, majority rule swiftly became even worse. One watches current events in the new South Africa with apprehension, fearing a replay of Zimbabwe's slide into post-apartheid chaos.Boynton honestly sets down his trepidation as lawlessness overtook former police state. He later details the corruption that the new government engaged in, and the reeling in of the press. Could things have possibly come out right?South Africa and Rhodesia certainly had their chances. Boynton describes his love of his African home, his activist youth which ended with him being smuggled out of Rhodesia, evading arrest, and his homesickness during his exile. He also includes some vignettes about dissenters who were not so fortunate, low class Afrikaner desperadoes, and the fight against poachers on southern Africa's big game preserves. He closes with the quixotic incursion of some diehard Boer irregulars into a neighboring black homeland, in which three were killed. Thankfully, he doesn't try to sum up What It All Means, instead letting the spectacle speak for itself. Whether South Africa can truly become the multi-party democracy everyone hopes for, or if it will become a tribalism-driven dictatorship, is unknowable. But what a long strange trip it's been..."},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"I bought this book after reading Mr. Boynton's obituary of Ian Smith. I thought this would be quite a controversial read, bringing to the table the intriguing issue of the trade off between majority rule and the total collapse of every African country that gained it.

Instead the book's a collection of vignettes of various characters and seemed to be lacking any central theme."},{"Title":"Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland: Dispatches from White Africa","review":"Corruption, violence, and AIDS will throw most of Africa which is below the Sahara desert into chaos over the next 10-15 years, this book is an effective guide for it."},{"Title":"Muddy Waters - Deep Blues (Guitar Recorded Versions)","review":"This collection of guitar transcriptions from the recorded works of Muddy Waters is, simply, a must have for any blues guitarist. In fact, any musician with an interest in fundamental American recorded music will find this document to be a primary text for Chicago Blues, the development of the electic guitar, and the basic beginnings of American (and Brit) rock n roll.Muddy Waters: Deep Blues contains guitar transcriptions from 31 songs performed and recorded by Waters and his sidemen from 1948's &quot;I Can't Be Satisfied&quot; to &quot;Sad, Sad Day&quot; off a 1981 session w/ Johnny Winter. Studying these transcriptions has given me - a mediocre amateur - new insights into the varied styles of the famous sidemen like Jimmy Rogers and Buddy Guy and a newfound excitement in the discovery of some lesser-known and under-rated guitar gods.

Crowell, 1957)Ah, the wonders of bucolic Denver in the fifties. Weber has finally ditched the last traces of overt McCarthyism, hopefully for good (remember, we're only halfway through the series at this point). Beany has finally ditched the last traces of her Norbettism and can finally view him as simply a friend. But with Andy gone off to the Marines, that leaves Beany without a beau. Well, a new one pops up almost as soon as the book begins, with that weird disjunct common to the Beany books, in Hank, who is, in contemporary terms, an investigative journalist. Hank's helping Beany's dad Martie on an expose of uranium land scams. (The series dug into this, if you'll recall, back in the previous book, Make a Wish for Me.) Meanwhile, Beany's seventeenth birthday is approaching, and while she and Mary Fred are cleaning out the old window seat looking for something for Johnny, Beany comes across an old, unopened letter from Miggs Carmody, her closest childhood friend, sent right around the time Mrs. Malone died. Last anyone in the family heard, the Carmody family were transient, so Beany sets herself to the task of hunting Miggs down so the two of them can celebrate their birthdays together like they did when they were kids. But Beany learns the meaning of \\"be careful what you wish for\\"...The book does have some scenes that are shocking today that may well have been par for the course back in 1957 (in at least one scene, Hank's behavior crosses well over into the \\"domestic violence\\" arena, and Weber gets a mention of the lingering bruises in at least once per chapter for the rest of the book). Be aware. Otherwise, though, it's your typical Beany Malone novel, which means it is at once not a real standout and miles better than Beany Has a Secret Life. A decent entry in the series. ***"},{"Title":"The Apocrypha; an American Translation","review":"The book is a translation of the Aprocphya. It is a nice beginning into the study of early Christian texts. Its only flaw was that I thought it could have used a little more introduction into the work itself and its history. It isn't set up in chapter and verse like the KJV or other Bible translations so it may seem a little bit unfamiliar, but don't let that deter you as a reader."},{"Title":"The Apocrypha; an American Translation","review":"The current Vintage edition is just called \\"The Apocrypha,\\" but the original cover title was \\"The Apocrypha: An American Translation,\\" and Amazon also uses that for listing some editions. The longer title may have seemed equally simple, but it concealed a story; indeed a set of stories.Edgar J. Goodspeed (1871-1962) was a Baptist minister, and a classical scholar at the University of Chicago (he had published on Greek papyri), and by the 1920s was a well-known popularizer of critical New Testament historical and textual studies for middle class (and, many felt, middle-brow) American readers. Due to his criticisms of the existing translations, including the recent R.F. Weymouth (1903) and James Moffatt (1913) New Testaments, he was recruited for the Chicago University Press's \\"American Bible\\" project of the 1920s and 1930s, with J.M. Powis Smith as primary co-editor for the Hebrew side.The idea seems to have been to break away from the British-dominated scholarship and language of the past, and offer a Bible to a fast-growing part of the American public that wanted to be informed, or at least edified, in its own grammar and vocabulary. (The then-recent American Standard Version was just a modification of the British Revised Version of the 1880s; and deliberately archaic, in fact more so than the King James Version in places!) The sponsoring institution was to be not only academic but secular -- although in practice \\"secular\\" apparently still meant non-sectarian, in the sense of \\"generic Protestant.\\" (So a Baptist like Goodspeed might be joining with Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Methodists.)Goodspeed was responsible for both the 1923 \\"New Testament,\\" the first part to appear, and for the final, 1938 volume, \\"The Apocrypha\\" -- that is, for the translations from Greek originals. J.M.P. Smith, A.R. Gordon, T.J. Meek, and L. Waterman took responsibility for the larger Hebrew (and Aramaic) part of the canon, which appeared between them.So the \\"American Translation\\" (or, as some called it, \\"The Chicago Bible\\") was intended to present a plain-English rendering based on the most advanced textual and linguistic scholarship of the day, for the use of ordinary educated readers. It did not offer elaborate study aids, or theological instruction; and the tone was Christian, and Protestant, but non-denominational. It competed for a time with Moffatt's \\"A New Translation of The Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments\\" (1922-1935, 1948), before the Revised Standard Version (RSV) debuted, to great controversy, but ultimate acceptance, in the 1950s. (Some of those whose predecessors denounced the RSV as \\"Communist\\" now regard it as almost a last bastion of True Religion....)The whole project seems to have slipped into relative obscurity thereafter; without the backing of a denomination whose views it embodied, or the interdenominational standing of the RSV, it may have had trouble finding a steady market. And the up-to-date language may have jarred for those who had never considered that the Bible wasn't really composed in late Elizabethan English; although three quarters of a century later, with modern-language versions abounding, this is probably not so glaring.And it was (and apparently is) a target of Fundamentalist-minded \\"literalists,\\" over its more accurate renderings of the ancient languages (like \\"young girl\\" for \\"virgin\\") and following of better manuscript traditions (e.g., without a recognized insertion of \\"Father and Son and Holy Ghost\\"), construed as rejections of Biblical Truth. There are in fact some problems with the translation, but they lie elsewhere than refusing to perpetuate invalid proof-texts. (These \\"radical\\" innovations were in fact flashpoints for the RSV as well; and still give rise to complaints, although there does seem a wider awareness that the \\"changes\\" from the KJV are based on real issues, rather than deliberate heresy.)Some other the features of the \\"American Translation\\" have become comparatively commonplace. The relatively obscure Apocrypha don't provide, I think, an obvious example. However, Smith et al. may have been the first to use \\"When God began to create\\" in Genesis 1:1 in a widely-read English translation, instead of the KJV's \\"In the beginning, God created.\\" This was not, as sometimes still alleged, because they wanted to follow the (pagan) Babylonian \\"Enuma Elish\\" (\\"When on high\\"), but because such cuneiform texts had provided new support for a traditional Jewish understanding of the Hebrew, as against the Greek rendering which had been followed by Jerome and later translators. The Hebrew grammar of the verse is very difficult, despite the seemingly unanimous reiterations of precedent in older Christian versions -- The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) offers three versions of the opening words!(From an outsider's perspective, it is a little amusing to see some self-described zealous Protestants insisting on following Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions; \\"by Scripture alone\\" seems to have its limits.)As suggested above, the \\"American Translation\\" is one of the ancestors of the many \\"modern language\\" and \\"dynamic equivalent\\" Bible translations which now crowd the bookstore shelves, unlike the more formal-sounding Revised Standard and New Revised Standard Versions, and various more orthodoxy-affirming re-workings of the King James Version (KJV). Still, the 1939 complete edition, as well as its 1927 Old Testament volume, and the 1923 New Testament, all seem to have dropped out of publishers' catalogues long ago. So did the useful \\"The Goodspeed Parallel New Testament: The American Translation and The King James Version in parallel columns, with introductions and explanatory notes\\" (1943).But the 1938 \\"The Apocrypha\\" was picked up by Knopf and Random House in 1959, reprinted in a mass-market paperback under the Vintage imprint, and later reissued in the present trade edition. In these forms it has an introduction by Moses Hadas; then well-known to the well-educated reading public as classical scholar, but also, as it happens, a Rabbi. Which does add an ecumenical tone to the volume.For those not familiar with the term in this usage, \\"Apocrypha,\\" meaning \\"Hidden Writings,\\" was used by St. Jerome to describe books whose presumed Hebrew originals could not be found when he set out to provide a new translation into Latin, now known as the Vulgate. Where there was a major discrepancy between the Greek and Hebrew of two other books, Daniel and Esther, he based the translation on the Hebrew, but added the \\"supplements\\" as appendices, out of their narrative order. These books and parts of books were accepted as canonical by some Protestants, but others began using the term \\"Apocrypha\\" to dismiss them as unreliable -- the current colloquial meaning. They became a source of inter-Protestant as well as Protestant-Catholic conflict; and to add to the confusion, in the Counter-Reformation the Catholic Church treated some as edifying but non-authoritative, while the majority are regarded as Deuterocanonical (Second Canon).In a more technical meaning, the term now covers a portion of what Christian scholars (not Jewish) often refer to \\"Inter-Testamental Literature\\" -- much of the rest is conveniently classed as \\"Pseudepigrapha,\\" falsely-ascribed writing, which includes works of much later date.So these Apocrypha are mainly works found in the Greek translation of the Bible, the Septuagint, for which no Hebrew or Aramaic original is (or, in recent years, was) available, plus others which probably never existed except in Greek. Most of these are considered simply canonical by the Greek Orthodox Church; a few are debated or rejected, but sometimes included in Orthodox Canons; others have been accepted at times only by the Catholic Church among Western Christians. (See below for a list.)The genres of the books are various, including: prophetic exhortation (Baruch) history (First Maccabees) and history retold in Hellenistic style (Second Maccabees, First Esdras); Wisdom in Old Testament style, slightly Hellenized (Ecclesiasticus) and a more fully Hellenized variant (Wisdom, otherwise \\"Wisdom of Solomon\\"); and pious romance (Tobit) and patriotic adventure (Judith).There are reasons for this persistence of the Goodspeed translation of these works in print. True, most (although not quite all) of these works are included in all Catholic Bibles. They form a section by themselves in many Protestant and Ecumenical editions. But other editions, even of the same translations, exclude them. (A common radical Protestant practice, it was particularly common in the United States due in part to the ubiquitous Gideon Bibles, which ignored their very existence.) The Revised Standard Version originally omitted them, although the lack was soon supplied; and the current New Revised Standard Version is available with and without them, as was the case with the New English Bible (now the Revised English Bible).So there are still many Bible-owners who find themselves without a copy that includes the Apocrypha, and are curious about their contents. Goodspeed has long been an inexpensive alternative to buying an almost-duplicate volume, and by far the most readily available stand-alone version as well. (At times it has competed with single-volume editions of the KJV translation of these works; which has been out of copyright for a long time!)And, of course, Jewish Bibles never include these books, so Goodspeed's version, relatively free of obvious and obtrusive Christian interpretations, and endorsed by Hadas, offered a useful source for Jewish readers. (Some of these books have in fact had specifically Jewish translations and commentaries in modern times; and Jewish scholarship is represented in elaborate translations-with-commentaries in the Anchor Bible series, and elsewhere in studies and translations of pseudepigrapha -- some by Moses Hadas, as it happens.)For those left largely uninformed by the view of the Table of Contents offered by Amazon, Goodspeed's translation offers these books and portions of books, in the following order; with their status and some alternate titles in Roman Catholic (RC), Greek Orthodox (G), and Russian Orthodox (Slavonic Bible, S) canons indicated:The First Book of Esdras (Greek retelling of Ezra and Nehemiah; 2 Esdras in Slavonic Bible; RC 3 Esdras, currently in a Vulgate Appendix)The Second Book of Esdras (Ezra Apocalypse) (Greek; 3 Esdras in Slavonic; RC 4 Esdras, in Vulgate AppendixThe Book of Tobit (RC, G, S)The Book of Judith (RC, G, S)The Additions to the Book of Esther (from Greek Esther) (RC, G, S)The Wisdom of Solomon (RC, G, S)Ecclesiasticus or The Wisdom of [Jesus son of] Sirach (Ben Sira) (RC, G, S)The Book of Baruch (and The Letter of Jeremiah) (RC, G, S)The Story of Susanna (from Greek Daniel) (RC, G, S)The Song of the Three Children (from Greek Daniel) (RC, G, S)The Story of Bel and the Dragon (from Greek Daniel) (RC, G, S)The Prayer of Manasseh (G, S; RC in Vulgate Appendix)The First Book of Maccabees (RC, G, S)The Second Book of Maccabees (RC, G, S)Goodspeed's translation does not include the following, which are included the Apocrypha of the New Revised Standard Version, and in some late editions of the Revised Standard Version before it:Psalm 151 (Greek, Slavonic)3 Maccabees (Greek, Slavonic)4 Maccabees (Appendix to Greek)The translation of \\"Second Esdras\\" here is particularly problematic, for serious study, because this visionary apocalyptic work about the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and the end of the world has a confusing textual tradition, and Goodspeed did not offer a selection of alternate readings, or interpretive helps. (He did base it on the still-standard edition of the Latin version.) \\"Tobit\\" and \\"Ecclesiasticus\\" have both had their textual traditions enriched by Hebrew and Aramaic fragments from Qumran, and, in the latter case, Masada and medieval Egypt as well. (In fact two-thirds of the long-lost Hebrew for the latter has been recovered in some form, enormously complicating the translator's task.) So Goodspeed's base texts for these are seriously antiquated from a critical standpoint.Finally, the NRSV has set a good precedent by translating the whole of the Greek versions of Daniel and Esther, with the \\"additions\\" restored to their proper places, instead of leaving them floating without context, in the manner of St. Jerome.Goodspeed remains what it has long been; a very readable and very convenient introduction to these books and fragments of books. Its age and format (with an aging Introduction and only the barest of introductory head-notes by way of commentary) mean that the interested reader will probably want to turn to other resources later. The full editions of the \\"HarperCollins Study Bible\\" and \\"The New Oxford Annotated Bible\\" might be good starts; and include works Goodspeed excluded.And, for most of the books translated by Goodspeed, the Catholic \\"New Jerusalem Bible\\" has, in its full Study edition, excellent textual and interpretive notes as well. The \\"Esdras\\" texts are not included in it; but \\"The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha\\" collection edited by James H. Charlesworth (Volume I, 1983) includes an exceptionally elaborate treatment of the second of them as \\"The Fourth Book of Ezra.\\" It there appears along with \\"The Greek Apocalypse of Ezra,\\" \\"Questions of Ezra,\\" \\"Revelations of Ezra,\\" \\"Visions of Ezra,\\" and \\"The Apocalypse of Sedrach,\\" a complex of seemingly dependent works of clearly later date, which should not be confused with what Goodspeed meant by \\"The Apocrypha.\\""},{"Title":"The Apocrypha; an American Translation","review":"I have read through Goodspeed's translation, and I thought it was understandable and quite the interesting read. Everyone who values their Bibles ought to see for him or herself what the Apocrypha really says.

In a short space the author tells everything an interested amateur like me needs to know.(3) very reasonable price for the book, which was appreciated.As for the Apocrypha itself, it renewed my interest in bible study. I found the Maccabees to be invaluable to my understanding of the progressive combination of political-religious leadership, which provided a good bridge to understanding the political order found in the New Testament. The stories of Daniel were interesting in and of themselves. And there were nuggets of wisdom such as &quot;where man ends, God begins&quot; that were exceptionally thought-provoking, at least to me.

Communicants of those churches should consult their own authorized canonical versions of the Bible to determine which specifically are recognized by their church. Anyone generally interested can consult the New Oxford Revised Standard Version with the Aphocrypha, which includes notes on the various books and a table of which are included in the various \\"canons\\" (often under different names, or incorporated in the text of books recognized as canonical by Protestants, e.g. Esther, Daniel.)Protestants might like to inquire into the process of exclusion of various of these books; often it was becaused they are used by the Roman and Eastern churches to support doctrines rejected by Protestants, e.g. prayers for the dead. A single verse might have been enough to result in exclusion.The \\"canon(s)\\" of the Bible as we know it (them) are the result of centuries of argument, and many of the early church fathers rejected or accepted books that were later held the opposite when the Bible as we know it finally settled into its current form.But the \\"Apocrypha\\" can at the very least supply missing Western cultural references for Protestant readers (the stories of Bel and the Dragon and Susanna), and at best provide some beautiful spiritual reading from late Jewish Wisdom literature."},{"Title":"The Apocrypha; an American Translation","review":"This is a very nice book and very informative.

I am about to speak more than I know, so bear with me.WHAT IS 'THE APOCRYPHA'?The OT is in Hebrew, but this language fell into disuse in Europe and the Mediterranean. Therefore, it was translated into Greek (Septuagint) and then into Latin (Vulgate). It was in these languages that the OT came to be known. These translations contain some material that is not in the Hebrew original, therefore, in recent times, it has become customary to leave out this 'extra' material in English translations of the OT, and these have come to be known as the Apocrypha.SO, IS IT FAKE STUFF?Not really. This material was originally included in the OT translations because of its value and importance, and their inclusion in the Septuagint is understandable. They may not technically be cannonical, but that does not mean that these works are worthless or unimportant. There is much benefit to be gained by these works.The OT is the inspired word of God. So, things like Solomon, Sirach, and Baruch may not belong to the OT, since these are practical guides for believers. On the other hand, Esdras and Macabees are mainly histories. Tobit, Judith, Esther, 3 Children, Bel and the Dragon, are simply fictional stories, but the canonical OT has other, similar fictional stories. It is not always clear that these in the Aprocypha are necessarily any less valuable than what is already in the OT.ABOUT THIS TRANSLATIONI am not qualified to judge the accuracy of this translation. It is a new, independent translation in modern, easy to read English based on the Rahlfs edition of the Septuagint. The best part is that the chapter and verse numbering is in the margins, so the text is unbroken print and a real delight to read. I love this format, and really enjoy reading it.

It is also a great book for children in conventional hetrosexual families to help them see that gay and lesbian families are very much the same as their own."},{"Title":"Best Best Colors: Los mejores colores (Anti-Bias Books for Kids) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I thot this book was a wonderful way to show once more that love truly does make a family.All the colors of the rainbow represent the diversity in the world around us. Why should we only be able to pick one, or maybe two colors... celebrate this diversity, don't teach our children to hate. We must teach them to accept all people for their many different attributes and in no way to shun them because they they may have two mommies, or two daddies, or just one mommy and no daddy, etc... children can be cruel to each other at such young ages. Parents do not need to fuel this behavior.Please read your child this book and start them on the path to celebrating diversity. If this includes going to your annual pride parade, that's wonderful! The pride parade is becoming a great family event for our glbt community. It's turning into less and less of an event with topless grrl bikers and men in leather sm gear and becoming an exibit of the groups in the community that support each other and their families. It's truly a celebration of community acceptance and pride.Hate is not a family value, please love your neighbors and read your children this beautiful book."},{"Title":"Best Best Colors: Los mejores colores (Anti-Bias Books for Kids) (Spanish Edition)","review":"One of the other reviewers wrote \\"I want to make it clear to anyone considering buying this book what you are buying.

Angelo Mystery, Angel of Justice","review":"Author Rosanna Filippello, Philadelphia police officer, hits her stride with her fourth book and second \\"Bee Angelo\\" novel. Homicide Detective Angelo chases and captures a serial rapist in this one, against a finely detailed and populated urban background. Like Simenon, Filippello is developing both a psychological drama and a police novel. She portrays convincingly the character of a serial sex criminal as well as the reluctance of his victims to accept victim status, and the frustration of the police in dealing with this reluctance and with the tensions and limitations of law enforcement. Warmly recommended, especially in the context of Filippello's earlier work."},{"Title":"Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory (4th Edition)","review":"I feel that the emergent literacy component was somewhat incomplete. The phonemic awareness component isn't comprehensive. It assesses initial, but not medial or final sounds in isolation. The letter recognition section tests recognition by auditory stimulus (telling the child to point to the named letter the tester says) and thirteen by visual stimulus (asking the child to say the letters as the tester points). All the letters of the alphabet should be recognized or named by the child; but it is not required that the child says the sounds the letters make individually (yet there was a phonics analysis included later for kids who failed the prescreening passage). Special letter combinations like blends, diphthongs, and digraphs are not addressed at all in the emergent literacy skills sections, but were included in the phonics analysis just mentioned as was a section asking the student to manipulate words by changing sounds to make new words. Neither of the examples of case studies used for explanation of how to complete the diagnostic reports even addressed the emergent literacy component at all.I was also disappointed that there was not a writing inventory. Since reading and writing are so closely connected and influence each other to quite an extent, I felt it would be useful to have some sort of instrument included in the package.Another slight fault was that although the lists of sight words and phrases were comprehensive, it did not include the flashcards. The user was expected to make and label two hundred sight word flash card and one hundred forty-three basic sight word phrases. It took hours to do, and I would have been much more satisfied if they would have at least printed them and put them in the book for me to punch out, or included cut out versions in a kit. The authors did include some helpful hint on labeling and numbering them in case they got dropped, which I acceded to.I found the graded, reading passages are clear, interesting and grade appropriate on the whole. One oversight was that there were no background statements in the directions to be given to the child to activate prior knowledge. Yet, the passages appeared to be intact rather than merely incoherent excerpts which would not easily stand alone. However, from the preprimer level through the third grade level there are no expository passages ninth grade passages were strictly expository. This is not indicative of what you would find in use in the classroom. I believe an IRI should be as closely correlated to what goes on in the classroom as possible.Another omission of the ESRI was that there was no analysis of the types of mistakes made in context. You just counted errors, but were not instructed to denote the types of errors. It might have been good to have guidelines of how, when and why to do a miscue analysis. I was also concerned that the forms do not suggest a silent and oral reading rate comparison.For assessing comprehension the instructions were to give the questions as prompts, rather than allowing for any free recall in the form of retelling what was read. The comprehension questions accompanying the graded reading passages are simply literal recall from preprimer through the second grade leveled passages. The first one is typically quite easy; the rational being that it would build confidence. I found this to be a little incongruent with what the curriculum in schools demands. Starting with the third grade passages there is one vocabulary question, one inferential comprehension question and eight literal comprehension questions included with each passage. This is better, but still not indicative of what you would find in modern, grade-level basals and standardized tests which require much inference on the part of the reader. The rational the authors provided for the lack of inferential questions was that it was quite difficult to write inferential questions that were passage dependent. After all, we are assessing reading comprehension and not prior knowledge.There were some features I especially liked. One was the table provided with each graded, oral reading passage. Across the top of the table is a series of numbers that denote the number of word recognition (decoding) errors. In the column on the left side is a series of numbers that denote the number of questions missed. You use these to locate the coordinates showing where the student performed. The grid is marked with (+) independent, (*) instructional, and (x) frustration levels, making it easy to see where the child's decoding and comprehension abilities come together to place them at the appropriate reading level. Another nice feature was the easy to use table used to assess reading rate. It gives the number of seconds a slow, medium or fast reader might take to read each silent reading passage. The assessor just has to use a stopwatch to account for the time passed in seconds and circle where the child lies; but it did not give the formula for calculating the actual words per minute. It is easy to use, yet it does not account for differences in rate during different times out of the year. A child will be significantly slower in the fall than in the spring, since more learning and practice should have occurred.There is a section that teaches and guides users as they learn how to organize and write a diagnostic report which can be used to guide instruction. It gave samples of data collected and summaries of the evaluations with a few suggestions for possible treatment of difficulties. I found this to be useful."},{"Title":"Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory (4th Edition)","review":"Ekwall and Shanker did a great job in organizing a very useful tool for reading assessment in a user friendly format.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in \\"sustainability\\" issues or use of renewable materials. This book describes the growing use of plant-based chemical feed-stocks and materials although there is also a chapter on the use of feather (chicken, turkey etc) reinforcement. The authors selected the material very nicely so that the subjects covered have a nice flow. Topics move from industrial-type separations processes to chemical modifications of oils, to blending materials to get desired properties, through to manufacturing and current products. There is also discussion and data comparing materials properties based on source and processing. Throughout the book never loses its \\"readability\\" or interest. I started the book with a lot of interest in the subject and finished it with even more interest in the subject, and that does not always happen. I have read other books in subjects that are of interest to me and yet lost interest in the book itself and thereafter used the book merely as a reference source. This book is one I quickly decided I would read from cover to cover. It does assume basic familiarity with chemical terminology and some technical background but I think anyone with a bachelor level background in chemistry or chemical engineering or some materials-related field will have no difficulty with the treatment of the subject matter. Modern industry is highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and the polymer industry specifically is largely dependent on petroleum-based feedstocks. I think every materials educator, researcher, formulator or manufacturer should start learning about bio-based materials since they are certain to become increasingly important to our economy, and I think this book is not only the first to deal with the subject, but even as other books become available, I believe this will remain the best for quite some time."},{"Title":"Guide to 50 interesting and mysterious sites in the Mojave","review":"Bill Mann has obviously done his homework on this book.

Be advised that at this review, the information is over six years old and some of the sites may have changed due to people abusing their environment. Update 10/2007 - discovered that many of the GPS waypoints in the book are wildly inaccurate, in one case by over 1/4 mile. No, my GPS is not malfunctioning (verified coordinates with topo maps). I suspect that the writers attempted to estimate the GPS coordinates rather than actually marked them physically. This was very frustrating on our last excursion.

The obvious fact that this print on demand profiteering publisher has never even looked inside the book. If they had would they take a book about the Celtic Fairy world and it's influence on the Arthurian romance and stick a bicycle on the cover?! Can they not take a minute to at least take an approiate picture equally able to be lifted in public domain and at least not insult the memory of the author with this absurd cover. Lest you think I am opposed to reprints I suggest if you purchase a copy of this book you purchase the 1960s era Burt Franklin reprint. It was bound beautifully unlike these and it even had an added bibliography by another scholar Roger Sherman Loomis. Reprints are fine and indeed worthy projects but not this type of 'publishing' that is killing the book trade. C'mon a green bicycle? on a book about King Arthur?

Extremely well-written, they get under your skin and stay with you. I hadn't known Burke had written this western novella and was pleased to trip over it. A lot happens in its 150 pages: the writing is crisp (as always with Burke) and the two protagonists feel real. When they form an alliance in a hellish prison camp and pledge to escape or die trying, the plot takes off at a gallop and doesn't really let up. It's around 1834, and the two men make their way to Texas as the struggle for Texian freedom is in the wind. While they're mostly concerned with just staying alive and ahead of the men who are searching for them, they become enmeshed in the looming conflict.The eye-witness history is fun, but it's the characterizations and situations that really work here. This is as good a western as you're likely to find, as sharp in places as some of McMurtry's best. Recommended, even if you don't generally read westerns."},{"Title":"Two for Texas","review":"I've read most all of Mr. Burke's books, don't know how I had missed Two for Texas but glad I found it.

Two for Texas takes place in both places. Son Holland is the main character. He has been falsely accused of being involved in a crime ring and sentenced to hard time in a Louisiana penal camp by the French gentlemen that control the city.While in this camp, Holland meets Hugh, a loud-mouthed, opinionated, walleyed older man who engineers a chance to escape to Texas. But, when they escape they end up killing one of the two downright evil French brothers that run the camp. This is 1834 and Texas is a foreign country - technically still a part of Mexico but certainly preparing to rebel and create the Republic of Texas.Hugh and Holland live among Indians, dodge the Mexican Army and flee the posse sent after them from the prison (led by the surviving evil French brother) that is pursuing them. They decide to hide by joining General Sam Houston's fledgling army as war between Mexico and Texas erupts.Veteran actor Will Patton did an outstanding job with this book. He covered a wide variety of accents making them all unique. But, his best performance was reserved for the character of Hugh. Hugh's smart comments, bad attitude and ability to tell the most elaborate lies at the drop of the hat make him a memorable character. Patton's raspy characterization makes every scene with him pop.Note: The book's description on the back of the box claims that Hugh and Holland join the Texas Rangers and fight in the Battle of the Alamo.

For former students the pertinent parts may serve as a mostly boring trip down memory lane.

In short, the book is nothing but a joke made by a self-important person who needs very serious help in his spiritual world. Most of his words echoed how leading firms in Corporate America recruit staff. As a former Harvard Business School graduate, I would say, I am really ashamed of what I have seen daily. And the author clearly wants to make discrimination a religion. If people are no longer legally encouraged to judge by the color of skin, they are now awarded to judge simply by which school they are from. In the eye of some of my colleagues, or maybe the author, a corrupt foreign official who managed to send his son with stolen money to Harvard is clearly a much greater contributor to our society, if compared to a lowly waitor, whose son can only choose to go to a state school because of financial reasons.Undoubtedly, Harvard is the most successful school in the United States. Yet, how successful? You can list a 1000 examples how Harvard changed this nation. However, those are out of 1,000,000 examples in most of which Harvard failed to do so. Harvard is lucky enough to attract the nation's most brilliant minds into its campus. Quite a few of them become incredibly successful. A lot more get quickly forgotten in this society.I would like to draw an analogy here. When you are at the foot of a mountain, you feel even the sun was overshadowed by the mountain's great peak. If you stand right on the top of that peak, you might feel frustrated that the mountain does not bring you close enough to the sun while making you feel really cold."},{"Title":"Firstfruits","review":"In this digest, published to celebrate the 1973 25th anniversary of the re-establishment of the State of Israel, compiled and edited by James Michener, we examine 15 short stories by the cream of Israeli writing talent during the State of Israel's formative years.This digest gives us a glimpse into the defined national culture of Israel, and the struggles of it's people.It displays the strength and sensitivity of a people, who have re-established their roots in their native soil, a young and vigorous people, forced to live under military siege and never-ending threats of anihilation.It also deals with human nature at it's most colourful and deep.It illustrates adaptation to kibbutz life, of the ancient roots in the Jewish past, of childhoods growing up in Israel, and of life in Israel's cities.This work showcases the writings of such authors as SY Agnon, Benjamin Tammuz, Amos Oz, Yithzhac Orpaz, Asher Barash, Yitzhak Shenhar, Aharon Megged, Haim Hazaz, Yehuda Yaari, Avraham B Yehoshuah, Natan Shacham, Hedda Bosem, Moshe Shamir, Yoram Kaniuk, and Hanoch Bartov.In An Enigma Benjamin Tammuz writes of the life of an Israeli family before the death of their little girl froma mysterious illness, In Hai's Well Asher Barash deals with the dedication of a pioneer to bring water to a Jewish community in the Holy Land, Tehilah by SY Agnon speaks of the amazing life of an extraordinary woman, in Jerusalem, who lives to a great age, On Galilean Shores by Yitzhak Shenehar deals with the relationships between young pioneers near the Kinneret Sea, and The Sermon by Haim Hazaz discusses in some depth the issues of the Jewish people, and their restoration to their ancient homeland. The Wanderer and the Blind Man by Yehudah Yaari is an illustration of mysery and humanity in Jerusalem, while In A Son's Footsteps by Hanoch Bartow explores the conflict between a father and son and the tragedy of the wars that have devoured Israel's children, since her creation. In A Long Hot Day by Avraham B Yehoshuah, the pain of an Israeli family, after the father is diagnoses with cancer, is depicted, while Nomad and Viper by Amos Oz explores the tragedy of the struggles of communities in the Negev, and the tragic plight of a young Jewish woman in one of the kibbutzim, and Next of Kin by Moshe Shamir tells of the victims of the Arab terror raidns into Israel.It is a testament to the richness of Israeli literature and Israeli life.The book affirms the extraordinary spirit of the people of Israel,the most humane, giving, life-affirming people on the planet--whatever sick propaganda you might have read to the contrary."},{"Title":"Firstfruits","review":"This volume was conceived as a present for Israel on its twenty- fifth birthday. The JPS editorial board led by Chaim Potok decided a good gift would be a book of Israel's best short stories. Potok writes the forward to the volume and James Michener, the editor, writes the Introduction. In his forward Potok speaks about 'serious stories.' Serious stories 'focus upon aspects of reality indiscernible to science and history, upon the invisibletracery of lines that connect human beings to one another and to the different worlds in which men live. It is these lines that the serious storyteller explores, the linesthat bind each of us to our own inner being, to other beings , to bodies of ideas, to old andnew loyalties to neighborhoods and nations.\\"Michener's introduction is a beautiful paean to modern Israel, how it has brought to 'abundant life a long dormant land.'The introduction by Michener chronicling his own experiences in Israel in itself makes the volume worthwhile.But there are a numberof outstanding stories , stories of Benjamin Tammuz, Asher Barash, Yitzhak Shenhar, Aharon Megged, Hanoch Bartov, A.B.

From offbeat illustrator Joel Stewart comes this utterly charming picture book adaptation of the celebrated nonsense rhyme \\"Jabberwocky\\" from Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" In muted, sepia tones sparked with lime green, lemon yellow and apple red, Stewart paints the mysterious Jabberwocky as a creature part English dandy, part Beetlejuice and part hedge. \\"And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame&#65533;\\" and -- according to Stewart's whimsical drawings -- teeth of checker boards, guts of a robot, and elongated claws of regular manicure appointments. A supporting cast of characters appear and disappear without explanation (though, of course, none is needed) as do the odd cameo appearances of different postage stamps on every spread. None of this lovely nonsense should be surprising, as we've seen Stewart's quirky style before, in the picture book \\"The Adventures of a Nose,\\" the strange story of a nose's quest for belonging.

She poses some fascinating insights and questions about Celtic prehistory. My problem with the book is that it fails on a scholarly basis--she does not quote many direct sources--the primary sources she draws from such as the Lebor Gabala Erenn (The Book of Invasions) and the Yellow Book of Lecan are few and far between. Most of her sources are merely other New Age books. Which only gives added ammunition to critics of contemporary paganism who say we are &quot;making it all up.&quot; I enjoyed her trying to make the warrior goddess aspect applicable to contemporary women. I enjoyed her trying to wed Celtic spirituality with women's spirituality. But I found myself reading this book with a critical distance, as much sympathy as I have to her views. To gain real insight into Celtic spirituality, one must read deeper into the primary sources, the surviving Celtic texts. It helps to learn at least one of the Celtic languages. I don't feel that she has made this leap of scholarship. To get a deeper view into Celtic spirituality, I recommend the work of Caitlin Matthews, although my personal problem with Matthews is that she seems positively anti-feminist. I had bought McCoy's book hoping to find Matthews' serious research wedded to a portrait of strong and resourceful Celtic women."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"It's true that the scholarship in this book is very shaky. Although she calls herself a &quot;historian&quot; in her author's bio on the back cover, the historical resources are somewhat shoddy, and the work is certainly not written from a place of scholarship (for instance, no footnotes when historical assertions are made, no real references). However, I don't think that detracts from the usefulness of this book.Although there is very little scholarship in this book, it is still filled with a number of useful meditations and spellwork that can be used in modern feminist spirituality. If you are looking for hard-core Celtic spirituality, this may not be the book for you. But, if you're looking for a book that will help you to enhance your (wiccan/witchcraft/goddess-oriented) practice with some ideas based in Celtic mythology and rooted in modern Wicca, then you may find this useful.It may also be useful as a book to help you think differently about the Celtic spiritual path you are already on. If you are open to different ideas, then you will find it useful. If not, then you may want to pass."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"....I found it to be a beautiful, inspiring book. First, it pleasantly surprised me by assuming a working knowledge of \\"Wicca 101\\" and didn't spend the first five chapters rehashing \\"How to Cast a Circle.\\" If you need that information, you can find it in the appendices; if you have already read some of the gazillions of Wicca 101 books on the market, you can just start at the beginning of the book and jump right into the new material. Reading on, it was chock-full of suggestions on how to incorporate ancient Celtic ideas into a modern spirituality that can be meaningful to women today, including guided meditations, rituals, folk spells, a neo-pagan calendar of Celtic women's festivals, and an absolutely tear-jerking \\"soul-friend\\" bonding ritual..... I see nothing in the book to indicate that McCoy is trying to pass this material off as ancient. On the contrary, whenever she discusses a concept that has no known basis in ancient Celtic history, she says so. It is important to preserve all the history we can, as a basis for our spirituality; it is also important to build upon that history, adapting and creating new rituals to make the ancient concepts more meaningful to us today. We need to look to both the past and the future. This book is not intended to be a book of history, but a book of dreams, designed to inspire modern women in their quest for meaningful new rituals. So, I say, read historical works on the Celts, and read this too.It's also been said that McCoy is lumping together very different Celtic cultures into one homogeneous culture that never really existed. Actually, the only place where that generalization is used is in the title. She comes straight out and says that the Celts were nowhere near as unified as we sometimes think, and whenever she mentions a specific Goddess, she says \\"So-and-so, an Irish/Cornish/Welsh/Continental/etc. Goddess\\", not \\"Celtic Goddess.\\" She is concerned with the common threads that the cultures _did_ have in common, but she keeps her pantheons straight.My only gripe: There were a few errors that could have been caught in editing. For example, the name Cormac was used for Conchobar a couple of times. However, a reader with a working knowledge of the myths can easily mentally correct these arrors and read on."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"Three stars for the Triple Goddess only, and NOT for the author! Can I grab Edain McCoy by her collar and shake her a few times? As an academic historian of Ireland and Irish people, I am always appalled at the way some authors toss around the word &quot;Celtic&quot;--as if all of the tribes existed in pure harmony with each other. Edain, you've heard of the Welsh, the Manx, the Bretons, the Scots, the Gallicians? &quot;Celtic&quot; is almost as impossible to define as American. At any rate, it's my thought that the author and publisher thought to take advantage of pliable minds subsceptible to, let's call it, Celtic Faery Magic. Preying on the weak is not a &quot;Celtic&quot; trait.As for McCoy, I wonder that she finds herself authority enough to become the author of--what? Two dozen books, maybe?--on roughly the same subject. Her tradition of Witta, which is supposedly Irish Witchcraft, is pure fantasy. I would recommend that skeptical readers looking for tight information look elsewhere--after all, this book could very well be a flight of fancy too. Cheers."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"Celtic Women's Spirituality is at best an introduction to Celtic Wicca. Without delving much into history or myth and legend, McCoy pulls out some aspects that she sees in ancient Celtic religion and connects them to aspects of mainstream Wicca. She envisions the three-faced Goddesses in Celtic mythology as the triple-goddess (virgin, mother, and crone) in Wicca, overemphasizes the female warrior in Celtic history in order to create a strong archetype for women to follow, has a number of sections about \\"Celtic shamanism,\\" and provides a lengthy, somewhat arbitrary wheel of the year. The book is a broad introduction to Celtic Wicca, with a general overview of the factors that she sees as important and a sprinkling of guided meditations and rituals. What Celtic Women's Spirituality is not is an introduction to historic pre-Christian Celtic religion. Many of the factors that McCoy focuses on don't arise from Celtic myth or Celtic history, and they are heavily adapted to fit Wicca. If you are interested in \\"actual\\" Celtic religion and culture, or Celtic Reconstruction, this is not the book for you.McCoy does her audience a disservice by not clearly separating Celtic myth and history from Wiccan aspects or showing where fact ends and her extrapolations begin. She writes as if everything she says comes directly from and applies well to Wicca, implying that aspects such as the three-fold Goddess and Celtic shamanism are authentic aspects of pre-Christian Celtic religions. However, the version of Celtic religion that McCoy presents in this book is actually highly adapted and modified to fit Wicca, sometimes picking up on similar strains, sometimes extrapolating from what was into what could be. As such, this book should be considered Celtic Wicca, not Celtic Paganism.As a book on Celtic Wicca, McCoy writes a broad but clear introduction to the faith as she sees it. She doesn't delve into great depth but she gives an overview of a number of aspects (conceptions of self, conceptions of Goddess figures, a few rituals, a number of guided mediations, and a number of correlations between symbol/deity/meaning). The few Celtic aspects that she focuses on she translates well into a Wiccan context. The entire book is geared towards women, and encourages strength, independence, and self-association to the female deities. It is actually a rather enjoyable, self-affirming read.That said, this book shouldn't be confused with Celtic myth, history, or pre-Christian religion. McCoy's basis in Celtic myth and history is limited at best, and all of the aspects she focuses on are highly adapted and interpolated. While she sums up the myths on a broad scale, the detail that she draws from them, as well as from Celtic society and ancient religious practice, are more opinion that fact. If your interest lies in actual Celtic Pagan religious beliefs and practices, for either academic or religious reasons, then you will have better luck reading textbooks and history books. I'd direct you towards the \\"Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism\\" religion and encourage you to skip this text--no matter how easy it is to read, it has a limited basis in history, comes highly adapted, and is misleading. Doing research on actual Celtic history and religion will take longer, but it will unearth facts rather than opinions and will provide much more depth than McCoy's text."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"*Merry Meet* It's unbelievable how a great, simple book on women's neopagan sprituality can be misunderstood &amp; misconstrued. Reading the reviews below, I take it that some folks(mostly fundamentalist euro-trads) don't understand the term NEOPAGAN. Yes, this book is NOT your early historical account on 'Celtic' lore but IT IS a progressive, updated, if you will; VIEW on the Celtic mythos. I have found this book to be a useful &amp; a richly rewarding read. I can however, understand the current backlash against NeoCeltic ANYthing, especially from the authentic(?) descendants &amp; historians of Celtic studies; but this book is about putting theory into practice. It deals w/ Ameri-Centric women's fantasies. Myth in action is what I call it:) I like this book for what it is. It doesn't scream dogma &amp; rules.

I have searched for books that would stop pasting Celtic spirit onto the Wiccan dogma and formats. This is not one. The only one I've found so far to fit the bill is Apple Branch. Read that if you are looking to find out what the Reconstructionists are doing and/or visit imbas.org. Apple Branch is where the Celtic spirit rises up on its own and forms a living tradion.BUT if you are basically Wiccan at heart, and there is nothing wrong with that in the least, this is one of the most well constructed WICCAN \\"reconstructions\\" of Celtic Sprituality.

What this book really is about is Wiccan spirituality with a Celtic cover, masquerading a &quot;woman's spirituality&quot;. It is very &quot;Goddess&quot; centered, which is nice I'm sure for feminists, but the Celts were Polytheistic with male AND female dieties, not to mention other spiritual beings which the author lumps together as &quot;fairies&quot; (another inaccuracy).

You cannot become a &quot;Celtic Woman&quot; simply by performing the rites offered in this book. Sure, there's a paradigm associated with the Celts (which is such a broad term anyway since you're talking about various different peoples), and I suppose anyone could adapt them. But being Celtic is a question of having Celtic blood, and neither this book nor any other can give you that. I really feel like this book cheapens my own Celtic heritage at the same time it insults other heritages by somehow implying there's something more to being Celtic. I would love to see a book extolling a heritage other than Celtic just to run against the pop Celtic interest grain. Shame!"},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"This book was surprising to me. I am taking a Celtic Spirituality Study Tour through an ecumenical graduate school. This book started out well enough, but turned into a &quot;how to&quot; book on very non-Christian themes. The author guides the reader through steps to awaken the goddess within. And guides them to choose the goddess who they will focus their attention on. The Celt's were a pagan people, but there was nothing glamorous about it. They were also a very violent people, not what we would want to embrace in our current society."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"She's a good author for those who want to take a teeny side step from the Wiccan tradition, without fully departing from Wicca.

Its pretty good - I enjoyed the historical aspects, but didn't have much used for the rituals as they were mainly geared towards 2 or more people.

I give it five stars because I have read one of McCoy's books before and I think that this is definitely one of the best celtic books I have read."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"The genre of Celtic studies is new to me. I've looked at several titles but I have to say Edain McCoy's book of Celtic Women's Spirituality is the one worth you time, money, and shelf space. She has obviously done some grueling research to write this book, and facts are backed up with detailed notes and bibliographies. She explores the cults and clans of Celtic tradition. This book is rich with Celtic and Pagan history, and also has many guided meditations and rituals. What I like most about it was the surprises at the end. If you are in a location where Celtic and magic books aren't readily available, there is a great appendix of sources, magazines, and newsletters. There is also a section of Celtic Folk Tunes sheet music. This is a great gift to yourself, or any friend studying Celtic magic."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"Edain McCoy has written the perfect primer on Celtic women's paganism. The structure of the chapters is fantastic- at the end of nearly every one, there are questions for the Celtic woman to ask herself. The many rites and meditations laid out are the perfect level of description, so that one could either go straight by the book or use it as a jumping-off point for one's own creative musings. The section of resources at the end is fabulously extensive. This is my new favorite book on magick and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"Awaken she who sleeps.That is what the back of this book says, while I would most likely say &quot;Put she who is awake to sleep&quot;. The book's title is confusing, making the reader think this has anything to do with Celtic Spirituality, while it in fact is as eclectic as can get. The four elements for example, which the author mentions in about every chapter, is Greek. I'm surprised the book was allowed to be published, even though the swastika (which itself wasn't used in celtic countries either) used to describe the seasons with, but other that... I would, of course, like to know how come in McCoy's world, accessing the Otherworld is so easy, when it clearly wasn't to the people she claim the book is about. Something seems very wrong there. Also the mention of tripple goddesses, in speaking of the virgin, the mother and the crone which I do not like. In Celtic mythology there are plenty of &quot;tripple goddesses&quot; as she calls them, but I have yet to find any which follows this pattern. Also, McCoy fails to mention &quot;double goddesses&quot; souch as Cailleach (mentioned in the book, but nothing about the crone/virgin aspects). Seems to me, this Wittan priestess is slightly obsessed with magical numbers and making the book sound interesting.This is the kind of book which destroys modern, non-wiccan, paganism. People not sceptical enough will read, and take to it."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"This book was not only educational about the Celtic woman's way of life, but also explored how this history can change a modern woman's way of life for the better.

There are very few books that combine Celtic and woman's spirituality, and I would love to see more. I think Edain McCoy did a fantastic job of exploring this new and exciting topic."},{"Title":"Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life","review":"This book is very useful and informative about Celtic and Women-centered spirituality in general.

She calls this revolutionary decorating approach\\"heart and hand therapy\\". This book, with its glorious photos and inspiring stories, proves her method works. We see case after case in which families restore self-esteem and help kids through hard experiences through her heart and hand projects: these decoraring solutions act like home remedy medicine for bruised spirits . Also, they simply empower their creativity and make them self-sufficient in a \\"pride of accomplishment\\" way. For example , one bullying victim--a 12 year-old named Alex, made a lamp with other men's photos(Ghandi, Einstein, Dr, King, Satchel Paige, etc.) applied to remind him that he too can overcome adversity and become great. Katillac reminds us that we need visual reminders to help us think more positively about ourselves.This old-fashioned yet new fangled approach to helping ourselves and our kids is practical, fun, and simply stunning from a decorating point of view. In a time of feeling hooked on consumer stuff or helpless to effect change in the world, it is amazing to see what ordinary kids and working parents can do together to communicate, heal and survive in these complicated times.

Linguistic Imperialism raises the point (all too often disregarded) that English Language Teaching doesn't happen in thin air, that it is connected with politics and ecconomy.Phillipson argues that the center (that is the English speaking countries of the West) have used English to supress the people of the former colonies. This phenomenon he refers to as &quot;linguistic imperialism&quot;. He deals with 5 tenets,or rather fallacies, which have been used for such imperialistic purposes; the most important of these fallacies are that English is best taught monolingually (without using other languages) and that it is best taught by a native speaker.While Phillipson raises many interesting points (the fallacies of ELT among them) his overall thesis has to be rejected on the following grounds (to name but a few):on its in-built power asymmetry, that is that the devloping countries are seen as being incapable of independent decisions.that fact that linguistic imperialism is not falsifiable: there is no scenario where Phillipson would admit that English DOES fulfill a useful role in a third world country.Phillipson's left-wing terminology and tone: imperialism itself is a left-wing term.a country's linguistic ecology is to complex to fit into Phillipson's neat &quot;black and white&quot; scenario.Phillipon's book can thus be only a start for a discussion on global English. For further reading I recommend Kachru's &quot;The Alchemy of English&quot;, Crystals &quot;English as an International Language&quot; (critical reading necessary) and Pennycook's &quot;The Cultural Politics of English as an International Language.&quot;"},{"Title":"Linguistic Imperialism (Oxford Applied Linguistics)","review":"The good thing about this book is that it becomes clear that linguistic imperialism is really just a widespread (but not universal) shambles in English teaching. It also becomes clear that this shambles is the result of an unholy alliance between shabby EFL &quot;professionals&quot; and undeserving elites in certain countries where English is taught as a non-native language. It follows that effective reform of paranoid language policy in the relevant countries can deal with the problem of linguistic imperialism as defined.The author has no need for preposterous &quot;linguistic theories&quot; of the kind that crop up in Pennycook's work, for example. We don't have to worry about the possibility that colonialism has somehow attached itself to the English language, for example. Nothing in Phillipson's book rules out straightforward reform of language policy.Indeed, the strength of this book is the fact that it does not distract from the fact that the responsibility for reform lies with the policy-makers in the countries where these neo-colonialist relationships exist. Indeed, by pointing out the problem in unpretentious terms, the author is arguing that reform of language policy is the key to breaking the relationships which lie at the heart of the problem.This is far superior to Pennycook's work, which focuses on the responsibility of the western teacher (who is expected to shoulder the white man's burden by being self-critical, while ignoring the malpractice going on around him).Phillipson loses a star for not making it clear why theoretical linguists don't police the field better. We can guess that they have little to gain, and a lot to lose, by doing so, but this is left to the imagination."},{"Title":"Agent of Peril (Executioner)","review":"If you think that these books don't have enough action then check out the first chapter!!!

It puts into reality a friend who is willing to lay down his life for another. An emotional ride, but well worth every tear I cried.Reviewed by Melissa AmenAuthor of \\"Phantom Faces\\""},{"Title":"Where Vultures Roost","review":"Josh Stafford shows himself to be a seasoned writer, even if this is his first book. His style is comfortable, yet compelling. Beginning his story with a child's birth, Mr. Stafford makes the reader immediately curious about the child's mixed parentage and his future, and almost at once the reader becomes a participant in the narrative.But a good novel also teaches us, and, as the story unfolds, we learn some of the history of a region we Americans know too little of and perhaps care too little about: Africa, and a topic we'd rather ignore: racism. It's obvious that the author has done a good deal of research or has drawn heavily on his own experiences to make the novel as real as possible. And it is also through these details (aircraft operation, African wedding customs) that the reader is drawn even deeper into the narrative. In most cases, they are so skillfully woven in that the reader does not realize he is learning, be it about flying or another culture.The details notwithstanding, this is also a story of a young man and the difficult decisions he faces; it is a story of a brutal, senseless crime, and of family solidarity. But more than that, it's a novel about friendship.This is not a \\"passive\\" tale; the reader will experience joy, despair and anger. There is also a strong spiritual aspect and a sense of hope at the end. By the time you put down the book, you may be wrung out emotionally. That's perhaps the most difficult part: putting it down.Savor the experience while you're reading it. And afterwards, for it's going to stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for 7 Weeks of Wellness Success Guide","review":"Rubin is NOT refering to himself in the title of his book, nor would he ever use this title for himself. Most people with even a minimal education in literature know that the reference is to Jesus Christ, who has been called The Great Physician throughout written history because of His healing miracles recorded in the Scriptures.Rubin bases his health guidelines on Biblical information, and understands the importance of not just physical health, but mental and spiritual health as well. I have read all of his books and found them to be extremely valuable, and recommend them to everyone I know.I also utilize his supplements, and have found them to be some of the best available today. Just remember, you get what you pay for. I for one, would prefer to spend money to stay healthy now, rather than end up with huge medical bills someday.It also bears mentioning, that many people are spending hundreds of dollars every month on supplements which are touted to cure what ails you, but end up being flushed down the sewer pipes in millions of homes each day because the supposed nutrients contained in them do not have the bioavailability to be absorbed into the bloodstream.Check out the sports nutrition stores, you know which ones I mean, and see how much they are charging for these products. You will find that for those who know that the average multivitamin supplement is useless, and are looking for something better, Rubin's products are not more expensive than these sports nutrition brands, which unfortunately are not that much better than grocery store vitamins. Do yourself a favor and try them before you decide. Your body will make the decision for you."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for 7 Weeks of Wellness Success Guide","review":"Reviewer Dan, You really shouldn't comment on something that you Obviously haven't read (Rubin's books) and that which you know nothing about (the quality of nutritional suppliments). Rubin's books are good old fashioned common sense and not just Fad diet books. And common sense is something you obviously lack. And you have no basis for saying that his reputation is fading-so Amazon sells the book cheap-it's an older book, so what? I have been using his products and advice for the last 3 years and am now showing no signs of the cancer I had and I used all alternative medicine, mainly his products. Maybe you would have a better outlook if you took his suppliments and followed the advice in his books. So educate yourself or please don't mislead others from something that could make a major difference in their quality of life!"},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for 7 Weeks of Wellness Success Guide","review":"The Great Physician is God. He designed our bodies, told us how to care for them and gave us all that we need to provide for them. His instructions are in the Bible.

However, if you are seriously ill and need healing quickly, you would be better off with George Malkmus' 'The Hallelujah Diet'. Brother George wrote his predecessor books to that one long before Rubin came out with this book, which appears to steal much of Malkmus' material. The big problem is that Rubin throws expensive organic, free range meat and dairy into the mix. If you read Rubin's first book about his healing, you will find that it didn't include fiberless, acid ash forming meat and mucus laden/forming dairy. These foods have been shown conclusively to contribute to disease by 'The China Study' and many other highly reliable sources. But, having them in this diet makes it much more palatable to people on SAD, hence it's current popularity. I also have an issue with Rubin's high priced supplements which he requires as part of his regimen. While Malkmus has a reasonably priced line of supplements available for the Hallelujah Diet and Lifestyle, they are not 'required' for maximum benefit from his regimen. I am a certified Health Minister with a Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering and a work background as a Certified Environmental Trainer specializing in Health & Safety and Hazardous Materials who has studied several of Rubin's books carefully and find them seriously lacking in comparison to the much more effective and practical Hallelujah Diet and Lifestyle materials."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for 7 Weeks of Wellness Success Guide","review":"Who is Rubin referring to?

Horne is one of best living historians writing in English. Relevant information and unforgettable images blend in this narrative. I'll warmly recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alistair Horne's book \\"A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962\\" is an exhaustively detailed account of the Algerian war for independence against France in the mid-twentieth century. Horne brings his extraordinary skills as a writer and an historian to provide a readable and in-depth account of the parties involved, the people who shaped the conflict, and the climate of terror that pervaded Algeria and France at the time.Horne brilliantly examines the FLN, the Algerian nationalist movement as it sought to confront the French government's policy of recognizing their homeland as just another collection of administrative departments within France. This is contrasted with the view of the pieds noirs, the French colonials whose lives were heavily invested in maintaining the status quo of French control, even to the point of rigging elections and using violence against the Muslim population. As the conflict grows Horne offers a wonderful account of the last days of the Fourth Republic, the arrival on the scene of De Gaulle, and the increasingly unstable political scene in Paris that threatened civil war on more than one occasion. The Battle of Algiers is shown as the desperate terrorist plot that it was, which only incited further violence from the French after the slaughter of civilians by the FLN. Horne makes sense of the senseless shifting of political allegiance as the government in Paris is perceived as too hard line for some, too soft for others. The revolt of the generals and the advent of the OAS, the secret army organization determined to keep Algeria French is chronicled with the skill and drama of a novelist.At times the book's detail is a little overwhelming, and serves to bog down the narrative. Additionally, its easy to see that Horne, a British chronicler of French history, is far from a disinterested observer. Though he often deplores the methods of the FLN, it is with the Algerian nationalists that Horne's sympathies lie. The French are certainly not always treated as black-caped villains, but nor are the legitimate concerns of the pieds noirs given ample consideration. Also, one would have liked to see Horne take the narrative further. Rather than a brief, episodic conclusion of the years that followed, a deeper history of the problems of the now-independent Algeria would have added considerably to this work.This is a very good work of history and proves once again Horne's abilities as a modern historian. Anyone interested in French or North African history, or the problems of decolonization in general should check this book out."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"A Savage War of Peace is the best book to read on the history of the Algerian War of Independence. It comes as no surprise that President Bush himself is currently reading this book in order to glean what lessons from that conflict can be applied to Iraq. I was impressed by the author's attention to detail, and also impressed by his analysis, which I find very clear and thought provoking.The best example of such analysis was the issue of torture. Perhaps the best argument against any military or police force using torture was summed up by the author when he quoted Albert Camus that by using torture to uncover 30 bombs, one will end up creating 50 new terrorists.Any military officer serious about mastering the art of counterinsurgency warfare must read and internalize this book. The events and lessons covered in this book are completely relevant to today's war in Iraq and elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"In the last two decades, despite all that has gone wrong in Algeria and the civil war between Islamists and nationalists in the 1990s, there has been no revision of the French-Algerian war in between 1954 and 1962, there have been many new facts that have come to light but this book remains the standard. It turns out now that many who are studying counter-insurgency have examined the French policy in Algeria, as evidence of a military victory and political failure. Whatever the lessons this is a brilliant story of tragedy, heroism, colonialism, rebellion, war and savagry.The French invasion of Algeria began in 1830 and after pacification the country was relatively peaceful. In the 20th century it became part of France, and the 2 million French citizens who eventually made up some 10% of Alergia voted in French elections. After the second world war however nationalism came to Algeria and a long terrible colonial war was foguht until 1962 when the French withdrew, the colons were thrust into poverty and massacred and the country emerged independent. This tells the story of the machinations in the French army that almost led to mutiny and all the ins and outs of the war.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I recall this as a superb book--an may well order another copy. It is detailed and above all informative. My only complaint is that it begins in 1954. I agree that the savagery of the French was second only to the Belgiums--but I do not mean simply their barbarous use of torture during the Algerian War. My father was stationed in Algeria during WWII--I believe he was witness to the Setif massacre which egan May 8 1945. In any event he refused to visit France.He was not a political man. Those who mindlessly compare the FLN to the Taliban would do well to do some reading about the events of May 8-22 1945 for which the French have apologized--60 years later."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Horne does a thorough job on the post-Indo China turmoil of French politics over Algeria. Good pictures are drawn of the principal players including De Gaulle. The pressure French institutions were put under is strikingly illustrated. Throughout this the French Army held together (just)."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Horne's detailed history of Algeria's struggle for independence -- written only a decade after the that struggle ended -- provides an excellent overview of what happened, how the independence movement began, how it impacted the French settlers and the Muslim majority, and how the conflict threatened political upheaval in metropolitan France. The chapters on the Battle of Algiers provide a comprehensive review of the terror campaign in Algiers, much more nuanced than Pontecorvo's gripping filmThe Battle of Algiers (The Criterion Collection)(which, by Horne's account, underplays the savagery of the FLN campaign -- not surprising, since it was co-produced by Saadi Yacef, the leader of the FLN's Algiers terrorist cells). Horne's equally comprehensive description of de Gaulle's evolving efforts to bring the war to an end and the escalating campaign by the French settler extremists and their allies in the French military to preserve \\"Algerie francaise\\" is a highlight of the book (and good background to another absorbing film, Zinneman'sThe Day of the Jackal).Comparing Horne's book to Martin Evans'sAlgeria: France's Undeclared War (The Making of the Modern World), published late in 2011, illuminates its strengths and (perhaps) a shortfall or two. Horne provides much more detail about the conflict itself and about the OAS's desperate attempts to forestall Algerian independence in the early '60's. Evans, taking the longer view that the half-century since the resolution of the conflict permits him, provides much more context about the century-plus after the initial French invasion in 1830 and how the two communities (the settlers and the Muslim inhabitants) hardened in their differences and their opposition over that time; Evans also emphasizes more the evolution of French policy, stressing the search for a \\"third way\\" that would permit Algeria to remain French while mitigating much of the harshness of colonization (efforts that fell afoul of the settlers' intransigence). Both are well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"A well written and well documented, and informative chronicle of the Algerian revolution; One of a number of books that should be required reading for all those who have an interest in history/U.S.foreign affairs and/or those who are/will be involved professionally in foreign/security affairs; Particularly apropos given our misguided involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan; My only criticism: The author used French expressions liberally throughout the text.

Professional warriors and historians should read this book because it portrays the same forces that were at work in Vietnam in a completely different environment. It's all here--a tightly organized group willing to stop at nothing to gain power, tradition-bound villagers enlisted in the cause of a left-wing revolution, a hopelessly divided Western nation trying to live up to its commitments, Western-educated intellectuals attacking the West, Westernized elites caught in the middle of a civil war, and ethnic minorities left out in the cold when power is handed over to the \\"natives,\\" not to mention pacification, \\"hearts and minds,\\" terrorism, and \\"search and destroy.\\""},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"There is not a lot out there specifically on the Algerian War for Independence but without a doubt A Savage War of Peace is the best reference. It is written by Alistair Horne so it goes without saying, but I will anyway, that it is well written, easy to understand, and a pleasure to read. As usual Horne gives both sides version of events. He gives a complete history of the background to the conflict to include the colonization of Algeria and the development of a new class the Pied Noirs. While the French considered Algeria a Department, not a colony of France only the Pied Noirs, Europeans who had been enticed by France to colonize Algeria, were given the rights of Frenchmen. Algerians provided many fine troops to fight for France in WWI and WWII. After WWII they felt they had earned autonomy at the most, and the rights of Frenchmen at the least. When this was not forthcoming the fight for independence began with the FLN emerging as the most powerful and influential rebel organization. Horne then covers the counterinsurgency which ended in a French victory in Algiers. However by this time de Gaulle had decided to grant independence to Algeria. This Led to the unsuccessful rebellion of some French units in Algeria who felt they had been betrayed by de Gaulle. Horne's description of the mass immigration of the Pied Noir's, the purges within the FLN after the war, and the coups that toppled one Algerian government after another is also fascinating. One technique Horne uses in all his works that I find anoying is the use of French in critical passages. Some of his readers, including myself, will completely miss the historical impact of what is said. I highly recommend this book, you will find yourself returning to it time and time again."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I am a novice in the history of Algeria and its liberation struggle from France.

There is no such thing as impartiality in history but the author gets close to a convincing objectivity based on humanitarian compassion for the characters whose acts and lives he traces. As a reference work for the Algerian War of Independence, for both a newcomer to the subject or a practising historian, it is the definitive text.I first Read A Savage War of Peace in 1980. Further prefaces have been added to the 1996 and 2006 editions. A copy of the 2006 edition was sent to Donald Rumsfeld. It is a great shame that he did not read it- many lives could have been saved from not embarking on misconceived policies in Iraq and Afghanistan. The sections in the 2006 preface on \`Fundamentalism and Civil War' and \`After 9/11 and Parallels with Iraq', still resonate strongly today.

Far more important to almost all other nations were the real wars that European colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East fought to become independent. As the US was quietly preparing the ground for its own disaster in Viet Nam, France (having handed off VietNam to the US) was beginning its terrible mistakes in Algeria, which began to lobby for independence. After years of political mistakes -- the same kind Western politicians make today when balancing their interests against those of the 3rd world -- and a horrific loss of life, Algeria finally became independent. I remember this war -- from the time I was 5 to 13, I looked at pictures of it, not understanding what was happening. Now I know.This author takes the reader step by step through events of the Algerian War. He has few opinions, many many many facts. My interest faded after DeGaulle re-appeared to settle the matter (more or less). That's my problem, not the book's. It could be a text for a graduate course on international relations. The assignments: draw parallels between the Algerian War and what happened over and over and over during the next 60 years. Few authors of history show this one's determination to stick to the facts. Excellent. Dispassionate."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Excellently written and documented, this book details the sad history of the French annexation and development of Algeria, with a focus on the Algerian war of independence.

US military leadership has used it as a template for to do, and not to do, in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US's success in following that template, or whether it was the right one to follow, is still being debated. But Horne's book is still worth the read, as it gives an illuminating picture into how difficult winning a counterinsurgency fought over many years is. Not only is this work of history useful for those who want to study US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it should also be on the reading list of anyone who advocates for the US conducting more of these kinds of operations around the world. France was permanently damaged, not only because of the lives and money lost in Algeria, but in the wound against the national psyche. Iraq and Afghanistan have done the same to the US. Who knows what would happen to Americans sense of pride and societal cohesion after many more of these wars."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"As the jacket indicates, this book carries a high degree of relevance for anyone interested in the conflict in Iraq. Horne's work is impressive. There are some uncomfortable timeline adjustments moving from chapter to chapter and there is also a very wide array of personalities involved. As Horne concedes early in the book, his narrative is more full and accurate on the French side than the Algerian. But overall, the context is quite good."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alistair Horne's &quot;A Savage War of Peace&quot; -- a narrative of the Algerian death struggle with France in the 1950s and early 1960s -- is history at its finest. Clearly written, passionate and authoritative, this book is a shining example that objective and powerful history can be written on &quot;current events&quot; (the book was first published barely a decade after the French pulled out of Algeria).As the US-led coalition in Iraq struggles to impose order, comparisons with France's ultimately unsuccessful attempt at holding on to Algeria in the face of Islamic insurgents have become fashionable. Such analogies, however, should be used cautiously. There are a number of salient differences in the two cases. None looms larger than the relatively large and vocal pied noir community in Algeria that Paris had to contend with, first politically and then militarily. In some Algerian cities in the 1950s, such as Constantine, a majority of the residents were of European extraction (although not necessarily French). These pied noirs had roots in Algeria for generations and had a powerful lobby in Paris. A simple political withdrawal from Algeria in 1955 was thus (in my opinion) a political impossibility. The ugly war that erupted was, in the end, tragically unavoidable.Horne would certainly disagree with this assessment. Myopic intransigence by the French and pied noir leaders is a leitmotif of the narrative. Yet, the author just as consistently praises the FLN leadership for laying out their aims at the 1956 Soumman Conferences and never wavering from them. Algerian inflexibility, it seems, was a virtue; for the French/pied noir community it was a sin.There is so much to praise in Horne's work (the minor disagreement above notwithstanding) that no review, no matter how flattering, will fully do it justice. If you are student of military history or have a keen interest in colonial / counter-insurgency conflict, &quot;A Savage War of Peace&quot; is as good as it gets. Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print, so you may have to scour used bookstores and various online resources to obtain a copy, but it is worth the effort. There is also a decent chance it will be re-issued in the near future. Failing that, there is always the local library. The important thing is to get your hands on a copy. If you love history, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"At the outset Alistair Horne bemoans the complexities and difficulties involved in writing recent history, where many of the main players are still alive and active. Ironically, he is the one who falls into that trap - for the only faults to this otherwise excellent rendition is the occaisonal of-the-cuff cryptic reference by the author to some event that happened at the time. He obviously assumes that everybody would share his joke. But these are few and tiny details. Over all this is an excellent text. Horne admirably makes up for the lack of documentation on the Algerian side of the war and manages, somehow, dispite that massive misbalance in printed references between France and Algeria, to present a text which presents both sides with equal scholarly depth.More than a million people died in the Algerian war, yet it is poorly remembered today. Books like this are needed."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I am somewhat of a fan of Alastair Horne's, having come to him via his trilogy of books on Franco-German conflicts, and I went looking in Amazon to see if there was anything new from him. And I came across this book, whose purchase many years ago was prompted by the desire to know more about the world of Freddie Forsyth's outstanding thriller \\"The day of the Jackal\\". Seeing it again on the Amazon website reminded me as to how relevant it is to the modern story of the US and Iraq. Of course, there are substantial differences; the US is not Iraq's colonial power and the US most certainly does not regard the place as part of the USA, the way the French did Algeria. And because of the lack of a US equivalent of \\"pieds noirs\\" (French settlers in Algeria), no matter how badly George Bush messes up, no US paratroop regiment is going to mutiny, try to assassinate him and bring the US to the brink of civil war.However, the similarities are scary - the reliance on pure military power to win, the use of tactics (particularly in the battle of Algiers) that alienated the locals and effectively made them into allies of the FLN rebels or at least tolerant of them, and the widespread use of torture (a subject that touches raw nerves in France to this day). As with Iraq, the FLN didn't confront the French military head-on, but relied on ambush and, more particularly, on intimidating and murdering local allies of the French, policemen, local officials and the like. There were also French near-equivalents of \\"Mission Accomplished\\", even as the war was being lost where it desperately needed to be won - in the hearts and minds of Algerians themselves.As I write this, former French soccer captain Zin&eacute;dine Zidane is in Algeria, being feted as a hero. He is the son of harkis, the Algerians who fought on the French side and who had to leave Algeria or face severely curtailed life expectancies. Time has finally healed the wounds. One hopes it will be so with Iraq. One wishes that the Bush Administration had read this highly perceptive book before launching its ill-considered venture - and that it had had the honesty and wisdom to see the lessons therein."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I've read most of this author's works.

I have met men who served under Salan, Massu, and Challe, and the portrayals of these leaders by the author harmonize with what I've been told.

This new edition includes the original preface written in 1977 in which the west was coping with its misunderstanding of the third world (most recently displayed in Vietnam). It also includes a preface to the 1996 edition, when Algeria was in the throes of another civil war, and brings us to the present with a new preface describing the post 9/11 world and parallels with the US-led effort in Iraq. Horne makes three key points in this regard:1) In Algeria, once the FLN terrorists realized they could not effectively attack the French armed forces, they instead attacked the civilian populace loyal to the French.2) FLN terrorists made maximum use of the porous borders of Algeria to gain sanctuary in Morocco and Tunisia.3) The gradual appearance of torture and counter-torture in the morally degrading environment of Algeria gradually infected the French armed forces.The French military ultimately succeeded militarily in defeating the FLN terrorists and guerillas, but didn't win this war. This was largely because the methods that the French employed at the tactical level were at cross purposes to the larger political settlement that was required to solve the conflict. Horne brilliantly describes the Battle of Algiers and the successful tactics of the French paratroopers. Names such as Bigeard, Trinquier, and Massu loom large on these pages. But more importantly, Horne highlights how once the civil administrators in Algiers had given almost complete power to the army to restore order in Algiers, a Rubicon of sorts had been crossed and civil-military relations were never the same again. The military tactics of \\"clearing and holding\\" while capturing terrorists amongst the population created vast numbers of people who had been needlessly detained and pockets of refugees in certain parts of the country. Imprisonment and refugee camps were two environments in which radicalism and extremism fomented only to come roaring back in an even uglier form. In a diabolical paradox, the tactical successes the French Army achieved created the strategic and political conditions that prevented the emergence of a \\"moderate middle\\" that could negotiate and/or compromise an end to the conflict. Therefore, the methods of French military success actually hindered their overall effort.The book also has a great deal to say about the role of the French Army in the French nation. With the history of France from 1914 on not being one of great military triumphs, the Army was self-conscious of its ability to achieve victories for the state. At the same time, the government had gone through frequent turbulence by rotating through four different republics and, in the course of the Algerian War, the fall of the Fourth and rise of the Fifth Republic with the return of de Gaulle. Thus the French Army, particularly the elite units and paratroopers, came to see themselves as the \\"true guardians\\" of France and the ultimate arbiters of power. This legacy arguably dated back to Napoleon's seizure of power during the French Revolution. The contrast with the US military is worth noting here: While the US military is sworn to an idea (to defend the Constitution), the French Army was ultimately sworn to \\"France.\\" And \\"France\\" could be something other than whatever government had power at that time. This altered the dynamic on the ground in Algeria, and we thus see two former Commanding Generals, Morrice Challe and Raul Salan, actually leading a coup against the government of de Gaulle. Tragically, Salan eventually wound up as head of the Organisation Armee Secrete, or OAS, which committed some of the most disgusting terrorist acts of the war. Together, the terrorists of both the FLN and OAS effectively prevented the emergence of a moderate middle that could bring peace to Algeria.In conclusion, there are some similarities between Algeria in 1954-62 and Iraq from 2003- present, but one must be careful not to take these too far. There are more differences than similarities. But Horne's book remains essential reading for the following lessons:1) Unity of effort between the civilian and military leadership: tactics employed by the military cannot run counter to the political solution that is desired by the civilians.2) Civil-military relations: the temptation for tactical successes is always great - especially in democracies with short election cycles. But civilians can never rest the hand that governs and guides military operations (as they did in Algiers), if force is to serve political ends. Good strategy and poor tactics will always beat poor strategy with good tactics.3) The need to foster/empower/create a moderate middle: extremist groups will do everything they can to polarize the population and prevent a political compromise from being reached. The more desperate the terrorists get, the worse their acts will be (reading this book requires a strong stomach). Still, these acts must be anticipated through scenario-based planning and courses of action developed to mitigate their effects. A familiar pattern emerged in Algeria: after any success by the French government/military, a massacre would be engineered by either the FLN or the OAS to polarize the population.Horne's fine work is history at its best. The addition of the new preface makes this book especially worthwhile and relevant."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Horne, in his usually lucid, well-crafted style, tackles the horrors of France's civil war in Algeria in the late 1950's and early 60's, which culminated in the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the near destruction of DeGaulle's Fifth Republic. Full of heart-rending tales of guerilla terrorism, and written with great sensetivity toward both sides in the awful conflict, Horne presents a complete, exhaustively researched account, including interviews with some of the people who stood at the center of events in those tumultuous years. The major flaw in the work is the chronology. Difficult as it is to define a clear series of events in so complicated a situation, it is the author's responsibility to establish some system by which the reader may grasp what happens in what order. Here, Horne fails, leaving the reader to wonder what is actually happening at any point in the narrative. If you are prepared to frequently consult the timeline found in the back of the book, I recommend this"},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"(1) This is a superb history book, by any standard.(2) It is not about the last colonial war, but about (arguably) the first post-colonial war:First suicide bombings? Algeria, in a dance hall full of teenagers, and at a soda fountain.First big wall to keep out insurgents? Not Palestine, but between Algeria and Tunisia.First war decided by domestic anti-war public opinion in a distant democracy? Algeria.First war thrown away by a civilian government in which the military and intelligence services had probably turned the tide? Algeria.This is a crazy confusing, searing, savagely brutal conflict that shook France to its roots, even more than the Boer war changed England, or the Vietnam war changed America; in which the rebels are riven by divisions amongst themselves, and the governing authority has to deal simultaneously with counter-revolutionary zealots running a private war, a military high command on the verge of rebellion, and an intelligence community in which it is at times difficult to know who is loyal to whom.In the end, De Gaulle overruled his military and intelligence chiefs and threw away victory when the insurgents had lost by every meaningful measure, and were engaged in a bloody internal purge; when the top intelligence officer of the rebels was a french double agent; where the provincial reconstruction teams were actually making headway in providing widespread schooling and health care, and in improving standards of living. The French military and intelligence services were, at times, brilliant in identifying, and adopting a winning strategy. This is the blueprint of how a technologically advanced democracy can win an irregular civil war.And then have it thrown away.De Gaulle rewarded the suicide bombers with a victory they had not won, and gave enduring encouragement to religious fanatics and men of violence everywhere. He unintentionally threw away France's hydrocarbon reserves in North Africa. He condemned thousands of North Africans who had been faithful to France to reprisals of stomach turning barbarity. Towering arrogance matched with incomparable naivete, and staggering irresponsibility. What a legacy.It was a stroke of idiocy that nonetheless unchained the French economy. France prospered as never before. Algeria was left to wallow in a bloody tyranny of extra-judicial killings that continues, on and off, even to the present day.Pertinent to current events? Indeed. Extremists who adopt suicide bombings of civilian targets as (in their view) a legitimate tactic of war, are not fighting for anything worth fighting for, and, in being able to rationalise such tactics, also adopt the mentality that prevents them from lifting the resultant society out of violence and poverty. This book is suberb.(3) If only there were a comparable book about the insurgency in Malaysia - the one insurgency that was defeated by very clever winning of public opinion along with use of the police and army.(4) \\"Pied noir\\", although a term inextricably linked with the Algerian civil war, is not a term that is presently acceptable in polite discourse in France.(5) There is a great deal to be learned from this excellent analysis.In response to the second comment, I first read this book long before anyone heard of hanging chads in Florida. It won the Wolfson Prize in 1978, and can hardly be seen as having been slanted to fit subsequent history. Uncannily prescient. Unlike the commenter, I do not presume to know what the author would, or wouldn't agree with."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alistair Horne is one of the preeminent historians of the 20th Century. I've read several of his books, including the entire trilogy on the three Franco - German wars. I've found each of his books excellent, but this one will always rate as his best - for the complexity of the material that he has mastered. In the preface is an impressive list of the principal actors interviewed. He acknowledged that it is virtually impossible to have seen the \\"entire picture,\\" and suggests that no one will. He combines the specific information on the war with an overall splendid erudition. He tells the drama lucidly, with irony where appropriate, as it is so often. I first read this book over 30 years ago, and was even more impressed the second time around.He draws you in immediately with the ironic title to his first chapter; a quote from former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, that Setif was \\"A Town of No Great Interest.\\" It was in this non-descript town that the native Muslim Algerians revolted against the French at the end of the WW II, and were in turn brutally massacred. And it was near Setif that two young French teachers, \\"dedicated liberals\\", bookish and bespectacled, were murdered on All Saint's Day, 1954, in the commencement of Algeria's war of liberation.Horne uses a wild range of sources for incisive epigraphs at the commencement of each chapter, and perhaps none is better than the one from Jonathan Swift: \\"In war opinion is nine parts in ten.\\" That opinion was spun and spun again as events repeatedly outraced the expectations of the actors.France first went to Algeria in 1830, colonizing it under the rubric of a \\"civilizing mission,\\" (a forerunner of bringing the natives democracy). But they carried the seeds of their own destruction, believing their mission involved the education of the natives, and after a few generations, was it any surprise that the natives were asking: Where are our fraternity, equality and most definitely, liberty? Generations of white French, ironically called \\"pied noirs,\\" considered the country there own too. Horne's strength in this work is his understanding and depiction of the numerous factions on the two principal sides. After the humiliating French defeat in Indochina, occurring only six months prior to the commencement of this struggle, it was imperative that they not lose again. Furthermore, unlike Indochina, Algeria was considered an integral part of France (though, of course, by in large, the Muslims did not get the vote). The struggle on the French side nearly lead to civil war. It did culminate in the collapse of the Fourth Republic, when tanks surrounded the key government buildings in Paris, in anticipation of an assault by rebel French paratroopers, lead by four French generals who had revolted. De Gaulle rode to the rescue, creating the Fifth Republic, and going to Algiers, where he gave his famous \\"Je vous ai compris\\" (I understood you) speech to the pied noirs. He was a master of ambiguity, and would ultimately betray pied noirs aspirations.As for the political maneuvering and machinations on the side of the FLN (National Liberation Front), Horne is not able to describe as well, fundamentally because so many of the principals did not survive the war, or its immediate aftermath. Like in the French revolution of 1789, the revolution \\"consumed its children.\\" He does quote some cri de coeurs of Frantz Fanon, one of the giants of the anti-colonial movement.Complementing Horne's knowledge of the military tactics and strategy, he is equally adept at describing the intellectual struggles, with a principal axis being between Sartre-Beauvoir and Albert Camus. This culminated when the later, a pied noir, made the famous statement upon receiving his Nobel Prize for Literature: \\"I love justice; but I will fight for my mother before justice.\\"The book contains some excellent maps, a substantial bibliography, and extensive pictures of the main characters in the drama. Particularly haunting is one of a young boy arrested during a \\"ratonnade.\\" (literally, a raid against the \\"rats.\\")I strongly feel the book should be read as an excellent, almost certainly the best history of one of the major tragedies of the 20th Century. Inevitably though, the question is asked: What lessons can we learn? This question took on additional relevance when it was reported that George W. Bush was reading the book. As a cautionary counterpoint to projecting these events on other circumstances, after my reading of it 30 years ago, I firmly felt this was how a similar situation, a minority of whites, who considered their country home, ruling over a majority of native blacks, in South Africa, would be resolved - through bloody war. Fortunately the Algerian precedent did not hold, as a few principled persons made decisions that avoided that denouement. The circumstances in Iraq, for the United States, are quite different that France in Algeria. Nonetheless, there may be at least two \\"takeaways\\". One from Horne himself, who, in the preface to a recently released reprint, said that no country should adopt the tactic of torture, as the French did in Algeria, primarily for what it does to the values and soul of those who torture. Sadly, a significant minority of Americans follow Dick Cheney's lead in embracing torture. The other takeaway is to decide how we would view Camus's position: Would we adopt injustice on behalf of a false concept of \\"mother\\"?"},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"One of the things that perplexed and, frankly, disgusted me, throughout this book was the posturing of many key figures on the French side about \\"honour\\" and \\"grandeur\\". In pursuit of their honour, many of these people behaved in the most disgraceful and dishonourable manner.They preened themselves on their honour and spoke volubly about \\"restoring the glory of France\\", but when the going got difficult, they mostly resigned their positions or simply abandoned their responsibilities - often to return later to repeat the whole disreputable process - or intrigue among themselves.Perhaps a psychologist could shed more light on this cesspit of misplaced values than an historian.But what of the other side - the Algerian independence movement? The alphabet soup of factions (FLN, CRUA, MTLD, UDMA etc etc) was liberally peopled by thugs, assassins, torturers and thieves. They squabbled among themselves, intrigued for office, occasionally betrayed each other, and terrorised their own people - all in the cause of Algerian independence.Even after independence, members of the ruling clique continued to wage war upon each other and upon the Algerian people. The struggle continues to this day.Ordinary Algerians on both sides were the victims of the war - as is ever the case. At its end, within months, almost all the \\"pied noir\\" population had fled the country in one of the great mass migrations of the post war era. Muslims who had worked and fought for the French and who were unable (or chose not) to flee were mercilessly hunted down.I finished the book with a sense of disgust, of having been soiled by the mostly contemptible people shaping events on both sides. When one peers into a cesspit of struggling fanatics, one inevitably gets splashed.However, readers should not be deterred from reading this book. \\"A Savage War of Peace\\" deserves to be read. Its lessons are equally valid today in the Middle East and elsewhere.The book gives an excellent account of the war from both French and Muslim sides, but while the latter was adequately covered in a factual sense, that side of the story was somewhat dry and impersonal.To a large extent this simply reflects the availability of sources - and those willing to talk freely and honestly. The author claims to have been hampered by the \\"traditional secretiveness and suspicion of the Algerian Arabs\\" - especially when the possibility of assassination was ever present for those critical of the Algerian leadership.Within these limitations, Horne gives an objective account of the 8-year war, during which up to 600,000 French military personnel were stationed in Algeria. As the struggle went on, both sides resorted increasingly to torture and terror to achieve their aims.At one point military victory seemed in sight, although one must suspect that, had the French \\"won\\" in a military sense, the price would have been some sort of partition of Algeria into French and Muslim zones, and the permanent military suppression of the latter. Sound familiar?Another conclusion one can draw from the book is that the relentless pursuit of an ideology rarely, if ever, results in a better life for ordinary people who are to be \\"improved\\". This was true for Communism and will probably be proven true eventually for the various forms of Islamic fundamentalism currently destroying lives in many parts of the world - and true also for ideologues on the other side who fight them in the name of freedom and democracy - and who are equally convinced of their righteousness."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"This is a superlative book, and one you won't soon forget.

He was delighted as he was familiar with the book and had read an excerpt in grad school."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alistair Horne does a marvelous job of research in this tale of the Algerian War. His command of names and events is, in my opinion, without parallel on this subject. Where he comes up short however, is in the major aspects of any historical undertaking.He is first and foremost hopelessly biased in favor of the Algerians. When the FLN murders innocent pied-noirs' women and children, he tends to gloss over the atrocities that are committed as if the French deserved it. When the French retaliate, Mr Horne almost recoils in horror that an atrocity would be committed in revenge. He also keeps trying to draw parallels to America which can only make one wonder what his ultimate ploy is. He discusses \\"good Democrats\\" (page 151) as if they were the true source of universal wisdom while he quietly makes pointed insults against Republicans. He alludes to Faulkner's works as somehow related to racism but obviously hasn't read them.Mr Horne, as pointed out by another reviewer, also has the tendency to substitute French words where an English one would suffice. Even for those of us who have lived in France and speak French fluently, one is sometimes left to search for the Algerian contextual nuances that are behind the meaning of these words. I don't know whether he does this as an act of self-importance or to show his erudition, but it can become quite irritating.Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, the cast of characters is fairly extensive. Where Mr. Horne really stumbles here is in his ability to adequately delineate and develop each character. No effort was made to simply and effectively cast each character so that the reader could easily relate to and determine their distinctions. Instead Mr. Horne seems to delight in the convolution of the Algerian names with important dates and events. Also, since he was obviously immersed in his subject, it seems that he assumes that the reader should also be able to easily follow the interminable lists of \\"Ben this\\" and \\"Ben that\\". After about 200 pages, my head was spinning with the list of Algerian characters and their similar (to an American) names.In short, if one can get beyond the irritants, this book is a fairly adequate synopsis of the Algerian conflict. I would strongly disagree that this book has any parallels to Iraq; only to an uneducated fool would Iraq even enter the discussion. I would not recommend that one read this book lightly; one should have a paper and pencil handy as the list of characters rolls by. Finally, be prepared for Mr. Horne's irksome manifestations of his distaste for the French, his obvious limousine-liberal biases for the \\"revolutionaries\\" and his total ignorance of American literature."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"This epic work is currently being referenced repeatedly as a cautionary tale of what the U.S. should be careful of in Iraq. Superlatives like \\"history at its best\\", \\"an all-time classic\\" and \\"superbly accurate\\" are being tossed around carelessly to describe Alistair Horne's history.In fact, it remains a remarkably racist work loved by State Department officials and neocons alike - similar, but not quite on par with, the racial hatred on display in that other State Department favourite, The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai.In this work, Alistair Horne describes in gory detail atrocities committed by the FLN, or Algerian nationalist rebels, while skimming over far worse atrocities committed by the nice white-guy French.Atrocities are not to be ranked, measured, and compared, but Horne's bias becomes transparent when he describes in detail and over several pages the killing of 100 French - a tragic and ugly incident, no doubt - but then blithely mentions in passing, without flesh-and-blood detail, that the French killed 6,000 Algerians in response. Six thousand! Most of these were summary executions of unarmed prisoners, a common French tactic, and many thousands of the civilians murdered were toddlers and elderly women.This is but a glimpse into the sick mind of Alistair Horne, who manages somehow to see the French as victims. He deplores the damage to the French psyche caused by their torture of thousands of Algerian civilians, without once considering the damage the torture had on Algerians, the actual people being tortured.Horne makes cursory mentions of barbaric acts committed by the French but never draws the conclusion that French society itself may have been perverse, twisted, or morally sick. Yet, he has no hesitation in expressing that Algerians' behaviour proves that they are somehow subhuman, or less human, than Europeans.In short, this is a good book to read to understand how once upon a time the French, like the Americans today, felt themselves infallible, civilised, and racially superior to Arab and other \\"primitive\\" peoples. It is an illusion that must be fought.Another reviewer on this site mentions that Horne's book covers \\"Islamic terrorism\\", but no such phrase is to be found in his book. Contrary to what most Americans believe today, so-called \\"Islamic terror\\" is not an eternal and everlasting feature of the modern world; in 1977, when Horne wrote this work, there had yet been no Iranian revolution, no Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (and hence no al-Qaida), no Israeli occupation of south Lebanon (and hence no Hizbullah), and no Israeli-supported creation of Hamas as a counterweight to the secular PLO. Therefore, no such concept of \\"Islamic terrorism\\" existed in Horne's mind or in any other person's mind in 1977. It is a failing of the human mind to write current events into history; American journalists employ it as their favourite agitprop tactic."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Written by a British expert on French history, A Savage War of Peace is the definitive account of the Algerian War of Independence. It is brutal account of a brutal war which militarily resembled in many ways our war against the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, but turned France itself upside down politically in ways Americans can only imagine. Horne's account contains a nice blend of descriptive and analytic history.Frequent large-scale massacres, political coups, mutiny - the war had it all. Anyone who thinks that the French Army will not fight is in for a huge disapointment. Following embarrassing defeats during World War II and in Indochina they were determined not to repeat the experiences. The FLN, for its part, was an equally ruthless revolutionary movement that was prepared to do nearly anything to win, as well as exact ferocious vengeance in victory.The only issue I have with Horne is his annoying tendency in all his books to mix his english with french phrases that he assumes the author can understand and parse. A sophisticated skill perhaps, but also a counterproductive one."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"The cover of the 2006 paperback reissue of Alistair Horne's astounding \\"A Savage War of Peace\\" boasts that the book is \\"on the readings lists of President Bush and the U.S. military.\\" All I can say is, too bad it wasn't on their reading lists in 2003.In his new preface, Horne bluntly acknowledges that the book has found unexpected relevance in today's Iraq. No matter where you stand on that conflict, you will learn something from Horne's harrowing chronicle of the Algerian struggle for independence from France in the 1950s and early 60s. In fact, if (like most of us) your view of the war in Iraq is filtered through some sort of partisan lens, Horne's book provides an opportunity to step back and take a clearer look at how others walked many hard miles in a similar set of shoes.Horne's book has it all. He sets the stage with the fragile illusions of the French and the frustrated aspirations of the Algerians. He charts the war's savage downward spiral into ever bloodier spasms of terrorism, reprisal, torture and militancy, with all the missed opportunities for compromise along the way. He seamlessly weaves military history with the diplomatic and political intrigues of the era.A distinguished British military historian of France, Horne is almost astonishingly objective and fair-minded about the conflict, even while chronicling the most ghastly atrocities on both sides. He seems to have interviewed almost all the major players (at least the ones who survived) and earned their trust. Horne does not flinch from condemning brutality and betrayal, stupidity and cowardice; at the same time, he does not try to answer whether the French had any right to be in Algeria or whether the Algerians' struggle for independence justified terrorism.Like Charles de Gaulle, who emerges as the central figure of this drama, Horne simply recognizes that the French were swimming against a strong tide of history (decolonization). They could not be defeated militarily, but were doomed to lose the political struggle in the long run unless they could find a face-saving compromise. Unfortunately, they came to this realization too late to salvage much from the debacle. Meanwhile--and this is where the book hits its dramatic heights--the unravelling of French will to remain in Algeria came close to tearing France apart, sparking a succession of revolts, coups, assassination plots, and terrorism from within the French military and European settlers in Algeria. Several times, the wrenching conflict threatened to engulf France itself in civil war.Horne shows that de Gaulle's great achievement was not winning the Algerian War, or even reaching much of a compromise peace, but of simply being willing to lose it and move on. It doesn't sound like much. But in the hands of a lesser statesman, France might have sputtered on for years in Algeria, unable to win and unwilling to lose, while draining its resources and destroying its own political system. Instead, de Gaulle allowed France to extricate itself and build a proud, modern, stable and prosperous country in place of the one shaken by a series of military defeats.Horne's writing is gripping and he never loses the thread of a great story. The level of detail here may be daunting to some, and many readers will be flipping to the list of acronyms in the back to keep all the players straight. Aside from a few obvious updates, most of the book was written in the mid-1970s, and its perspective is slightly dated as a result. (For example, it is striking how few times Horne mentions the role of religion in the Algerian struggle, an omission that no future writer on the Iraq conflict will make.)Still, I would recommend this book without reservation to anyone interested in French history or the Middle East, past or present. Even the president."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"There has been a revival of interest in this book because of our entanglement in Iraq. There are considerable similarities between the military situation faced by the French armed forces and the problems faced by our Army and Marines in Iraq. The political circumstances faced by the French, however, are quite different from those we face in Iraq. Regardless of any analogy with Iraq, the Algerian war is an important subject in its own right and this book is an excellent account of that war. Horne based his book on the extensive secondary literature in French and what appears to be a large number of interviews with many of the major actors. Horne accomplishes the difficult job of providing a good narrative of the war proper, accounts of the relevant politics of France and the European community (Pied Noir) of Algeria, a good history of the independence movement (the FLN), and an analysis of the role of the French armed forces as a political force. Each of these topics would be worthy of a book in their own right, but Horne manages to combine all these elements into a clear and very well written narrative. My only criticism is that it is clear that much of the violence in Algeria was Algerian versus Algerian, particularly committed by the FLN as part of an effort not only to achieve independence but also to guarantee political supremacy in anticipation of eventual victory. Horne deals with these issues but not extensively though he was probably limited by his source material.Horne is very good also in terms of analysis of the basic structural features of the war. He shows well the wellsprings of the conflict in the explotative nature of French rule, the emergence of armed resistance occurring in the 50s with clear erosion of French prestige and power brought about by WWII and the disintegration of the French empire. Successive French leaders are shown as unwilling to recognize the contradictions inherent in the French position, their desire to retain Algeria without or only belatedly conceding rights to Muslim Algerians. This problem was exacerbated by the inadequacies of the French political system of the Fourth Republic. The FLN leadership, in contrast, for all their brutality, is shown as being fundamentally more realistic and resolute than the French leadership. Horne also does well in showing the corrupting effect that the Algerian conflict had on the French Army and French political life. De Gaulle is shown as a man of real political and personal courage, pushing ahead with the unpalatable surrender of Algeria.To return to the analogy of Iraq, its clear that our present leadership is more similar to the intransigent and ultimately unrealistic Pied Noir leaders than De Gaulle."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"The title says it all! This is a very intense and excellantly researched book on the subject. For those that love history as I do, and remember this period of time. It was always more than just a &#34;Colonial War&#34; by France. Auther, Alistair Horne covers it all here from begining to end. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"This was an excellent history of the Algerian War for Independence. Alistair Horne does a great job giving readers a balanced perspective, and gives a wide range of perspective to this significant work. The book does a nice job flowing between the French and the Algerian perspective, but not only that but he takes a top down approach detailing these events, which broadens the focus while giving the readers a greater insight into not only the leadership's prosecution of the war, but the perspective of those on the ground fighting and trying to live through this war. This means that the human tragedies that accompany a terrible conflict such as this one are not left out. This creates a picture that is much more close to whole than a lot of other works.The significance of this work cannot be overstated. This book does an excellent job detailing an asymmetrical war fought against a superior force, and how each of those forces acted and reacted throughout this conflict. The author discusses in some detail the lessons the Algerians took from some recent successes of Third World nations in fighting nations like France. The Algerians took lessons from the French misadventure in Vietnam, and applied those lessons to their own conflict with the French. While both sides attempted to adapt to the other's actions, it shows the huge disadvantage that an occupying army faces when confronting a determined and motivated foe. As French countermeasures were pursued they tended to run the risk of alienating one population or another whether the pied noir's or the Algerians. This presented the French with the impossible task of trying to please both groups, which ended by ensuring the alienation of both.The power of this book is in what it can teach about this type of warfare. The author has done such a great job outlining the actions and reactions of the various and disparate groups that this book is a definitive look at this type of warfare. The similarities between the way the French fought in Algeria, and the problems that the U.S. faced in Vietnam and in Iraq and Afghanistan today are striking.Read this book because it is a wonderfully well written history of the Algerian War of Independence, but also read this book because of what it can teach about this type of war. It will give you a better historical understanding of past conflicts, but will also give the reader an insight into the conflicts of today and tomorrow. If you want to understand Iraq and Afghanistan then you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alistair Horne provides the reader with an extensive and very detailed narrative of the Algerian War. His familiarity with the subject matter is plainly evident. On the down side, the book can be slow and confusing in certain parts. It is long at 566 pages and is divided into three parts.The author does a superb job in describing all aspects of this conflict. The first three chapters are focused on the period of 1830 to 1854. This part provides a good understanding of the problems surrounding French colonialism, the European settlers in Algeria (the pied noirs), and why the F.L.N. began the war. Part two focuses on the actual war years of 1954 - 1958. The detail provided in this part, especially the chapter on the Battle of Algiers, is very informative. Part three covers the period from 1958 to 1962. This includes not only the peace negotiations, but also such events as Barricades Week and the General's putsch. The author not only does an excellent job of describing these events, he also explains why so many high ranking French officers turned against De Gaulle. The author also describes the internal conflicts within the F.L.N. as well as the rise of the O.A.S., the French rebel group that fought against Algerian independence. Of particular interest is the fact that the author interviewed several people who participated, and also survived, the war.On the down side, the book is slightly difficult to read. Although some parts flow well, other parts seem to drag. One confusing aspect is the author's tendency to use French phrases without providing a translation. In some instances, he will use a French term when an English term would have served equally well. For example, on page 179, he describes the \\"presence francaise\\" in Indochina as opposed to simply using \\"French presence.\\" In other cases, the reader will simply not understand what is being said unless they speak French. For example, the author uses the term \\"Ce-con-la\\" in a sentence on page 181. The term is not further explained. Finally, he will add references that do not contribute to the story. Mr. Horne quotes Jean Paul Sartre on page 196 even though it really adds nothing. He also makes references to other people's memoirs and the movie \\"Battle of Algiers.\\" Such references are indeed useful, albeit at the end of the book, not scattered through the text.Bottom line: this is an extremely detailed account of the Algerian War. Mr. Horne does a good job of bringing many of the main characters, such as Ben Bella, Ali La Pointe, Generals Massu and Salan to life. The difficulty of reading this book can be found in its writing style and sheer length. That said, any reader who can overcome these minor difficulties, will come away with an excellent understanding of this forgotten conflict."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I selected this book wishing to know more about the French war in Algeria. Mr. Horne more than satisfied my curiousity. He provides an in-depth, virtually blow-by-blow account of the eight year conflict, pulling no PC punches, and taking great care to remain as impartial as possible. This is no easy feat, given the intensity of the situation. He is very careful to present this as not a typical colonial war as much as a battle between 2 diametrically opposed visions for Algeria. On one side were the Pieds Noirs, whose families had lived in Algeria for generations, understandably saw Algeria as their home, and wanted to preserve \\"Algerie Francaise.\\" On the other hand, you have the FLN (not the spokesman for most Algerians), with its demands for Algerian independence, sans the Pieds Noirs. What made this conflict a battle between extremes was the FLN's reign of terror against relative moderates among the Algerians (many of whom had advocated finding a \\"middle ground\\" in the conflict). This has the effect of presenting the FLN as France's only \\"negotiating\\" partner within Algeria. Moreover, it pushed many of the Pieds Noirs to support such hard-line groups as the OAS. Essentially, the FLN set up the conflict to end in its favor, as the war nearly tore France apart on several occasions (and nearly claimed the life of Charles De Gaulle on an equal number of occasions). Mr. Horne captures this story very nicely, weaving back and forth between Algeria and France. He demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt that the conflict had very high stakes for the French. Also, he describes how the outcome of the conflict proved to not be France's finest hour, to put it very charitably."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"This edition is particularly valuable in that it provides the author's prefaces to the 1977, 1996 and 2006 editions, that is to say, at 20 years from the Battle of Algiers, at the beginning of Algeria's own confrontation with Islamic revolt on the modern pattern (rather than nationalist as in 1954-62), and, in the last preface, in light of the current war in Iraq. Horne does note the parallels and the dissimilarities there.The book is also worthwhile in that Horne puts in context the damage to the French Army and nation in the later stages of the war. The book may be Euro-centric but as a record of the consequences of defeat it is first-rate. Many other accounts of the war dwell on the Battle of Algiers -- including the movie of that name, which Mr. Horne cites -- and end with the FLN turning the tide by 1960. What the book, and not the movie, shows is how parts of the French military then turned on France: the generals' 1961 mutiny, the spin-off of the OAS terrorism from the French side, and the violence that followed in Algeria and in France itself. The book, indeed, does stress just how vicious this new terror became: how those professing to fight \\"terrorism\\" became, literally, terrorists themselves. It's something that the US has not experienced, so far.Still, worth reading and pondering now, even if we mark the differences.\\"Generally, the old saw about history never repeating itself holds true. Nevertheless, its bad elements may well do so if national leaders pay no attention to its lessons.\\" -- Horne, 2006 preface."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"This is reputed to be THE history of the Algerian War for independence from France. And with good reason. I find it hard to conceive that there is a better one-volume work on the subject available. But why, some might ask, should anyone care about the Algerian War for independence?Anticipating that question, those behind this 2006 edition of A SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE (originally published in 1977) have touted the supposed parallels between Algeria of a half century ago and Iraq of today. The blurb, \\"Anyone interested in Iraq should read this book immediately\\", is emblazoned on the front cover. Now, the U.S. incursion into Iraq is NOT an instance of history repeating in lockstep fashion the experiences of the French in Algeria (I sense that our own experience in Vietnam is a closer, although still not exact, precursor), but there are indeed parallels between Algeria and Iraq. Some of them are addressed in \\"The Washington Post\\" review by Thomas E. Ricks that is reprinted above by Amazon. The matter also is discussed in the author's excellent seven-page preface to this 2006 edition. There, Horne lists three areas of the war in Iraq where the \\"echoes\\" of Algeria \\"are particularly painful, if not deafening.\\"One of those areas has to do with torture. As this book vividly describes, the French sullied themselves badly by their widespread practice - indeed, institutionalization - of torture during periods of the Algerian war. The book makes a strong case that for the French in Algeria that practice was counterproductive - both as a method for gathering reliable intelligence and because of the political backlash. More generally, Horne writes that \\"history teaches us that, * * * regardless of the moral issue, torture is counter-productive.\\" He goes so far as to say that \\"torture should never, never, never be resorted to by any Western society\\" - a stricture I endorse.Another reason for reading A SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE is that the Algerian conflict remains \\"a prototype of the modern war of national independence.\\" The F.L.N. consciously followed the program for insurrection through terrorism explicated by the Brazilian guerrilla leader, Carlos Marighela, and the Algerian insurrection was horrendously bloody and lethal. The book contains seemingly endless instances of wanton killing of civilians and destruction of private property, and many instances of cold-blooded butchery. The savagery was carried out both by F.L.N. insurgents and by the pied noirs attempting to quell them. But particularly striking was that most of the F.L.N.'s victims were fellow Arabs and fellow Muslims. For example, in the first two-plus years of the war, about 6350 Muslims were killed in F.L.N. attacks against civilians, as opposed to about 1000 Europeans.As a \\"modern war of liberation\\", the most obvious counterpart to Algeria is the two-stage war of independence in Vietnam. Curiously, today Vietnam is light years ahead of Algeria. In his preface to this edition, Horne raises the question whether that might have something to do with contemporary Islam. \\"Vietnam, infinitely more devastated than Algeria over twenty years of war, and lacking its natural wealth of oil and gas, but now rapidly emerging as the new Taiwan of Southeast Asia; Algeria wracked by internecine fundamentalism, and economically impoverished. Students of contemporary Islam and its incompetence in the world of material progress might wish to draw their own conclusions.\\"Yet a third reason for reading A SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE is that, regardless of the parallels to Iraq and Vietnam (or absence thereof), the book, as written by Horne, is jammed with potential lessons about the conduct of politics and diplomacy while a nation pursues a large-scale military effort - such matters as the frequent gulf between the military situation and the political one, or the differences in negotiating leverage (and hence tactics) between insurgents with virtually nothing to lose and a much more powerful and affluent nation whose principal objective is to extract itself from a politically untenable military effort. While I don't wholeheartedly endorse the notion that any American interested in Iraq must read this book, I do believe that it should be on the short list of reading for those in the State Department or otherwise responsible for foreign policy.A fourth reason for reading the book - and the last of the reasons that I have room to mention in this review - is that it is quite well written. For the most part, Horne manages to avoid the dry, the dusty, and the tedious by writing with flair and occasional wit and by superb organization of his material. My sole complaint that might be more than simply nit-picking concerns the number of French statements or phrases for which no translation is provided. Horne obviously assumes that his English readers are more familiar with French than this philistine American is."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Although it was one of the deadliest counter-insurgency campaigns in history, costing over 1 million lives, English-speaking writers tend to overlook the war in Algeria. Alistair Horne's book fills that gap with a masterful narrative that weaves quotations, statistics, and analysis in a readable, journalistic style. The author balances the full horror of the conflict - massacres, razzias, torture, mob-violence - with the war's political dimension. The war in Algeria nearly cost France its democracy. An embittered, defeated military twice mutinied against a corrupt and cowardly civil authority. It concluded with De Gaulle's return (deus ex machine). The entire government resigned to make way for \\"le grand homme.\\" The National Assembly granted him dictatorial powers. In a display of self-restraint all too rare in history, De Gaulle used his power to re-write the French Constitution (a dramatic improvement) and restore peace. An astute reader will be struck by the similarity between the ruthless F.L.N. and our present enemies, the Taliban. The book vividly demonstrates what can happen when civil and military authorities collide, and each decides to take matters into its own hands."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Alister Horne as usual has provided an interesting, informative and enjoyable book with tremendous practical applications for the U.S. British and NATO forces conducting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as other regions. It should be read by political leaders as well as military leaders as it deals with how the type of struggle waged in Algeria is not merely a military exercise and how military organizations involved in such a struggle can become at loggerheads with their own government over policy and politics and it shows the danger of such a situation for all parties. It also shows how a country can lose what it has gained on the battlefield by not using its strength to negotiate a magnanimous peace as the French and Pied Nior failed to do in 1945-46 and how this came back to haunt them in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is must reading for politicians, diplomats and military leaders."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"As one ponders the \`insurgency' in Iraq, one wonders if the administration had any idea what they were getting into.

We see how the French government's use of torture and the justification for it, is the twin of the current administration and its rehtoric. The French public was fearful, with the media over emphasizing the attacks by the rebels and downplaying the atrocities of the French government. A indepth history of how France was finally forced to leave the country they had invaded. Not a book that will bring light to how the current wars in iraq and afganistain should or should not be fought. But it will shine light on how the policies of torture,and the continued push of more soldiers into a meat-grinder were driven by the fear and ignorance of the general population who believed that they were doing the Algerians a great favor. The French tried to bring democracy and freedom to Algeria through the barrel of a rifle. History has spoken unamiously on how well this works, and we can see its fruits ripening now in iraq and afganistain."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I gave this 5-stars because it's exhaustively detailed and researched on its subject to the point where you could say you don't need any other book on the Algerian War. The writer admits he had a crapload of info from the French side and significantly less on the Algerian side. I didn't notice any real bias either way.Still, the reader should be in for a warning: First, this is not for the casual reader. This should be obvious just by picking it up. Secondly, if you're not familiar with Arabic names, you will get confused on all the names like Ben Balla-Mustafa and Ben Achmed Ali and Ben Salam al-Jafar appearing in one sentence. Heck, you will also get confused by the French names. That's the negative of being so detailed. The reader has to constantly be aware of what is taking place amongst whom and where.Third, don't listen to Thomas E. Ricks when he says on the front cover it will help you understand Iraq. Their just using a current event to sell books. The circumstances surrounding the Algerian War are radically different from the circumstances surrounding Iraq. Algeria was an Arab nation fighting against 150 yrs of colonialism from France, which considered it Algeria an integral part of France. Iraq is a Farsi nation experiencing war against the U.S., which has no interest whatsoever in making Iraq part of the U.S. People think that just because they are Muslim nations fighting against westerners then they are both the same situation. Not even close. It's like saying the situation involving U.S. antagonism with Venuezuela is similar to Cuba because they both involve Latin American countries that are left leaning.In any case, this book is a highly-detailed look at the Algerian War.

A gripping analysis of humans caught in a maelstrom of myriad forces, colonial, religious, cultural, historical. Not many heroes here but really not many villains either. Unless you want to include everyone as a villain. The atrocities are appalling and heartbreaking but Horne is remarkably even-handed and his level of detail and insight into especially the French mentality is superb. To say I know what a pied-noir might actually have been thinking back then is a long stretch but at least I have SOME understanding of the forces that led to the tragedy of Algeria. That said I am not sure that Algeria has many parallels applicable to the Iraq conflict of today.

If anything the French were more like the Taliban--their use of torture was routine and people could hear the screams of prisoners from police stations every day.The tragedy of North Africa and the Mid-East after colonial rule is the failure of the secular regimes and the rise of a retrograde Islam. What that area needs now are more people like Nasser or Ben Bella though hopefully with a broader vision of democracy. The alternative is Bin Laden and the Taliban. Any brutalities committed by the FLN (and there were many) pale in comparison to the French many of whom fresh out of German concentration camps apparently brought what they had learned from their captors. French colonialism in Africa was second only to Belgum in its ferocity racism and pure cruelty. That was then--what happens now is anybody's guess."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"A Savage War of Peace is the story of three separate wars, all of which concerned the future of the city of Algiers, which is now in Algeria, and used to be in France.The First War: The Fourth Republic Against the FLN, 1954-1958The first war is the three-way fight for the future of Algeria between the FLN, the Pied Noir population, and the Fourth Republic. This war, occupying the first half of the book, in many ways resembles the American experience in Iraq.The FLN was a terrorist organization that was anti-Western, anti-Communist, anti-Liberal, and anti-Semitic, and initially counted in its supporters many Muslim opponents of French rule and a small but dangerous coiterie of deluded western fellow travelers.The Pied Noir, generally white (but not ethnically French) settlers, composed a minority of the overall Algerian population but the vast majority of its \\"European\\" residents. Analogous to the (relatively) educated and (relatively) affluent Sunni community in Iraq, it was situated half-way between the French metropole and the Algerian bled. As beneficiaries of the welfare state, the Pied Noir were politically affiliated with Petain's collaborationist government and hostile to liberal democracy.The Fourth Republic, the democratic French state, inherited from its pre-war predecessors a dicey situation in Algeria. The millet system, inherited from the Ottoman Empire upon France's conquest of Algeria in 1830, let the initial Muslim community live under Sharia Law while the European community lived under French law, voted in French elections, and so on. The increasing power of the French state, however, made this situation decidedly unequalal. The Fourth Republic's mission was to essentially reestablish the status quo before the rise of the French state, to allow the Pied Noir to be full citizens of the Republic while also allowing the Algerians to effectively government themselves.Each of these three factions had specific challenges. The FLN, paranoid, fratricidalal, uneducated, and given to a degree of sexualized hyperviolence that would make al Qaeda in Iraq blush. The Pied Noir, demographically the weakest faction, were (barely) an over-class in Algeria while suffering the lowest living standards of any group of French citizens. The Fourth Republic, established after Petain's collaborationist military dictatorship, attempted to avoid a return to tyranny by creating a weak executive.The first four years of the war would be extremely familiar to all Americans, because of the analogous first four years of the Iraq War (2003-2007). The FLN began a campaign of murderous terrorism while (in the early days) enjoying the tolerance of the local population. Counter-insurgency operations included torture, which worked in some cases and not in others, but alienated those French intellectuals who believe that war is a gentleman's pursuit. The Pied Noir often exasperated their military protectors through their fear of what any political change might entail. The organized combatants &iexcl; the FLN and the Fourth Republic &iexcl; both experienced stress as the the FLN's military capacity was destroyed in proportion to the Fourth Republic's political standing.In the United States, a stable constitutional liberal republic, what happened next was the following: our party system allowed millions to funnel their frustration in a candidate of \\"hope\\" and \\"change\\" who, of course, changed nothing. Simultaneously, in Iraq, the Sunni minority accepted the lost of their political hegemony while securing for itself security and self-government. The military policy of the American government was continued, and the war is perhaps as \\"won\\" as any counter-insurgency operation can be. With body-count now sufficiently low, the issue simply fades away as other issues of the day (the economy, jobs, cultureal issues) dominates politics in both the United States and Iraq.France, unlike the United States, was not stable. Remember that the German occupation was made possible only the collaboration of Marshall Petain, the war hero who had previously saved France from German in World War I.France had the weakest resistance of all \\"occupied\\" countries, and was the most energetic in its economic collaboration with Germany. This led to two disastrous consequences for France1.The natural modernization of the political culture of Algeria was profoundly harmed. The War experience both artificially accelerated expectations among Muslims for their political ascendancy while also teaching the Pied Noir that their political stresses were the result of democracy, which might not always be the French form of government2.The \\"Vichy\\" and \\"Free\\" French regimes were both led by military men, which led to a belief that neither civilian leaders nor higher officers should be entrusted with the war effort. It was up to each officer to decide what is \\"right.While the FLN collapsed on schedule, France would not be so lucky.In France, unlike America, democracy itself collapsed.The Fourth Republic's plans of abolishing Sharia and integrating the Muslim population into Algeria ran into violent opposition from the Pied Noir, who feared the loss of their ability to control Algeria at some future date to be more frightful than the barely standing FLN enemy. The military, angered by actions by the Fourth Republic that in retrospect only trivially effected the war effort (granting independence to Morocco and Tunisia, etc.) had taken to disobeying orders. And in the background, refusing to condemn violence as a method of seizing power within France, stood the man who would end democracy in the country: Charles DeGaulle.The military, egged on the Pied Noir, began seizing government offices and replacing Governors with its own appointment. As the machine of the coup churned, DeGaulle made it clear his support was contingent on the end of the Republic and the granting, to him, of dictatoral powers. The French experiment in democracy ended in 1958, with the military and Pied Noir factions successfully ending the Fourth Republic which had slowed down the efficiency of their victory over the FLN, and the enthronement of DeGaulle. DeGaulle prompted gave the French Assembly a \\"Vacation\\" as he ruled by decree for months on end.The Second War: DeGaulle Against the Pied Noir, 1958-1962There is no mystery about DeGaulle's personality, aims, or ruling style. Anyone familiar with Chiang Kaishek or Mao Zedong instantly recognizes the type. DeGaulle's method of management was \\"working towards the chairman,\\" in which he vaguely states operational objectives and allowed underlings to carrry them out. DeGaulle identified himself with the nation though not with any specific ideology, and so viewed personal enemies as enemies of the state. Also like Chiang and Mao DeGaulle was a profoundly cold man, whether concerned with the fate of individuals or groups.As DeGaulle identified himself with France, his two greatest strategic interests were (a) preventing Germany from emerging as a competitor as (b) liquidating any remaining supporters of Marshall Petain. The first led him to support close economic integration with Germany. The instrument of that campaign (barely mentioned in A Savage War of Peace) are the institutions that would eventually form the European Union. The second led him on a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Pied Noir population. The instrument of that campaign were the scattered and defeated remnants of the FLN, who so many had died in vain to defeat.Just as Chiang and Mao coolly maneuvered others into liquidating their enemies, DeGaulle began setting the stage for the resurrection of the FLN and the ethnic cleansing of the Pied Noir. DeGaulle's efforts occurred in several stages1. Ceasing offensive operations against FLN remnants2. Turning in leaders of the Algerian Awakening to the FLN3. De Facto Recognizing the FLN as the sole legitimate representative of the Algerian people4. Imposing a \\"unilateral truce\\" on French forces5. Directing French negotiators not to hold out for guarantees of the safety of the Pied Noir6. Instructing the French army not to intervene even when Pied Noir are murdered before their eyes7. Disarming Pied Noir and Pied Noir allies to facilitate FLN massacresDuring this DeGaulle responded to protest by having tanks bombard civilian buildings at close range, ban opposition political groups, ban demonstrations, use torture against French citizens, and all other techniques which today we would associate with Gadafi's Libya.The Third War: The OAS Against French Algeria, 1960-1962Of course, the people who had overthrown the Fourth Republic and installed ad DeGaulle were shocked and outraged by his policies (but not, it is important to remember, his abolition of democracy). After peaceful protests, boycotts, and even military coups did not work, elements of the French military and the Pied Noir population formed the OAS (Secret Army Organization), which had both a primary and a fall-back goalThe primary goal was to attempt to prevent the DeGaulle/FLN victory by establishing itself as a terrorist organization along FLN lines, and establish itself as a \\"third force\\" in the reality of any peace process. The hope here was to force the hand of the French government.Once the primary goal was seen to fail, terrorism as such was abandoned as tactic. Dictatorships such as DeGaulle's France (or Franco's Spain, or Chiang's Taiwan) are of course immune to terrorism as a tactic. Therefore, the OAS moved onto splitting DeGaulle and the FLN by manipulating events to attempt to force a FLN-OAS united front.The FLN, composed largely of violent and uneducated hicks, did not have the manpower to actually run a government. They were not more adept to governing a modern Algeria than, say, the Taliban could effectively govern Alabama. Some of the FLN (particularly leaders of other factions which had been absorbed early by the FLN) were aware of this, and exacerbating this situation could possibly lead to a cold detente. The OAS thus began systematically executing all non-Pied Noir government functionaries. In one outrage (intended both to highlight their destruction of the machinery of government while also emphasizing their basically pragmatic purpose), they executed 2 white postmen, 2 Muslim postmen, and 1 Jewish postman in one night.DeGaulle responded by strengthening the position of the least educated factions of the FLN, to close this last attempt to the Pied Noir to save themselves. Eventually, in 1962, DeGaulle won the war, as the Pied Noir were scattered and the last internal threat to his rule.The ethnic cleansing of an entire people would buy DeGaulle seven more years in power. A trade that Mao, Chiang, or Gadafi would have accepted as eagerly as did DeGaulle.In RetrospectA Savage War of Peace is a history of tragedies and ironies.DeGaulle. DeGaulle ended democracy in France, and brutally suppressed those who fought for their rights and livelihoods. Vain, arrogant, and machiavellian, he successfully oversaw the ethnic cleansing of a community he viewed as antagonistic to his political future. But his self-confidence was stronger than his paranoid, so like Chiang (but not Mao) he laid the groundwork for the return of democracy. Just as Chiang's \\"White Terror\\" eventually gave way to free & fair elections in Taiwan, DeGaulle allowed himself to be defeated by the vote (and old age) in 1969. At the same time, DeGaulle's fear of a German revival lead him to energetically push forward the multilateralal institutions that now form the European Union.The Communists. The dog that never barked was the Communists. Concerned with the poor Pied Noir early in the war, the French Communist Party ended up having the most reasonable policies of all factions during the war against the FLN. Later, after DeGaulle's coup, the Communists continued to be a force of order as they accurately saw DeGaulle simultaneously alienated the United States while constraining Germany. In French, as in Chinese, history, pro-Moscow communists tend to be sympathetic characters.General Salan. The most interesting human in the entire book is General Raoul Salan, Legion d'honneur (Knight, Officer,Commander, Grand Officer, Grand Cross), Medaille militaire, Croix de guerre, Croix de guerre, Croix de guerre des Theatres d'Operations Exterieures, Croix de la Valeur Militaire, Medaille Interalliee de la Victoire, Medaille Commemorative de la Grande Guerre, Distinguished Service Cross (US), Commander of the Order of British Empire (CBE) (UK), and the only person to lead operations in all three phases of the war.-> Salan was an early leader of the French military in its counter-insurgency against the FLN, and was nearly assassinated by a bazooka by enraged Pied Noirs.-> In the second war, Salan organized resistance to DeGaulle's authoritarian government and attempted to organize a second military coup.-> In the third war, Salan was a leader in the OAS and ordered the general mobilization of the Pied Noir population, and the extermination of the Muslim intellectuals.Given the history of French military leaders, one imagines if he had ever gained executive power he would have been as bad as Petain or DeGaulle. As it was, however, he strikes the reader as a romantic figure, fighting for a lost cause against impossible odds.Context. If most Americans are aware of the Algerian War at all, they know it from The Battle of Algiers. But that movie, showing a terrorist campaign by the FLN and its defeat, only accurately captures the first of the three wars described in A Savage War of Peace. DeGaulle's coup and the OAS campaign are the most important phases of the war, but all occur after the end of the film.A Savage War of Peace is a disturbing book, and a must read for anyone who cares about history, democracy, or the Arab world."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Many lessons here on how history is repeated.again and again..ie the USA's attempt at its own brand of control in the middle east."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"If George Bush has read this book, or has had it summarized for him, as someone remarked, he apparently can't understand it very well.

I read a couple of really interesting articles on this book earlier and felt compelled to read it. Terrorism, civil war, torture: these things also took place in Algeria and it would seem that there are some lessons to learned, but it seems they have not been heeded. It was a very long and complicated book, but not without its rewards. Apparently it has been read by Bush and several of his advisors. I think it would have been more meaningful to me if had a better grasp of the conflict and French history since 1945 in general, but that being said there was a lot of interesting information about this conflict. Terrorism, de Gaulle, France, and other conflicts like those in South Africa, Ireland, and Indo China. I think this paragraph sums up the situation pretty astutely:One is left with the controversial role of de Gaulle, criticized both for going too slow and too fast. As far as the latter reproach goes, in the last stages of negotiations he suffered from the lesson not learned by Kissinger in Vietnam, or perhaps by Israel vis-&agrave;-vis the Arab world, or by the South Africans; namely, that peoples who have been waiting for their independence for a centenary, fighting for it for a generation, can afford to sit out a presidential term, or a year or two in the life of an old man in a hurry; that he who last s the longest wins; that sadly, with the impatience of democracies and their volatile voters committed to electoral contortions every five or four years, the extremists generally triumphs over the moderate. Just keep on being obdurate, don't leave deviate from maximum terms, was the lesson handed down by the F.L.N. (Front de Liberation Nationale) and remains as grimly valid today-Northern Ireland or the Middle East or southern Africa. One after another de Gaulle saw his principles for peace eroded in the face of the F.L.N.'s refusal to compromise. As his disillusion grew, so did his resolve to liquidate the war with all the speed. In his final haste injustices were perpetrated, such as the exclusion from the peace talks of any representative Algerian faction (e.g. the M.N.A.-Mouvement Nationaliste Algerienne)) other than the F.L.N.

Now they soon became willing to concede to the demands made years ago, but, as always in this world, it was too little too late.Author Horne describes a horrific period of eight years in which different Muslim organizations fought both for control of their own people and against the French government and military. The non Muslim population (pied noirs) who had migrated to Algeria from France, Italy and Spain also took up arms. The atrocities including torture and wanton murder disgusted not only those in France, but also the United Nations, the U.S. and eventually most of the world.Horne provides us with information that has implications for our current situation in Iraq. You throw a lot of people in prison, and you provide a \\"school\\" for recruitment of insurgents. You try to fight a war in a country with open borders - in this case Morocco- and you have further troubles in terms of insurgents using border states to set up their headquarters and training programs.This war brought France to the brink of bankruptcy. Part of the French military became so disgusted with Premiere de Gaulle's leadership that they tried to bring off a coup d'etat. When France finally sat down at the negotiating table in 1962, the Muslim negotiators would not compromise. And so France lost everything.PLEASE NOTE: While this is a fascinating volume of history I had some frustrations while trying to read it. There is almost literally a cast of thousands in it. Rebel and French leaders come and go, and trying to remember who is who becomes a daunting task. Secondly there are, by actual count, 41 different organizations involved in this struggle, and all of them appear by acronym. There is the FLF, the FLN, the UDMA, and on and on. The book is almost 600 pages long and the print is small. This is a book that is hard to read unless you really study it. At a certain point new names and new acronyms stopped registering with me. My brain could absorb no more of them. Yet there is no question that this is a most important book about a general subject that unfortunately never loses currency."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"The claims by the author and other reviewers that this book is revelant to todays happenings in Iraq and elsewhere appears to be a shameless attempt by the publishers to squeeze more earnings out of this older and dated history. The Algerian Civil War has as much relevance to current happenings as The Crusades. Just because the enemy in both wars were predominently Islamic doesn't make them the same wars. Both wars are being fought for far different reasons and under totally different conditions.First of all, the Algerian Civil War was a failed attempt by France to retain control of what the French considered an integral and territorial part of Metropolitan France. This was a war easily avoided if they only extended the same rights and benefits of citizenship to the Algerian people. Though long and difficult, the French eventually obtained a military victory over the insurgents that, for good or for bad, was squandered by their politicians.The current war, as pointed out by the Washington Post, is not a colonial war and the U.S. has no territorial interests. We have taken down a disruptive influence in the Middle East that, contrary to what critics of the Bush Adminstration are saying, has resulted on some stabilization in the region.Militarily, there are some parallels as the book's praisers point out. However, there are equally important differences. The Algerians were Nationalists seeking independence and relying on foreign aid from other Arab nationalists to defeat the French. Todays insurgents are a mix of foreign terrorists (al Queda), Saddam's Sunni supporters and Shiite radicals who are receiving support from foreign powers that want the region unstable and ripe for political and religious domination. They do not care for Iraq or the Iraqi people. They just want to kill Americans, other Westerners and their Iraqi allies and maybe create a fundamental Islamic state out of the ashes.To say that the Algerian Civil War was a dress rehearsal for today's conflicts borders on being a bit bombastic. The strategies and tactics used by the Algerians in 1954 predates the spector of todays international terrorism, radical Islam and mass communications and technology. Though the war sometimes spilled over into Continental Europe through acts of terrorism, the Algerian leadership were wise in minimizing this so that they not alienate the many supporters and sympathizers for their cause among the Europeans. There was none of the sophisticated IED technology, suicide bombers or exporting of the conflict to other countries as today. The Algerians never imagined the ability of todays insurgents to use mass international communications (Internet, news media and satellite communications) to control and sell their cause, publicize their successes and issue their threats.The Washington Post go on to state that both the French and the Americans have misunderstood and underestimated their enemy. For the U.S., it was complicated by the misguided priorities of the Defense Department led by Donald Rumsfeld. Mr. Rumsfeld still thinks to this day that he will be best remembered for his attempts to reshape the U.S. military for the 21st Century. The lack of a long term, post war vision, a balanced ground force and other gross mistakes such as failure to restore post war law and order and disbanding the Iraqi military led directly to the chaotic situation that is only now coming under control.Once the French understood the nature of the enemy, they eventually won their war militarily by surging both military, police and civil forces and sealing the borders. The U.S. led Coalition is doing the same today with equal success. More importantly, they've achieved buy-in from the Iraqis themselves who are now voting with their feet by returning home and fighting the insurgents.All this, as in the Algerian Civil War, is now in danger of being derailed by a Congress controlled by an opposition party whose interests lies not with successfully winning the war, but by getting themselves back into the White House by appeasing their lunatic, anti-war constituency. That parallel is something the critics of this book have failed to compare.It appears to me that this book is being used to support the philosophy of those who think that successfully fighting Islamic based insurgencies is a no win situation no matter how its handled. However, we, the United States and our Allies are in a life and death struggle with an enemy composed of economically and politically alienated indivduals who are using a popular religion as a means of redressing real and perceived grievances. Fighting these groups is unavoidable and we better learn how to do this successfully.I read Mr. Horne's book in 1993 well before todays chain of misfortunes. His book was an excellant read and a definitive history of that unfortunate war. However, I cannot say that we could have avoided todays misteps by reading his book. I train soldiers bound for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and I can say that todays Army officers are reading his book to get a sense of historical background to today's conflict with Islamic based insurgents. However, to draw direct lessons from this book is a stretch. Comparing the two wars is a bit like comparing apples to oranges."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"I picked up this book knowing next to nothing about the franco-algerian war and after reading it i felt i knew a great deal about it. Alastair Horne is an excellent writer who manages to be both highly detailed and informative at the same time as telling a great story. It's hard to decide which part of the story he told best, the passages regarding the guerilla war in the mountains of Algeria was fascinating but the way he told about the end of french algeria and the exile of the european population of algeria was heartbreaking at times. This is one of the best history books i've read in a long time and on the basis of it i intend to read everything Horne has written, if it is even half as good as this it will be worth the read. I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys good history well told."},{"Title":"A Savage War of Peace (The Leather-Bound Library of Military History)","review":"Sometimes the French and English have a bizarre relationship. France is known for its wines, but the world's best wine-tasters are English! Modern France has a rich and complex history; but one of its greatest historians happens to be British.The Algerian War of Independence is still a controversial subject in France. In fact, the French prefer to call it the \\"Algerian War\\". It just goes to show what a dark chapter this was in our history. After reading this work, you can rightly scoff at French claims to be the \\"country of human rights\\". They pulled off that mask in this conflict.As a Frenchman looking at Horne's book, I would say the following. His knowledge of the French and FLN political and military establishments is magisterial. His understanding of the Pieds Noirs astounding. Keep in mind that he spent several years meticulously researching this book, and interviewed many of the story's main protagonists. His treatment of Albert Camus I found particularly fascinating, given that Camus was a towering \\"humanist\\" who spoke out against torture but nonetheless supported French Algeria.What is important in Horne's assessment is that he understands this conflict was a political opportunity exploited by De Gaulle to regain power in France. It is often said that De Gaulle inaugurated the Fifth Republic by a \\"coup\\", and this is perfectly well illustrated in Horne's book. He also correctly identifies the Soummam Conference as the pivotal event in the success of the FLN. Had the FLN not succeeded in establishing a united command and purpose, the French would have blown them away as they did Abd el Kader.There is one very important shortcoming to this book, which has to do with the people who run Algeria today and could not be foreseen by the author. When this work was written, Houari Boumediene was still the President of Algeria. But when his successor Chadli Benjedid came to power in 1979, his authority was gradually undermined by powerful generals in the Algerian army. These officers - people like Larbi Belkheir, Khaled Nezzar and Mohamed Lamari - had once been soldiers fighting in the French army during the War of Independence, and only changed sides to join the FLN late in the conflict. The Algerian population despised them as traitors, but they were kept in the army due to the severe shortage of trained officers. Horne's book fails to identify this fact. When Boumediene died, this \\"French\\" faction of the Algerian army seized the opportunity to take power. It was these same officers who later ordered the machine-gunning of protestors during the 1988 riots and organized the military coup of 1992.In conclusion, I would say this is a great work of historical scholarship. There are of course other books you could use to complement it, such as the memoirs of General Paul Aussaresses (\\"Services Speciaux: Algerie 1955-1957\\"), who was the first high-ranking French officer to admit the widespread use of torture (he was also an instructor at the notorious School of the Americas). When you consider that the current minister of defense in France (Gerard Longuet) was once an extremist Pied Noir thug, and has recently proposed to have Gen. Bigeard's remains moved to the Invalides, it is clear to see that this war still has dramatic ramifications."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Japanese Script","review":"For it's price this book is a good find.

First lessons start with pictures on which certain charasters are based. Then the real characters are presented. The student is offered to establish a link between a picture and the corresponding character. It is a good stimulating exercise which makes the student pay attention to the elements of a certain character on one hand and prerares him to discover its meaning on the other. The lessons are supplied with exercises that help remember the material and also refresh what was learnt in the previous lesson. The exercises are very practical and present real language situations, e.g. to work with Japanese calendar, ads, warnings, notices, etc. The inroduction to kana is built on associations as well. However, I think it is slightly condensed. For those who are interested in learning Kana using picture mnemonics I would recommend Kana Pictographics by M.Rowley. Ohterwise, H. Gilhooly did a great job on creating this book. I just regret that the number of the Kanji introduced is only about fifty.

The book is written simply, by and established author, and leads you well through many simple kanji, including a nice set of general rules for stroke order.There are only a single real problem I found with this book. For one thing, the author does not always introduce the names of the kanji when she presents them--given, there is an index in the back, but I would like to not have to flip back and forth quite so often. This was my major concern with the book; if you want to have speaking ability with these new kanji you must learn how to say their names.Other than this, I believe this is a good choice of book if you are looking to learn kanji; even some of the pictoral mnemonics (I need a way to help me remember how to spell that! *grins*) were helpful, though some didn't seem to be very well-linked unless you looked them over quite carefully.So to you I say--nihongo gambatte!~KeViN!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Japanese Script","review":"I used this book eight years ago to learn some kanji before moving to Japan.

I just picked it up by chance at a grocery store back in '95. It is a wonderful book! I have since bought the hardcover edition which is very hard to come by! The story develops very well and like others have noted, you don't have a real clear idea of who the principle character is until well into the story. Sheffield had a knack for developing very unique characters. You have a real sense of understanding and appreciation for each person's situation and philosophies. Unlike some hard science fiction novelists (who tend to focus soley on the their ability to wow us with their indepth knowledge of theoretical physics and remind the rest of us how ignorant we are) Sheffield exposes the reader to incredibly detailed settings, rich, believable characters, and wonderfully acurate scientific insight. Unfortunately, Mr. Sheffield died on November 2nd of this year. He will be missed.

The plot revolves around a new weapon that one side hopes will tilt the war in their favor. Unfortunately for them, events turn sour, they attempt to cover their tracks, and we are left with a mystery.The book is well-written and easy to read. The plot does not create a great deal of suspense, and the resolution involves violations of biological principles that lack a real SF cover. As such, the stage is SF with interplanetary travel, frozen worlds that have been terraformed and the like. The plot, however, is fantasy involving biological responses beyond any norm. The mix is more than mildly annoying."},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","review":"For years Charles Sheffield has been one of my favorite science fiction authors--right up there with current \\"wouldn't miss\\" authors like Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, Ursula LeGuin, Robert Sawyer and Gene Wolfe--and this will be as much a eulogy as a review of COLD AS ICE. I looked forward to a Sheffield novel or novelette every year or so. Some say he wrote space opera--but if so, it was a superior kind. COLD AS ICE, set in the near-future solar system and something like a sequel to THE JUPITER PROJECT, is less of a space opera than, say, Sheffield's \\"Convergence\\" tales. I read it years ago and reread it last week before going on to its 2002 sequel, DARK AS DAY. Sheffield's last book is quite good after a somewhat frivolous start, grows better with each chapter, and I genuinely recommend it, but COLD AS ICE remains my personal favorite of all his longer fiction.Sheffield had the mind of a scientist, a waggish wit, and the soul of a poet--a rare combination in science-fiction, which has been able to attract writers of significance like Ted Sturgeon, humorists as prolific as Ron Goulart and Terry Pratchett, and scientists like Gregory Benford, but seldom has the genre had an author whose elements were so mix'd as in Charles Sheffield, enabling us to shout, \\"This was a writer!\\" Sheffield's poetic diction and irrepressible wit probably emerged from his own temperament. He seems to have been a glorious romantic who had next to no male supremacy hangups. \\"At the Eschaton,\\" a novelette that whirls us, a la Olaf Stapledon, from our time to the far distant future, is the most genuinely romantic work ever to emerge out of science-fiction, a mind-blowing exploration of \\"eternal love.\\" It remains the best sci-fi short novel I've ever read (although the novel-length expansion was one of Sheffield's lesser efforts).In a different way COLD AS ICE is also a superb romance, with realistic, sometimes imperfect, relationships of many kinds, from friendship to love (both mature and immature). While these interactions are building, the action never for a moment lets up, and the science, while cutting-edge, is extrapolated from current physical theories. The setting, mainly on Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa, is deliciously described and the preservation of Europa from human contamination has resonance for our time. It's a slam-bang adventure tale, with (as usual in Sheffield) a mystery to be solved. But most of all I appreciate Sheffield's subtle, realistic, and warm humans in this fine book--something, alas, Arthur Clarke has never achieved. Humans like \\"Megachirops\\" the Great Bat, a fat and sometimes too-arrogant genius (whom we met in THE JUPITER PROJECT and who shows up for a third appearance in DARK AS DAY, I'm happy to report), the three young people of special talents whose mystery is the backbone of the book, and even the lesser characters.It's correct to call this a next-step-in-human evolution novel, but it takes evolution in small steps--don't look for CHILDHOOD'S END or BLOOD MUSIC. In Sheffield's mature stories the main characters may be superior but are never one-dimensional. Like Bat, they are quite fallible. The up-and-coming young sci-fi novelist, Peter Hamilton, could learn a lot by studying Sheffield's books. Hamilton's space-operatic \\"Confederation\\" series shows promise, but the hero is too much a universal genius to be true, and ultimately he becomes a crashing bore. Sheffield never bored us. I don't want to believe he's gone!"},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","review":"Cold as Ice is a very fine work, by one of the best science fiction writers of our time. I am sorry indeed to hear of Charles Sheffield's passing last year. I enjoyed the wit, humor and hands on realism of this book, and others of his. Of the works of his I have read, this is the best yet. The story line keeps one engaged, the background of the Great War that is now over, leaving humanity bruised and battered, and the space lanes strewn with lost hopes and ghost ships is a engaging and believable background indeed. And the characters are real, human and they invite us to follow their efforts in many ways.The issues of science in service to politics, war and social needs is raised in subtle ways, and the sacrifice and challenges faced in many ways in this story evoke and raise questions for contemporary contemplation.I would urge any who have encountered Sheffield's work to read this as one of his best, and congratulate those other readers who already know and appreciate the fine qualities of this superior work."},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","review":"For some reason the publishers like comparing this author with Asimov and Clark. Surely by the late 90s this puts off more people than it encourages.

Thankfully it doesn't have 95 pages of dialogue where you are supposed to spot the clue. Anyway... this book is fun to read. He's taken the same universe as the Ganymede Club and selected the one of the same characters, but not the one you might expect... Bat. Mostly set in space, or underwater, or under planets .. good escapist stuff"},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","review":"I found COLD AS ICE a little hard to get into. It starts with an engaging scenario, then jumps forward 25 years and presents the reader with a number of seemingly unconnected characters. Not that the characters aren't interesting, but it takes quite a while before connections begin to be established.Overall, the alien locations are well-drawn, there are some unique and intriquing characters, and the action moves along satisfactorily once it gets going. On the downside, the plot was a bit transparent and it never devoloped much suspense. I never had the feeling that I just couldn't wait to see what would happen next.Perhaps the number of high ratings here are partially a comment on the state of the scifi genre these days. To my mind, this is really a mediocre book, but I still find it one of the more enjoyable scifi books I've read lately. Maybe I'm just not making great choices. In my younger days, I read a lot of what I still think was outstanding scifi. Books like DUNE, DOUBLE STAR, the FOUNDATION series, RITE OF PASSAGE, LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS, RINGWORLD, etc. I'm just not finding books of that calibre in this genre anymore, and it's not for lack of trying. So, whether it's a commentary on me or the state of scifi, I'm giving this a four-star rating. It's a weak four, more like 3.7 (a B- in letter-grade terms), and a very mild endorsement. Rip-roaring scifi it's not, but it will have to do until something better comes along."},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","review":"&quot;Cold as Ice&quot; was my introduction to Charles Sheffield.

I am a fan of near furture science fiction and this fits that category. The locations, in our solar system, are familiar.

The story developes the characters in parallel so for half the book you do not know which one is key or where you are going. Things converge nicely in the second half and all ends well. It was a good, exciting read. Some romance, no sexual descriptions, no violence. Fair amount of techno-speak and scientific explanations, sounds feasible to me even if the timeline is ambitious.I did think the ending was a bit too tidy and I look forward to the sequel to learn more about these characters and their mission. Actually, I have read the sequel and it is the same universe but not the same characters.

The beginning is very disjointed -- many characters are introduced in many different setting and the reader has no idea what's going on or how the characters relate. Its hard to keep them straight. Around the middle of the book, things start to come together and some plot begins to develop. Finally the book comes to a conclusion and the reader thinks &quot;so what&quot;. There are aspects of a mystery story, but the mystery, when revealed, is not a big deal -- one wonders why anyone ever tried to keep it secret. The strengths of the book are in the details -- good characterizations and realistic depiction of the &quot;surroundings&quot;. However, a weak plot and the rambling, disjointed style make it less than outstanding."},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"The first sentence of the introduction to this book says \\"This is a book about shorebird identification\\", and I believe it succeeds admirably in that goal. The two strongest points about the book are that it contains every species that has ever been recorded in North America (94 of them), and the 534 pictures are of very high quality. Distinctive species may have only a few pictures, while difficult or variable species have many more (up to a dozen or so). Although sometimes on the brief side, I did not find the sections on behavior and habitat to be lacking to the point of being drawbacks. And at a price of just over $20, this is a good value for a photographic guide.A few points about range maps, which are not included in this guide:1) The author points out that they are not included \\"in part so all the space can be used for photos and text but also because all current field guides have largely accurate range maps that can be used in conjunction with this book.\\" I believe this is a fair trade-off. The book, at 350+ pages, is already a bit hefty for a field guide and range maps, although they would have been nice, would have made it larger and more expensive.2) Nearly one-third of the birds covered by this book are so uncommon in North America that range maps don't really apply. Of the remaining two-thirds, many have North American range maps which in Sibley's are largely white except for the far north, and have varying numbers of little green dots elsewhere. Thus, many of the range maps, had they been included, would have conveyed minimal information.3) Many shorebirds migrate very long distances and have a tendency to wander widely, thus making range maps less useful than they are for other species, like sparrows. When you think you may have a Little Stint in with that flock of Western Sandpipers you are observing, what you need are more pictures and identification pointers, not range maps.So if you already have a general field guide like Sibley's and are looking for something extra to help you identify North American shorebirds, this book fills that bill nicely at a modest price."},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"This is a beautiful book on shorebird identification. I've found this guide to be an essential addition to my bookshelf, primarily due to the quality and variety of photographs. For many of the included species, the wide selection of photographs show birds in flight as well as average plumage differences between breeding adults, non-breeding adults, and juveniles, allowing for the careful study of differences within species as well as between species. I also found the identification tips to be very valuable, as the discussion includes useful comparisons between similar species for birds both on the ground and in flight. The discussions of habitat and behavior are not extensive but provide sufficient detail, and the voice descriptions are very helpful.The lack of range maps is well-balanced by a short discussion on range for each species, and may even be a blessing. A single glance at range maps can be misleading, as there can be wide variations in the timing of when individual shorebirds of some species may depart from or arrive on their wintering grounds. For example, the range maps in both the Sibley's guides and the National Audubon Society field guides show that Ruddy Turnstones should only be found in the Carolinas during the \\"winter\\" season - I've watched Ruddy Turnstones in full breeding plumage foraging on South Carolina beaches in early August, presumably early migrants who have already completed their nesting season and haven't yet begun molting into their non-breeding plumage. Another perfect example is the normal range of Northern Lapwing, an occasional Eurasian visitor to North America, whose rare visits have included Maine, New York, Maryland, and Florida.This photographic guide to shorebirds is a lovely reference to accompany basic field guides, provides an excellent overview of what you might see in the field, and is a valuable resource for those who are passionate about shorebirds."},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"Shorebirds of North America is a keeper! Absolutely stunning pictures showing virtually every bird in flight as well as on the ground in a multitude of plumages. The interesting, informative, well written descriptions make this a better arm-chair book, than field book.That said, however, it's certainly small enough to be carried afield; it's smaller than Sibley's Guide and ruggedly constructed. The bird pictures are exceptional and elaborate showing many molt stages and picularities. As a visual person, I find this not simply helpful for me, but absolutely necessary for shorebirds. The descriptions Paulson uses for identification are practical, comparative, clear and easy to understand. There is much discussion of plumages, voice and distinctive characteristics both in flight and on the ground.I loved the table of estimated populations of these birds. It answered my question about the Snowy Plover in Washington state and why eveyone seemed so concerned. Paulson estimates their population at 15, 700.He has a well illustrated section on anatomy that provides a guide for terms used in the book such as mantle line, upper and lower scapular line, primary projection and more. There's sound information on individual variation from feather wear and fade, unusual plumages, hybridization, and molts.The only disappointment for me was the quick list of species on the inside cover. It's done numerically and I would have liked the listing alphabetical for speedy look-up. I think it's faster to go to the table of contents where the species are broken down by type - plovers, sandpipers, curlews, etc.As I said of another book recently reviewed, this one should have a higher rating than shown, like 43/4 stars, but that choice is not available.I bought it as a companion book to Stokes Beginner's Guide to Shorebirds and I am not disappointed with the pair, they compliment (and supplement) each other. In short, this book with the information it contains is 'worth the money'."},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"Like all field guides for birds and I do consider this a field guide due to its size, completeness and wonderful photographs, you need to include a couple of other guides to act as supplements. What will work for one birder, may not work for another and the more ammunition you have in your rucksack, the better when in the field. I have to classify this particular guide as one of the best. It does cover all 94 species that have ever been spotted in North America and does cover different plumage, maturity and sexual identification marks. It gives a very nice description of habitat which is extremely helpful.As has been pointed out; this work does not include distribution maps. As far as I am concerned, and in my opinion, for what that is worth, this is a plus! Shore birds are a tricky lot. I truly feel that they gather at the beginning of each year in some secret place and discuss just how they plan to mess with the minds of birders this year. After that, they send a few of their better flyers to various spots in North American where they have absolutely no business being. This can and will drive the average birder out of their minds and has been the source of many heated arguments among birders. I have found that with shorebirds, that it is best to take nothing for granted and expect the unexpected.Now, there is the problem of just what a shore bird is. Shore birds ARE NOT ducks, geese, herons, loons and the like. In general, shore birds are little brown critters that all look quite alike and are insanely difficult to identify at times. If you want ducks and geese, go elsewhere.The photographs in this work are of the highest quality, clear, concise and extremely accurate. As I said, if you use this work, along with others to act as supplements, your life will become much easier. This is particularly true when you consider some of the modern optical equipment we have available today.This is a great one to add to your collection, either if like me you concentrate on marshland, or if you are lucky enough to live near the coast, so much the better.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"The book covers 94 species of shorebirds for North America including familiar species and rarities.The wide selection of photos show birds in flight as well as average plumage differences between breeding adults, non-breeding adults and juveniles.

This is just a wonderful book and, as I live in an area with many species of wintering shorebirds, it goes with me everywhere I go. The identification summaries are succinct and well written. The book is also just plain tough - it has been dog-eared and jammed in my backpack in awkward positions and even been rained on a couple of times, and it's still in great shape. I highly recommend this book! Even better, buy it along with the Karlson, O'Brien and Crossley book and you're all set! :)"},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"I was waiting for this book to come out for a while and I got one of the first copies that came out. I am hugely disapointed. Ofcourse, the pictures are great and there are large paragraphs on physical description and plumage, but unbelievably, there are no range maps and the descriptions of habits, behavior and migration patterns are almost like footnotes after a page long dictionary like description of plumage. I compare this book to the similar princeton guide to north american sparrows, which has incredible descriptions of behavior and great rangemaps, and I call this book a massive disapointment. So if you want a page long summary of physical description, buy this book, otherwise save your money."},{"Title":"Shorebirds of North America: The Photographic Guide","review":"This has proven to be a very useful field guide to the wading birds on the New England shore for someone like me, serious enough to want a good guide and occassional enough in my birding to need a lot of guidance.

Therefore this book ceased to be important as a primary textbook or a reference. Nevertheless it would be a shame for it to become forgotten. Written with typical Spivak's subtle humor (the book gently mocks both The Joy of Cooking and The Joy of Sex), it introduces important concepts of TeX and mathematical typesetting. It is one of the rare books that explain not just HOW, but also WHY. It would be enjoyable both for a TeX gourmet and a technical writer interested in the way Spivak is able to explain difficult things in simple terms."},{"Title":"The joy of TEX: A gourmet guide to typesetting with the AMS-TEX macro package","review":"Spivak's appealing and original book makes learning TeX much more fun than it really should be! If you are already familiar with some flavor of TeX, this is a great book for becoming proficient with AMS-TeX quickly. If not, then there is enough introductory material to make you familiar with the basics of TeX typesetting first. To me AMS-TeX is preferrable to LaTeX (commands are more suggestive and easier to use) and this book is the best AMS-TeX handbook available."},{"Title":"Genesis & Evolution","review":"Dehaan is a Christian physician (M.D.) who takes a very direct approach to a problem that has plagued us for a long time- evolution versus Creation. This book was written in the 1961, but is a timeless book whose language is not antiquated and whose examples are timely for us today. Dr. Dehaan explores the fact that if you don't believe Genesis 1:1, then you can not believe anything in the Bible. He backs up his belief in Genesis 1:1 by arguing that science has never refuted the Bible. He is a believer in the Gap Theory, which is the interpretation that God created and then destroyed the earth because of sin (Lucifer's fall) when Lucifer and his angels lived on earth prior to man's creation. This is based on Scripture where it tells us He created the Heavens and the Earth (Gen 1:1) and then the earth was devoid and without form (Gen 1:2). God would not create something useless, so something must have happened between Gen 1:1 and 1:2. This would allow for both the ideas that the earth is old, yet humans have only been here for 4000+ years. He does not discount the validity of fossils, in general, or old earth ideals, like many of today's Creationists do. The book uses many Scriptural examples and many scientific examples. It is written for the lay-person, so there is no need for one to understand the complexities of genetics or in-depth evolutionary ideas. This is a great place to start a study on resolving the &quot;conflict&quot; between evolution and Genesis."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Big Sur: 80 Great Hikes","review":"We bought this book to take with us on our week long, mostly driving, tour of the middle California coast. We ended up taking about six of the shorter hikes listed. All were wonderful. Honestly, we never would have found most without this book. Apparently no one else would either because we were alone on five of the hikes. The information presented is clear and accurate.

Two years ago I decided I needed to see some trails, not just look at things from the cliffs. The picture on the front cover is of McWay Falls. What a hidden treasure. It is right off Hwy 1. You park, go down a very short trail and around the first curve is this beautiful waterfall that empties into the Pacific Ocean. I was absolutely astounded. The cover of the book interested me initially, but the book is worth it's cover price. This was a hidden treasure to me but McWay Falls is actually quite famous. Somehow I found that the author created a web site during the time that I was going to do my first hikes. Unfortunately, I was going shortly after the North Sur fire. I found information on the author's website that I was not able to find on any fire site. It is the web site that has the pictures,etc. Get the book and go to the interactive website. He kept it up to date. I was going for a one week stay and was very disheartened. Due to the fire most of the trails were closed...but then there was McWay Falls, right by Hwy 1...open,open,open. I got to hike 1/4 mile!"},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Big Sur: 80 Great Hikes","review":"This is not a horrible book, but its not a great book either. The book looks and feels like the publisher had some cost constraints he put himself under.Pros: 1. There were some hikes under here that I would not have though of. 2. The maps, with one major exception ( which is listed in my list of cons ) seems to be pretty professionally done. There was nothing hand scribbled here.Cons: 1. Maps - there is a little compass on each that shows where North is pointing. Sometimes north is pointed up, but a lot of times it isn't. This one of the items that says the publisher was cutting costs, and it really shows 2. There was nothing in the different hike descriptions that got me excited about that hike. 3. No pictures - another case of the publisher cutting costs."},{"Title":"Humanzee Pb (Oxford Thrillers)","review":"All in all, this is a fairly accomplished children's book, but sadly it doesn't transcend the barrier to make it a great kid's book that could be truly enjoyed by adults too.The protagonist, Nemo, is an interesting and reasonably developed character; and Gates plays around a little with our concepts of time. Although set at the end of the 20th century, the book has a slightly futuristic feel.The relationship between Chingwe (the humanzee of the title) and Nemo is genuinely touching at times, and his interactions with Martha are equally interesting.Sadly, the book is a little disappointing in its treatment of science and evolution - the ideas presented may be challenging for some, but at times the book has a slightly preachy feel, and presents the issues in a very black and white way. The book would certainly from an interesting basis for discussing the ideas of both creationists and evolutionary biologists, but would be best presented along with material representing other viewpoints.Just as a brief warning, although I'm not religious, I can very easily see that this book may cause offence to those with very strong religious sensibilities, as it presents creationism in a very negative light."},{"Title":"Humanzee Pb (Oxford Thrillers)","review":"The characters were extremely detailed including Chingwe the humanzee and Nemo,the boy who is the main character..It was very descriptive in general.I could actually visualize the underground caves mentioned that Nemo explored.I would have liked a more detailed description of Chingwe,though.There was never a dull moment in the book.I literally had a hard time putting it down.It's been a while since I've read a book that engaging."},{"Title":"Pieced or Appliqued Flowers: From the Aqs Contest Flowers on Parade","review":"This book is a compilation of 7 quilt designers work.

My coworker and I often exchange books. One day \\"I Do\\" appeared on my desk. She said she didn't put it there and had found it on her desk and assumed I left it for her. Needless to say I picked up the book during some down time and started reading it. I am currently not in a relationship and it seems the \\"so-called\\" relationships I had did not last long. I am a widow and have been married twice before. Living alone and taking care of myself, i.e., very independent, it's hard to let go and let someone else do the driving. My term is \\"I'm waiting to exhale\\". Pastor Powell hit on some points when he spoke of men who are are looking for women to take care of them. Where are the men of valor? I totally enjoyed reading this book. I am referring it to my friends, the married ones. I found the help I needed in reading this book - it got me through the night. I am a believer in the Word -- the book of instructions for this life. I loved the way Pastor Powell made living proof of God's words by his illustrations and examples. Believe it or not, some people know very little about how to love. What greater example is there than God's love. Thank you for a job well done. And if I can add one more thing...the reason I am on this website is because I wanted to get a picture of the author, Pastor Stenneth Powell. How about a photo?"},{"Title":"What to Do Before You Say \\"I Do\\": Ensuring a Strong Foundation for Marriage","review":"I read this book gained a lot regarding relationships and marriage. It's good to read a practicable book coupled with proper exegisis of the Scripture. There is no bias toward male, female, rich, poor, church, nor unchurched. I read the other review and wanted to add how I read the suthor's p.o.v. concerning wealth and marriage. I read that men and women should make it a priority to get their priorities straight both naturally and spiritually - this includes finances. Many people like James Dobson, Jimmy Evans, Joyce Meyer, speak about the things that bring strife in a marriage - lack of money being one of them. I see this author, S.E. Powell as saying to the reader to get yourself together, spiritually, financially, naturally, etc. as much as possible. This will help one experience less trials in a marriage relationship. Well there is so much more in this book than what I've already mentioned. I view the book as a call for people not to live beneath their privelage. It gives knowledge that you will need to review throughout your relationship - and knowledge brings responsibility. So, in a nutshell....I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"What to Do Before You Say \\"I Do\\": Ensuring a Strong Foundation for Marriage","review":"This is a great ministry tool that speaks the truth.

However, it might be better for other people who are in different situations in their lives, it just wasn't good for me. There are a lot of people out there with very silly ideas about marriage, and this book would set them straight, but offers little else to those of us who already understand the basic principles of a Christian marriage. It did do a good job of establishing some of the characteristics of a good husband and wife, although at times I disagreed with the great importance that was placed on wealth in marriage. The author seems to make the case that gathering wealth is one of the primary reasons to get married, which I would say is false.

Apparently Dean, who owned a security firm, was working a warehouse when two youths entered. They came not so much to rob the place, but to locate the meth they stashed in a trailer. In a senseless killing, the youngsters shot Dean when he found them. Feeling obligated, Brendan, who played ball with Dean as a child, informs Mindy, the pregnant wife of his late buddy.Brendan tries to be there though he never liked the widow. He soon realizes that his previous feelings towards Mindy was a form of reaction formation to hide even from himself how attracted he was and is to his best friend's widow. As Mindy begins to reciprocate, both feel guilt that they are betraying the memory of a nice man.The likable lead couple will keep the audience glued to this fine romantic contemporary as they struggle with love for one another and deep regard and love for the deceased. The story line is character driven with Brendan and Mindy feeling guilty that they are betraying a loved on, turning any relationship into a forbidden triangle. Janice Kay Johnson writes a strong relationship drama as the unborn symbolizes the future and the past.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"With Child (Larger Print Superromance)","review":"This book was surprisingly credible, unlike most romance novels.

Reading this book has given me a new insight into the richness of our traditions and their basis. I have a deeper appreciation of the sacraments, the seasons of the church and the practices that surround them. I especially liked the review of the liturgical year, and I can see myself using this book to follow the Church calendar as an aid in spiritual growth. In short, a great book for Catholics who want to know why we do what we do."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Regis's book.

Also, my two daughters have found simple explanations to questions they have, especially with regard to the seasons of the liturgical year and the sacraments of our faith. God Bless you Regis, keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"Many Catholics go through their lives knowing the customs of the Catholic Church without ever knowing just exactly where those customs come from. Most Catholics I believe go through their entire lives not having any idea just how ancient most of these customs are. Adult converts to the Church are given instruction in most of these customs but that instruction usually stops with the why and seldom reaches into the beautiful history of these customs. Even when the RCIA instruction does cover all of the bases and even when the cradle Catholic has been thoroughly schooled in the history and tradition of the Church much of that instruction and education gets lost along the way. There is just so much information that the human brain can absorb and learning all that there is to know about the majesty, history and glory of the Roman Catholic Church is simply beyond the average person's capacity.That is why wonderful little books like this one are so important. This author gives the reader a concise but thorough explanation of some of the most important customs and traditions of the Catholic Church. Each subject is covered in only a few short pages or sometimes only paragraphs but all of the basics are there. The physical action required for the customs is explained very clearly so that for example someone who had never seen anyone genuflect could easily picture the action in their mind's eye. The author then tackles both the scriptural and traditional reasons for the custom and when the custom is practiced somewhat differently from one region to another he explains the differences and the reasons for them.Personally speaking I picked up a lot of information about the history of some of our most cherished customs and how they had first come to be practiced. For example many, if not most of our modern practices can easily be traced as far back as the early Church because of images found in the Roman catacombs. I also learned a great deal about some other customs on which I was a little fuzzy like indulgences and scapulars. The very simplicity with which this author explains these things is what makes this such a fine little book. Simply put, you don't have to be a theologian to actually understand what the author is talking about and areas that have never been quite clear will begin to come into brilliant focus.I did find one little typo on page 135 which is not the author's fault but the publisher might want to correct it in future editions, of which there ought to be many. I also found the author's description of a set of Rosary beads to be a little confusing and there are very few people more familiar with Rosary Beads than I. On the other hand I found in the Rosary section that the old English word bead meant, \\"to pray\\" which was a bit of completely new and fascinating information, at least it was for me.Don't expect heavy theology or in depth analysis from this book but as a primer on why we Catholics do some of the things that we do this book can't be beat."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"As a 5th grade religous educator, I found this book extremely helpful. My class concentrates on the sacraments and Catholic Customs is a great resource. It is also a great source for all about the life of the Church.

It definately gives all a fresh look at our Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"This book is just an amazing read for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. CATHOLIC CUSTOMS covers all the issues that aren't discussed in 12 years of Catholic schooling or from the pulpit. I consider this book a valuable resource in understanding the most intricate, as well as, the most basic customs of the Catholic church. The customs and beliefs of the church are vast and can be confusing. Regis Flaherty in his book helps explain these intricacies in a logical and readable manner.Thanks to CATHOLIC CUSTOMS, I am now well-armed to defend my deep Catholic beliefs and the customs that are ingrained in my faith. I now have a grasp as to what the significance of the priests' vestments are, what it takes for one to achieve sainthood, and what the church's calendar means."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"As a reference source, Catholic Customs does an excellent job. I have a tendency to judge all works on devotions, customs, and practices by whether the full tenebrae is included and explained - and this book comes pretty darn close! There is an excellent breadth of information which is a fine supplement to the catechism, and other more targeted books such as Dubruiel's How-To Book of the Mass. When contrasted against Dues' Catholic Customs &amp; Traditions, Flaherty's work is more down-to-earth, informative on present practice, and in-line with the magesterium (but not quite as developed compared to the excellent historical perspective that Dues provides).That being said, the book lacks somewhat in readability. While the author does a nice job making individual sections entertaining with anecdotes &amp; analogies, the structure of the book just doesn't lend itself to being a through-read. Frankly, this may be my fault for trying to devour it linearly.Overall, a nice addition to any Catholic's library, and certain to pique some ideas and get people out of ingrained modes of worship to try some time-honored practices."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"On the back cover of Flaherty's new book, Bishop Thomas Tobin writes &quot;This book is completely Catholic,&quot; and to that I say &quot;Amen.&quot; Everything you ever wondered about as a Catholic ... why do we genuflect, what exactly is a feast day and why do we celebrate it, why do we light all of those candles ...

If your non-Catholic friends repeatedly ask you, &quot;Why do Catholics do ...&quot; get this book for them."},{"Title":"Catholic Customs: A Fresh Look at Traditional Practices","review":"This was a modestly sized reference book. It is nothing like an encyclopedia of Catholic practices or anything like that. But it is a basic overview of terms which the Church uses.

The Earth Mother has allowed the Duo Pods' chemical wastes to change the ants and roaches into self-aware beings with unique and viable cultures. Plastics mined from ancient waste disposal sites are essential food supplements for the proper growth and development of these sentient insects. Vying for access and ownership of the plastic mines has created decades of intense animosity, exacerbated by occasional military actions between the ant and roach nations.This book chronicles four generations of dairier ants and two generations of adopted roaches, who reach out to the roach community to end the hostilities. The ants strive to create common ground in mining, construction, trade and law. Among the roaches, there are those who savor their privileges and will go to any lengths - even murder - to maintain the status quo. If the ants fail, both species will pass away, just as the Duo Pods did.I had trouble starting this book, because I'm a cat person, not a roach person. However, by the time I got to Chapter 11, I was cruising. Looking back, I think I'll miss Anthony. It takes a very special ant to adopt a roach, because his mate can't have any children of her own.

Assessing the claims', is a particularly sobering look at the prospects for 'regime-change' through international pressure, sanctions or boycotts.Although the march of time is making it a little dated, there is much about this book that will repay the effort of reading."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I wanted to check this book out at my local book store first before I bought it,thank goodness I did. I thought this book would discuss and show different techniques on how to apply makeup and different looks you can achieve with makeup, but it didn't. It vaguely discuss how Asian features are different, which is nice, but it doesn't discuss on how to play up those features. The pictures and the models in the book were pretty but some of the makeup is a little strange (orange lipstick?). The book claims to have all types of Asian women in the book which it does but it doesn't discuss or show how to apply makeup to different people and the explainations on how to do things were skimpy. This is a nice book to look at while waiting in line someplace, but as for reading and it's usefulness to anyone Asian or not, very little. I think anyone thinking of buying this book should look it over before making any irrational decisions."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I got this book for my birthday, and I wish I would have chosen a different book. I'm full chinese and this book is primarily for mixed asians or asians with eyelid jobs. There is a lot of text and a lot of pictures, but not many tutorials. i think that what would have made this book a sucess- is more tutorials with different models. I really don't feel like there was enough representations of the various races i.e. chinese, japanese, korean, indian, vietnamese etc. I think the author should have chosen a few models of each race to display technique. I also think the writer should have shown more models with different facial structures. I thought her eyes section was pretty funny, she said &quot;Smoky eyes like this look great on Asian women because they add to our mystery&quot; insert close up of an eye thickly lined all the way around with kohl liner. The way that i and other asian girls put on their eyeliner because they can't figure out what else to do!Her makeover section before/after photos was disappointing. All talk... i guess she couldn't totally copy aucion's book and put in photos or drawings of the &quot;process&quot;.Her &quot;get a new attitude&quot; at the end of the book should have been entitled &quot;Notes to myself&quot; ... &quot;make time for yourself, set goals, start a journal, learn to forgive, take responsibility, dare to do something different, learn to love yourself naked&quot;....All in all, this book was a HUGE disappointment. Kimura prefers to tell you what she likes to do in this and that situation but doesn't want to SHOW you. You might as well go read allure if you don't have a crease in your eyelid."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"The description of this book claims that Asian Beauty contains &quot;step-by-step guidance on how to enhance lips, eyes, cheeks, and brows&quot; and that the book would be helpful to people like me, those &quot;who have had to make do with beauty tips tailored for women of European descent&quot;. This is terribly misleading. I won't deny that Asian Beauty contains some stunning photography of beautifully made-up Asian women of all types. However, I don't think this book would be terribly helpful for someone looking for detailed make-up application tips accompanied by photographs demonstrating specific techniques. For example, I had hoped the book would finally be a source of tips on how I could enhance my eyes, which like those of many Asian women, lack eyelid folds. Wouldn't this be one of the classic questions many Asian women would have? I hunted through the book to find the answer, but found that Kimura gives only a brief mention of this particular feature, and offers no real helpful hints on what to do with it. There are a few series of photographs which purport to be &quot;how to&quot; shots, but Kimura offers frustratingly vague descriptions of many other techniques which are not illustrated with photographs.You might find Asian Beauty interesting and helpful if you like to see glamorous photographs of Asian women made up in a variety of styles, both classic and cutting edge. But you will be sorely disappointed if you are looking for the guidance to get to that end result. Browse this book in the store before ordering."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I picked this up at the book store to see if it may be useful for me, an asian-american. As I scanned through the pages, I saw a lot of pictures of asians with &quot;white&quot; features. Most of the models tend to be asians mixed with white or black. None of the models had single eyelids. The makeup also looked very tacky, using colors that did not seem to complement asian skin tones. I cant say this book is all bad. It does have a few good tips for skin and make-up applicators. I still think this book tries too hard to make an asian woman look white. It does not seem to accentuate the natural beauty that asians have. I am glad there is a book that focuses on Asians. I give props to the author. I still think it should be more focused on the typical asian rather than trying to make them look white."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I have The Asian Face, written at least 20 years ago and was looking for a new, updated book on makeup tips for Asian faces. I called a local bookstore and had it put on hold. Stupidly, I bought it without looking through it. It certainly wasn't what I had expected or wanted. The faces of the models are not pure Asian faces; rather they are Asian blends with beautiful deep-set eyes. The faces in the book hardly need any help.I wanted some tips for every day makeup. Many of the models had makeup on that I wouldn't even wear at night. I am especially interested in makeup for the eyes. I had expected some tips for the various types of Asian eyes (which no magazine ever covers). However, that was not the case. I'm sorry I bought the book. I had planned to buy another one as a gift but will not do so now."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"Despite it's title, the majority of models featured in this book are half-asian. And although I was initially excited by the fact that there were so many faces similar to mine, it was a useless purchase.I could've picked up an issue of Allure or Glamour and found more useful beauty and makeup tips for a fraction of the price. As for the actual quality of the photos, I was in shock. Some of the images had been so enlarged that I could see the pixelation on some of the models' faces. I've seen newspaper inserts that were of a higher quality.If I was a full Asian woman I would've given &quot;Asian Beauty&quot; one star. I saw nothing in this book that deals with the specific issues that many women of Asian descent deal with, ie: single eyelids, rounder faces, etc."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"Initially, I was very excited about this book. I have Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin, but I wanted another book that would teach me how to use vibrant colors so I thought that Asian Beauty would be a good choice. The design is nice and the makeup looks are exactly what I was looking for but Kimura doesn't tell you how to achieve those looks. She does mention a 'light and shadows' technique but it is not adequately demonstrated. She also doesn't give product names. I understand that some artists don't give product names because they want to give the reader freedom but it's hard for me to find colors if I don't have a name to go by. All in all, this is a pretty book. Too bad its not a useful one."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I picked up this book with much enthusiasm and anticipation.. it is rare enough to see a makeup book featuring Asians, but one that devotes itself to Asian makeup.. wow! That's a first!Imagine my disappointment seeing page after page of pan-Asian looking models with deep set eyes and Eurasian features! There is little information on makeup techniques, other than what you probably already know. To give due credit, a few of the makeup looks do look outstanding and quite beautiful. But all in all, I am rather surprised at the kind of makeup featured in the book: I am no makeup expert, but a few models looked like they have oil smeared all over the face, quite frightful indeed! Do we Asians really want to look like that? And dare I say it... actually a few of the models in the makeover section are better off in the &quot;before&quot; pictures than &quot;after&quot;!! What a shocker! And what's with the stenciled eye brow look most of the models are wearing?If you want a book to stack up the coffee-table fern, this is it; if you want one for picking up real makeup tips and looks, you are better off with Kevyn Aucoin's collection anyday."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"If anyone has read all of the reviews on this book they will notice that overall many consider that the book Asian Beauty falls extremely short of its goal. And if one has read all the posted reviews they will notice that most of the few positive opinions of this book have been posted by (probably) white readers and the majority of the negative (and more realistic) postings were made by Asians who know \\"real\\" Asian beauty. Like many I was happily awaiting a book dedicated to Asian beauty but as an African American even I noticed the frequent Eurasian featured models and the short and vague makeup advice. At first I thought I would be the only one giving a negative opinion on this book but I am glad that many recognize its faults."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"This book contains beautiful photographs of stunning Asian and partly-Asian women. However, as far as makeup tips that address all of the different types of problems that Asian women have (no eyelid fold, wide faces, small eyes, thin lips, etc.), it's pretty thin. It was nice to see the wide range of colors that we can use, but that's about it. I already know about drinking a lot of water and getting enough sleep, thanks!Lots of sparkle, little substance. Too bad."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I'm an Asian American in my late twenties living in L.A. and lived and traveled in Asia. So I have an idea of beautiful Asian women. And this book does not contain that. The before and after pictures aren't anything any woman (even one as dumb with makeup as me) wouldn't know. The author doesn't take any real make up risks. She gives the basic 411 on eating healthy, excercising, etc.. She emphasizes using eyeliner. However, not all Asian eyes are similar. It's better to just look on the Internet for Asian beauty tips. I was so excited when I ordered it. When I read it, I was sooo disappointed."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"The book focuses too heavily on women with Eurasian (people of asian and caucasian decent). Eurasian models in the book seem to outnumber pure-blooded asian models. When a book claims to have advice to help people with unique \\"Asian\\" features, you would think that it would have more models with these unique \\"asian features\\" (ie: asian eyes, nose, facial structure) that are not covered in popular magazines. The problem with featuring so many Eurasians in the book is the fact that Eurasians often have very \\"Cauasian\\" features...and thus their concerns are ALREADY adressed in popular magazines. Many of the models in the book had so little asian blood in them that they didn't look asian at all - i remember turning to a page to find what very much appeared to be a full-blooded caucasian woman staring back at me - all this in a book entitled \\"Asian Beauty\\". Kimura later explains that this Woman apparantly has 1/4 asian in her...well I don't see it!I guess Kimura emphasizes Eurasian models because they're so stunningly beautiful and exotic...but she really undermines the whole purpose of this so-called book on \\"Asian Beauty\\" by doing this - because Eurasian features tend to lean towards Cauasian-looking - not to mention that Kimura uses some models with only 1/4 Asian blood - or even less in some cases!Besides the fact that Kimura uses too few models with authentic Asian features. Her book provides minimal information on how to actually apply make-up... in a nutshell, it's a book full of pictures of beautiful women - not a book on make-up application to enhance Asian features.Hopefully an someone else will come around and write the first \\"how-to\\" book on Asian Beauty."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"This book was a total waste of money. There is no useful professional advice at all.Because one of the authors is Asian American, I expected she could talk about some professional technique applicable particularly to Asian faces. nothing.The book is rather about the author's impressions and feelings, such as &quot;I always found -(Asian faces) --are very mysterious.&quot; But she did not provide with any solid technique to make this &quot;mysterious&quot; faces look attractive.Furthermore, all models photographed in this book look like as if they just come out of Chinese opera with heavy make ups (with bright colors that do not go well with Asian features at all.)Bobi Brown's &quot;Beauty&quot; talks about Asian faces in short three pages. But it was far more practical, useful and kind advice to help Asian faces look prettier, and Asian women feel confident with their oriental features.Total disappointment."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"As with the other negative reviewers of this book, I was first very excited to have found a book dedicated to Asian women. I am of mixed race decent (Canadian and Chinese) and I believe I have the best of both worlds. However, I did inherit the Asian eyes from the Chinese side. I do have a crease but not a heavy one like those models in the book. I agree with the other readers that this book featured mostly Euro-Asian women.My biggest makeup challenge has always been finding ways to flatter my Asian eyes, as I believe they are the best part of my face. However, I have yet to find any tips for Asian women that's truly flattering. So when I picked up this book, I was thrilled that maybe I have finally found a solution to my problem.As said by the other readers, this book is best suited for mixed race Asians. The models all have very chiseled features and heavy lidded eyes that made it easy to apply makeup. The book did not provide helpful techniques that will benefit Asian women with little or no crease. The only two tricks that would work is the \\"smokey eye\\" where you basically smear black shadow and liners all over your eyes, who would want to look like that all the time? Or just slap on some cream eye shadow and curl your lashes and leave the eyes \\"au naturale\\". Well I wanted the natural look I wouldn't have bothered with makeup to begin with.My suggestion is for the readers to do a search on the internet for the key word \\"Asian makeup tips\\". I learn more useful tips doing that than reading this book."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"This book was completely useless as a tool to help asian women with a creaseless eye. I would have given it a zero star, but I'll give the author a one star for effort."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I am of full-blooded Chinese descent, and I found this book very helpful. I haven't worn makeup consistently throughout my life, so when I started applying the techniques in this book, I received many compliments. I also liked the way I looked when I used the shadows and light technique. My only complaint, if I may call it that, is that since people were more used to seeing me in &quot;plain face,&quot; sometimes they would compliment me by saying, &quot;you're makeup looks so beautiful!&quot; As I make it a habit to put on makeup every day, those comments will probably fade, because I want my makeup to draw attention to me, not to the fact that I am wearing it."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"This is a coffee table book, not an instruction manual. For those interested in step by step instructions this book is not for you.Pros: Large, color, real photographs of women of various ages and ethnicities. The stories surrounding the women were interesting, but not really necessary in a book centered on makeup.Cons: As others have stated, the makeup applications are more experimental than classic. Direct advice on how to apply the makeup is scarce and there are no real variations on a theme.Kimura's book is great for admiring, but does little for helping the everyday woman with the practical application of makeup."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"After reading reviews that others have written, I decided to borrow this book from the library instead of ordering it. I have read the book from front to cover and found it full of useful information, along with terrific pictures. It's great to finally find beauty tips that's not targeted to the typical model-thin female of european descent. Margaret Kimura gave some good suggestions for color and techniques to enhance certain physical characteristics, but most importantly, she showed that there are no typical rules or guidelines. After reading this book, I now have the courage to experiment and be more daring. In the future, I do plan on buying this book for myself to keep as a useful reference, not as a 'coffee-table' book."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I love this book from day one when it came out. It has all the tips and advice you need to apply the makeup. Margaret makes you comfortable with your own skin. She has done interviews with beautiful Asian women of all walks of life.

This book is a must!"},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"Whoever used the computer to edit those pictures in this book must not know how to use the software, because I can do a lot better than that. The pictures are horrible!!!! The pictures are partly blurred and partly filtered, so you can see right at the hair line where the face was blurred out and the hair was still in focus. Ewww..."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I got a copy as a Christmas gift. I liked it so much I bought some to give to my asian friends. Most of the women in the book are very beautiful. I'm sure they don't look this good when they first get up in the morning without make up. But then again, who'd want to buy a book with pages full of ugly woman?? This book is a big inspiration to asian women whether they have double or single eyelids. It's about encouraging woman to look their best so they can feel their best...inside and out! I've never saw any books that cater to asian woman of this kind before, so it's refreshing to discover something new. It's a refreshing breakthrough for Asians Woman of all kinds and I think Margaret is being a great role model by sharing her expert advice as an asian. Although the book didn't cover every type of asian feature such as single eyelids and spread out noses, it's a good start to educate asian woman about make up techniques and color. I'd like to see if anyone can beat this book to help asian woman. It's a positive start."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I was very impressed with all the tips Margaret Kimura provides on enhancing asian eyes. She also goes in-depth on beauty care for the skin, and taking care of your health. The photos are fabulous, and even shows African Americans, Phillipinos, Latinas, and mixed race women who have almond eyes and how to make them up to the max!"},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"The women in this book are gorgeous! There were quite a few make-up tips that are very useful. The colors that we go with, the way you should line your eyes, etc.... I don't usually buy make-up books because they never seem to have my eye-type or face-type, this book was wonderful in that I could at least relate to most of it. I also liked the fact that the author kept saying that beauty comes in various ways, and it is more attitude than commercial.I also like the way most of the women were made up very naturally. I wish I could have this woman do my makeup for me everyday, or at least a nice makeover, but this book is as close as it will get for me, and I consider it an excellent investment."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about makeup tools, application, skin care and flattering looks. I appreciate this book, as it is a good guide, and represents Asian women of many different backgrounds. The author recognizes that Asian women are very diverse in look, and don't always share the same shape of eyes or skin tone. This book includes ALL Asian women."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I bought the book based on some readers' reviews' saying it featured a lot of Eurasian models. However the majority of the photos are of beautiful Asian women. It does feature some mixed race women that includes Eurasians as well as others...The book is easy to follow and helpful for beginners. I really liked it and it is the only book I have seen that features make up tips for Asians and other ethnic women."},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"So, several people have complained that this book doesn't have &quot;Asian&quot; women - I would disagree! Margaret Kimura covers a wide range of &quot;Asian&quot; women - from full-blooded to mixed-race. This is the first time I've found women that look like me (Filipina-German-American) in any beauty/style publication.This book has lots of great tips - I just wish she had sourced her make-up line, or suggested other brands to try!"},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I am so glad, finally there is a book for Asian women.Unlike the sterotypical image that we usually see on TV or in the movies, Margaret Kimura covers every type of Asian decent.I am one quarter chinese and three quarters of different european backgrounds, however I still see myself as Asian.I am so thrilledI have a guide that really focuses on Asians with different backgrounds. My friend who first purchased this book and who also introduced me to Asian Beauty is not at all Asian.So you see, it's just a great book to have for everyone.FYI...The photos are beautiful too!"},{"Title":"Asian Beauty","review":"My wife had Asian Beauty sitting on our coffee table and the stunning cover compelled me to picked it up. I was initially blown away by the beautiful photographs, but as I began to read the book I discovered a whole new world I'd never visited before. The world of women and more particularily the world of Asian women. Through stories and experiences Margaret Kimura shares the challenges and blessings of being an Asian women in America. As a caucasian male, with an Asin wife I found the information profoundly educational. In addition to the social text Margaret shares some very interesting techniques on applying makeup. My wife found the techniques very exciting and they must be easy to learn since I now help her with a few applications.

It is evident that prior to writing, Jeffrey Archer researched the various setting locations and time periods.

Therefore, it is more likely that this book will appeal to you, unless you find reading about 50-year old lawyers fascinating.You can't talk about Jeffrey Archer without referring to his expertise in writing endings. Unlike most other stories, which end in typical, lovey-dovey fashion, Archer's endings always have unexpected twists, and the ones in \`A Quiver Full of Arrows' are not exceptions. After reading the book's first story, \`The Chinese Statue', I found myself flipping back through the pages to reread it. The ending of this short, yet meaningful story adds a whole new perspective.

The end result from having read this book was that I came out wanting more information, since if one looked at the book on the outside, one would expect a bit more than was delivered.With 304 pages offered, I had hoped for most of that to be centered upon the experiences of the Soviet submarine fleet as it grew into a force that caused the West no shortage of concern. However, the amount of material on the Soviet submarine service was understandably limited, and depended heavily upon only a few people who had significant experience at the end of the Cold War, as opposed to the beginning and turbulent middle. What seemed like the last third comes in the form of an unusually informative analysis of Soviet naval doctrine as seen by Admiral Gorshkov, and a primer on the many individual sumarine varieties that were fielded by the Soviets during the Cold War.There were a few semi-lengthy stories about specific incidents, but it repeated what can be found in many other books, including the far more revealing Blind Man's Bluff. It did not have the detail about the daily lives of the crew and challenges such as was found aboard U.S. subs in Big Red. It did have some discussion on the poor construction of the boats and the political interests outweighing sound employment of these critical naval assets, but it didn't dwell too long there.The value of this book is that is one of very few references on the Soviet submarine service, but it is not authoritative enough that it can be consulted often. Still, it does add to the growing list of available sources on the \\"other side\\" of the Cold War, and thus sheds just a little more insight."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"When I first started on the book I found that it captured my interest right away. The authors had a confidence that came through in the writing that made you believe everything they were saying. The book attempts to tell the story of the Soviet Unions submarine fleet from its start pre World War Two through the cold war. In order to do this they used both written works and a number of interviews with former sailors that where there when the action was going on. For the most part they cover the interesting events like crashes or major exercises or events. They spend time on the Cuban missile crises that provided me with some interesting and before unknown details about what the Soviets were doing with their subs during the event.The problem I had with the book is that that the authors did not good a very good job of covering any aspect of the book. They almost did not touch on the life of a navy man in the USSR or how they got into the subs. They also did a poor job at covering in any detail USSR verses USA cold war action. The events that they covered the most outside of the Cuban missile crises had a distinct USA tint to the reporting. The details of the crashes was not in any sort of order, it seemed like they threw them in here and there. Plus the detail of the crashes was somewhat lacking. They did not do any of the events justice. The book ends with a review of the Krusk event and again they did report some interesting info from the Russian side, but it was diminished by the overall skimming of the story.Overall I thought the book was just average. The writing was good and the authors come across like they know what they are talking about. A number of the stories are interesting, it is just that as a full history it is lacking. I do given them a little slack, given the USSR / Russia's view toward public viewing of military information, the authors probably did the best they could at times. The disappointing thing for me is that I have read other books on some of the events covered in this book and a lot of the missed detail in this book is in the public arena."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"Rising Tide is a fairly decent book about the activites of the Soviets during the Cold War, sort of a &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; from the other side. The author undoubtedly had a significantly more difficult time researching this subject, due in part of continuted secrecy of the Red Navy, the overall breakdown of the Soviet/Russian navy, and the sources which he used (which were primarily oral histories from those Soviet Sailors involved.) In spite of these limitations, the book does provide a fairly interesting insight as to how the Soviet submariners viewed the cold war.However, there are several shortcomings that stand out. First, the organization of the book, at times is appaling. in the first few chapters of the book, the authors often try to make the book more interesting by telling some historical anecdote that distracts from the overall theme of the chapter. For example, the retelling the story of the accident on K-19 falls in the &quot;Uncertain Nuclear Begginning&quot; but probably would have been better off in &quot;Death in Depts&quot; chapter. Furthermore, the author tries to fill in space by providing American and German histories and achievements as comparisons. Unfortunately, many of these histories take way too much time and detract from the Soviet theme of book. Many of these anecdotes easily could have been reorganized and placed into different chapters to give the book a better flow.Additionally, while the stories from the submariners are interesting, the book offers little of the technical history behind the creation of the submarines and the nuclear reactors. I was left wondering if the Soviets had their own version of a Admiral Rickover besides Gorshkov, or how did the American react to abilities of certain Russian subs (particularly the Alfa, which the author stated could run at 45 knots and dive to almost 3,000 feet) Other than the actual accidents that happened at sea, you get little of the technical problems that went into submarine design and building from the Soviet standpoint.Finally, one of my disappointments with the book was the lackof information contained within the two appendix. The first appendix contains a commentary on Admiral Gorshkov's history of the Soviet Navy, but never provides a substantial piece of the original text for the reader to get a sense of Gorshkov's views. The author blasts Gorshkov's revisionist history of how the US NAvy took down the Japanese in WWII, but we never get Gorshkov's own words to make a independant analysis. Providing at least some of the orignal Gorshkov text would have been appropriate. The second appendix provides a comparison of Soviet and American subs thoroughout the cold war. While the information and brief synopsis of each sub is interesting, the list is no where near complete. (The author talks at length about the Alfa sub, yet provides no technical information in the appendix.)"},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"Unlike many of the recent books about cold war submarines, this one isn't a gripping read. Books like &quot;Blind mans bluff&quot;, &quot;October Fury&quot;, &quot;The Silent War&quot;, &quot;Dark Waters&quot;, etc. have pretty much all been excellent. This one never seems to get exciting. Much of the book is devoted to non-Soviet topics (e.g.: a long introduction of the history of submarines and the German U-Boats), or non-Submarine topics (e.g. the very long appendix one which is a &quot;cliffs notes&quot; style commentary on Admiral Gorshkovs view of world Naval history and Russias place in it.)Much of the book features stories already detailed in other books, so if you've read some or all of the books I listed above you've already covered a lot of the book.I was particularly disappointed that the book failed to get into any sort of techinal detail. I saw a TV show with interviews of Soviet sub commanders who talked at length about the problems with the nuclear reactors etc. I was hoping for details about that sort of thing -- e.g. the twin hulls of the typhoon subs, or the methods used to manufacture the alfa's titanium hull, etc. This book pretty much avoided technical details beyond simple explanations like 'engine trouble'.It's not a _bad_ book, it's just not a _great_ book. A lot of the recent books in the genre have been really good and this one disappointed.The biggest problem is that just as something might start to get exciting the story ends and switches to a different story. The &quot;Wet Blanket Effect&quot;. Instead of a book that is hard to put down, it turned into a &quot;must read to get my $26 worth out of it&quot;."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"There have been quite a few books in recent years based upon first-person accounts of submarine operations during the Cold War. These include several books by retired US Navy Captain Peter Huchthausen (Hostile Waters, October Fury, K-19), several books on the Kursk (A Time to Die is excellent), and Dark Waters, on the NR-1 research submarine. Of course the book that kicked it all off is the excellent Blind Man's Bluff. One thing to keep in mind for all of these books is that for the most part they are based upon interviews, not documents, which are still classified. The problem with writing history based upon interviews is that people remember things the way that they want to remember them, not necessarily the way that they really happened. And memories can fail. So these books are not truly history, but memoirs.Rising Tide was written by Gary Weir and Walter J. Boyne. Weir is a professional historian for the US Navy and has written about the SOSUS underwater listening array. Boyne is a professional aviation writer, and I suspect that Weir did most of the research and writing and Boyne may have polished it up.Despite the fact that Weir is a historian, not a journalist or retired naval officer, the book is not as historically grounded or researched as I would have preferred. It is based primarily on interviews and I found the footnotes to be superficial. While this will not bother most readers, I find that it makes it much harder to look for further information on things mentioned in the books, and it makes it harder to totally trust the information that is provided. We have no way to confirm the stories in the book. (More on this in a moment.)Rising Tide starts out a little slower than some of Huchthausen's books, and initially re-covers much of the same territory--the plight of the K-19, Soviet submarine operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a succession of submarine accidents. One problem with all of these books is that because they are often filled with \\"thrilling stories of the sea\\" rather than recounts of exactly what the submarines accomplished, it starts to seem as if submarine operations were nothing but daring adventures and near-fatal accidents, rather than military missions that served a clear purpose. The US Navy's submarine service likes to brag that it never suffers accidents, but when one picks up these books it looks like submarines were in constant danger of sinking. Clearly this form of storytelling can leave a false impression of what really happened.Because Weir interviewed many of the same people that Huchthausen did, the stories and perspectives are largely the same, and the reader who has already read those other books will not learn anything new in these sections. There are some differences of interpretation in some cases, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I wish that the authors had specifically responded to them. Why not clearly identify where these books disagree on details? In some cases these are important. For instance, I have seen two different accounts of the near-use of an atomic torpedo during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I would have preferred if Weir had tried to settle the dispute.Another problem with interview-based history is that the people that you interview always come across as brave and smart and noble, whereas the people you don't often look worse. That is true here--several of the commanders are portrayed as \\"experienced\\" and \\"brave.\\" But the now-dead people that they worked for or disagreed with are portrayed as drunks or incompetent. It is important to keep in mind that we are only seeing one side of the story here, and that people who look badly in these stories often did not get the chance to speak.About a third to halfway through the book Weir and Boyne start covering entirely new ground that has not been discussed in previous submarine books, such as a couple of bold multi-boat intelligence operations that the Soviets engaged in during the 1970s and 1980s. There are even photos of some American equipment recovered by the Soviets in 1970, proving that they were successful. The authors make a few comments that are quite intriguing, such as the claim that the Americans with their superior technology could be sneaky and stealthy all of the time, whereas the Soviets had to respond in an entirely different manner, such as brute force intelligence collection.Unfortunately, what the book lacks, however, is the American side of this. It would have been fascinating to see what the Americans thought the Soviet submarines were doing during these periods. But except for a few paragraphs about a US Navy officer doing this or that, we get none of that contrast. (As an aside: Huchthausen attempted to do this in October Fury, even though he is much more of an memoirist than a historian. So October Fury tends to be more balanced and more engaging on the subject of Soviet submarine operations during the Missile Crisis.)One other thing that is missing in Rising Tide are solid American testimonials as to how much better Soviet submarines got during the 1980s. We are told, based on Soviet claims, that the Victor II and III submarines were much better than their predecessors, and even rivaled American submarines. But there is no mention of the Toshiba propeller milling machine scandal, or other Soviet quieting efforts. Comments from long-serving American commanders about how much the Soviets improved over the decades would have been nice.The introduction includes an interesting comment that Soviet society was so brutal that people began to devalue their own lives. They developed a kind of fatalistic approach to their lives and work. This theme is not explicitly revisited again in the book, although the many Soviet submarine accidents seem to support it. It's an intriguing theory that deserves more attention. Finally, the book makes the now-familiar comparison of submarine operations to spaceflight. (Dark Waters did this, so did Blind Man's Bluff--it is now a cliche of submarine books.) Somebody should really explore this analogy better to question its validity.All in all, this is an enjoyable book with some intriguing ideas and new research. The sections on intelligence collection are the most unique and interesting in my mind. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"The concept was great. The execution leaves a little to be desired. It is obvious that Mr. Weir is an apologists for the Soviet Navy and tends to view much of what the submarine force did as nothing short of god-like, while the American effort was lacking and far behind the Soviets. Mr. Weir's pronouncement that Soviet subs habitually tracked American Ohio Class SSBNs is so ludicrious that it is beyond flawed research. The Ohio class SSBN has never been successfully tracked by an foreign submarine force and probably never will be. Mr. Weir also states that Soviet ICBMs were more accurate that the American versions is also absurd. Data released after the Cold War ended, as well as data collected during tests of the Soviet missles conclusively proves that the Soviet missiles were very inaccurate as well as had the annoying tendency to explode when fueled prior to launch. It seems that Mr. Weir was far more gullible when it came to what the Soviet submarine commanders had to tell him. I guess he didn't bother to check his facts, assuming that the Soviets would never exaggerate. It's too bad, really. The stories told in the book concerning the more personal aspects of the numerous mishaps of Soviet nuclear boats and the drive to produce a vital, powerful submarine force is well worth reading. Just don't beliece everything you read."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"Interesting. Obviously the author became good friends with some Russian submariners, and of course, that is the inside story. So, for that reason, especially if you find it on the $3.33/copy bargain shelf (as I did), do buy it. There will probably never be another book published in the West, based on such interviews.Inaccurate. Opinions of former Soviet submariners, no matter how \\"nice\\" or enthusiastic they are, should not be taken as a fact, especially when numerous other sources contradict them. So, as a source of \\"oral history\\", it is a great book ... but should be taken with a grain of salt. Other reviewers before me went into the details...Can't spell... The mis-spellings are there on almost every page, whether related to a place name, a submarine type, or an acronym. Just a small example, so I don't waste the reader's time by the hundreds of errors: The so-called GIUK Gap is an important place in the history of Cold War submarine operations (and even today0. It refers to the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap (two relatively narrow sea passages), well guarded by Western anti-submarine forces. The abbreviation, as \\"GIUK\\" makes geographic sense, but \\"GUIK\\" does not. Yet, the authors have both on the same page, referring to the same place. Many of the mis-spellings may be low-cost type setting errors, but even so...some are definitely not.Recommendation: buy it if you can find it on the bargain rack..."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"Readers who demand a complete and meticulous history of Soviet submarine warfare should join the CIA. For the rest of us who cannot or will not join the CIA, Rising Tide comes as close as possible to describing the Soviet sub program -- the maneuvers of her vessels, conflicts with American boats, strategies, technologies, and the political tit-for-tat that accompanied it all. As a bonus, Rising Tide sports an appendix containing an itemization of Soviet boats replete with tonnage, diving depth, length and special features.Particularly heartbreaking was the account of the nuclearization of the Soviet navy, her transition to reactor power. For example, the Soviets inserted two reactors into most boats -- before they were fully developed. The result was repeated volunteer suicide missions by crew members to turn off overheating reactor cores and leaking cooling pipes.Also interesting is the account of Soviet technological progress in shipbuilding. From early diesel-powered jalopies, the Soviets managed to produce, in 1977 (initial design, 1957), a reactor-powered Alfa-class boat, made entirely of Titanium, that could dive to 800m at 40 knots. The boats were all still intolerably hot and sweaty in warmer climates, until Typhoon and Akula class boats appeared with warheads and nuclear-armed torpedoes.Beyond the edifying history, however, Rising Tide breaks down the last Cold War barriers of mistrust and ignorance, finally documenting the heroism and ingenuity of honest sailors who, trapped by a history never in their control, fought steadfastly for a dying and unworthy ideology."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"This book seems to try to cover all aspects of the submarine cold war, without a lot of detail on any particular subject. I found the coverage of the Cuban crisis particularly interesting, but somehow felt as though I had to read between the lines, which was true with all the other subjects covered.All in all, an intersting book, but not in the league of Blind Man's Bluff."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"This is the first real sub book I have read. The historical appendix is really good covering The Russian Navy. There are many facts in here that are amazing to someone new to the genre. This may not be the best book, but it is worth a reading. The info on the Kursk and K-19 were informative and cleared out all the nonsense you get from Hollywood movies. Very informative about Soviet Naval Culture."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"I really wanted to give this 3.5 stars but because I can't I've gone for four stars as anyone with an interest in submarines and/or the Cold War really should read this book. Based around the potted memoirs of several Russian submarine officers, the authors offer an alternative view to books such as the excellent Blind Man's Bluff. Considering what the Russian, sorry, Soviet submariners had to deal with in terms of politics within and beyond the Navy, shoddy, passing-the-buck workmanship (in constructing and repairing the boats) and a general technological lag behind their Western counterparts, what they achieved needs to be more widely known. This book goes some way toward doing this.However, I have to admit that I did find myself questioning some of the claims made by the submariners. There was no major argument against their claims and they were largely taken as gospel. Fair enough, I suppose, considering this is a book revealing the Cold War exploits of the \\"evil empire\\". A major criticism I did have was that Appendix 2, detailing specifications of various Soviet and US submarines, neglected to list three of the classes that featured heavily throughout the book - the Soviet \\"Alfa\\" class and US \\"Los Angeles\\" and \\"Sturgeon\\" classes. I found these omissions surprising considering the types' role in the Cold War battles under the sea. Small potatoes really as these specifications can be readily found elsewhere. It just seemed odd not to see them there!Appendix 1, however, is an excellent potted history of the Russian/Soviet Navy. So, although there's a few things that might get the reader thinking \\"Hang on, what about...\\", this book goes some of the way to filling the hole in learning about what the other side did during the Cold War. Brave men one and all those who sail beneath the ocean."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in submarines. It concentrates on the USSR submarine fleet. This book has many things going for it. It contains a very good background history of the Russian/ USSR navy. It put many historical news items that one may have only heard in piecemeal fashion, in retrospect, such as the various disabled smouldering USSR subs that literally popped-up. All in all, I thought this book provided invaluable new information, (at least new to this reader) than has been previously available. The fact that the Glomar Explorer operation actually succeeded in recovering a USSR submarine codebook, a little more knowledge can be gleaned from this book about the US Navy's underwater listening system SOSUS , some espionage and tactical information along with the damage the Ames and Walker spy intrigues actually cost the United States in day to day deployment terms. The book's strong point is that it stresses the fact that the USSR put pressure to bear on getting results from its submarine fleet, but treated it as a poor relation to the overall USSR military budget. Last in line for funding, maintenance and service. Unsuccessful patrols would shorten an officer's naval career. Yet the history shows that poor quality construction and safety procedures, maintenance and supply were the root cause of most of the failures. The USSR sailors fielded crews subjected to higher risks, therby effecting greater sacrifices, sometimes the ultimate sacrifice was required to save the boat and crew. The USSR's submarine fleet was actually facing a two front war, One front, the West from the Cold War and a steady technological challenge, the second front, the USSR military, fielding a fleet where the crew was subjected to substandard conditons of safety and a severe lack of supplies.I would also recommend reading the book's appendix where Gorshkov (the USSR's Rickover) explains Russia's and the USSR's naval history in a socialistically pleasing way. I thought this book was a real eye-opener, It is evident the authors did their research, occasionally the material overlaps with some repetitions, but in relation to the amount of information provided it really remains a spellbinding read."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"I should say at the outset that I'm a big fan of naval historian Gary Weir. His previous books on the technology and politics of building US submarines are excellent. I therefore went into this book with great expectations, which were not completely met. This book examines the Cold War years from the perspective of Russian submarines and submariners. The book makes the case that Admiral Sergei Gorshkov was undoubtedly aware of the severe shortcomings in the early Soviet nuclear submarines and the lack of effective training and safety. Yet, he exposed numerous seaman to unnecessary danger and health consequences. Perhaps the most stunning revelation is political. Authority for the use of nuclear torpedoes and nuclear missiles was placed in the hands of individual submarine commanders. When asked about the ground rules for the use of a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban Missile crisis, one captain was told by Flag Officers, \\" Once your face has been slapped, don't let them hit your face again\\". This vague, cryptic warning effectively shifted responsibility for weapons use onto the captain's shoulders.The book examines plans laid by Stalin for a large Navy, and the subsequent evolution of the Soviet submarine force post WWII. Kruschchev's shift to emphasize submarines over large capital ships led to an expansion of the sub building program. The early Soviet nuclear submarines and the defects and accidents that plagued them are covered. Soviet trailing and intelligence operations are described, as is the succeeding generations of Soviet nuclear submarines. A final chapter offers insights into the recent Kursk accident. Overall, a very good book, but it could have stood some careful proofreading. As one of several examples, on one page in an interview of a Soviet officer, the Alfa is described as able \\"to dive as deeply as 2,460 feet before reaching its \\"crush depth\\"\\". Four pages later, \\"it could dive very quickly to nearly 3000 feet...\\". A number of small technical errors of this sort mar the narrative. Additionally, other sources now available that do not support these claims. In fact, the Alfa was far from the \\"supersub\\" feared by the US Navy, and information obtained during the 1990's indicates the submarine had a more limited diving depth (less than 2000 ft) and powerplant problems. Weir & Boyne may have relied a bit too much on the \\"sea stories\\" of their interviewees.Rising Tide is overall a \\"good read\\", but not in the same class with other Weir books. His two US submarine technical history books \\"Building American Submarines 1914-1940\\" and \\"Forged in War\\" are superior to this effort."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"The book is adequately researched. The interviews with former Soviet military personnel and information regarding collisions are interesting. Much of the information about submarine activity has already been published. The authors do a bit of hand-wringing and depart from the subject in the epilogue when they attempt to draw parallels between the Kurst and space shuttle disasters and throw in a call for saving the oceans from pollution. They should have saved that for NPR."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"The authors address a most interesting and worthy topic and should be applauded for seeking out Russian sources. However, their lack of critical review of what the interviewees said together with a failure to check other cited facts degrades the worth of the book as a contribution to the historical record. It is unfortunate that the basic reader unknowingly will walk away having been mis-informed as to the reality of some significant events.I am not surprised that there are a large number of second-hand editions available.Contrary to some introductory words, there is now a wealth of literature available on many aspects of Soviet naval history. True, most of this literature is in Russian. But, for professional historians, of which certainly Mr. Weir is one, there are both resources to overcome the language barrier and opportunities to consult with knowledgable experts. Apparently no effort was undertaken to use either since the book contains over three dozen factual errors.Autobiographies are prone to self-promoting errors and misstatements. However, interviews with ostensible eye-witnesses (indirect biographical information) provide an opportunity for more objective and critical cross-checking of fact and, at least, critical contextual commentary on the part of authors who use such interviews. In this book the statements of the interviewees appear to have been taken as indisputable fact and not subjected to any critical review or evaluation."},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"Very good book giving the side of the Soviet \\"Silent Service\\" during the cold war.

I picked up and went straight to the counter. And I was not dissappointed. It gives you the perspective of the Cold War that not many people have seen. The Russians had been trying to develop a submarine fleet that could counter the United States and wanted a global prescense. This book gives you the details from when Stalin was dreaming of this to the sinking of the Kursk in 2000. It gives the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the first testing of a Russian SSBN, the multiple journeys to the North Pole and the espionage conducted by the Soviet Union's submarines.

I can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War","review":"very interesting book.

For one thing, the book is very short and as other critics have mentioned, there wasn't enough space for everything as it is. He can only concentrate on something, and in this case he decided to go for what the front-line Captains had to say.Another factor is that the testimony could not afford to be further double-crossed. The book's primary targets are people who have been indoctrinated by Tom Clancy (whose reach is worldwide) and American submariner community into believing American sub invulnerability. If he allows the undercut, he might as well not write the book because 99% of the readership will just believe the American version.A very good example of why NOT undercut is in Nathan Alexander's review. This is how most of the readership was probably indoctrinated. No need to increase the indoctrination depth further, methinks.Objectively, are the Americans the best sources? The book reveals (in the few undercuts it allowed in the endnotes) that Soviet Captains make computations assuming that American sonar is at LEAST equal to theirs, while American captains go from the assumption they have a vast superiority. The latter assumption will likely lead to a large number of false negatives in guessing whether the Soviets counterdetected them - interpretations which will be enshrined in reports (and later books) and become \\"fact\\", which enhance this assumption...cycle repeats. This whole problem is so severe even Tom Clancy decided to write about it obliquely in the Sum of All Fears (see my review of that too).As for the spelling mistakes, must say they don't bother me much."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"I found this book to be more or less devoid of useful or interesting material, with two exceptions. I liked some of the feats presented in the book and I liked the section on creating immortals. The rest of the book was fluff, useless, a waste of space. The book tries to explain goodness to players, all of which know what it means to be good anyway. It presents a whole mess of groupings of deities which anyone could make up on their own, which is basically the way Wizards of the coast present everything divine. Instead of giving 7000 examples of divine beings, why not give us a book about how to build them, details of how divine beings interact, create, and how they fit into the cosmos? Anyone DM truly worth his salt makes all his own stuff up anyway rather than using the junk in books like this and the Manual of the Planes. Spend money on something else like Heroes of Battle, a much better book and more useable."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"In my opinion, this is an un-needed book. Why does a DM need a book full of \\"monsters\\" that are vastly powerful GOOD beings. In the vast majority of campaigns, the players are good, fighting the forces of evil. With the monsters in this book, the players won't have much to do except watch the battle. This brings up a minor complaint about D&D that I've had since the game first came out...why do the developers always give a slight power edge to good? Wouldn't it make more sense to give a slight power edge to evil, since that's what the players will be fighting against. Take dragons for example. The most powerful good dragon (gold) is a bit more powerful than the most powerful evil dragon (red). All this leads to is the DM having to come up with some reasoning why evil dragons outnumber good dragons, like in Dragonlance Chronicles with the abduction of the dragon eggs. Well, enough rambling off topic. Unless you're DMing a high level evil group, give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"The purpose of D & D, at the start, was to crawl through dungeons while killing monsters and finding nifty pieces of equipment. The game's come a long way since then, with hundreds of core book and supplements adding layer after layer of moral complexity to the fantasy world.Demons and devils were defined. Evil was given its own spells, magic items and races. The good guys, for there part, had morally limited and easily stereotyped paladins and the occasionally pure-hearted cleric. That was it. There was no real reason for a fighter, rogue or wizard to be any more good than their alignment description read.The Book of Exalted Deeds changes all that. Good has been given power, real power, and is now just as capable as evil of showering benefits on its devotees - though at no less cost to those devotees.This book opens with a discussion of the motives of good. What acts are good, which are not, and the exceptions to the rules. It's never a problem for me, but this section would be quite handy for those DMs and players who have trouble figuring just what a character's alignment means and practice.Also included is the idea of being \\"exalted.\\" This isn't being on a moral high-horse or anything of the sort, it's simply the idea that just as some villains can be despicable beyond human comprehension, so can heroes be righteous.Next we get to the meat and drink of the book: the new stuff. The magic items are adequate, not much more. There's only so many new adjectives you can add onto the beginning of item names, and only so many powers you can give, but at the very least this book includes special enhancements that directly counter enhancements from the dreaded Book of Vile Darkness.The same goes for feats and spells, really, although some completely new concepts are also entertained.The book really comes into its own with the prestige classes, monsters and descriptions of greater creatures of good. In these sections, you're given some specific statistics, but you're also given a really good guideline for just how you can create your own special and sacred servants of the eladrin, the angels and the guardinals. Various otherworldly and mortal servants of the three great bastions of good are described, including a lot of the eladrin that were missing from previous supplements. The tulani and the firre were particularly appreciated.The greater creatures of good, the angels, the high eladrin, the greatest of the guardinals, are described in detail, with thorough descriptions. Given their tremendous power, I'm a little surprised that they weren't generated via Deities and Demigods, but that's a minor quibble.What I liked best about this book is that, as opposed to the majority of WotC's other products, this book appears to be cleanly edited, neatly presented and well-organized. I'm not an organization freak in my waking life, but when it comes to reference supplements, I really appreciate having everything laid out in plain, simple order, particularly when it's information that's useful."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Plato once said that we should never trust anyone who advocates that we should avoid anything but evil and pursue anything but goodness. And Plato was right.This book is fantastic and definitely worth buying for several reasons:1. It is a worthwhile counterpart to the Book of Vile Darkness. For a game which prides itself on being fair and balanced in all things, it would naturally be blatantly unbalanced in favor of evil if there were not such counterpart.2. The new feats and prestige classes are definitely worthy of those of us who prefer to play with good-aligned parties and characters. I'll expand on that below.3. There are those idealistic, old-fashioned fools like me still in existence who believe that for a game like D&D;, which is based on Lord of the Rings, it is not only more appropriate but also more fun to play with a view to some sort of noble goal to destroy evil. Such naive souls like myself have always believed that it is far more fun and exciting to kill the dragon and save the damsel than the other way around.I'm not terribly big on prestige classes. However, the ones described in this book are terrific - very balanced and eminently playable. Although I haven't actually played a campaign with this text (yet), I can see how it would be supremely fun to do. The prestige classes are very powerful: Vassal of Bahamut (a de facto dragon-slaying class), the Sword of Righteousness (a prestige class for those who, like me, don't want to deviate from their regular character class for many levels but would like some bonus feats), and, my personal favorite, the Fist of Raziel for Paladins who wish to eschew their undead turning and special mount privileges for bonuses to their smiting ability. Ever hear of a lawful good assassin? There's now a special order of ex-rogues and assassins who have converted and have now formed a lawful good society of spies and stealthy killers of evil. Harpers, eat your heart out. There are more, of course; this is only a sample. But for those of us who live to play good-aligned Paladins and Clerics, this book is a ray of hope in an often evil-glorifying game.But don't think for a moment that only Paladins and Clerics can benefit from this text. On the contrary, there are classes designed specifically for good-aligned Druids, Fighters, Rangers, Sorcerers and Bards. There is a prestige class only for Elves & Half-Elves. There's even a class only for female characters. But the main requirement for any of these classes is that the character be of good alignment. Not non-evil. Good.If I have any complaint at all it's that there isn't much in the book for Barbarians and Wizards. But even so, Barbarians may wish to join one of the nature-oriented prestige classes designed primarily for Rangers or Druids. And Wizards will enjoy the new spells and metamagic feats available to them. So there truly is something for everyone.I myself have played Paladins for years. And I'm in love with the 3.5E Paladin. But throughout many of the campaigns I've played and players I've encountered, I've often seen Paladins, good-aligned Clerics, and even the concept of goodness and law scoffed at and ridiculed. The overall feeling of many gamers is that Paladins are nothing but arrogant do-gooders whose very moral alignment is opposed to having any fun, obtaining any amount of treasure, or getting any experience points. (And that's odd since no one seems to be going around calling Obi-Wan Kenobi or Aragorn from LotR arrogant do-gooders or whimps.) Such players prefer to power-game a chaotic neutral dual-classed half-orc barbarian-fighter or something which will enhance their freedom and advancement. And that may very well work. But, again, this game was based on LotR, and I prefer to see it in those terms. And I play it in those terms. I don't think that rescuing a red dragon and slashing the throat of the damsel as enhancing the advancement of my character, no matter how much money or experience points are involved.So for those of us who prefer to capture the original vision of the game, this book goes a very long way. Lawful good is now something to be revered - and even feared. Law and goodness are vindicated in this tome. Paladins, and the many Paladin orders listed in this book, are not whimps - they're superlative hunters and destroyers - every bit as powerful and fun as any Fighter or Barbarian, and far more so if battling evil-aligned creatures. Clerics are not just healers - they can be other-worldly mystics who are immune to virtually everything or who are fearsome warriors like their Paladin counterparts. This is almost redemptive in a game which has become, sadly, dominated by the \\"evil is freedom\\" mentality of many of the game-makers and players over the past 20+ years.So, yes, law and goodness are now not just in keeping with the original idea of the game, but are also fun and extremely powerful. And all of us who love playing Paladins, Clerics or any other good-aligned character but who felt inferior and who were the brunt of many a joke over the past several years, will now be the ones who are accepted and sought after. And this is a welcome change for a game whose original purpose is to do good and avoid evil."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Without making fun of religion or making it trivial, this book actually makes it possible to play someone with real virtue in a D20 game. I've had a pacifist cleric order in my game for some time, but no one would ever consider playing one - with the details in this book, they actually become balanced. The new creatures included are much appreciated by my current group, as most of them are noted as being able to be summoned by various existing spells - which makes my existing characters more versatile, even without the prestige classes.I would have liked to have seen a sample adventure, to help make some of the ideas presented more real and more easy to work into a D20 game, but that's a nice to have.I would also have liked to have seen more interaction with the Epic book. I considered this a fairly major flaw, in that most of the ideas and scope presented would work well with epic characters. It may be difficult to figure out the progressions for the characters here, and some of the feats cry out for epic versions. Hopefully, Hasbro will address this with web enhancements later."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Over all I liked this book, I'd been waiting for it since I bought the Book of Vile Darkness when it first came out. I had very little problem thinking of truly vile villains for my campaigns and the Book of Vile Darkness simply served to give me some new ideas and such for my villains.The problem I had was giving my players good aligned help, spells, items, and prestige classes. There is really very little in the way of what the Book of Exalted Deeds has to offer in products designed for DMs. So as soon as it became available I bought it. The book really came through.My two biggest complaints are the gender bias in the prestige class section, and the practical uselessness of the feats in most campaigns.There are two prestige classes in this book that require your character to be female to join. There are, however, no prestige classes in any book I own or have ever read that require a person to be male, much less two. While I am male myself, I was not the only one who read it who was surprised. One of the girls that plays with my group flipped through it twice and asked, &quot;Where are the guy prestige classes?&quot;. Although a great number of the illustrations depicted men, there was no male gender requirement anywhere. All the WoTC products I own are fairly gender neutral, but I have to say this book was a pretty far cry from that. They could have so easily made a companion class to those particular classes and solved the problem.As far as feats go, don't buy this book for them. Unless you design a campaign around the book and it's counterpart, they're pretty much useless to practical minded players. One of my players did take the vow of poverty which is pretty cool and encourages better roleplaying.Like the Book of Vile Darkness there are precious few really useful magic items, so that's not a good reason to buy this book either.The biggest advantage this book has, and the reason I gave it four stars is the monsters portion of the book. This book has singlehandedly managed to fill the huge gaping void in what good characters can summon. With the critters in this book your good aligned spellcasters no longer have to be limited to summoning &quot;celestial&quot; animals until they get Summon Monster III or IV. The Celestials in this book are incredibly well written. The NPC's are even better. Those two points make the rather large price tag worth it.The only thing it really misses, is a good counterpart to the imp and quasit for familiars."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"I was delighted when I first heard about this book. I'd been peeved for some time by the focus on evil presented by the Book of Vile Darkness as being somewhat unequilateral. This book is, in essence, a guide to playing good characters. Not just run-of-the-mill good characters, but for those who really want to get INTO playing a truly good character, right along with all of its consequences and dilemmas. It's hardly easy or simple, but definitely interesting, and this book provides some great food for thought on such characters, as well as a handful of really nifty and fairly original prestige classes. However, apparently, there are some balance issues, as a few of the new classes and feats are rather disproportinately powerful (though a careful DM can balance these out with the alignment requirements and making sure that these prestige classes in particular are stricter about the characters being good). This book does Dungeons &amp; Dragons the deep service of demonstrating that goodness is neither laughable, trivial, feeble, or misguided. It is a powerful force unto itself that is as every bit as real, potent, and meaningful as any other sort of power. This is the type of heroism that I feel this game was really made for, and the classes and feats herein are perfectly suited for characters who have reached epic levels of both moral development and power.In a nutshell: Nice guys only finish last because it takes them a little bit longer to wind up to deal the deathblow."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Finally, we have something to stick in the Demon Princes' craw.The Book of Exalted Deeds (commonly acronymed BoED) is the counterpart to the Book of Vile Darkness. Named after a nifty artifact in the game, this greatly-welcomed tome brings you the ability to play, well, &quot;goody little two-shoes!&quot;The book is set up rather like Book of Vile Darkness, with sections I'll title Discussion, Stuff, Feats, Prestige Classes, Magic Stuff, Big Huge Celestials, and (Mostly) Friendly Monsters.The Discussion section talks about how being Good (not good) works, and how it can expand your enjoyment of the game. This includes ethics and examples of heroic types. Stuff includes relics, Ravages and Afflictions (Evil-targeted poisons and diseases), and some alternate rules, including the explanations for the Vow of Poverty, Vow of Nonviolence, and Words of Creation feats.Speaking of feats, there are quite a few here, some generally useful and then one or two per class. There really need to be more, for reasons I'll get to in a second. This has some quite nifty things, like Sacred Strike (sneak attacks rise from xd6 to xd8 versus evil creatures) and Sanctify Martial Strike (gives extra damage against evil creatures, and allows your weapon to breach n/good damage reduction). These are often necessary to the Prestige Classes, many of which are built on one or two of these feats as prerequisites. I rather liked the Slayer of Domiel (a LG assassin-type...no, really), the Initiate of Pistis Sophia (Exalted monk), and the Fist of Raziel (uber-smiting paladin-cleric).The Magic Stuff includes quite a few new spells and domains, though some are revised (like Glory). This book introduces the Sanctified spell, which has somewhat greater effects for its slot, but at the cost of some sacrifice from the character (usually ability damage or XP). There are nifty new magic items, which can be a tad problematic; one, the Retributive Amulet, reduces damage by half and returns that half to the attacker as damage, which, at 56,000 gp, is a bit cheap for the effect. However, these are generally nice items.(Re-)Introduced here are the Higher Celestials, the Good counterparts to the Archdevils and Demon Princes. You probably won't ever see them, and they don't accept worshippers, but they do have small followings (sort of like saints in the Church). Also included are quite a few new and revised celestials, most of whom appeared last in the Planescape setting, like the Hollyphant!On the whole, I enjoyed the heck out of this. There are a few things that could make it better, like more Exalted feats; only having one or two per class means that you will, eventually, run out if you take the Vow of Poverty feat (which grants bonus Exalted feats every other level). Feat chains built for each class would be very nice, indeed; some higher-level ones would be most welcome, especially if they supported multiclassing in their requirements."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"In my opinion this is by far the best book that has yet been released for the D&amp;D 3.5 series. As a companion piece to the Book of Vile Darkness it provides numerous new character options that allow players to take their good aligned characters and turn them into Exalted characters. This book does a fantastic job of introducing new and powerful abilities without upsetting game balance becuase the system is designed so that the new feats, prestige classes, and templates (while powerful) are also easily lost if the character strays from the &quot;straight and narrow&quot;. If you enjoy playing Paladins, Righteous Clerics, Smiter-of-Evil type characters then this book has everything you could ever hope for. This book does for players what the Book of Vile Darkness did for DM's...put a highly focused, motivated character into the forefront of the power curve. An excellent book and a necessity to groups that like the &quot;save the world&quot; style games."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"If a Paladin lies, he forsakes his Deity-granted powers....or does he? For quite a while, the essence of good and evil have been fairly black and white topics in the D&D; world, (Paladins=good; Orcs=bad; Undead=bad; but fun; etc.) and, ironically, this tome serves to even further polarize that gap, but it does so with such amazing flourishes of depth and detail that it actually makes the Good vs. Evil concept that much clearer.I enjoyed this book beyond a role-playing standpoint; I read through each issue, topic by topic (lying, killing, cheating), all the while my internal monologue jogging along with the pages, challenging my long-held ideas of a variety of concepts of goodness. That is true art, and it elevates the game to a level only scratched at by previous attempts. Bravo.One side note here: An earlier writer gave poor marks for the books \\"Heavy bias towards homosexuality.\\" This is completely off base. While I would find it refreshing to see material that tackled the issue head-on, the wording the writer objects to, wherein one creature is \\"devoted to\\" or \\"in all ways connected to\\" a being of the same sex in no way implies homosexuality. It simply invokes a language of a time where beings were beyond petty paranoia of sexuality and formed strong bonds of friendship regardless of sex.Obviously, that reviewer has a few issues."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Finally a book of goodies for those of us who prefer to play true heroes. Book of Exalted Deeds has to be the deffinative book for play Good aligned charactes in D&D/D20. I don't mean just Paladins and certain Clerics, there is something for all D&D style players who want to traverse the moral high road. Their term for truly Good characters is a little pretencious calling them Exalted, but for who choose the \\"straight and narrow path\\" as they put it, there are rewards a plenty. New feats, prestige classes, magic and monsters are found here as well as discussions on how to play a Good Guy/Girl. Robin Hood on par with King Arthur in Exalted status? According to this they both can be. The straight and narrow path is a little broader than one might imagine but while in some cases there is a lot of breathing room for the forces of Light there are perils. This book has a warning label for mature content and in some cases themes that truly require a bit of maturity from the reader. It is also meant to be used in conjunction with the Book of Vile Darkness. Having purchased both books I must heartily concur with this. Book of Exalted Deeds and Book of Vile Darkness are two extremes of the D&D world. Even if you don't use the defaul setting of Greyhawk these two books are meant to be used in the same campaign as a way of differentiating between the Dark and the Light and in this they do their job quite well. Some of the material is drawn from real world faiths which some may find disturbing. But this is also a distinction of the maturity this and its companion volume not just simply require but demand of its reader. Challenge yourself; challenge your world and get this book. And if you don't have Book of Vile Darkness, get that too."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Continuing their trend of good and bad material, this one definitely hits the mark as a winner. A companion book to Vile Darkness, Exalted Deeds shows gamers how to portray the heights of good and righteousness in the face of evil. There's not much to add that other reviewers haven't already covered. One missed element is the outstanding artwork. The angels are portrayed as firesword-wielding instruments of the gods, burning with divine might. Avatars and immortals clash on vivid fields, and the dark things of the universe paw closer like hungry tigers.Some of the artwork contains nudity, which is another reason for the mature rating, but it is nothing gratuitous or pornographic. Overall, the book is a unique one among the annals of roleplaying material, if not for the content, then surely for its combination of stunning full color art.

A second person complained that the vow of poverty was too strong on a monk (it's not.)

People complain that book of exalted deeds is a lesser version of the Book of Vile Darkness. This simply isn't the case. This book is excellent for the following reasons:- There's never really been an issue with being evil in the D&D; universe. It's said that players of the game will end up chaotic evil no matter what they say they are for a reason. Most magic is lethal, spells take over the minds of others, etc. etc. The book of exalted deeds helps even out the playing field for those who wish to be good. feats that provide nonlethal alternatives are provided, techniques to provide better healers are given, and players are divinely favored for choosing to honor vows.I'm not sure what else there is to say.

There were several prestige classes and almost all of them were very good. Most of them are geared toward the paladin or cleric but there were also some for all of the other classes.They also do a good job of defining the good alignments and giving examples of what actions are and are not good.The monster section covers the Eldarin, celestials, etc. which can be used either to combat an evil party or be used for the planar ally spell.

BOVD contains a few interesting spells, a handful of great creatures and demon lords, a bland assortment of feats and prestige classes, and a few side-rules that you might have enjoyed if you need them. The BOED has a very similar spread of content. The quasi-dieties and creatures add a great deal of detail to angels and celestials of many types, and the prestige classes in BOED are fantastic. However, the feats and exalted concept are difficult to work into many games.I recommend the Book of Vile Darkness first, and if you enjoy it enough, the Book of Exalted Deeds helps to fill a niche that balances the table on both ends of the spectrum."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"Well, with the Book of Vile Darkness in my hot little hands, I thought to myself &quot;Can life get any sweeter?&quot; I now had the power to creat terrifying, disgusting, insidious villains.

The Exalted feats section suddenly had me dreaming up all sorts of uber-heroes, ranging from the Sword of Righteousness to the Apostle of Peace (both of which are amazing prestige classes). I read a review on Amazon.com that mentions reference to homosexuality and bisexuality. This is simply not true! There are no such references in this book.

So take this with a grain of salt, but I thought it such a poor value that I retured it immediately.The book has a lot of new classes, most of which seem best adapted to NPCs. It has a lot of new &quot;monsters&quot; - angels of the heavens which seem usable only in very narrow, particular campaigns with high level good characters (or evil I suppose). And everything else was pretty lame. The descriptions of what was good and what wasn't; and the ideas surround the Chaotic Good versus Lawful Good is, as D&amp;D is always, simplistic and relativistic; but also useless in a supplement as it is so subjective. The feats were dumb, the items and relic stuff felt like filler, and there wasn't enough focus on how good combats evil and how good campaigns are run or story ideas.In short, I felt like it was an interesting book that would have made a great paperback for $11, but certainly not this full hardback $30 book."},{"Title":"Book of Exalted Deeds (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"This book is mostly excellent -- I gave it a three star rating on the basis of two facts: 1. the list price of $32.95 is a bit steep for a book that's barely thicker than one of WOTC's D&D paperbacks like Masters of the Wild or Tome & Blood; 2. I dislike seeing so many references to bisexuality and homosexuality in one book; I accept that this can be brought up in a book labeled 'for mature audiences', but WOTC seems to be trying to ram these concepts down the throats of their purchasers -- half of the celestials seem to be 'passionately devoted to' or 'attending to the desires of' or 'a consort of' someone of the same sex; in the interests of balance, if they were going to have relationships mentioned in the book (which, in itself, I don't object to at all) they might have had at least one regular marriage between creatures of the opposite sex, but there isn't ONE. Other than these two quibbles, the book is excellent. There are a large number of new spells for the 'good guys' -- I was especially surprised by the quality of these, many of them are very innovative. \\"Phoenix Fire\\" for example, which blasts evil creatures with immense quantities of damage -- of course, part of the spell's components is the death of the caster :) who is resurrected immediately at one level lower. The Celestial Paragons chapter details many powerful creatures of good and their champions, and provides an interesting way for PCs to channel their powers or call these unique beings as allies. The Monsters chapter has many new creatures, from the tiny, mischievous Coure Eladrins (who would make great PCs), to the formidable Sword and Throne archons, to a large selection of guardinals -- the equinal (a horse-like celestial), the ursinal (bear-like spellcasters), and so on. The hollyphant -- a 2' long, gold-furred, winged, magical elephant -- has been reprinted at long last, and there is an intriguing new humanoid, the Rhek, a combination of human and rhinoceros. The book is rounded out with a discussion of good, some exalted feats (obtainable only by the noblest characters), a few new pieces of magical equipment, and a solid pile of prestige classes for those who use them.

No seriously, it's really neet to look at.The inside art isn't very attractive. Most of the add-ons are like \\"if your characters become extra special good, they are just so swell!

It also gives ideas on how a player could play a pacifist character or a character that gives away his material wealth to benifit others.

I really enjoy the ideas behind some of the prestige classes and the feats will definatly make a good character shine.SpellsThis section of the book is probably my 2nd favorite. Its very detailed and innovative. Each spell deals with fighting and/or subduing evil and in some cases even destroying the evil in a persons heart and making them see the error of their ways.Deitys and creaturesThe deities presented in the book are all about good, although if you read over most of them you may question the approach a bit. The creatures presented are very well done, they present many different celestial beings each having their own role within the multiverse however the creature part is probably the only part of the book that im a little disappointed with.Overall the book is very well done and gets a high rating as the best WotC release ive seen this year IMO.

But it needs to be written, becuase this is the dawn to evil's night, both sides must be equal. It is a great supplement for an Evil campaign, which I ran for over a year. The \\"bad guys\\" were all the paladins and high Preists of good. But once we went back to the usual type of good/neutral campaign, this book came back out and some pc's willingly wanted to become exhalted. It is well worth your money.

The maturity warning is unwarrented, I believe, because the only thing it does that is mature is cover topics such as good vs evil and how to be a good PC. The content is not innapropriate mature, more like difficult to understand mature.

I think that this is a great book for any little kid to have and listen to, or even big kids (me), the story takes you through a strange and hillarious world, that is acompanied by ammusing illustrations. it is a great book for kids to read and listen to that will be sure to make them laugh.

If you ever have a chance to get this book, seize that opportunity at once. The first essay you should read is the magnificent analysis of Edgar Allen Poe's famous short story \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" This essay, by Barton Levi St. Armand (what a name!) analyzes the essential unity of the gothic imagination by bringing in such diverse figures as William Faulkner, Herman Melville, William Blake, William Butler Yeats, William Beckford, Percy Shelley, Thomas de Quincy, and the sun god Osiris. The discussion of the famous opening paragraphs of the Usher fable show how closely Poe paralleled his imagery with the mysteries of the veil of Isis. We are further informed that the sinister house of the Ushers is described in terms more appropriate to the Egyptian House of the Dead. We also see that the fanciful list of books that Roderick Usher loves to study is a list of actual books that pried very deeply into the romantic imagination. Roderick Usher and his unfortunate sister Madeline could very easily be participants in the mysterious Elusinian mysteries. And in fact their mutual death was actually a sexual embrace which provides the purification of the soul through a physical union. Oh, mercy me! Please don't let your dear old auntie read this book. But for the mature and sophisticated inquirer, this book will open many doors that you never knew existed. The veil of Isis will be lifted and the genesis of a new world will be revealed. Try it, you'll love it! The synthesis of a coherent and inevitable development of the Gothic imagination from the Mysteries of Udolpho to Absalom, Absalom! is a tremendous intellectual achievement and a real brain stretcher."},{"Title":"The book of cowboys","review":"The beautiful full page color illustrations alone make this a value.The simple pre-triple R story is fact filled and fascinating.Loaded with page border artwork, too, but the full page ones (5) aredated, which is a compliment, and eternally beautiful with John Held grandiousity and color yet less stylistic.Easy reading, but at, really, a level that presupposes that you are relatively well read for your age, I might say, and you love cowboy and ranch and old West lore.I am pleased my wife found it in a thrift shop."},{"Title":"The book of cowboys","review":"We follow a young brother and sister as they're taken to spend a summer with their uncle on a working ranch out west.

This is not a hardcore reference guide to grammar and should not be judged as such. It is what it is - a scenic route to grammar - a gratifying and amusing trip.Those who are uptight and like to nitpick their way through the English language will probably have a hard time getting through this book... because it will force them to crack a smile and not take themselves so seriously."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"While reading Grammar Snobs I kept wondering if it was healthy to be laughing this much at a book on grammar. I read the book in one sitting (excluding 15-minutes to walk the dog and another 5-minutes hiding from a door-to-door salesperson) and it has to be one of the most user friendly books I've ever encountered when it comes to grammar. In addition. Casagrande may be the first author I've encountered who doesn't immediately disparage modern \\"netspeak\\" or attempts at countering racism and sexism in language. A great read for anyone looking to brush up on their grammar or to become better familiarized with writing."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"Casagrande writes in an accessible style, with wit wrapped in sarcasm, inside a joke. Such is the springboard and follow-through for each lesson. One of my own favorite phrases is, \\"Prepositions are bad words to end sentences with.\\" This was an entertaining book to read, a gift from a brother who shares an appreciation for language. I've since bought the author's complementary book, Mortal Syntax."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"June Casagrande, Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies (Penguin, 2006)The first thing that really struck me about this book is that Casagrande either misread, or deliberately distorted, Lynne Truss' take on the Oxford comma. After that, I started viewing the book with a great deal of skepticism. But even with a grain (or an entire lick) of salt, Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies is a fun, and worthwhile, read. Just ignore Casagrande's swipes at Lynne Truss (or, better yet, read Eats, Shoots & Leaves to get the primary source; Truss is quite in favor of the Oxford comma, as everyone should be).Casagrande, being American (Truss is English), will probably ring truer for American readers than Truss does, since she's much more closely acquainted with the foibles of grammar particular to the American version of the language. We just do a lot of weird stuff here that they don't do in England, and so Truss never addresses things like the basic idiocy of having two distinct (and often conflicting) grammatical standards for books and newspapers. Casagrande tears into them with all the fervor of a pit bull with a juicy porterhouse, and the resulting output is satisfying, in a vicarious sort of way.If you're a fan of grammar books, this one's worth your time, as long as you question what you're seeing whenever it seems appropriate. ***"},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This is a wonderful book to use to help explain some of the confusing grammar rules associated with the English language.

She needed it for a class. She has really enjoyed reading it. It puts those grammar snobs in a fun light."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I bought this book because English grammar is complicated. The book took a light-hearted look at the rules and rule makers and made me feel that the rules are indeed flexible."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This book was great! I had to read it for my English class. I was expecting to be reading it just for an assignment, but the more I read, the more I enjoyed the book and was reading it for reading's sake. The author really knows her stuff and is super sarcastic - something I can really relate to. After I finished the book, I decided that EVERYONE should have to read this book for some English class for school."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"However much I learn about usage, style, and grammar, details continue to baffle me. \\"That\\" vs. \\"which,\\" capitalizing after a colon, titles that begin with \\"a\\" or \\"the,\\" when to spell out a number, possessives of words ending in \\"s\\". Efficiently and humorously, this book answers these questions and many more. But don't expect an exhaustive guide. Rather, expect to spend some casual time getting better acquainted with these ideas. Like Lynne Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves, you can pick this up, have fun with it, and learn a few new tricks in the process. I found some information that stuck with me, some information that hopefully will some day, and some information I already knew, which her writing made enjoyable anyway. If that sounds good, give this a try.I have two small complaints about this book. First, the \\"Satan's Vocabulary\\" chapter. Casagrande's humor and readability barely wavers for most of the book, but these last pages are tedious. Second, it took me a few chapters to pick up on Casagrande's angle, which is something like this: Grammar snobs are nasty people, and Casagrande will help you outwit them by improving your grammar. Defiance through submission, kind of. In the typical chapter, she'll introduce a rule that grammar snobs mercilessly insist on, bemoan what meanies the snobs are... and then tell you how to follow the rule. It can feel convoluted, or even patronizing. Casagrande claims to oppose grammar snobs like Lynne Truss, but despite Casagrande aiming her ire at people who insist on grammar rules rather than at people who defy them, I see little difference between their projects. But who cares? This book is still fun and useful."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This book is hilarious, I'm loving reading it (as I too have been a victim of a grammer snob lol)!!!

Who would have thought learning grammar could be fun?"},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I picked up Ms. Casagrande's book intending to skim just one chapter. An hour and a half later, I'd learned about split infinitives, the subjunctive AND gotten a handle on how and when to use semicolons. Guess what--it wasn't the least bit painful! The essays are short, humorous and easy to digest. It's a great book for the grammar-shy, the grammar-reluctant, and those of us who find William Safire's essays a tad dense. I highly recommend the book!"},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"For all I knew and cared about grammar, style, punctuation and syntax, Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" was all I needed to write well enough. Journalism school introduced me to the \\"AP Stylebook,\\" which complemented S&W; and so I figured my usage library was complete...enough.But for too long I'd written grammatically acceptable sentences more out of feeling than out of confidence. I could use \\"whom\\" and \\"who\\" correctly with my only explanation for using either would be, \\"It just sounded better.\\" Ask me to explain arcane grammar jargon like what is a \\"past participle,\\" \\"conjugated verb\\" or \\"subject and object nouns,\\" I'd be at a loss.I'd have dismissed Cassagrande's book as another irritating and patronizing grammar guide if not for the humorous title. On a whim I rented the audiobook, listened during my commute and immediately found her writing style approachable and engaging without getting the feeling like I was in a junior high remedial language class. She's occasionally self-deprecating yet also confident in her knowledge and even shares tips on verbal judo with arrogant, needling grammarians.Though I still fumble to explain to a copy editor why in some sentences a hyphen was omitted or why I become hostile at the suggestion that using \\"once again\\" or \\"whether or not\\" might improve a story, I feel gratified that Cassagrande--a columnist and recovering editor--feels the same as I and would sooner reach for a usage book to prove a point than to argue."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"The book is informative and funny. I learned some got grammar points and enjoyed reading it. What else can I say. I wish she would write another."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This book is really awesome. I don't know the last time I actually wanted to sit down and read a grammar book. Surely, if you have a test to study for-- this probably isn't the book for you, but if you want to learn how to write better, this book is a great start.This book provides funny lessons that not only teaches, but makes you remember because of the humor. For instance, in the first chapter she discusses two authors that she considers as \\"meanies\\". She says, \\"A bug crawled up Kilpatrick's and Safire's behinds and died.\\" While trying to teach about possesives she notes: \\"if they shared a single behind, it would be 'Safire and Kilbatrick's butt.'\\" Genius-- I couldn't stop laughing."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This book offers a humor approach to learning grammar that I appreciate. Using real life experiences and those from famous American culture makes the author's point ever the more clear.

I (or is it me?) and most of my friends are at a loss when it comes to correct punctuation and grammar. We know most of it but, gosh darn if it isn't sometimes way too tricky! And we thought we were the only ones!! I personally cringe at the thought of using the words lie, lain, lay or whatever the heck it is and opt for something else.While I did pick up some useful tips, I think the way in which she handles this topic is \\"right on\\" for so many of us. Her information is serious and yet delivered with such humor and ease, that I actually found myself recommending this book to others. And who, except a small group of grammar snobs, EVER recommends a grammar book to a friend??!!Lighten up and enjoy the humor!"},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I listen to quite a bit of audio books when I am behind the wheel and sometimes the books can be a bit boring. Not this audio book! Fun listen.Besides having a laugh while listening to the authors stories you're also brushing up on your grammar skills. Learning that the rules are forever changing and that most of the time chances are you the writer or speaker are right.One of the reasons I enjoyed it is because in my head I was able to stick it to those annoying people I've referred to as the \\"grammar police\\" or what the author called the \\"grammar snobs\\" who feel the need to correct or \\"one up\\" on others. I am related to a few of those and if I were inclined I would send them this book but I am sure the significance of it would go over their heads.Anyway, it is a good book where it will either reinforce what you already know/knew or teach you something you did not know in a fun way.Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"Hilarious and educational.

June Casagrande is to be commended for coming up with a fresh approach and finding a multitude of ways to be humorous about language rules. She aimed the book toward the masses of people who are intimidated by language geeks.I don't think she ever intended the book to be viewed as the 'gold standard' on the subject, and she often quotes from the accepted authorities, so that people who want to learn even more about the subject know where they can look.There definitely are better guidebooks on the topic. This book is not organized in a way that makes it easy to flip through, to find quick answers to common questions. But it has merit as a casual approach to an admittedly stiff subject. You could call it \\"grammar for people who don't suck all the air out of a room.\\" What a novel idea."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The premise is certainly true: grammar snobs often are bullies and often are faking it, so ammunition to fight them is a good thing to have.The only good strategy for fighting the grammar snobs is to know more than they do. Unfortunately, June Casagrande is not equipped for this. The book is rife with errors. These can be as basic as problems identifying parts of speech. Her discussion of the infinitive is completely botched, her discussion of the subjunctive comes across as an explanation by someone who barely understands the subject, and so on.There are problems with even understanding what the issues are. Casagrande makes no distinction between questions of grammar and questions of style. Style manuals exist to bring consistency to a publication's look. It is completely arbitrary whether we write \\"the 1980s\\" or \\"the 1980's\\" but a publication looks better if it picks one and sticks with it. But this doesn't imply that one version is right and another wrong in any general sense. So if someone criticizes your choice, the correct response is not that even the \\"experts\\" disagree. It is that there are various legitimate styles to choose from.On questions that really are of grammar, and not merely style, Casagrande completely abandons the good fight. There are innumerable issues where the grammar snobs make questionable assertions. For example, the claim that \\"which\\" cannot be used as the relative pronoun in a restrictive clause. This rule was a flat-out invention that got adopted in American style manuals, gradually infiltrating its way into the collective consciousness as a rule of grammar. This is complete nonsense. No one can declare a change to the English language by fiat, and anyone who says that a restrictive \\"which\\" is bad grammar should be mocked mercilessly. This ought to be just the book for the job, but Casagrande doesn't seem to realize that there is an issue. Instead, we get a routine explanation of the rule such as can be found in any number of books. This happens over and over: questionable rules that ought to be challenged are meekly accepted.There is a recurring bit of shtick about how unqualified she is to write a book on grammar. This presumably is intended as self-deprecating humor. Unfortunately, it is an accurate description of the situation."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I'm not an English major or teacher, but an engineer who occasionally writes technical and marketing literature. Although I've always had a keen grasp of tricky English rules and exceptions, at times I still fumble with such details as \\"which\\" vs. \\"that\\" and \\"three\\" vs. \\"3\\". I thought this book was hilarious and a fun way to learn the tricky rules. I usually have a very short attention span when reading any type of rule book. However, June's short and humorous chapters made this book easy to read. Besides the definite grammar rules, the best thing I got from this book is learning that, in many cases, there are no definite rules. The major sources of English reference disagree with each other, and the rules change over time. This quickly put my mind at ease as I often thought I was going crazy when reading different writing styles. I highly recommend this book for anyone who does any kind of writing for a living."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"Frankly, I think the entire point of this book is to relax about grammar. For those who find it useless, I question whether they read through the whole book or understood that Cassagrande's point is that grammar is a messed-up area in which none of the style guides will ever agree. Her point isn't to show you how it's done so much as to allow people to feel a bit more confident.I found the book insightful, helpful and a very good source of entertainment. If you take it too seriously, then you'll never get the point of it, which is to understand that grammar will always baffle even the smartest among us, and that it's okay that it is. Cassagrande points out a few areas where the style guides and self-proclaimed language experts can't even agree and shows that grammar is more complex given each interpretation. That we don't agree only proves that point."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I made a startling discovery in the opening pages of \\"Grammar Snobs are Big Meanies\\" by June Casagrande. There are actually newspapers that publish grammar columns? The thought of this fascinated me - and I wondered if all of the grammar columns were cranky or if they were actually helpful in a positive sort of way. I continued reading and was delighter at what I found.I was thrilled to see the title of this book for multiple reasons. The first and foremost is this: as a writing teacher and as a writer, there are occasions when I get lambasted for grammatical mistakes and the folks who deliver the criticism confound me with their arrogance and smug grandiosity.I thought it might be just me. Finding June Casagrande's book was like finding a dear friend. The book outlines frequent complaints of Grammar snobs and clarifies the truth (or lack of truth) in those complaints. This is especially useful because instead of just proclaiming grammar rules like some grammar books, this book gives you a context.The examples are frequently amusing, always entertaining and they include illustrations from pop culture (read about \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"Star Trek\\") and there was even a review of my eleventh grade English class, making clear the uses of \\"lay\\" and \\"lie\\".Grammar reference books are essential for a writer's home liberary and one like this will not only teach, it gives the juice that helps those teachings to stick. Put this on your shelf along with others like \\"Elements of Style\\" and \\"Woe is I\\".There is plenty of room for a variety of approaches. Many kudos to June Casagrande for delivering such a unique example."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I have a few grammar books that I turn to in times of need when editing my magazine. I've added this book because I was looking for something that was a bit more conversational and explanatory, rather than a list of rules. This is by no means a \\"complete\\" book, but more a collection of chapters that deal with common contentions in grammar. Casagrande repeatedly tells the reader to trust his/her ear and that many of the rules that are constantly foisted on us are wrong, misunderstood or have exceptions that the sticklers or \\"snobs\\" don't know. I found a couple of chapters still confusing, but others were enlightening. Also, the snob angle got a little tired, but her humor was appreciated. She does include a good list of references that I'll check out to fill out my \\"reference\\" section. I'm not trying to be an exemplary grammarian, just someone who can write clearly, concisely and compellingly. I think Casagrande's book will help me on my journey, even if it isn't the total answer."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I purchased this book based on the recommendation of someone at the same time I purchased Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss. I read Eats, Shoots & Leaves several months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I identified with the author's concern for the laxness and the lowering of standards for using grammar and punctuation correctly. The book was not only a great refresher, but I learned several new things.Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite, although marginally funny in places, is primarily a direct attack on people who use grammar correctly and hold the rest of us accountable to do the same, specifically Truss and other named grammarians. The author, June Casagrande, strove to arm her readers with ammunition to repel snide remarks from grammar snobs; those people who are constantly correcting or looking down their noses at others who use incorrect grammar. Although the title of the book should have given me a clue (duh!), I did not want or need that kind of ammunition.For the most part, I did not find this book helpful. There was almost an \\"anything goes\\" attitude toward grammar or what one can \\"get away with\\" when dealing with a grammar snob. I much prefer knowing what is and is not correct and when there is a choice or the rules are silent, what is the preferable usage. I came away from reading this book unenlightened.Perhaps all of this makes me a grammar snob or a grammar-snob wannabe, but then so be it. As Lynne Truss wrote, \\"Sticklers unite!\\"I stand with her."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I wanted to like this book, but unfortunately the author seems to have put more effort into trying to be entertaining than getting things right. Starting on page 4, an omitted closing quotation mark might have been a simple typographic error, but an insistence on page 23 that the word \\"up\\" in \\"The baby can sit up\\" is an adjective (no, it's an adverb - up modifies sit, not baby) made me throw up my hands in resignation and, I confess, stop reading. I find no pleasure in reading a book on grammar that not only makes mistakes but vehemently defends them.Did the author write this book in response to accusations of being a grammar snob? If so, she has a lot more explaining to do."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I think June Casagrande had a run-in with someone like my former boss, who treated language as though it were a logic puzzle governed by rigid laws, rather than a vibrant tool to be used with the aid of a few helpful grammar rules and style points. The woman had a tin ear for good prose and constantly insisted on challenging people based on rules that were either hopelessly arcane or flat-out wrong. And if you cornered her, her usual squirm-out was that her way was \\"idiomatic\\" or the \\"generally accepted\\" way. She was a grammar snob, and she was a great big meanie.This is the portrait that June Casagrande tries to paint, but ultimately, she doesn't really seem to be sure what a grammar snob is. Is it a person who will run out of the room crying when you press him or her on a technicality, because the snob really doesn't know what he or she is talking about? Or is it a person who simply makes you feel low because of the snob's superior grasp of the language? Well, Casagrande seems to want it both ways. Sometimes the meanies are overbearing know-it-alls, and sometimes they're overbearing know-nothings. Strangely, she ultimately reverts to the alleged meanies, especially Bryan Garner, to back up her arguments, which range from the obvious (the stuff you learned in high school English, if you paid the least bit of attention) to the downright weak to things that aren't even matters of grammar at all. Ultimately, she ends up saying that you need to know what the grammar snobs know.Yet while she does that, she blindly defends some meanie rules (with often flimsy explanations that rely a lot on the use of the word \\"technically\\") and tosses out others. Incidentally, an earlier reviewer dinged her for defending against the use of the restrictive \\"which,\\" yet that's one of the calls I'll give her credit for. The restrictive \\"which\\" may not be bad grammar, per se, but it is most certainly bad form, given that an indiscriminate use of \\"which\\" can only lead to confusion for readers.Casagrande also tells you that snobs will insist that you never split an infinitive but love to resort to Churchill's famous quote to tell you why you CAN end a sentence with a preposition. Now, I would think that these bogeymen snobs would tell you to do neither, given that the infinitive rule and the preposition rule both derive from ill-advised attempts to impose the limitations of Latin grammar on our language. So which is it? Do grammar snobs embrace silly rules rooted in Latin, or don't they? Again, the author either wants it both ways or is just clueless.It's not a big surprise that this book is so confused in its advice. You're dealing with someone who uses \\"prior to,\\" gives a blanket defense of politically correct language (in quite a snobbish way, I might add), and, perhaps worst of all, offers up a dangler as a fix for a dangler. (See page 26 -- the opening phrase modifies \\"vision,\\" not \\"VP\\" as she had intended.) The website associated with this book is just as bad. On a quick glance, I spotted at least three glaring punctuation errors and a completely illiterate (though all too common) use of \\"due to.\\" (Helpful hint: \\"Due to\\" is properly used as an adjective phrase and almost always follows a form of the verb \\"to be.\\" Think of it as a synonym for \\"attributable to\\" or \\"caused by.\\" It answers what, not why. Most of the time, you really want to say \\"because of.\\")In short, Casagrande doesn't know what she's talking about. She can't even discern grammar from style, it seems. She obviously knows just enough to make a living as a word person, but let me tell you -- I work as a copy editor, too, and I've seen some June Casagrandes in my profession. They remember the stuff in their AP stylebooks and have a slightly above-average grasp of basic grammar rules, but at the end of the day, someone else has to clean things up where their deficiencies left off. And remember, I'm saying this as someone who once suffered under a REAL grammar snob.The good news is that you CAN learn how to use the language right -- er, correctly -- without becoming a snob. Casagrande tries to make that point but fails miserably. She also seems to have a problem with what she perceives as the stuffy humorlessness among grammar folks, so she jacks up her book with oh-so-hip references to pop culture (mainly primetime cartoons) and peppers it all with a little bit of raunch. Yes, she's looking down on the snobs' stuffiness -- and that makes her a snob, too. The odd thing is, there's plenty of subtle humor among grammarians and their tomes -- and Casagrande even points to some of it. If you want funny, this book is fine. If you want funny AND competent, try Bill Walsh.Casagrande says that no grammar snob would ever want you to know about someone like Garner and his usage guide. Well, I'm here to tell you that I have a copy of \\"Garner's Modern American Usage\\" on my desk. It's one of the best, most useful books I own. And this editor fully encourages you to get a copy, too, because everyone should be able to use the language properly. Just don't look to June Casagrande for help, no matter what you do."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"Finally, a grammar book for the rest of us. Although I am an editor, I am more of a grammar geek, as June would say. Due to my profession, I fall prey to grammar snobbery all the time. Part of being an editor (the part that I pride myself on) is honoring that there are many ways to write something. So-called \\"experts\\" and style guides constantly contradict each other. Editing is the art and skill of maneuvering through all of the opinions, while taking the author's style and tone into consideration, and choosing the most appropriate and effective way to communicate what the author is trying to say. It's not just all about the \\"rules.\\"In Grammar Snobs, June Casagrande makes reading about grammar rules less painful--in fact, it is downright hilarious! My personal favorite chapter is about the \\"steamy predicate nominative.\\" Who knew predicate nominatives could be so sexy? (Or that reading about them could be as sensual an experience as watching Brad Pitt laze around the house in nothing but a towel?)Casagrande made me laugh out loud several times while I read this book. Her skill in connecting with the reader from the very beginning of the book is the hook. She also pokes fun at her colleagues--such as Lynn Truss--from the very beginning, which is pretty funny to read, especially for those who have read (or faked reading) Truss' book on punctuation, Eats, Shoots & Leaves.I would most definitely recommend this grammar guide to anyone. Period. From high school English students to experienced editors to grant writers to published authors, this book is guaranteed to answer questions that plague English speakers and writers...while making them giggle in the process."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"This book is an entertaining way to brush up on some grammar. Despite the fact that it does happen to be a book about grammar, it is written for people who may be somewhat grammatically challenged, and so it is much less intimidating for the general reader. It also happens to be very funny!It probably won't appeal to the \\"grammar snobs\\" who might read textbooks in their spare time, but for those of us who lead busy lives and care about the quality of our writing, whether it's a memo for work or a thank you note, this book is a very enjoyable read as well as useful.I highly recommend this book to anyone who ever has to write anything, and especially to those with a sense of humor.

That's how I met June. We shared a distaste for a lot of the dry, stilted prose that companies used to inform the public about their products and finances. I was content to complain about bad writing; June went out and did something about it. She wrote a funny, thoughtful book for everyone who wants to write - not for the know-it-alls who only rouse themselves to attack the writing of others. A few of the latter are well represented among these book reviews. For the rest of us who seek an entertaining and empowering guide to freeing the writer within, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite","review":"I found the book rather offensive in tone and quite heavy handed.

This book is filled with so many errors and poor explanations that it can't help you learn much of anything. Wanda's review below illustrates the problem pretty well: You get to skim over the basics, but you obviously won't learn anything about the finer points, such as parallel sentence structure. That's not Wanda's fault, though. I blame the author, who seems to be telling her readers it's OK to scoot by with a cursory knowledge of grammar. Apparently, that's what June Casagrande does. And yes, as others have noted, she does conflate grammar with style.Grammar snobs aren't meanies.

To the back of this book, anyway, where tomes of terrific reference books, which are remarked on in the text, are listed for extra homework and/or clarifications. Casagrande's smart-person's guide to grammar and how we really use it in speech and writing is self-satirizing and sassy. it's also brilliantly funny. File this book under best loved and most used, it's no overwrought cementblock of time-encrusted dos and don'ts.The fact is that most copy needs fixing and gentle prodding--here's where casagrande's book might inspire such efforts, working in that crucible where the sheer joy of personal accomplishment comes hard against the fear of loathing by one's peers. Isn't that what inspires/terrifies all of us? It's writing she is addressing, not how to write thank you notes to the Junior League.Should editors expect writers to wade through grammarian backwaters for their personal edification? No. That's the editor's job, and Casagrande includes excellent sources for more info (none better than Don Basse, a veritable avatar of an editor, with whom i also have been lucky enough to work). So you've got a host of other refs to turn to for too much information.Casagrande loves writing and she's successful professionally to boot; she's been there, done that (writing and thank you notes, thrill of agony, joy of defeat), so if you don't have the privilege of working alongside Basse, you need this next-best friend to battle your (and your copywriters') everyday word demons.

The photography is simply outstanding and reflects the authors experience in presenting yacht interiors and nautical themes generally. There are a number of action shots as well as &quot;stills&quot;. The photographs of Ticonderoga in particular, are simply stunning.The presentation in order of yacht name, rather than designer, is interesting and does not detract. The addition of line drawings and more technical specifications would have rounded out the presentation.The inclusion of new &quot;classics&quot; is welcome and demonstrates that traditional skills are alive and well in many parts of the world. In this vain, I would have appreciated a wider representation. Some magnificant wooden vessels are being constructed ( either entirely of wood or with wooden decks and interiors) in parts of the world other than the USA, the Med and the UK,upon which the book concentrates. Notable in this regard are New Zealand and Tasmania (a State of Australia). Some of the worlds finest boat building timbers are found in Tasmania and this is reflected in yachts constructed there; particularly the carvel planked yacht.The cover price represnts good value. Even my children, aged eight and six years found the photographs stunning and sat quietly for a considerable time, slowly flipping the pages.Anyone who is interested in Art, Yachting, or Photography will find great enjoyment in a quiet read."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Tradition: Old and New Classic Yachts","review":"The pictures are excellent, while the text is good in parts. The drawings, where they exist, are pretty poor. Also, the selection of the boats seems random, at best, leaving you with the feeling that the authors chose what they had access to, rather than based on more specific criteria. I have nothing against subjective, even quirky choices, but I have a very hard time calling some of these boats classics, whatever your definition for it.Anyway, it's a nice book, if not terribly informative. So, buy it if you really like older boats, or if, like me, you're a fan of designer Bruce King. Or for some subjective, quirky reason of your own."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Tradition: Old and New Classic Yachts","review":"The book is full of excellent photos, of exteriors and interiors and action shots.

For this purpose the book is inspiring and full of ideas to copy. Although, the excellent wood work inside these boats will humble anyone with a saw. For my purpose, I still prefer the author's first book, Classic Yacht Interiors. The previous book contains a wider range of vessels and much easier to implement ideas on more affordable boats."},{"Title":"Reversible Quilts","review":"Book arrived...good service.

She also teaches quilting as part of her work and, by association, I have learned a lot about quilting.She got these books to plan out her lessons for a class she was giving to quilting beginners.I initially glanced at Reversible Quilts and found myself going through the entire book.Why?It's really excellent. Sharon Pederson is an excellent teacher and a fine writer. (I am not sure if Sharon did the design and layout as well. If she did, more kudos to her.)The book starts with the basics: Tools and Supplies, Fabric, Batting and Design Wall. She moves on to reversible blocks, explaining the mechanics of building the block, which I have seen done in real life hundreds of times. What impressed me was how well Pederson was able to describe the process in words and pictures.She goes on to Settings and Sashing, Borders and Binding, all explained clearly.Finally, the Projects, ten of them.

Show the gals how to do reversible quilts and I wouldn't have to quilt them!!Using Ms. Pederson's techniques, our guild has now produced four quilts in under six months (we only meet 2.5 hours a week so that's a pretty good production rate). I began them with solid pieced backs and the stripping technique she shows in her book. Now that they are comfortable creating this way, I am going to move them on to the \\"real\\" way Ms. Pederson shows to make reversible quilts --- using a full triangle on each side.Once they get the hang of that, I will move them on to the \\"full strip\\" quilting techniques. They love doing the reversible quilts (or quilt as you go as we call it) because the gals that only do sewing actually get to play with colors and patterns. Oh what happy campers, Ms. Pederson has made our guild.The book contains 10 projects besides all the wonderful techniques shown.

I got my wish with this book - although the title is a bit misleading: you don't get two quilts. You get one quilt with two different sides that, when planned carefully, can look completely different. So for instance, my first attempt was a toddler quilt with a lively crazy patch/I spy design on one side and a calming one patch design on the other. You must put a little more thought into designing the \\"front\\" and \\"back\\" before you begin sewing, but once you start to sew, it goes very quickly. And a design wall helps too, so you don't have to crawl around on your living room floor to get the lay outs right.The concept is challenging and that's a plus for me. Since I've been quilting since the '80s, I've just about seen it all. This technique lets me think about how piecing a particular pattern on one side creates a quilting pattern on the other side and will the result be pleasing?

He does not only have a commanding mastery of the English Language but the way in which he draws one into his subject, one gets the feeling that one is interacting with a master of the sublime. His prose reads like poetry, and his use of myths and legends and symbolism take us on a mental journey that is not only vivid to the observer of details, but indeed, it is like interacting with virtual cinema. More than that, his knowledge of Indian history, philosiophy, culture, enriches one's life to the extent that one is really made to reevaluate the extent of the learning on is given in the course of one's education. In a manner of speaking he stands tall among the giants of world literature. His writing skills in this book and the depth of the subject matter can easily be compared with Shakespeare, Milton, Johnston, Wordsworth, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Poe, Emerson, Steinbeck, Feuntes, etc. His style and the selection of his material is not only original, but just stunning.Arc On the Horizon is not the kind of book that one either likes or dislikes. It has something in it for everyone, for the young, for the youth, the middle aged and the aged. For one thing, it is, on the one hand a very powerful love story, with shades of emotions bordering on Romeo and Juliet, or even Orthello. But on the other hand, it is a book about ideas, specifically about the notions about reincarnation and the dynamics of memory in a philosophcical sense. It deals with reincarnation in completely different mode of being, certainly, by contrast with what most people understand reincarnation to mean. Mr. Naipaul uses the cocept of reincarnation more as a tool to inject life into things past; and in so doing we are made to interact with such notable figures as the once rebellious queen, the Rani of Jhansi, who led the Great Mutiny of 1857 in the drive to evict Britian from India.But the story does not only deal with the early struggle for Indian independence -where parallels are made with the early struggles for American Independence; it takes us on a tour-de-force, symbolically, from the heights of Peruvian Andes to the plantation-life of Trinidad. Here, in the southern-most portion of the Caribbean we are introduced to a lowly farm boy, who emerges to become not only a powerful U.N. Diplomat, but disilusioned with the way of the world, he turns away from his career at the top to become a yogi. Now, nearing old age he falls for a young Belgain woman who is on her way to India to do a documentary on the life of the Rani of Jhansi. As we soon finds out, our narator, the diplomat turned yogi, is also on his way to India to do a documentary in the Himalayas. Soon they discover that they once had a life together: she as the former Rani of Jhansi, and he, her former lover and at one time her prime minister. And so Love is reignited, but this is not anthing like ordinary love: it is the love that connects soul.Still, the philosophy takes us at an other level (and there are many), to their travels in the Himalayas, where they are met face to face with the world's perenial terrorists. Here we are not only given a rare perspective on the mind of the terrorist, but it brings us face to face with the forces that lead to 9/11. The dialogue is powerful, but even so, Mr. Naipaul keeps the emotions manageable: he allows for us a few real pinch, but as we leave the scene, amidst all the devestation, not unlike the aftermats of the tragedy of the WTC, we wonder where we are heading next. Still, we are not left hanging. Indeed, the philosophy bails us out, and part of that philosophy resides in the power of culture and the ability to remember, even long after we are gone.This book, I am certain will make it to the big screen, in the same way that \\"Gandhi\\" made it, long after the death of the Mahatma. Balkrishna Naipaul is a writer to watch. He deserves all the prizes there are for Literature."},{"Title":"Arc on the Horizon","review":"Arc on the Horizon aims at the highest spiritual nobility.

Want a real treat? Read it. You Confederates will love it too."},{"Title":"Inside the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson","review":"This is an outstanding set of letters by a perceptive officer in the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry. It certainly ranks in the top five of Army of the Potomac letter collections published in the last decade. Donaldson was opinionated, but also intent on description, not chat. He provides excellent narratives of most of the major campaigns, but more importantly he offers insights into ordeals and events often overlooked--everyday struggles lost to history. Gregory Acken has done an outstanding job of introducing, annotating, and editing the missives, offering the reader cues to the important themes that course through the correspondence. For the serious researcher of the Army of the Potomac, this book will become an oft-cited source. For the more casual student, these letters are a vivid, first-rate look at the experience of America's Civil War."},{"Title":"Inside the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson","review":"In letters to his brother and aunt, Francis Adams Donaldson chronicled his daily experiences during three years in the infantry of the Army of the Potomac. Not intending that his words would find their way into publication, he used his letters home to express his hopes, ventilate his frustrations, and convey to his family some sense of the tedium, grandeur and horror he was experiencing. Presented almost as written, this collection of correspondence brings an honesty and immediacy not found in the often sanitized volumes of other Civil War memoirs. Donaldson was a very young man when he began his service as a volunteer in a Pennsylvania regiment. Enduring the intensity of combat, called upon to lead but not trained as a professional soldier, craving recognition and promotion, his often bitter criticisms of the abilities and personal qualities of his peers and superiors reflect his own inevitable stress and insecurity. There are other collections of such letters from Civil War combatants. What sets this book apart is J. Gregory Acken's remarkable editing and research. Almost every individual and place name mentioned by Donaldson, even if only in passing, is referenced by a footnote. Where available, photographs of the soldiers are provided. You won't be left wondering what happened to these men, whether they survived the wounds which result in their passing from the pages of the memoir, or the course of their careers as they leave the unit; their fate is there in the footnotes. Each chapter is headed by a brief section placing the subsequent letters in historical context. My only criticism of the book comes in these sections, which introduce some jarring redundancies by quoting passages later contained within the letters, themselves. The book comes most alive in the letters describing the battles of Gettysburg and Mills Run. Though it can be a long read at times, you will finish it with the feeling of having shared, in the words of the subtitle, the Civil War experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson."},{"Title":"Inside the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson","review":"What I love about this book is that it is so much more than stories about battles. It's an incredibly well written account of the everyday life of an average Civil War soldier. You get a great idea of the politics of rank back then, along with great descriptions of everything from marches, to camping, to of course the battles. It's also amazing to me what he experienced....from the Battle of Fredericksburg, to Gettysburg, and Antietam, there is definetly no lack of detailed battle descriptions too. I guess my favorite part is that he continually asks his brother to not publish his writings and for that reason he writes honestly, and you get a true account of what military life was like back then. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson","review":"Francis Donaldson's letters in this book are really one of the best personal accounts of the Army of the Potomac. Donaldson really sheds some light on the inner workings of the Army of the Potomac. He really tells it like he saw it and his views are not watered down by a long passage of time. There are superior officers that he could truly not get along with and this comes through in the letters and makes clear how little has changed in the military hierarchy over the centuries.But most American Civil War readers will want to read Donaldson's fabulous and detailed accounts of various battles and skirmishes that he saw. His view of the Federal disaster at Ball's Bluff is a very important account. Also his writings on his actions at the nearly forgotten battle of Shepherdstown during the Maryland Campaign of 1862 are harrowing. A reader will also be treated to excellent accounts of the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns plus a very long and detailed look at the important Gettysburg campaign. Donaldson's letters read very well and you will feel that you are walking and riding with the Army of the Potomac. The awful heat and dust comes alive as does the cold of winter and the battle to stay alive.Highly recommended! A+ reading!"},{"Title":"Inside the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Experience of Captain Francis Adams Donaldson","review":"Civil War memoirs seem to have taken off since the Ken Burns miniseries aired on PBS.

The headings and subheadings are often very confusing; what should besubheading is often listed in the same font/size/color as the its corresponding heading. It is very hard to dicipher how the authors areclassifying things at times. Some of the classifications arevery poor and not even parallel. For example, on page 88, the authors classify data processing into four &quot;general approaches&quot;:batch processing using sequential files, batch processing using direct access files, batch processing with real-time data collection, and real time processing. The headings on page 88 are ALTERNATIVE DATA PROCESSING APPROACHES and BATCH PROCESSING USING SEQUENTIAL FILES. (These headings have exact font/size/color. ) It would be much more helpful to students if the print the four approaches in one font/size/color which is different from the overall header of &quot;ALTERNATIVE DATA PROCESSING APPROACHES.&quot;After reading the following 6-7 pages of discussion, I could not help shaking my head about the poor classification. To me, data processing should simply be classified in 2 categories: batch and real-time. THe authors added more classifition using another criteria of file structure. However, they mix these categories together. What they called &quot;batch processing with real-time data collection&quot; is really just half batch and half real-time (which in the aggregate should probably be called batch processing).So, in essense, the authors' classification of the four approaches is exactly the same as the following classification of cars:(1) red cars with 2 doors(2) red cars with 4 doors(3) half-red, half-white cars(4) white carsThe discussion about each approaches are also confusing.For example, on page 95, under the heading &quot;Batch processing using real time data collection&quot;, the author wrote &quot;The systems examined thus far describe a process by which transactions are sent in batches to a central location for conversion to magnetic media. A popular alternative is to capture transaction data at its source in real time. Real-time processing is also called &quot;on-line&quot; because the system, in this case the data collection portion of it, is available to the user at all times. By distributing data input capability to users, certain transaction errors can be prevented or detected and corrected at their source. The result is a transaction file that is free from most of the errorss that plague data processing. Figure 2-39 illustrates this approach. Real-time data collection can be used with both the batch/sequential and the batch/direct access update techniques. In both cases, however, the transaction file produced in the data collection stage must be a direct access structure.&quot;This is just one example. I am from a computer science and MIS background, and can kind of figure out what the authors are trying to say, but many students are confusedby this book, and are complaining about this book (which is why I am writing this review)."},{"Title":"Accounting Information Systems","review":"This book is perfect for self study, studying without colleges.It reads easy, has a perfect index and interesting information."},{"Title":"Accounting Information Systems","review":"The book is okay as far as textbooks go, but there is no real companion site.

Most Latin textbooks begin with the first declension and move systematically through each declension, conjugation, etc. Ecce Romani, however, encourages the student to use his or her own instinctive linguistic abilities to translate texts. Thus instead of the typical Latin one textbook which begins with the banal sentence &quot;Roma est in Italia,&quot; Ecce Romani begins with a sentence such as &quot;In pictura est puella, nomine Flavia, quae in villa habitat.&quot; With cognates and a limited vocabulary list the students are able to translate the sentence without going into the depth of ablative phrases, relative clauses, and verb conjugations. These topics are gradually introduced and explained as one goes through the series. The result of this is that the student gains an appreciation of the language without being burdened by its intricacies. I have found that this works wonderfully for middle school age students in the sixth through eighth grades. Once a student reaches ninth grade a more formulaic understanding of the language becomes necessary. Interesting stories accompanied by archaeological, mythological, and historical tidbits make this series a visually pleasing and academically challenging introduction to Latin for young students."},{"Title":"Ecce Romani I-A, A Latin Reading Program, 2nd edition: Meeting the Family (Vol 1)","review":"I wanted to learn latin and I had no idea what i was doing when I purchased another set of books to learn latin.I was on Amazon and I saw these books, so I decided to try them out.

Instead of throwing words and prefixes you learn by associating the words with things in the scenes. You realize that some words are similar to english and other romantic languages.

First of all there are the words, lots of them, words that flow and caress and make liberal use of just the right tiny details to get to the essence the people he dscribes. Never have I seen such artful characterization and I found I was re-reading some of these descriptions just for the pure beauty of the way he used his words. And yet those words never got in the way of the story; they enhanced it. It is also a piece of history as the author brings alive the South of 1920s and 1930s.The story is about Willie Stark, man of humble origin who rose to power as a governor of an unnamed Southern state and is supposedly loosely based on the life of Huey Long, the Governor of Louisiana. But the main character is really Jack Burden, the narrator of the story. He's a reporter when he meets Willie Stark early in his career and is there as witness his political rise. Later, he works directly for Willie and becomes a key player in the blackmailing and political intrigue that surrounds the Governor. We come to know Jack through the people in his life as well as his own internal introspections and watch the swirl of events that grow in depth and complexity. Nothing is quite what it seems at first, and there are multiple sub-stories that unfold as the basic action of the book moves along. And then, just when I think I understand it all, there is yet another and another layer of depth and meaning. Everything has an effect on everything else. I found the book impossible to put down, thinking about it all the time, not only as it related to the story itself, but also how it applies to my own life.This is perhaps the best book I ever read and I can't heap enough praise on it. It is clearly a masterpiece and I give it my very highest recommendation. It's a present to yourself to read it. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Yes, this is a great novel, though I personally think the last three pages were a big mistake. But this review is about the \\"new, corrected edition\\" by Mr. Polk, which, I'm afraid, is a literary and scholarly travesty. Readers will be well advised to stick with the original 1946 text.; the fact that it has been a force in American life for over 50 years, and that in the 43 years before his death Warren never gave any indication he was dissatisfied with it, should be reason enough. (A cynic would argue that the only reason for the new edition was to extend the copyright.)Polk went back to Warren's original typescript draft to restore many of the passages, phrases, and stylistic features that were changed or deleted in the editorial process before publication (and approved by Warren); and he claims that his editorial decisions have created a superior novel. The first problem is that, except for a very sketchy 10-page essay, Polk gives the reader no help in judging for himself. A respectable scholarly edition would at the least indicate, at the bottom of each page or the back of the book, each instance in which the first edition text has been changed and where the change came from (the draft was edited by several hands, including Warren's). A reader who wants to assess Polk's work will have to have both editions in hand and scan page by page, and even then will not know whose decisions Polk has overruled. Thus Polk puts himself beyond criticism.Polk's essay tries to justify his decisions, but his illustrations are merely anecdotal and offer no consistent editorial principles or methodology. I haven't the space here to go through a critique point by point; suffice it to say, I'm not convinced by any of his examples, including the reversion from Willie Stark to Willie Talos. Polk seems to be one of those editors who believes that the closer you get to the author's very first words on paper, the better or the more authentic your version will be, since then you are closest to the \\"white heat of creativity.\\" But this is one of the silliest forms of romanticism still in existence. And I suspect it runs directly again Warren's own philosophy of history. Polk may think he has restored history, but in fact he has falsified it, for the history was the event of publication.Polk writes: \\"Many may feel that Warren's at least tacit approval of the [original] editors' changes-indeed, his gratitude for them-should argue against a new edition. But his \`approval' may have come from fatigue, from pressures of one sort or another, from the years of constant work on it. Indeed, his very closeness to the novel may have prevented him from exercising his own good judgment, and in any case this version indicates that he had written better than he knew.\\" Ah, but surely Mr. Polk knows? No, these are the lamest of speculations, for which there is no evidence, and the surest signs that Polk's fantasies are in danger of effacing Warren's work."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It is extremely hard to sit down and write a review for any piece of classic literature for there is very little a reviewer can say that is new. Of course, for a book to be considered a classic most of its reviewers have to have had a favorable opinion of the work and all a new reviewer can do is concur or disagree. In this case, I couldn't possibly agree more with previous reviewers who have written rave reviews of this book.This is not so much the story of Willie Stark, who was Willie Talos in the original manuscript, as it the story of Jack Burden, the man telling the story. It really seems to be the story of a young man and his road to maturity. That young man is Jack Burden and Stark seems to be just a convenient focal point around which Warren weaves his story. The plot is very well laid out and flows very well from beginning to end, which is quite an accomplishment when one considers all of the subplots to be found in this book. As Burden tells his story he often wanders down memory lane, recalling events which his story has recalled. Each subplot builds to it's own climax while also building toward the climax of the main story and the reader is swept along like a barrel on the Niagara River. Just as the reader feels as if he can put the book aside for a while, another subplot begins to ascend through the story and the reader is again swept along unable to pause. I got so caught up in one of the subplots that I was late for a very important appointment. I just couldn't stop until I found out what happened.Stark is obviously supposed to resemble Louisiana Governor Huey Long and he very much does so. If one also reads T. Harry Williams biography of Long they will see just how strong the resemblance is. There are several morals and messages to be drawn from this story including thoughts on good and evil and past and future. In addition to the messages though, one has to admire the incredible amount of research Warren had to have done to write this book. Warren of course was alive and well during Huey Long's reign and that had to help him but in all events described his historical accuracy is uncanny. For example, one of the subplots involves Jefferson Davis in a minor way and even in delving in things well beyond his own memories Warren laces the story with many accurate details. In one passage, Warren relates that Davis missed the steamboat that was to carry him on the first leg of his trip to Montgomery to assume the Presidency of the new Confederacy. Warren points out that the boat left Davis Landing and then was halted out in the river while a smaller boat brought the new President out to get on board. A historical fact that would not be common knowledge but that is entirely accurate.Many people avoid books that are considered to be top-flight works of literature. These people often assume that such books must be dull and so philosophical that they are beyond the average reader. In some instances this may be the case but not with this book. Warren has turned out a masterpiece that is not only fun to read but is so enjoyable that the reader will hate to come to the end. There are messages to be found here, both obvious and subtle but do not worry about the messages. They will come through on their own as you sit back and enjoy the ride over the falls."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it. If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published. Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel. Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved. I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Let's get this out of the way: having just finished this book, I feel confident in ascribing \\"All the King's Men\\" the status of one of my all-time favorite books. My words cannot begin to describe just how good it is, but I shall try...This book is primarily sold as a political novel. I think this is somewhat of an inaccurate pitch, because while Willie Stark is certainly a politician,and the book's real main character, Jack Burden, is one of stark's pundits, to limit ATKM to the political realm does it a disservice. This book is truly about so much more than politics. Sure, one of the main themes of this book is how politics are present in nearly every aspect of our lives, but this book is also about ideas, the ties that bind, the search for self, the human condition at its best and at its worst, the driving force of passion, and the intricacies of morality. It has romance, mystery, scandal, suicide, murder, and some fairly awesome speeches.Sound dense? It is. At nearly 700 pages, ATKM is a true epic, but not one word of it is superfluous. Warren deftly spins multiple storylines into an intricately tangled web. His prose is deceptively simple, the strong Southern voice of the narrator belying some of the stark truths. He selects and arranges his words so that you feel the full force of their meaning as it resonates within you. After reading this book, you will understand with fierce clarity how this book won the Pulitzer prizeThis book is a testament to what fiction should strive to be, for there is more truth in these lines than fantasy. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants the ultimate reading experience, and I daresay that this is one of those books that only improves upon re-reading. This book rocked my world, and I can only hope it does the same for you as well."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Calling anything &quot;the best&quot; is a dicey proposition, but in my opinion, this magnificent novel deserves the billing. I've read it more than a few times, and it has never failed to deliver an emotional punch, and Warren's poetic prose has never failed to lose its luster.On one level, of course, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; is a fictionalized account of the life of Huey Long, the machine politician who rose to state and national prominence as the iron-fisted governor of Louisiana, a man strong enough to seriously offer FDR a challenge in the '30s before his (Long's) assassination. As a hard-nosed political novel, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; delivers the goods. Warren's Willie Stark develops absolutely believably from a laughably naive idealist to a ruthless politician who has convinced himself that the political ends justify the brutal means.But beyond this, Warren's novel is a profound meditation on the limits of power and the nature of our understanding of the world. Its narrator, Jack Burden, is one of the most complex creations in American fiction, a man at once supremely self-assured and wracked by the most essential of doubts about himself. On the one hand, Jack, who becomes Willie's number-one assistant, is as hard edged a realist as his boss. On the other, he is a wounded romantic, lamenting a long-lost love and the disappearance of a world that offered the simple pleasures of boyhood and none of the ambiguities a complex world in which nothing -- politically, socially, or romantically -- is as it seems.Finally, the novel is a voyage of self-discovery for Jack, and in this, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; continues the great tradition in Western literature we trace back to Oedipus. The novel explores the fundamental theme of self-identity, as Sophocles did, and it succeeds brilliantly in creating a complex, multi-layered story that achieves its thematic goal.There is really no describing the richness of the experience you will find if you read this novel, but be forewarned that it is a novel that demands much. If you are willing to submit to the experience, Warren's great work will reward you many times over."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is perhaps one of the best works of American fiction of the twentieth century. As an historical work, it gives us an incredible insight into the way Louisiana functioned under Huey &quot;the Kingfish&quot; Long. The story line is riveting, certainly, but the most remarkable thing about Penn Warren's book is the beauty of his writing. That might be why this work has become a classic: one doesn't need to be a political junkie to appreciate it.The other major work of fiction using Long as inspiration, Adria Locke Langley's A Lion is in the Streets, doesn't even come close to the greatness of All the King's Men. Anyone who read (or thought about reading) Joe Klein's Primary Colors should read Penn Warren's book to see what a quality &quot;novel of politics&quot; is like.To be honest, I was surprised to note the number of negative reviews of this book on Amazon. Fair is fair, and everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, but how a mature reader of fiction could not enjoy this book totally escapes me."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Like a few other reviewers here, All the King's Men is my favority work of fiction ever. I first read it two years ago, and re-read it last month. I can't say whether I liked Robert Penn Warren's style or themes more - they both appealed to me. More on that in a second, however. I just want to say that, even after I finished it the second time, I kept on returning to the novel just to read select pages. This book alone accounts for three or four of my ten favorite passages.Now, everyone seems to enjoy the style of the book. It's hard not to. But the themes of All the King's Men are equally poignant. Jack Burden, the main character, deals with lost love, disgust at the life he's led and still leading, and disillusionment with modern society. Willie Stark, the demagogic governor, presents themes regarding the nature of power - is it possible to attain power and still remain moral? Can morality survive as a means, or can man only try to, as Stark says, \\"make the good from the bad?\\" Is it necessary to pander to corruption to achieve good? Penn Warren not only presents all these questions, but knows how to argue them as well. This is rare for an author - many only fancy themselves stylists, not philosophers. Penn Warren is both.I could write for days on the style of All the King's Men. Suffice it to say it's wonderful. A touch of nostalgia, a whiff of fatalism, a little cynicism here and there...since the novel is written in the first person, the writing provides the best way to get to know the narrator, Jack Burden. Because of the strength of the writing of All the King's Men, Jack Burden may be one of the most detailed and complex characters in all of american literature.I can not state this any more clearly; All the King's Men is my favorite work of fiction ever. If you haven't read it, please, please do."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The release of the new movie (disappointing) drove me back to the book, which I probably read thirty years ago. The book was a revelation. It's astonishingly good - a great American novel - but not for the reasons I remembered. If asked, most people would say All the King's Men is about the rise and fall of Willie Stark, a country lawyer who becomes the near-dictatorial governor of a poor southern state. Willie's story is based fairly closely on the life of Huey Long, the populist governor of Louisiana during the Depression. Willie is certainly a central character in the story. In fact, his attempts to bring economic justice to the poor people of his state through the imperfect vehicle of a corrupt legislature have led many critics to call All the King's Men the best novel ever written about American politics.But Willie's career is chronicled by Jack Burden, and ultimately this is not Willie's story, it's Jack's. Born into privilege, Jack rejects his upper-class background and goes to work for Willie because he believes Willie is trying to do good for the people who have been kept down by Jack's ancestors and childhood associates. Jack accepts that the means to Willie's ends aren't always pretty or pure. As Willie's right hand man, Jack spends a lot of time digging up the dirt that Willie uses to bury his political opponents. During the course of the novel, some of this dirt spatters on Jack in direct and very painful ways.What make the novel astonishing are the workings of Jack's consciousness and the prose that Warren uses to describe that consciousness. Jack is a classic American type, the cynical idealist. Jack thinks he can remove himself from his own history, only to find himself lacking the optimism and conviction he needs to fully inhabit the present. The real struggle in the novel is not Willie's attempt to soar above gutter politics, but Jack's effort to know and accept his own heart.Jack is both a romantic and a wise guy, and Warren's supple vernacular captures the full range of his expression, from soaring perorations on the moral confusion of Southern history to crude jibes at hack politicos. Jack's insights about the haphazard constructs we assemble into a self are forward looking for 1940s when this novel was written, and give this Depression era story a curiously postmodern feel. Beyond the tragic and almost gothic machinations of its plot, this novel reveals some fundamental truths about the American character. Americans are a strange blend of idealism and cynical opportunism. We're born to believe we can flee our past, right up to the point we run out of land and run out of excuses. It's only when Jack turns around and retraces his steps that he finds what he needs to go forward."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The New York Times blurb &quot;The Definitive Novel About American Politics&quot; on the cover of &quot;All the King's Men&quot; is somewhat misleading. This novel is only barely about political process and instead focuses on the quest of a man to uncover the past and how his discoveries lead to the undoing of a state of grace.The man (and narrator) is Jack Burden, who starts out as a local newspaper reporter in a thinly disguised Louisiana. A young, temperate, idealistic county treasurer named Willie Stark comes to Burden's attention during a minor scandal. Stark refuses to give in to a kickback scheme involving a contract for a schoolhouse construction project and is promptly ousted from his position. Burden's reporting of Stark's honesty starts Stark on a path toward a political career. After years of developing himself as an orator and demagogue, Stark becomes Governor and hires Burden to be a sort of right-hand man in his administration.During his political rise, Stark transforms from a naive idealist into a cynical imperialist, as his relationships to his wife and son grow distant. He is the manipulative type of man who will slap a friend reassuringly on the shoulder while browbeating and intimidating members of his administration (the &quot;king's men&quot;), such as making them write resignation letters that he personally will date when he wants to get rid of them. Especially symbolic is the possum incident at the end of Chapter 1: The Willie Stark political machine crushes anything that gets under its wheels.Stark commands Burden, who is a former history student with experience in research, to dig up dirt on a political dissenter who happens to be one of Burden's lifelong friends. In doing so, Burden uncovers a revelation that shatters not only his own life but the lives of several people close to him. The novel ends with the weight of a Shakespearean tragedy, where the line of responsibility weaves directly and indirectly through several major characters.Robert Penn Warren writes in a style that alternates between straight hard dialogue and poetic philosophical musings. It's not easy to see where the novel is going after reading only the first couple of chapters; Warren takes his time unfolding the story to allow the reader to develop a genuine interest in the characters and appreciate the wealth of ideas presented."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I had to read this book for my American Studies class, and I was weary at first, since it was relatively long. But when I started, I quickly realized that Warren was a master storyteller, and that I loved the novel. The various levels of time can be confusing, but as you progress in the novel, it becomes less of an issue. This has become one of my favorite novels, and if you have time to read it, I suggest you do so."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Yes, All the King's Men is one of the 5 greatest American novels, for all the reasons people here cite, and more.But this is not that novel. It is a piece of junk unjustly cadged together with manuscript fragments that one of America's greatest writers never wrote in this form. Despite decades to do so, in a life of over 90 years. A very careful,writer, scholar, and teacher too. This edition is a gratuitous insult to his memory and a dangerous precedent in American letters. The public should not countenance it. It doesn't matter if one paragraph or one sentence only is changed. Indeed one single word can change a whole book, as the recent restoration of Ulysees has proven. But that was justified because of: (1) an copyist's error that persisted for decades; (2) poor Joyce was blind. No such excuse exists here for putting in words that Robert Penn Warren cut out. Any writer knows that cutting is as important as writing. And certainly do not believe the ridiculous lie about the editor supposedly goofing with Warren's intention. For one thing, that was a conversation with a live man, who agreed and thereafter forever let it stand. And who certainly (several Pulitzers and every other literary award this country has to offer) eventually possessed the clout to \\"fix it\\" if he wanted to. Truth be told, this lie can be used to alter just about any book published in the last 200 years -- and so much easier after you die. For whatever reason they may like to.For decades, the community of American literary scholars has painstakingly put together a set of rules to govern the correction of texts, and the publication of manuscripts posthumously -- always to reflect the last and best intention of the author based on the evidence. For after death, this can be the only aim and only ethical endeavor.In America today, everything is now subject to fakery. Movies contain ads, even \\"news broadcasts\\" have product signs pasted in by computers. Such is our brave new world, even more tawdry than Huxley envisioned. This edition of a classic is a blatant attempt to prostitute our very cultural heritage. If they can do this to Penn Warren's masterpiece,they can do it to anybody. That is the book industry's message. That, plus a shameless attempt to pitch something \\"new\\" to go with the movie.It is especially ironic and doubly disgusting that this has been done to a book which has, as a major theme, vulger hucksterism and its dubious wages. The word left out of Ulysees, by the way, was \\"love.\\" The word invisibly yet indelibly seeped into this bogus imposture, on every page, is \\"garbage.\\"Just say no."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"First and foremost: The Kindle edition of All The King's Men is not the extended version edited by Noel Polk. If you've never read All The King's Men this is good news. If you've read it once or several times, it's still good news. This is the originally published version from 1946 - not the version that renames Willie Stark as Willie Talos.Okay, if I could take two books with me to a desert island, the first book would be All The King's Men. The second book would also be All The King's Men, in case I lost the first book. I think it's that good, but that's just my opinion and it doesn't count for much. Some people hate it; they say it's long and that it rambles and waxes poetic and has lots of philosophy in it. They're right. Some people love it for the same reasons. But there is this about it: It is full to the brim and overflowing with life. It tells a fictional story of people that lived over 75 years ago - and it could just as well be talking about people that are alive today. You will find yourself in this book and you will know yourself better if you finish it. What more can you ask?"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Have never read a book that felt more like a graduate class. No, make that three graduate classes, for there's enough in here to provide ample curriculum for Ethics in Politics 320, Rhetoric & Logic 420, and at least a full semester of Modern American Literature.The story is set in the 1930s and is told in first person by Jack Burden, former journalist-turned-aide to Willie Stark, a southern governor in the Huey Long mold: broad, brash, and bold. But now that I've gotten that out of the way you can stop worrying about it, because what this book is really about is Original Sin/corruption/moral compromise. Literally every character in this tale faces some sort of moral/ethical dilemma. A small handful (for instance, the governor's wife Lucy) manage to navigate the morass of existence without falling from grace, but the vast majority slip and fall - some out of a genuine lack of morality (for instance, the assistant governor, Tiny Duffy, a true Tammany Hall villain), but most of them gradually, one ethical compromise yielding inevitably to another, like a Jenga tower from which pieces are systematically removed until the whole thing collapses. I'm not sure whether Penn himself is clear whether this is the result of free will or a manifestation of Original Sin. One of the governor's favorite quotes, repeated often throughout the tale, is that \\"man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something [corrupt in their nature]\\" - suggesting that at least a part of him comes down on the side of Original Sin. But it's hard not to want to kick many of the (largely unsympathetic) characters in the butt every time they wittingly make choices that are obviously going to lead to catastrophe.Students of Ethics in Politics will relish the examination of how Governor Stark's noble motives become gradually corrupted by the realities of the political system in which he operates. Originally convinced to run for office by corrupt politicians counting on him to split the \\"rube\\" vote so that the state's Political Machine can continue to churn unmolested, Stark eventually turns the tables on his manipulators, but in doing so finds himself resorting to increasingly unethical methods (threats, blackmail) in order to achieve his largely unselfish and well-meaning ends. Which begs the question that seems to arise every time someone like Huey Long - or, more recently, DC Councilman Marion Berry - ends up on trial for corruption, even as thousands of deservedly grateful, devoted constituents picket the courthouse steps: can even the noblest of intentions ever justify ethically questionable means?Meanwhile, students of rhetoric and logic will be kept busy by chapter upon chapter of cascading syllogisms employed in order to justify all sorts of questionable ends. No topic seems too vast or intimidating to escape Penn's scrutiny, from life, death, and fate, to the nature of good, evil, and God. The narrator, Jack Burton, uses these syllogisms as justification for a series of increasingly dubious acts; what's less clear is whether he is self-aware enough to realize the extent to which his syllogisms are laced with sly and intricate fallacies, enough to keep a class of grad students huddled over pints of ale for months, hashing them all out.And, lest students of Modern American Lit feel left out, there's plenty left for them in examining the parallelism between ancient Greek tragedy and Stark's gradual fall from grace (substitute Judge Irwin's fall from grace, or Adam Stanton's fall from grade, or Jack Burden's fall from grace, if you prefer), culminating in a series of climaxes as horrific as they are undoubtedly hubristic. Even the names of the characters in the story - Jack Burden, Tiny Duffy, Willie Stark - are loaded with symbolic and metaphoric relevance. No - English lit students needn't feel slighted; there is more than enough here to keep them churning out papers until final exams week.In other words, this book is stuffed full of juicy, complex content - which makes it a capital book for studying, but perhaps doesn't much contribute to creating a diverting or entertaining reading experience. The characters aren't particularly likeable, the plot is largely introspective rather than event-driven, and - believe me - I'm not spoiling anything by letting it slip that no one lives happily ever after, which can make portions of this tough slogging. Guess I'm saying that while there's plenty of meat here, definitely requires an investment in energy, attention and cognition on the part of the reader in order to appropriately digest it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book won the Pulitzer and is described as \\"the finest novel ever written on American politics,\\" so I was expecting great things. However, right off the bat, in the opening chapter, I started to get a bad James Agee vibe. While Robert Penn Warren's long, rambling, stream-of-consciousness digressions are not as gratuitous as Agee's (and not so obviously written in a drunken haze), they can be equally tedious. The \\"poetic\\" repetition of the same sentences over and over grates on one's nerves after a while. Nonetheless, every so often in the midst of the rambling the author makes a really profound observation and you feel glad that you stuck with it instead of chucking the book across the room. There is some excellent characterization in \\"All the King's Men,\\" and there are some very exciting moments. Even though this book annoyed me frequently, I still feel that it has its moments of brilliance. Also, it really made me think. Therefore, I give it four stars.By the way, I noticed that sweat is a recurring motif in this novel, especially in the first third. Every character is \\"perspiring,\\" \\"damp with perspiration,\\" building up \\"beads of sweat,\\" sporting pit stains, etc. My brother, who did not like \\"All the King's Men,\\" comments: \\"Many bad \`Southern' books use the \`Long, Hot Summer' motifs of constant heat and sweat and ludicrous \`everythin' gwine be alright' dialect (see the similarly overrated Faulkner). Even modern-day novels use this conceit, even though air conditioning became commonplace during the 1950s.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All works of art are only as strong as their underlying structure. In this book the organizing theme is perhaps the most daunting question any of us will ever face: The book is built upon an examination of our universal confrontation with the impossibility of integrity, or moral wholeness, and whether our life remains worth living afterward.One character finds it is not. One becomes mad from her unknowing. One believes it doesn't matter, yet dies at the hand of another for whom nothing else matters, and who in turn dies for his belief.The protagonist and narrator, Jack Burden, is surely one of the most cynical of men, but his 650 page journey through darkness, false enlightenment, and eventually toward a dubious and paradoxical redemption, wet my face many times. Where does this effect come from? Not from the plotting (which is flawless, of course), or the magnificent and dazzling array of characters, and their epic tortures, or the stupefying command of literary craft, technique, and method the author displays, but from the sustained poetic narrative itself, every single word of which is perfectly calibrated to unlock one's deepest feelings, and to change one forever."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This was the book I most enjoyed reading in 2006.

I don't know why I waited so long to read it. It is high quality fiction, written in an era when important novels were taken seriously. There is an air of asseveration that pervades the work- it seems understood that this tract will not be taken lightly. I'll not provide a general review; rather, here are a few unexpected points of interest.The novel provides a good balance between action and mental reflection. Jack Burden, the prime political hatchet-man for Gov. Willie Stark, is the first person narrator. He has a good fix on what is happening to him, his friends and family. He can observe and articulate every gesture and nuance. He is his own psychiatrist. However, his ability to understand his condition also loses him respect in the reader's eyes. Burden does his job well, but his lack of heart and passion destroys his intimacy with the reader. The mayhem he unleashes hardly costs him a night's sleep. After it is revealed that he is complicit in patricide, I lost all respect for him. He held neither loyalty to his clan nor to an ideal. He was just a mercenary with a flair for reportage. From that point, the book was less enjoyable for me. I want my narrators to have at least one redeeming grace.I would have been pleased if the editor had culled 100 pages. The early relationship between Jack and Anne seems tedious, but perhaps in the 1940s it was hot stuff. I did enjoy the examination of Jack's Civil War ancestor- his perfidy is a harbinger of Jack's some 70 years later. I am curious as to how closely the novel tracks Gov. Long of Louisiana. It seems that Long was charged with improprieties that the fictional Judge Irwin shot himself over. I wish new editions would address the obvious similarities in a preface.The interrelationships between the characters is masterfully designed- it's Southern Gothic at its best. I don't think the most astute reader will predict all the subtilties. However, much of the prose is very mediocre- not what I'd expect from a poet. Of course, there are memorable paragraphs and scintillating lines. Here's one example from Gov. Stark on finding political dirt: \\"Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Within the confines of a bookstore one is often overwhelmed with the numerous topics and choices available to them. A solution to this problem, if a reader is interested in an engaging, magnificently written piece of literature, then take a few steps and find All The Kings Men by Robert Warren Penn.The theme is one of uncanny importance and relevancy to this stage in American lives despite the fact it was written in 1946. The story is told in the first person, the narrator is Jack Burden; a right hand man to the leading political figure in the story, the \\"Boss.\\" Interestingly, the \\"Boss\\" is based on the real life story of Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long of Louisiana.The story encompasses Jack Burdens revival from a involuntary life, as well as the metamorphosis of Willie Stark's, the \\"Boss\\", idealistic political views to the lust for power and fame. Robert Warren Penn won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, and within the last few months I can not recall a book that would equal it in quality and purpose. Penn utilizes his characters to develop and provide insight on the issues of forgiveness, power, and corruption, and the consequences of leadership.Within a bookstore there are many choices, and many possibilities to choose from, but in the busy lives of the average person today why waste the time just pick up a copy of All the Kings Men by Robert Warren Penn today."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All The King's Men is a well-written, thoughtful novel detailing the rise and fall of an idealist Louisiana local politician. Corruption is inevitable with the power given to the new governor, Willie Stark, and his team of smart, slimy, and invaluable confidants. Written from the perspective of Stark's #1 right hand man, Jack Burden, we get to see the unpolished life of a local politician who fights his way to the governorship and whose goal is to make a difference and to make a permanent and indelible mark on his state. There is no shortage of back-room bargaining and scandal, as well as two-faced public pandering. Reading this book allows the reader to see how easily it would be for one in power to get sucked into the level of influence he or she exudes. Dangerous and compelling, this novel is one that could provide an unfortunate template for our nation's politicians, whether they be dirty or clean."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Amazon lists this as a movie tie-in edition, and I must admit that I bought it because I had been attracted by the movie trailers, but wanted to read the original first. Now having done so (and still not seen the film), I cannot imagine how it would be possible to translate any but the broadest outline of this subtle masterpiece into cinematic terms.For one thing, how could one capture Robert Penn Warren's superb style? Not for nothing was he to be made the first American Poet Laureate; the story is enfolded in broad tracts of rich Southern prose-poetry, capturing the climate, the country, and the lives of the ordinary people who dwell in it. For example, consider this paragraph on page 33:\\"It looked like those farmhouses you ride by in the country in the middle of the afternoon, with the chickens under the trees and the dog asleep, and you know the only person in the house is the woman who has finished washing up the dishes and has swept the kitchen and has gone upstairs to lie down for half an hour and has pulled off her dress and kicked off her shoes and is lying there on her back on the bed in the shadowy room with her eyes closed and a strand of her hair still matted down on her forehead with the perspiration. She listens to the flies cruising around the room, then she listens to your motor getting big out on the road, then it shrinks off into the distance and she listens to the flies. That was the kind of house it was.\\"I quote this in full partly so that readers may get a sense of the riches that are in store: a style that is leisurely and expansive while remaining utterly straightforward. I quote it also because, like so many descriptions in the book, it captures a place in terms of the people who inhabit it, with a feeling for the rhythm and values of their lives. In that this is a political book at all, the charismatic politician at its center, the populist Willie Stark (loosely based on Louisiana's Huey Long), first derives his strength from just such a grassroots understanding of the ordinary people he represents.But I question whether ALL THE KING'S MEN is a political book, at least in the sense that the movie trailer appears to be marketing it. When the novel opens, Willie Stark is already the Governor of his state, and even in flashbacks there are very few scenes of him campaigning or working up crowds with his oratory. Similarily, although we see him quietly collecting information with which to dissuade his foes or manipulate his allies, any graft or corruption remains mostly beneath the surface, and Stark's descent into demagoguery is nothing compared to what was going on at the same period (the thirties) in Germany or Italy. Warren does paint a very clear picture of old-style machine politics, with Stark at the center of his web, surrounded by a small circle of \\"the boys.\\" But very little of the drama is played out in the public arena, but rather in the lives and loyalties of a small group of childhood friends from moneyed backgrounds quite different from Stark's own, who nonetheless get drawn into his orbit.Chief among these is the narrator, Jack Burden, who gradually emerges as the principal character in the novel. I quote the passage of description above because it demonstrates Jack's voyeurism. Not only does he see a farmhouse and imagine the woman inside it, but he also writes a little story about her. This characteristic continues throughout the book; Jack's imagined stories are plausible, for he is very perceptive, but they are all things that he sets in motion and watches from the outside. A failed PhD student of history, he first encounters Willie Stark while covering him as a newspaper reporter, and his objective viewpoint, his insight, and his talent for uncovering facts make him very useful to the rising politician.While Jack remains outside the political machine, fascinated but aloof, Willie Stark gradually invades Jack's own circle from his childhood home at Burden's Landing. Chief among these are Adam and Anne Stanton, the children of a former Governor, and Judge Irwin, who served as a moral guidepost and second father to Jack. Before even the first chapter is out, you know that Jack's personal allegiances will be tested. You gradually realize that because Jack is a watcher and not a doer he will fail these tests in many respects, though not utterly.In the end, this book is about Jack's journey to self-knowledge. Willie Stark's story continues to propel the plot, but he fades into the background as a force, remaining more as a touchstone for all that Jack is and is not. In movie terms, the part requires a star performer, but it is not a starring role. Jack, by contrast, is central though anything but a star. His story would be hard to realize on the screen because so much of it is internal: a moral journey played out in memories, long (sometimes overlong) paragraphs of meditation, and occasional episodes of action, brief but brilliantly realized. A true cinematic adaptation of this book would concentrate almost entirely on personal relationships. It might have elements of romance, but it would be neither an action movie nor a thriller. It would be political only in the sense that politics highlights the question of how good intentions may lead to evil ends, and bad means may be necessary to acheive good results. But this moral conundrum is eternal, and Robert Penn Warren has found a wonderfully intimate and subtle means of adressing it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Perhaps, by now, you will have heard that All the King's Men has been made into a film (again) which will be released this September. Because Hollywood always goes for the glamour, I wanted to read this novel before the mega-celebrities' beautiful faces spoil my ability to imagine the characters as real 1930's Southerners. The first thing a movie script takes away from a novel is the reader's thrill of discovery, of apprehending the psychological detail which fuels characters' motivations. The dramatic kick of the film visuals is a pleasure but too often films substitute for our experience; the true test of Warren's precise prose is that we bring our individual knowledge of life to bear on what he shows us. Warren's prose is so detailed that I felt I was in the South, the ordinary South of the Depression Era. I fear that in today's fast-paced life people will have lost the taste for Warren's carefully crafted sentences and dense detail.Warren is as precise with landscape description as he is with human interaction. Because each sentence and image is connected, it's difficult to quote Warren: \\"It was very hot and very still. You could look down the bay, beyond the cove, toward the Gulf, and see the water lifting up into the light as though the horizon had ceased to exist.\\"People who go to the film before the novel will have the pleasure of looking at Jude Law as Jack Burden, but if you skip the novel you will miss the self-education of a man, the training of a sentient being. The novel could have been titled, The Education of Jack Burden, since Burden is the narrator and it is through his consciousness that we experience Willie Stark, a.k.a. Willie Talos."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is the story of Jack Burden who, as assistant to Governor Willie Stark, describes the inner workings of the political machine (of which he is an integral part) that consolidates and strengthens Stark's power. The corruption of the Stark administration, and Jack's involvement in that corruption make this a compelling story. But the real power of this book is in the development and portrayal of its characters, especially Jack Burden. The description of his transformation into someone who recognizes his responsibility over the consequences of his choices and actions over a period of several years and 400+ pages is remarkable yet believable.No other book that I have read compares to this book in its combination of enjoyable and exciting reading; believable character developments; and beautiful descriptions of events, activities, thoughts, feelings, conversations, and surroundings."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"One of my all-time favorite American novels! Although touted as the definitive novel about American politics, All the King's Men reveals more about the lens (narrator Jack Burden) through which we look than the actual subject.The writing is lyric and engaging, although long-winded, and discourages some less-determined (or appreciative) readers. I like a book I have dig into, like a juicy steak. Warren's misuse of the English language is brilliant. Each sentance can be savored and enjoyed.Structurally interesting, we meander through Burden's life in a manner bolder than, but not unlike Proust's Swann's Way. Be sure to leave some mental bread crumbs, the extra effort is well worth it.Overall, excellent!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This World War II-era, Pulitzer-winning novel ostensibly chronicles the rise and fall of Willie Stark. Loosely based on Louisiana boss Huey Long, Stark is an ultra-charismatic, larger-than-life, Clinton-esque, Southern governor looking to reach the U.S. Senate. In truth, though, the political story ultimately yields to the personal story of Jack Burden, a reporter turned right-hand man to Stark and the first-person narrator of the book.Burden's vibrantly crackling, descriptive, often lyrical narrative drives the story throughout, frequently delving into the past--his own and others'--to comment upon the present and, just as frequently, infusing descriptions of events with cutting questions of philosophy and observations of human nature. Burden's chronicles introduce a variety of utterly realistic and memorable minor characters--his ex-wife; his mother; Stark's chauffeur; a judge; the girlfriend of his youth and her brother, just to name a few--and seldom wane in intensity.The one weakness I noticed was that much of the language and dialogue relies on Depression Era slang that can prove distracting and require a bit of thought to figure out. This proved especially true in the beginning of the novel, the pacing of which is by no means fast; however, once the story got going, I noticed it less and less. And the last chapter, as Jack struggles with the meaning of all that has happened--struggles to understand if there even is any meaning--is simply sublime.A highly recommended tour de force and great American novel--not so much for its insight into politics, but for its insight into human nature in the whirlwind of history and politics. A book worth owning and re-reading. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"As a visitor living here for a few years I have decided to read the cream of American Fiction.I must say in this book I struck gold.The writer seemed to have the skill to combine a hugely compelling plot,elaborate character development and prose which at times was poetic.The novel is full of timeles themes such as the greed and corruption of the body politic,sowing what one will reap and the importance of friends and roots,it is all there.This novel for me was a great discovery and I was in awe from start to finish.This is compelling reading and stands head and shoulders above some of the modern writing we are getting today.I would recommend this book to anyone.......it is a must read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I have a list of books that I put into the category, \\"Books Every American Must Read.\\" I don't put books on that list thoughtlessly, but All the King's Men occupies one of the top spots. Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city, or even a country come down to the mentality of just a few individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates people to the point that they become unable to consider the humanity that surrounds them, so that the meaning of what they are doing is disconnected from their ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\"friend of his youth,\\" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, and he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\"boss,\\" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it metaphorically \\"predicted\\" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades. Finally, the main female character in this book is one of the most complex, unforgettable people you will ever meet in a novel.As an aside, the recent bestseller, \\"Primary Colors,\\" has a main character with the name Jack Stanton, which happens to also be the name of one of the main political figures in this book. I have always thought it was NOT a coincidence, but no other reviewer writing about either the book or the movie that came later has pointed this out."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book was written before the baby boomers had slacker kids... it shows that the trend for unhappy self-centered people who have ot hitchike on other people's energy started a long time before the slacker generation. Every person who was disappointed in his family and freinds being less than perfect will understand Jack Burden, and every person who wished that somebody, anybody would take charge will admire Willie Stark. And every woman who screwed around with someone else's husband and was then offended when the jerk screwed around on her had best take Sadie to heart. This doesn't have anything to do with politics for me. That was just the incidental setting for a great study of grownups who never outgrow their need to be loved. And in this age of television blurring the distinct regional speech patterns except when artifically exaggerating them, this book does a wonderful job of capturing the humor and imagery of down home speech that I enjoyed reading almost as much as Clude Edgerton's &quot;Raney&quot;."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is one of the great books in the American literary canon.

DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Written in the post war era, published in 1946, this book simultaneously idolizes and humanizes the Huey-Long like personality of Louisiana's grand governor - Willie Stark.Cleverly, the spots of Willie Stark and his wife, Lucy, and son, Tom, are not the heart or center of this book. It is really about the narrator (Jack Burden), whose perspective delivers us to the inside world of the political smoke-filled negotiating rooms of the state' deal makers. Why deals must be made, how deals must be made, the purposes for deals, and more information about the machinations of political machinery are disclosed.Not surprisingly, what happens in these pages is similar to what happened in the same time period 1,300 miles away in Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather.\\" Stark is Louisiana's Don Corleone.And, like Corleone, there are lickspittles - \\"yes men.\\" And, like Corleone, one will betray the leader. Like Corleone, there is a fair-haired son whose antics are governed more by his libido than brains. Like Corleone, the provider wants to deliver a world to his child that he could not have. And, like Corleone, his efforts encounter tragedy. Greek theater does not deliver greater tragedy.The book is highlighted - in this reader's perspective - by the down-home farm metaphors constantly recited in the dialogue of Stark - the \\"Boss.\\" And the zingers delivered by narrator Jack Burden also bring cheer. Many of the contrarian and pithy statements they deliver remind me of the great lines written by Ayn Rand in \\"The Foutainhead.\\"Beneath the story of the Starks is the story of the Burdens. All of it. From Jack Burden's boyhood days living on the \\"Row\\" of \\"Burden's Landing.\\" He recalls his childhood relationship with his \\"first love\\", Anne Stanton, and her brother (and his best friend), Adam Stanton, the children of then Governor Stanton. He recalls how his education was enhanced by neighborly and fatherly Judge Irwin. And, in great detail, he recalls how his freshmen days were tainted by beautiful Anne Stanton's breaking of his heart.The beat and rhythm of this book has a few slow spots - Jack Burden's smitten character with Anne Stanton when they were teenagers; and his thorough description of the book that he never published on \\"Cass Mastern.\\" But, those spots are easily overlooked when the Stark dialogue comes about and the human intricacies of the Row and governor grow until they reach a crescendo where either good music or disaster must arrive.William Faulkner's Lafayette County is rivaled by William Penn Warren's \\"Burden's Landing.\\"Robert Penn Warren's greatest work is claimed to be this novel. Warren's works have always been well received. This is one of many glorified novels or works. After winning one National Book Award, three Pulitzers, the National Medal of Freedom, and the MacArthur Prize, this book sturdily sits on a very high pedestal"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I was soundly defeated by this book in my early 20s. Although I could appreciate the flashes of genius and the beautiful passages which populate the book, I got lost in the weeds of the characters and politics and eventually gave it up as hopeless.I picked it up again this year after reading and enjoying some poetry by Warren. I had the idea that I might be better able to appreciate the book now that I was older. The idea was a good one, as it happens. Either my patience has increased, or I understand the characters better now, or something. In any case, the book really spoke to me this time around.You can find a lot of information about the political side of the novel-- the comparisons between Willie Stark and Huey Long are many and well documented. I have to confess that I was more interested in the intersection between the personal and the political than in the probable historical parallels. There is something really nice about Willie Stark's fall from idealism as highlighted by Jack Burden's simultaneously cynical and romantic narration. Dressed up as a political novel, All The King's Men somehow manages to put the focus squarely on the people involved.Warren is a poet writing prose. This is worth bearing in mind when you pick up the book. The digressions into the thought or the moment are many. Although generally very beautiful, it can often be quite tricky to follow the thread of the plot. If you bear in mind that the digressions are as important as the point, I believe that you will struggle with it a lot less. Nobody will ever accuse the novel of being terse. It is very big and often windy, in the best and grandest possible fashion.I would recommend the book to nearly everybody. Do not let its label as a political novel put you off, imagining that it will be dry and boring. It is a lovely book-- one that I suspect that I will go back to several more times in this life."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I don't have a whole lot to add to the accolades this book. The story for me was relatively straightforward, with the twists and surprises really pretty predictable. But the story and what could be considered its shortcomings for me were not an issue at all; I still thoroughly enjoyed this book, and likely will read it again within the year. Its prose is absolutely brilliant, flowing and fluid, creating colors and feelings, taking me far deeper into the world inhabited by the narrative and its characters than just about any other book I've ever read. Of course Robert Penn Warren was a poet laureate; how could he not be, given the depth and feeling of his writing. Whether you know it at the beginning, you can't escape his poet-ness and his poetry as you read this work, thoroughly enoyable from beginning to end.I especially liked his fascinating detours into discussions of religion and belief, the nature of faith, the power of West and moving toward it, so strangely in tune with what I have come to believe and feel as well.If you enjoyed this book, I'd recommend James Dickey'sDeliveranceor even better,To the White Sea.This is an outstanding book, a wonderful read, and one to keep around the house and enjoy again and again. I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I've read this book many times. It is bittersweet meditation on human weakness, loss, and learning the way of the world. The depth of this book is such that different themes resonate at different points of your life, like a dark gem. Penn Warren's evocation of the changeful, aching, moments of life is nothing short of masterful."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book is simply a treasure. Robert Penn Warren is well known as a poet and the prose of All the King's Men often approaches the level of poetry in its beauty. The story is wonderfully composed, with striking characters and deep insight into American politics and the human character. It would be wrong to consider this an accurate portrait of the historical Huey Long, but Warren has used the historical basis to create an outstanding work of fiction. I could not give a book any higher review."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I was never forced to read this book in school, and had only picked it up (secondhand) because the title had lodged itself in the back of my mind. I'm glad to have discovered it. I'm a fan of Salinger, and Pynchon, and Heller, and most anyone who writes of the (probably passe by now) moral ambivilance of the modern world. Whatever you may think of the stance taken by these authors, I think you will find, as I have found, that this book anticipates that attitude, one which I had always associated with the late 1950's. Reading &quot;All the Kings Men&quot; has given me much insight into the great books which came later, as I consider how those authors must have thought and felt, creating their work with Mr. Warren hanging over them. &quot;All the Kings Men&quot; is a fabulous work, and I'm not sure that its treatment of ethics has been surpassed by those which came after."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I'm currently a high school senior and we read this book in our AP English class. Despite the long nightly readings, I enjoyed this book tremendously. If you liked &quot;Primary Colors,&quot; the movie based upon this book, you'll enjoy All the King's Men. Even though it sounds really political, it is just an introduction to the process and politics does not overwhelm this book at all. It is a wonderful character study with lots of action. You'll find yourself quoting this book without even realizing it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I definitely had my doubts while I was reading it, but now in reflection this is probably one of my three favorite novels. If you can withstand the slow first chapter, keep reading - the final chapter is nearly impossible to put down and is undoubtedly one of the most captivating and best-written chapters in American literature. DON'T read this book to learn about the political rise and fall of Willie Stark. Most reviews say that the book is about him, when the book is really about Jack Burden, the narrator. Warren at times is really amazing; his prose in countless paragraphs is as good as or better than any 20th century American novelist. The book is long, and often times slow, but it is a priceless piece of fiction, and I think it would be difficult to find an educated reader who would be disappointed in the end."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren, who in 1986 was named the nation's first Poet Laureate, won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for this tremendous novel. It is my personal pick for the Great American Novel and I would place it just below Orwell on the Top 100 of the 20th Century list.Most will be familiar with it's Huey Long derived tale of the rise and fall of populist politician Willie Stark. Jack Burden, the narrator, is a newspaperman who hitches himself to Stark's rising star. Eventually, Stark calls on Burden to get the goods on the lilly white Judge Irwin, the surrogate father of Jack's youth and a man of widely acknowledged rectitude:Jack: But suppose there isn't anything to find.Stark: There is always something.Jack: Maybe not on the Judge.Stark: Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink to the diddie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.Sure enough, Jack digs until he finds the ugly truth and unleashes a series of shocking revelations and tragic deaths.I'm sure that this must seem too cynical to some, but it is actually a marvelous retelling of the essential Puritan democratic myth that informs the American system. Politics after all is nothing but a system of choices about how some men will wield power over other men. All of the choices are bad, but the alternative--the lawless State of Nature--is worse and so we try to make the best bad choices possible. But we must remain ever vigilant against those who wield power over us &amp; noone is more dangerous than the populist or the do-gooder who cloaks himself in the mantle of the Good &amp; the Right. FDR and his New Deal come hand in glove with interring the Japanese Americans and packing the Supreme Court. LBJ and Civil Rights are accompanied by profound personal corruption and Viet Nam. And, of course, when you elect the purely evil, you get Detente + Watergate or the Health Care Plan + Monica + Chinagate, etc. The only politicians who are even mildly trustworthy are those who renounce the very powers of government--George Washington, William McKinley, Calvin Coolidge, Eisenhower &amp; Reagan.This is a book that John Adams would have loved and you will too.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book won the Pulitzer, as well as made the Modern American Library's list of the top 100 books of the 20th century. As far as I'm concerned, it's flawless. Why? I've a deep hankerin' for Southern fiction, and I read any of it that I can get my hands on. The story of Willie Stark and his political rise and fall parallels not only its true origins as a fictionalized account of the life of Louisiana politician, Huey Long, it also has as much to say about today's political landscape (Bill Clinton...did you read this book?). Side note: the film version also won the Best Picture Oscar in 1949."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"In his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel All the King's Men, Robert Penn Warren proves he knows more about writing than just the simple mechanics. Strongly defined characters and a setting so real you can taste the air provide the foundation for this literary masterpiece, yet the real genius of the book is in Warren's understanding of the reader and his use of style to convey a personal tone in the reading.The main characters in All the King's Men are Jack Burden and Willie Stark. Jack, the narrator, was a reporter before joining Stark's bid for political power. Stark began as a small country lawyer who saw something wrong and tried to change it, but he eventually becomes a politician in the truest sense, so much so that the narrator can only think of Stark as &quot;the Boss,&quot; an ominous title indeed. Accompanying these two men is an array of equally fascinating minor characters such as Sadie, a saucy married woman influential in developing Stark's position as a politician, and Sugar Boy, an Irishman so named for his affinity for sugar. Every character has depth and realism and can stand alone as a fully-developed individual.While the characters are clearly an enjoyable part of the story, the setting is even more compelling. Warren's word choice is superb; he chooses to include and omit just the right combination of words to paint a realistic picture in the reader's mind without becoming too cumbersome. It is a balance few authors are able to achieve with such proficiency and yet another way in which Warren demonstrates his almost supernatural understanding of the reader. The best part is, it only gets better.If characters and setting can be described as masterfully crafted, then Warren's grasp of tone is inexplicable. Simply put, the story truly speaks to the reader and could never have been as effective were it written any other way. Sentence structure, word selection, and dialect coalesce into a tangible atmosphere that projects a strong sense of familiarity onto the reader. The book is hard to put down because of this sense of familiarity.Overall, All the King's Men is a book enjoyable in many more ways than one, with intriguing characters, realistic setting, and a true understanding of the needs of the reader. Even after fifty years, this book remains a classic appealing to all generations."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It's a story of the polictics of humanity and how it plays out in government.

A must read, especially if you're not fond of political novels."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This ranks as one of the five best American novels that I have ever read. The story rings as true today as it did when it was written. The story is that of the rise and fall of a Southern politician, Willie Stark, a humble small town lawyer and reform politician , who wins over the people and ascends to the rank of Governor. As Willie's popularity rises so does his ambition and he becomes the most poweful man in the State who will stop at nothing to maintain his power. I agree with a reveiwer who says that Willie Stark is one of the great characters of American literature but so is Jack Burden, who transforms himself from a cynical follower, who performs several distasteful acts for Willie , to someone who does the right thing at the end. Even Willie comes full cicrle at the end. The secondary characters are wonderful. Allegedly the story is loosely based on the Huey Long storyand set in Louisiana; but it could just as easily be based on a number of other Southern politicians in any part of the Deep South."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I am completely shocked by &quot;Tina's Friends&quot; and their comments.

They are perhaps our greatest influence, and certainly our greatest teachers. -Reader, 11th Grade"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"As a member of the Agrarians and a leader of the new critics, Penn-Warren's talents in Southern novel writing come alive in this novel. All the King's Men presents the reader with a vision of mid 20th century Southern politics through the adapted story of Huey Long. This narrative also includes page turning elements of the mystery novel while covering tricky issues common in Southern literature. For example, the protagonist deals with the notion of a southern cavalier or hero (Cass Mastern-civil war), behaviorism in the form of the &quot;great twitch&quot; as seen by a doctor friend, and other areas of S oren Kierkegaard influence like the &quot;leap of faith&quot; required of the protagonist. This book is painted with the rich Southern tradition of language, religion, friendship, and romance; it also deals with the simple struggle for good in a time of personal and political decay. Penn-warren's novel can present some student readers difficulty without notes; nonetheless, most readers will leave this book knowing why it deserves its place in the Southern literary genre."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The descriptive passages in this text are able to take me, an Australian of this era, into the lives homes and meeting places of people of a different era and nationality.The characterisation weaves through the narrative to provide a consistency unparalled in other writings.The writer cleverly builds to the climatic and devastating discovery by the anti hero (Jack Burden) that nothing is safe (or sacred) from corruption - even his boyhead love."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"There were a few too many stains for my taste, and there was some writing on the inside though for the price it was a great deal."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It's an amazing book.

At least I wasn't!."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is a beautifully written book which gives us a fascinating look at the interior workings of one man's political dreams, and how he tries to accomplish them. The novel gives us a glimpse into the underhanded, controlling, backstab-your-own-kin tactics of politicians and their cronies, and that is always enjoyable. Sometimes the book becomes a bit long and plodding, but other times it is a pageturner. And, as I said before, Warren writes with a beautiful turn of phrase."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Warren's novel -- one of the best American novels ever written, I believe -- is beautiful and evocative, but it is only tangentially about politics and Willie Stark. It is instead primarily concerned with history; specifically, the New South and the Old South, one generation versus another, backwoods Jeffersonian agrarianism versus modern political ambition. Willie Stark is certainly an important character; it is with him, after all, that the novel reaches its violent climax. But Jack Burden, tortured former graduate student, keen observer of everyday life, is the true focus of the novel; through the course of the book, we see the world through him, and come away shaking with revelation and uncertainty."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I read the restored edition. The first chapter (which Warren wrote before the editors got hold of it) was added as an appendix, along with an editorial afterward. I think I preferred the ORIGINAL first chapter. This restored edition used the name Willie TALOS, instead of Stark. Again, it was the editor who got Warren to change it...the editor didn't like Talos. Loved the story, but I suppose I am showing my ignorance (yet again), in saying that I didn't like the WAY it was written. I judge a book two ways...overall story and writing style. I am not a classics scholar, so what do I know. Of course the book was narrated by Jack Burden, former newspaper reporter turned right-hand-man to the governor. So I guess if you looked at it that way, it is understandable why it was written the way it was written. Some words are misused like \\"pore ground\\" instead of \\"poor ground\\", in speaking about the farmability of the land. This one really \\"stuck\\" out, but there were others that I don't remember, as I didn't make a note of them. Maybe this was just Jack Burden being sarcastic, I don't know. Being from Louisiana, I was especially curious about this book because it is supposed to be loosely based on former Governor Huey Long, who was assassinated in the state Capitol building. It has made me want to read up on Long. I didn't see the Academy Award winning movie starring Broderick Crawford (who won an Oscar for his role as Willie Stark). I wanted to read the book before seeing either movie."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Wow!This book was great! I read some reviews before I read this book, but when I started reading the book I though \\"how boring\\" he is talking about a highway???? But after this the book got much better. This book has every type of style of writing, romance, action, comedy ,drama. I really thought the ending was perfect, I really didn't see Adam doing something like that, he didn't seem like he could kill a fly. This is why I like this book it doesn't follow the way it should. Nice little country boy turning into [debauch],\\" bust or buy em'\\" Willie Stark. The other part of this book I liked is that it was from Jack burden's point of view, this story is from the eyes of a political aide, not from the governer. This gives it a diferent look on what was going on. Jack Burden is basically Stark's best friend,although Jack calles Adam his best friend, he is not. Adam and him are holding onto a relationship that doesn't exist anymore. It is just a memory of what they had in their youth. The age of each of these characters is different then what you may think. Jack is 41-42 years old when he is telling this story, but he is not at all mature. He doesn't understand what death means and still has a slightly perverted outlook on life. Willie Stark's age I could not figure out, but he must have been a good bit older then Jack, beacuse he calles him \\"boy\\". This is not some thing that would happen in real life. For this to be realistic Stark must have been at least 65 years of age, which I don't belive he was. Anne Stanton was another one whose age was distorted, She is about 37-38, but Jack still thinks of her as the 17 year girl he loved. Before I figured out how old he was through dates, I thought he was maybe mid to early thirty's, I also thought that Stark was about 55 or so. In Jack's eyes he views Adam as a brother as well as a friend, but he views him as a younger brother, he refers in the book about Adam's age \\"around mine\\", he also states that he alway's wins the verbal arguments and Adam won at sports. Adam is the stero type of the sucessful younger brother who Jack feels has everything he lacks, passion and peace. Which makes it ironic when Adam kills Willie for he doesn't seem to need to( I know that Anne was fooling around Willie, and that Adam was her brother, but it really should have been someone else. Which brings me to the point that it was not Sadie or Tiny's fault that Willie was killed. In the end it was Adams who pulled the trigger not tiny or Sadies fault. O.K. I've talked too much already, great book, read it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"As a California-based mystery novelist with Southern roots stretching back many generations, I was raised hearing from my father about the great things Huey Long accomplished in Louisiana--the schools, the universities, the roads, the bridges, and the hospitals. Dad never mentioned the quasi-police state the populist governor established while he ruled Louisiana. While in college, I first read Robert Penn Warren's fictionalized treatment of the founder of the Long Dynasty. ALL THE KING'S MEN tells the story of Willie Stark, an initially idealistic small-town pol who learns how to win big by losing first. Jack Burden, Stark's idealistic hatchetman, narrates the tale and shows the reader how Willie becomes slowly corrupted by wealth, power, and ego. I've read this book many times, and each time I find myself fascinated by the moral ambiguities of the Stark character. Willie got into politics to do good. Even at the end, he still believes he is on the side of right battling the forces of evil. In his novel, Robert Penn Warren wrote, I contend, the most perceptive biography of Huey Long ever written. ALL THE KING'S MEN is a literary landmark of the last century."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I doubt if any book would ever comes close to the experience of reading Penn Warren's book. There are passages that are everlasting oasis of thought. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book was a nice read. A good classic to have under your belt that isn't too complicated or hard to follow. I enjoyed it and recommend it, even for those who don't care much about politics."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The plot involves Jack Burden, failed historian and fallen aristocrat, who has become a political hatchet man for a charismatic populist politician, Willie Stark, who believes that the greater good may be cultivated if well fertilized by the corruption of his friends and the carcasses of his enemies. Jack's duties include gathering weapons for use against those enemies, like biblical David before him, by gathering stones with which to fell the Goliaths of a more genteel, if scarcely less corrupt, plutocracy who formerly ran the state. But it is not the stones themselves that Jack gathers but rather the creepy crawlies living underneath the stones unearthed that will eventually allow Jack to be so successful that tragedy will ensue for all, good and evil alike.This theme of raking through the muck of bygone days resonates with me as I first read this book as a youth some forty years ago and as I reread it I see my childhood and this book in a different light. But as I understand more of this book than I did upon first reading, I fear that one need not delve so deeply into the past to see the relevance of this book today and into the future. Although inspired by Louisiana's Governor Huey Long, one need not look to the thirties to see the type. Stark rather resembles a certain Arkansas governor of recent vintage whose wife, like Stark, attempted to redeem the family of its sins by providing free health care to the less fortunate. One need not squint too hard to see in Anne Stanton, that paragon of female nobility whose virtue could not survive an encounter with Willie Stark, the National Organization of Women who were only too willing to overlook the sexual improprieties, lies and corruption of their Willie Stark if only he pretended to respect them in the morning. Why, even the senator from Massachusetts may be glimpsed as Tom Stark drunkenly drives into a culvert ruining the life of a young lady companion with no consequence to himself, although admittedly Tom had the foresight to avoid plunging the car into water. Huey Long promised to raise Louisiana up out of the muck but mired it in corruption just as Willie Stark promised to raise a Louisiana-like state only to see it sunk into corruption. Now we see the results of an additional seventy years of Democratic good old boy (and girl) corruption in Louisiana as it struggles to blame others for its failures of government to the detriment of the very people in pretends to help but, in fact, victimizes.So off we go into the future as the citizens of Louisiana and elsewhere continue to not only accept but to positively demand a snake oil salesman, well acquainted with his wares due to close family relations, to lead them into the promised land. Too bad that we, like Jack Burden, Willie Stark, and the rest, will find more venom than remedy from the fangs of the serpent we demand."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The author has a way of weaving seemingly far-flung stories into the backbone of this story. If you're used to that sort of thing, you'll be in heaven. If you're not, hang in & go with the flow -- RPW writes as theough he swallowed a dictionary and the complete works of William Faulkner, but before you know it, you'll get into the mental rhythm and you'll feel as though you're in a rocking chair on a hot summer day, drinking sweet tea from a Mason jar and listening to the cicadas.The book is *so* pertinent to the present state of politics."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book though written long ago, really transends time. The story, of course based on the Kingfish, Huey Long is a lesson in absolute power corupting absolutely. The book reads very quickly and the proes are well crafted. If you have any interest in Southern politics or frankly, just enjoy a great book, then i cant conceive of you not being pleased that you took the time to read this book, it's time well spent. Oh and go see the movie, Sean Penn is electric."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize Winner \\"All the King's Men\\" is a very convincing roman &agrave; clef, whose key is a famous populist southern politician Huey P. Long, \\"the Kingfish,\\" former governor of Louisiana and that state's U. S. senator in the mid-1930s. Real life similarities aside, the novel is a complex character study of how corruptive power can be. The writer uses the politics as an excuse to exam the corruption of the human soul.The main character, Willie Stark, is a simple man with a good heart, that degenerates when he is on his way up to the power. His journey is chronicled by his right-hand man, an ex-journalist named Jack Burden. As the narrator tells the politician's life, he exposes the lives of many characters, as Stark's wife, son and other people.Since in the novel the characters and their evolution are more important than the action, Warren takes his time to develop them thoroughly. Every character from the most important to the least one. Of course, Stark is the most complex character and we can fully believe in his changes. Another great character is Sadie Burke. She is considered Stark's secretary, probably because in that time they didn't use the expression political advisor. She makes believable the expression \`behind every great man there is a great woman'.\\"All the King's Men\\" is one of those fundamental books that one is supposed to read in order to understand the world we live in. Warren has a very lucid vision of the political game as well the human behavior. A book that is so real that sometimes is scary."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I refer to the 'restored edition' edited by Noel Polk. Warren's novel is the story of a political strongman, Governor Willie Talos (known as Stark in most editions of the novel). It describes his rise, the political machinations of his tenure and his ultimate downfall. Much of this makes for entertaining and salacious gossip for those attracted to the stories of backroom, tactical politicking. It is especially interesting to see how Willie was before his success: a too-smart, earnest crusader for the mythical 'little man'. There is certainly a kind of political statement in this novel and Warren pits Willie's demagoguery against Whiggish Republicanism in a famous dinner scene near the middle of the book.My problem is with the narrator, Jim Burden. Warren spends some time on his backstory and relates it to the Willie political story through the figure of the judge. While he makes sense in the Burdens' Landing setting, Burden himself is lost in the political story. I could understand why he *might* stray from his roots to support Willie, but the novel does not focus enough on this aspect of the story. It is a timeless theme, of course, and Warren might have developed this angle more. Instead, the real father background to Burden just comes across as a randomly assigning a debased aspect to his genealogy.The edition is nice and Noel Polk does a nice job in the afterward and it is interesting to see the removed beginning to the first chapter."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Never in my reading experience have narrative and stream-of-consciousness so thoroughly complemented one another in one work. I was loaned this book before I began some business travel alone and I am tempted to say that Jack Burden is the best travel companion I have ever had.When a reading of a work of prose by itself almost explains the fact that its author was a poet laureate, you know you have been treated to a masterpiece. Passages like an early one wherein Jack describes the feeling of watching Willie about to give a speech (which Willie begins by saying that is exactly what he is not going to do) and likens it to finding an envelope and not wanting to open but having to because \\"the end of man\\" is to know what is in that envelope even though the \\"sad little foetus which is you in the dark which is you too\\" doesn't want to know. And a later sequence when Jack explains why he went west (the short answer is because \\"that's what we do\\", but Jack/Warren says it much better). These and many others are almost all the reason I need to read at all.I went to a bookstore (sorry, Amazon, could not wait even a day) and bought two copies so I could give back the one I was loaned, keep one to read and loan to people, and give one to a friend to be determined. That's how much I loved this.I have not read the version that was originally published. I may decide to some day out of curiosity or I may not. But I know I will read this version several more times in my life."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I read this book my junior year of highschool, for English class. It was a very well written book, and it is very accurate about Louisiana politics. I will be honest, it isn't the most exciting book in the world. The chapters are at least 50 pages long each, but I really liked the style in which the author wrote, and I found it a very good book. If you need a lot of action to keep you going with a book, this isn't the book for you. But if you are looking for something more for its style, then this is definitely a good thing to check out. It also gives you a good perspective on Lousiana politics."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I'd always shied away from this classic because I thought it was about a Louisiana politician, Willie Stark, modeled after the recent assassinated Senator Huey P. Long. He's the background. But the real story is 15 years in the life of Jack Burden, Governor Stark's assistant. The novel follows Burden from his failed engagement to a college sweetheart, to his failure as a grad student in literature, to cynical newspaperman, to his job digging up dirt on opponents of Stark's political ambitions. The most interesting things that he digs up on behalf of Stark turn out to yield surprising information about his own family."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"but the book is the way to go...the unofficial &quot;biography&quot; of louisiana governor huey long....i read this book when i was a senior in college; it is one of those books that makes you glad you love reading and will deepen your appreciation of literature... willie stark started out wanting to do good for the people but was destroyed by his ulterior motives and treachery... the story of jack burden is equally fascinating as it sometimes paralells stark's, but takes twists and turns all its own...even if you don't love politics, you'll still love this book...the perfect graph for understanding human nature and for finding out why people do dirt..."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The novel itself turned out to be better than I had expected it to be after listening to the first part on the audio cd set. However, the content of the novel is not the topic of this review, the audio edition is. I had been assigned the book for my Lit class and figured the audio version would help me understand the writing. However, I never even finished listening to the CDs. First of all, the narrator's voice is so gravelly and unappealing that it was a low-level version of torture to listen to. Secondly, the writing is difficult enough to follow on page, but on audio with no writing or punctuation to go from, the story is nearly impossible to follow. Unless you have no other option, go for the print version of this book- the audiobook will only frustrate you."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It was so busy of a book I felt I had to read it super fast and didn't have time for it to soak into my mind. was not happy with it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I feel like a cheerleader: was this book great or what? I was just awed by it, great characters, both flawed and glorious, great story line, great setting, really great writing (it was awesomely devastating to read, time after time, sentences that I could never craft to be their equal in power and economy), and great theme (pick one that's most relevant for you, they fairly ooze off the pages). For me, the pertinent theme was what Jack's ancestor discovered: that you can't step on the fine spider web of existence without shaking everyone else's footing. If absolute power corrupts absolutely, it doesn't just affect the Willie Starks of the world, it affects us all. I love it because with this book Penn says: Here is where we are in American culture, and I don't have any answers. That's for all of you to figure out. I love his teaching that isn't undercut by what could have been a lot of ineffectual preaching."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I read this book initially during my junior year of high school, and I believe that it was the first (and perhaps only) literary work to instantly change my entire outlook on life. While the first chapter seems tedious, as so many reviewers have commented, I think that this shows the readers' inability to immediately access and appreciate Warren's distinctive prose, rather than a flaw in the writing. As I read on and became more involved in the characters, I realized how Jack Burden's rambling observations on human existence held even greater importance than the politically-charged plotline. Warren perfectly captures the mortal struggle to find meaning and order in the vast chaos of reality. This is the kind of novel best read slowly and carefully, so as to digest its themes and elegant style with the thoroughness they deserve."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book started off slow, but you have to stick in there in order to get up to speed, just like taking off in a sport's car. By the time I was less than half-way through, I did not want to put it down! Jack Burden follows the political career of Willie Stark from start to finish, and in doing so surprises the reader at every turn. Almost a dictator, Willie rose from essentially nothing to essentially everything in a matter of years, possessing strength and power only known to those who can manipulate and have people completely under their control at the mention of a threat. The novel explores two arenas of life: political and philosophical. Jack Burden is the narrator, and since most of the book is his story as much as it is Willie's, he has a lot to say on life, and makes some great points throughout the novel. Politically, the book explores the dimensions and evils of the political scene and the thirst for power among political leaders. One of the main issues to be brought up (in the mind of the reader) is: does power corrupt? Willie's story does a good deal in explaining that question. The reader himself shall decide in the end. Though at times Jack Burden's descriptions were too drawn out, the book as a whole is a masterpiece. Recommended for all, especially those interested in politics. If one is not interested in politics, they will be by the end of the book (myself included). The book is exciting in its action and detail of events, enlightening in areas of philosophy, yet horrifying in the aspect that anyone can rise to political power and virtually become a dictator within a democratic society. The title of the book seems to echo the words of an ancient nursery rhyme, Humpty-Dumpty. Change the name to Willie Stark, pack more &quot;men&quot; into the story-line, and you have a modern-day example of the strength, yet fragility, of political power. A great novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Penn Warren was a poet laureate, and word is that it took him 10 years to write this book because he treated each line like a line of poetry. I have read the book three times now, and it is the type of work where I feel I will keep gleaning more wisdom from it as time goes on. Whenever I am feeling overwhelmed and scared about the direction my life might be going in, I re-read passages that somehow capture what is essential about the passage of life through time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"&quot;All the Kings Men&quot; is not about politics.There.

The first 100 pages were a bit confusing because I couldn't tell where the story was headed. However, I kept on reading and I'm glad I did. By the time I neared the end, I had to stay up until 2am to finish the book. The many subplots throughout the story unfolded in such a subtle way that I didn't realize until later that they were all building up to a beautiful, interwoven, complex, story of how people and the passage of time come together to create history and all of its truthful glory. This book is worth the read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Emerson said of Plato's Republic, it is more than a book it is a world. This is also true of Penn Warren's classic political novel. But the political story of the rise and fall of the demagouge Willie Stark is just a veneer for the real story. The real story is the struggle of Jack Burden, the cynical and emotionally reclusive narrator, to understand himself and his role in the chaotic world that surrounds him. This book is a probing reflection into the soul on par with Miller's \\"Death of a Salesman.\\" The movie starring Jude Law and Sean Penn did not do it any kind of justice. A must read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Jack was a journalist living in the 1930s in the South. As a newspaperman he had the opportunity to follow the early political campaign of the idealistic Willie Stark, a farm boy who thought he could make a difference and agreed to run when some powerful men asked him.Little did Willie know that he was a stooge set up to split the vote and guarantee a win to his opponent. Little did he know that nobody was listening to his earnest, figure-ridden speeches about how he would make the country a better place. Jack was there to help pick up the pieces when Willie finally found out what was going on, and he was there to witness Willie's rebirth as a fighter, who promised to come back to campaign on his own for the next election.Years later Jack is no longer in journalism. Instead, he is Willie's right-hand man. He is the one who keeps track of the things Governor Willie Stark needs to get done. He is the one who digs up dirt on friends and opponents and puts pressure where pressure is needed. He is essential to the smooth running of Willie's personal and political life, and he is much reviled by many people for his role in the government.In Jack's mind, though, Willie is a better politician than most. There is some corruption within his organization, but there is also much more good being accomplished than in past governments. Jack defends to his friends and himself that such good should and does overshadow the dark parts of his boss. As this book progresses, we are able to see how decent and moral people can be sucked into a somewhat immoral life, and how those who are immoral to begin with can find places to sneak into an ethical man's world.I really liked watching the evolution of all of the characters in this book, and the changing relationships among them. It was interesting to puzzle through Willie's change from idealistic young man to hardened womanizer, or Jack's change from slacker student to dedicated blackmailer. I liked seeing where Jack and Anne's relationship went wrong, and I liked the stubborn way Adam refused to let his friendship with Jack go.This book had some beautiful descriptive paragraphs, but there were times in which I felt I was simply wallowing in description, trying to wade through words in order to get back to the story."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is one of those books that I've been meaning to read for years. My advice is don't wait, READ IT NOW! This is now on my top ten list of favorite all time books.The writing (as befits a three time Pulitzer Prize winner and the National Poet Laureate) is eloquent. The story of southern politician Willie Stark is not only an astute novel about Americian politics, it is a novel that examines the foundations of philosophy. What is good, what is evil is an on-going theme.However, the fascinating part for me is the narrator, Jack Burden. (the names Penn Warren selects are so wonderfully Dickensonian!) His character and his motivation is what drives this story. In many ways Willie Stark's drive in politics and his desires both political and personal is a recognizable theme. (Yes he is based on Huey Long, Governor of Louisianna and populist and corupt demagogue) But Jack Burden, ahhhh Jackie Bird. There is a dark horse! Jack comes from privilege, he grew up with the children of a former governor. He has every advantage, breeding, money, brains, talent and yet he is a rootless soul with no goals. Then he meets Willie, and despite all of his family and friends horror at Jack's working for such a corrupt and crude politician, Jack perserves.The end, when he compares his two friends, Adam Staunton and Willie Stark is the first and only time he uses the word friend to describe Willie. Usually he refers to him as the \\"Boss\\". This is a key part of what motivates Jack.Beyond the character studies of Jack and Willie, this is plain and simple a good story. It is one that you will devour and will keep you fascinated until the end. The revelations about Jack's life, the inevitable clashing of the two worlds (Jack's upperclass family/history and the world of Willie Stark) and the sense of place, the south in the 1930s makes for absorbed reading. I highly recommend this book. It is worth your time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family.

It reveals great truths about people and the writing style is excellent."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The story of Jack Burden as reporter turned henchman to rising star Willie Stark is gripping, all the more so because of the story's biographical intent. The author loves words and is quite at home flexing the English language in myriad ways. The book reads like poetry. And that's its problem.Though the author writes with zest, the vast, deep eddies or metaphor that he creates to describe a scene ultimately detract from the flow of the story. One wishes sometimes that he would just simply get to the point. But from the outset, our narrator Jack is imbued with superhuman English mastery as well as every other character with whom he converses.The conversations are not believable because no one in their right mind would speak with the kind of flowery language that the author puts in their mouths. This is not to say that it's stilted, but simply too fluid and poetic to be taken seriously. It's the type of book that pretentious bookworms like to tout as an &quot;American Classic&quot; because of its difficulty.Even so, the book itself is pretty good, if slow-going. The characters are fully fleshed out and the story is compelling. It's worth a read, and worth paying for."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Excellent in all respects, it is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in American literature, and those attracted to its prime elements will be particularly intrigued. Many of these are nearly always overlooked and often deliberately misrepresented. Like nearly everyone else, all I knew about the book before reading was that it is supposedly a thinly-veiled dramatization of Huey Long's life. It is this, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it is also far more. A top-tier historical novel and a deeply meaningful work with a wealth of philosophical depth, vivid characters, and general verisimilitude, it is well-rounded and simply masterful.Let us deal with the Long parallels first. There are many; this is required reading for anyone interested in Long, as it uses much of his biography and delves deeply into his psychology. Far more importantly, it gives profound insight into the people of whom he is an archetype - supremely egotistical and conscienceless but intelligent, extremely able, and undeniably charming. We see how they work and how others fall under their spell. Long is simply fascinating, a true American original and seminal figure; this is a good introduction, hopefully leading readers to find out more, and a perpetually interesting stop for the many still curious about him.The book goes far beyond this even in immediate aspects. For example, it is an astonishing inside look at American politics just before World War II; it of course focuses on the low and gritty, but this is politics after all. Warren's narrative has that indefinable but all-important air of authenticity, pulling us in immediately and keeping us engrossed. Local and state politics are particularly emphasized, but the basic truths are not only national but eternal. Many have said that politics is corrupt, but few have shown it as vibrantly and memorably as Warren. His novel is also historical in a larger sense, giving a grand panorama of the rural South's last hurrah and even stretching back to the Old South, showing slavery and more. Warren had great insight into the Southern character and Southern culture, showing everything from history to speech to mores. His portrayal is notably unapologetic, non-sentimental, and non-didactic; he shows things as they were, letting us draw conclusions. Unlike so many others in similar situations, he does not force an ideology or even any kind of perspective on us, always letting story take center stage. In addition, the novel conveys a strong sense of what it was like to live in this important era; American politics was being revolutionized, the Depression was in full swing, the Red Scare lingered, and WWII loomed. Few works bring all this so effectively - much less affectingly - to the fore.Even more importantly, the book has a plethora of meaningful themes explored variously and at great depth. Human fallibility is of course key, and a variety of ethical dilemmas ranging from social to familial are dramatized; the book touches on everything from economic issues to race to gender roles and sexual politics. It also movingly portrays the loss of innocence and adulthood's transition. Perhaps most fundamentally, it delves far into the free will debate and even life's meaning.Much of this comes via Jack Burden, the first-person narrator, who is the real protagonist, not Long stand-in Willie Stark. The book is in fact a bildungsroman on top of everything else; we see Burden progress from talented but indecisive youth to outwardly successful but inwardly tormented young man to something approaching middle age's hard-won wisdom. The whole story is filtered through his eyes; significant parts deal not at all or only tangentially with Stark, and Burden's narrative goes on well after Stark has faded. Burden is a sort of Everyman, experiencing the alienation, doubt, and despair at the twentieth century human condition's heart. This is a profoundly existentialist work; much thought and history central to the era and earlier pass through it in thought-provoking and highly emotional ways. Warren also uses these concerns to speculate on things as varied as history's role, epistemology, and metaphysics. Simply put, there is something for everyone, and Warren's ability to plausibly put it all in what is ostensibly only a Southern political novel is truly remarkable.No one interested in American writing can be without this. Hardly anything else Warren wrote is now read, especially not his fiction, but this immortal classic will keep him prominent as long as American literature is read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Jack Burden works for Willie Stark, 'The Boss'. He digs up the dirt so that Willie can have his own way and protect his interests. Willie starts as an idealist before becoming a realist in the world of politics;a real political animal. He does some good by being bad, yet for all his power and control he is helpless against the past,peoples raw emotions and what life continually throws up.This is a terrific read, the only political novel you need ever to read or-if you've read loads-this has all the ingredients you've missed plus icing on top.So much is quotable and so much rings painfully true. Willies response to the question 'What is good in society?' for example; 'Why thats an easy question Doc.You make it up as you go along!' Isn't this exactly what human society has done sinse its inception? What was bad yesterday is good/ok today as we made it so? I guess about 2/3rds of a countrys population today would be jailed for their current life styles by their ancestors of a hundred years back! You easily warm to the Boss despite his huge failings.And his notion that good comes out of bad and bad comes out of good...if a morally upright anti nazi had tried to save innocents during the holocaust, he'd have been instantly shot and of no use to anyone. But amoral, philandering bone idle Oscar Schiendler....On another level the book explores how our image of life/history and people is often distorted and misconceived; that no one is free from the past and the future this creates, no one is innocent and life is a vibrant entity that exists almost seperately from us as individuals.A great work, lyrically written-as befits the man who became the first poet laureate of America."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This review is about the audio version.I read the hard copy of the book years ago, and I've always remembered it being one of the ten best books I've ever read. Of course, over the years only the basic story remained in my mind as the details faded. So I eagerly began listening to the audio version and quickly rediscovered the beauty of Warren's writing along with his interesting -- and sometimes fascinating -- sub plots. But what made this experience special was Michael Emerson's superb narration. With his multiple voices and his perfect interpretation of the drama, the book comes to life and is an even more exceptional story than I'd remembered.If only Emerson and Kristoffer Tabori could narrate EVERY book I want to listen to!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It's doubtful that any book will ever be chosen as The Great American Novel, but those looking for one should certainly try All the King's Men.I don't read many classics these days, but discovered this one when it was assigned in high school English. Then I had to read it twice to feel like I really had a grip on it. (Yeah, I was that kid.) It was worth it, though, as this is one of the most masterful novels I've ever read.For starters, Robert Penn Warren is great with language; it will come with no surprise that he was also a poet. Some of the passages in this book demand that you stop and admire his skill with the English language, and that's not something I do often. But his knowledge of language is complemented by a knowledge of the world: this isn't one of those dry classics full of long-winded philosophical musings or descriptions of trees (although the former at least is present), but a fascinating story in its own right. It centers on Jack Burden, the right-hand man to governor Willie Stark, who is based on a 1930's governor of Louisiana, Huey Long. There is a fair bit about politics here, with the focus on demagoguery and the corrupting influence of power much more so than specific political issues. But that is balanced by the story of Jack's life, jumping backward and forward in time; to me that enhances the story rather than confusing it, but I won't deny that this novel requires a great deal of concentration.The characterization is excellent, and Warren's depiction of human relationships is nothing if not intense. He does a similarly wonderful job evoking various settings. My only criticism is that too many of the characters tend to talk as if they were philosophers or mind-readers (character A can only inform character B of what B thinks, feels or believes so many times before I start to roll my eyes). Still, in a novel this brilliant, that's a minor flaw.This is a must-read for those interested in classics, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in American Literature (with a capital L) or who is looking for a challenging book, because believe me, this isn't an easy or quick read. If you're up for it though, it's worth the trouble, because All the King's Men is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is a novel whose prose is astounding on every level. Robert Penn Warren was an immensely talented writer and poet, and he brings these gifts to bear in this wonderful novel. Rarely would I say that a 600+ page novel doesn't have a few words to shave here and there, but I can't say that about All The King's Men. I would not want to be the editor who thought he could whittle down this writer's great work.ATKM is the story of Jack Burden (metaphor of a name) and his long (too long) growth process. Jack has what we would call \\"issues\\", and like most of us he has the ability to overcome them, but first he must grow up. This novel is the story of that process.ATKM has been called a novel about politics, but I think that politics serves a secondary function in this text. It is through his involvement in the underbelly of the political world that the narrator (Jack) learns how to live in the real one.Even though there are a multitude of characters in this text, each one is finely wrought and Warren never seems to delve into caricature. With the huge cast of characters in the novel this is no small feat. One of the greatest glories in this text is that there is not a single character who is likable or without flaws. And yet, as I read I found that I really did not hate any of them. In fact, I felt I knew many of them. That is because they are so lovingly and accurately crafted by the author. Jack states towards the novel's close about one of the text's more dastardly characters, Tiny Duffy, \\"and for the first time I saw him as human.\\" That really is one of the main themes of the text. How all of us, in all of our ugliness and beauty , are still divinely human. When we see the good and ill in others and don\`t pass judgment, we can then recognize and accept it in ourselves. Jack Burden is the unique narrator in that his almost passive views of others allows the reader to engage with them without prejudice.The colloquialisms and speech of the deep south in the early half of the twentieth century are delivered here with the accuracy and the warmth of someone who knew intimately the world which he was writing about. Rarely have I read a novel with such a keen sense and development of time and place.ATKM also has many subplots and diversions that are complete narratives in themselves, and are satisfying to that end. Yet they all also tie into the larger themes of the novel as a whole.Read this novel closely, be prepared to reread certain parts, and then sit back and lustfully digest one of the greatest of American novels. You will learn something about yourself along the way."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I was assigned this book in an undergrad political science class. I began it and didn't finish it--I suppose because of immaturity. Thirty years later I decided to give it another try.In short, this is one of the best novels I've read, and one of the few books that I want to re-read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I read the 1963 edition by Time Inc. This 600 page book is an incredible read, an extremely well written page turner, very visual writing with colorful chanracters that are so real and alive. The book is filled with intriguing events but so skillfully layered and woven with seamless transitions into monologues by the narrator about his reflections on life, history, good and evil, and many more. This is the best book I have read this year so far."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren does an incredible job making a novel of this magnitude flow. He jumps around in time and still keeps the reader enjoying his novel. It is truly one of the best political masterpieces of all time. Many people hate political books, but this one is interesting enough to hold anyone's attention and at the same time teach you something.Warren based this novel on the life of Governor/Senator Huey Long from Louisiana. Many of the occurrences in Willies life coincided with the occurrences in Huey Long's life. This is impressive on Warren's part because it shows just how much thought and research he had to put into this novel to come up with the facts and ideas.All The King's Men is narrated by a young and nave Jack Burden, the protagonist. He is from a well-known family in Burden's Landing (named after his ancestors) and who believe that no one can be held accountable for what occurs because of your actions. Throughout the novel Warren shows how Jack slowly matures while dealing with the tough lessons of life and making decisions for yourself. An awakening occurs when his boss, Willie Talos, the governor, tells Jack to dig up dirt on Judge Irwin. The things that he finds cause him to look back and reevaluate his own life and change his beliefs.Willie Talos's story takes place simultaneously to Jack's. He starts off as a poor farm boy who just wants to do good for others, but is corrupted by the spotlight of fame when he becomes governor. As he continues on his political journey the one thing that he despised most, the corruptness of politicians begins to become him. He used his power to command others around and blackmail them into doing what he wanted. He gains support by being projected as a common man.These two stories are simultaneously occurring and because of this you see many similar characteristics between Jack and Willie. They are both trying to flee their past. Willie does not want to be the man that others took advantage of, but a strong and powerful man that no one can tell what to do. Jack no longer wants to be the nave boy that grew up in Burden's Landing, but a man that can claim that he did something important on his own. While Jack matures through his experience, Willie has hardly any spiritual growth that occurs until it is too late. While Willie sheds his idealism for the power politicians gain and corruptness that soon follows, Jack keeps it and continues to sees the world through completely different eyes. Their personalities clash more than once although they work well together and keep the novel interesting.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone. Do not let the size (it is a long one) stop you from reading it. It is not hard to follow and keeps your attention. Every time you start to put it down Warren brings up a new point and you get involved again. This is one of those books that you just cannot put down. I really enjoyed All The King's Men and will probably read it again to catch the things I missed the first time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This novel is, quite simply, the greatest piece of literature ever produced. Every page contains a memorable scene or passage that any reader will remember beyond the actual reading. The relevance of this masterpiece will endure as long as we have the institution called &quot;politics.&quot; It should be standard reading for all high school and college students."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I put off reading this novel for almost twenty years from when it was first recommended to me for the simple reason that I dismissed as a \\"political\\" novel and, ergo, not of the first water. - How wrong can a prospective reader be?!? - To begin, this is not a \\"political\\" novel, per se, and the character of Willie Stark, as compared with the odyssey of Jack Burden, not very gripping. As another reviewer has mentioned, it is only political in the way that Oedipus Rex is political. What All The King's Men is, then, is a beautiful, hauntingly poetic, dark reflection on man's state in the world. It is an authentic American, modernist tragedy. And, like all great works of literature, it resonates in one's mind and heart long after the last page is read and the covers closed.The other reviewers have covered the plots and subplots, so that there doesn't seem much to add save, that, for me, the most engrossing sections were Jack's accounts of his two journeys into the past, one to find \\"truth\\", the other to find \\"the facts\\" and his deeply poetic rendering of the development of his adolescent love for Anne Stanton, which comes as close to Proustian as anything else in literature.I suppose I would go on to add a caveat here too. As I say, despite the book's somewhat pacific ending, the work is a tragedy, with the accompanying dark Weltanschauung inherent in an authentic tragedy. There are so many passages I could quote to exemplify this perspective to let the reader know what s/he is getting into here, but the best comes at the end of the fourth chapter, after Jack's first dive into the past:\\"Cass Mastern lived for a few years and in that time learned that the world is all of one piece. He learned that the world is like an enormous spider web and if you touch it, however lightly, at any point, the vibration ripples to the remotest perimeter and the drowsy spider feels the tingle and is drowsy no more but springs out to fling the gossamer coils about you who have touched the web and then inject the black, numbing poison under your hide. It does not matter whether or not you meant to brush the web of things. Your happy foot or your gay wing may have brushed it ever so lightly, but what happens always happens and there is the spider, bearded black and with his great faceted eyes glittering like mirrors in the sun, or like God's eye, and the fangs dripping.\\"In other words, beware of trying to trip the light fantastic through this powerful novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"If you are looking for a great example of American literature you can't do much better than Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning classic \\"All the King's Men\\". It ranks up there with Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Harper Lee, Truman Capote and all of the other greats. \\"All the King's Men\\" is a quintessentially American tale of politics, greed, corruption, idealism, friendship, betrayal, family, and just a touch of romance (but not too much -- this is, after all, a very masculine-centered novel). It is a sprawling tale of the political career of Willie Stark and his journey from the innocent do-gooder \\"Cousin Willie\\" to the jaded, corrupt \\"Boss\\" who governs the state of Louisiana with an iron fist. After a failed bid for governor where the idealistic young Stark is used as a pawn by one of the other candidates to siphon votes away from his competitor, Stark is crushed and left feeling like a sap. But he comes back and runs again with a new political attitude -- determined that if winning means playing the game that from now on he will outplay everyone else. And he does it, too, maneuvering and bribing and blackmailing his way to the top like a well oiled machine. When he sets his eyes on the Senate, however, his odyssey begins to spin into tragedy. His transformation is narrated by Jack Burden, a reporter who first met Stark when he was toiling thanklessly as county treasurer and later gets a job in his administration at the capital. Burden was, perhaps, once an idealist too but now stumbles cynically through life all too aware of the foibles inherent to human beings (his name, Burden, is quite apt for this position in which he must live). His struggle asks some meaty philosophical questions (can good exist without evil? Is it necessary to do bad things in order to have a good outcome, and is such a thing possible? and more) and thankfully doesn't get too bogged down moralizing the reader (although Warren does dangerously toe the line in a few parts). Reading this book was unique for me because I found myself unable to read it without a pen in hand so I could underline passages and write notes and reactions in the margins of the pages -- agreeing and disagreeing with what was being said. That was great fun, and it was a thrill to feel so involved in a book to be doing that. I do have a few minor complaints, however. I thought that Warren's chronology was slightly jarring as it went back and forth through time and took long detours to get to the point, but since those detours were usually filled with some meaty themes of their own I can forgive them. I thought that Warren's proclivity for repetition got annoying by the end of the book (hitting it zenith when Anne Stanton proclaimed in one flashback \\"Oh, Jackie, Jackie, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, say it's a wonderful night, Jackie-boy, say it, say it!\\" on page 425), but since this is only really present in the dialogue -- and mostly in Anne's dialogue at that -- I can forgive this too. I also took offense to Warren's portrayal of women as either manipulative or wishy-washy but always responsible for the downfalls or travails of men. That's a tough one to get by, but since he can be equally critical of men for their own corruptions and failings I guess I won't let it bother me too much. It's very much a product of the time it was written and of the setting it depicts, and you can't necessarily fault it for that. At any rate, on the whole I would definitely recommend this classic. I don't know how either of the film adaptations compare, but I can't imagine that they could accurately capture the scale of Warren's epic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book is called one of the greatest novels of American politics ever written. But really, there is so much more to this tale than that. This is easily one of the best works of literature I have ever read. Robert Penn Warren's style is quite descriptive and flowing, and his use of Jack Burden as the narrator gives readers an incredibly intricate narrator."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is the only book in my life I've read four times and each time is an experience that brings new insights and relevations. I first read this book in high school and I come back to every three years so becuase its just that good. Warren won the Pullitzer Prize in 1946 for this and I argue its the classic of the century and possibly the best American novel ever writte. Reading this book is like drinking a fine wine...it needs to be sniffed, sipped and swirled to appreciated although I promise you won't want to spit this out!Like all amazing pieces of work, this book has many different aspects to it. The story revolves around a southern Governor and his right hand man who narrates the story. The first time I read the book, I knew nothing about the plot or the historical undercurrents and I think this is the best way to read as it the best way absorb the beautiful prose. Warren turns simple situations like the sound of rain beating down on an automobile into eloquent rythmical expressions that fuse you onto the page. The book is also a coming of age story and Warren is able to capture and relate to the human psyche so well that I've thought I'm reading excerpts from my own life. The relationships Jack Burden has with his boss, his father, his best friend, and his best friend's sister will surely ring true with many a reader. Warren does an amazing job developing these relationships in realistic and heartbreaking ways. I love how each chapter stands alone as it's own mini story.There is so much to be said about this book and there is reason why so many other viewers give this book such high praise. For novice readers this won't be an easy read as it exremely involving and some of the sub-plots are hard to follow. I think more experienced readers won't be able to put it down. For people looking to try some classic literature, this is a fantastic place to start. Enganging enough for the advanced high school student, this would be an excellent present for the teenager leaving home for college beacuse of the thematic relevancy.Bottom Line: For me it is the standard all other classics are measured against."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"there are two newish paperbacks out in print right now. one is this edition featuring the classic novel we've loved for fifty years, the other is the restored edition- notably returning willie's last name to talos from stark and other changes. one interesting change is an addition of an opening chapter an editor, wisely in my opinion, convinced warren to axe. THIS edition is the one i would advise purchasing for those who are new to the novel and unfamiliar with 1930s history and politics. warren's biographer joseph blotner writes a fantastic introduction to this classic american work, putting history and politics skillfully in context and setting the reader up for a broader understanding. the introduction is short, only four pages, but is worth the read.check out other reviews for summaries and articulations of why this book is completely wonderful."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"&quot;All the King's Men&quot; moves along breathlessly right through to its nail-biting climax. I wasn't prepared for such a suspenseful read, but the intrigues, shady dealings and political backstabbing make for quite a thriller.It's loosely based on the career of Huey &quot;Kingfisher&quot; Long, one-time governor of Louisiana. I didn't know anything about Long before reading this book, but it doesn't matter. Robert Penn Warren's novel is not about Louisiana politics, but rather about American politics in general and the ease with which political figures can become god like in the eyes of their voters and just as easily fall from their lofty perches.Warren uses stylized, thick prose to conjure images of the dense, sultry Southern landscape that serves as this novel's backdrop. The swampy, tangled undergrowth mirrors the tangled machinations going on among the politicians and aides that make up the novel's motley cast of characters. Willie Talos (Stark, depending on the edition you read), takes center stage as the larger-than-life governor, but the story really belongs to Jack Burden, right-hand man to Talos and the novel's moral center. And Warren creates a bona-fide scene-stealing character in that of Sadie Burke, aide to Talos, who understands what it takes to make it in an environment so dominated by power-hungry men and who more than adequately holds her own.This is a compulsive read. I didn't have the luxury of being able to sit down and read the whole thing in one sitting, which is probably the best way to approach it, as there are very few ideal stopping points along the way. But whether you read it all at once or over several days, I hope that you will indeed read this book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It may take awhile to read this but it is worth it. I have read it twice-the second time was even better. There is so much to this novel that just makes it complete. You learn to love the characters and feel like you know them. One word of advice would be to not give up on it- and read it slowly so you don't miss anything!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is quite simply the finest novel I have ever read. The story of Willie Stark offers a powerful, moving platform on which Warren develops the true story, which is Jack Burden's philosophical conflict and its resolution. _All the King's Men_ is a novel about a politician in the American South, but it is also a novel about what it means to be good in a bad, harsh, or morally indifferent world. I have kept this book with me from state to state, reading and rereading it and finding new insights and new lessons each time. I cannot recommend any other novel as strongly as I would recommend this one."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I just want to correct one error. This book is NOT about Huey Long nor was it based on him. The author, Robert Warren stated as much."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"There's no doubt this novel has a good story line. The main problem I had was getting to it. I labored through so much descriptive prose that I often forgot where I was in the story. It was a chore to finish and I have come to the conclusion I should not read any more Pulitzer Prize winning novelists. This is my fourth and none have been half as good as a Glass Castle or Memoirs of a Geisha or many others with less acclaim."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I have not finished this book but it is difficult to get interested in it. Parts of it make no sense to me. As a Louisianian, I know much of the history this book is based on, but it is still not easy to follow in this book. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book is rather strange: it presents me with a situation I have never encountered before. Penn Warren's writing is superb, his command of the English language perfect, and his use of images simply fabulous. However, the book fails to strike me as anything. After reading it I don't feel as though I have, for a time, entered a different world and learned something in that world. In short, this book is bland, repetitive, unnecessary fiction that fails to impress the reader on any level other than its use of language. At first, I didn't want to admit this, and went back and read the book again; each time I found myself falling asleep every 30 pages. Many would say &quot;Oh, well you must like escapist fiction, and this is why you cannot appreciate this book,&quot; however, this is hardly the case. If you want to read a great novel that is deep, equally well written (if not more so), keeps the reader's interest, and is written in a simlar &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; narration style, go buy yourself Ulysses by James Joyce. All the King's Men is, quite tragically, a failure: Robert Penn Warren certainly had talent in writing, and it is very sad to see that talent go wasted."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"As long as I have wanted to read this fascinating story, I just could not make my way through the author's ponderous writing style. I gave up after about 100 pages as he is one of those writers who thinks 1000 words is better than 100. I don't think I have EVER read longer sentences or longer paragraphs!!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book is so at the beginning in my opinion because the charactors are not very lovable. It was not until about five chapters into this novel that I actually cared if they lived or died, but by the end I did not have to make myself read it. (instead I was trying to make 26 hours in a 24 hour day- my schedule is... rough) Still, I'm glad I read it. It's a good book for class disscussions, but I would only recommend it for the upper honors or gifted classes. Most high school students would read it and instead of seeing the philosophical meanings, they would get bored at what they perceive to be meaningless ramblings. There is a lot of philosophy in this book; not all of it is correct (in fact there are only a handful of philosopies in the first eight chapters that I could not easily disprove, but I enjoyed reading the stuff at the end, it was correct, and it often told why the previous chapter's thinking was wrong.) It does not have the descriptions like 'A Tree Grows In Brooklyn' or the lovable charactors that most of my favorite books have, but it is a great serious book. If you have extra time, I would recommend it. If you are having to read it, do not harden your heart towards the charactors too soon. They do get better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I thought this book could have been alot better. I think he rambled on too much in the beginning. If u want to read this book I suggest Cliff notes.

I can respect that this has social significance, it was well written, etc. I don't agree with the girls that it was &quot;just plain terrible&quot; but I do think that it was more than a little flawed. While reading it, I had trouble deciding whether I liked it, but finally decided it had not been worth the time. Ever get the feeling that a book was simply too cute? This book's series of contrived coincidences annoyed the bejezus out of me. Let me reel them off: Jack's father figure Judge Irwin becomes an enemy of the Boss, so the Boss says find dirt on him, which he does thanks to a childhood friend of his, who he loves. (She later has an affair with the Boss.) He finds the dirt, the Judge kills himself, he finds out the Judge was his real father. The dirt also implicated his friend's father, who like the Boss, was also the governor. The Boss is killed by that governor's son, who had found out about the affair and assumed he'd gotten his job because of that (it was actually basically unrelated.) It makes me want to vomit, I can tell you. How can any writer be considered great when he tries to pass this soap opera stuff off as literature? Get rid of the absurd coincidences and it's a good book...maybe, but as it is I just felt insulted. Don't waste your time (I just gave away the plot anyway.)"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The first time I opened this book, the cover broke off. I was very displeased. It was very brittle.

Jack Burden, the narrator spent way too much time describing things. I never did get caught up in the book. I only finished it for a class.

At this level, ATKM is a carefully wrought story, more about the tyranny of the past than the bare knuckled compromises of politics, with the character Sadie Burke contrasting with Anne Stanton, Willie Stark contrasting with Adam Stanton and Tiny Duffy, Jack Burden contrasting with Sugar Boy, and so on. But while all of these characters are fully realized, they are also somewhat predictable. It is for this reason that ATKM seems like a melodrama; once you get the characters, their stories fail to surprise.Nonetheless, this novel is well worth reading, primarily because of Robert Penn Warren's fabulous style. I'm no expert. But most authors I read seem to use metaphors and similes to create a quick burst of insight or beauty. Yes, Updike, Chabon, McEwan and maybe a few others create occasional passages of descriptive writing with multiple elements that fit together in amazing extended metaphors. But Warren does this repeatedly, taking an idea and exploring it for 100 words or more. This, in my opinion, explains why ATKM has lasted: much of the novel is very fine poetic prose. Here's one example:\\"In the morning it had stopped raining and there was the sun. I went out and saw the thin pools of water standing on the black ground, like sheets of isinglass. Around the japonicas, the white and red and coral petals, which had been shattered from the blossoms, floated on the blackly gleaming pools. Some of them floated with the curled edges upward, like boats, and around them other petals floated upside down or had shipped water, making a gay carnage as though a battleship had fired a couple of salvos into a fleet of carnival barges and gondolas in some giddy, happy, far-off land.\\"Warren's poetic style helps explain why ATKM is both a long book but a fast read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"After seeing the movie I wanted to finally read the book; I wasn't disappointed.

Being able to listen to it gave me a better appreciation for Robert Penn Warren's use of language."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"\\"All the King's Men\\" is the story of Willie Talos, a backwater boy who teaches himself lawyering at night and ends up in politics as the Governor. Then as Willie finds out that politics isn't about doing the right thing, he quickly learns how to maneuver in the real world of politics. Before long, this formerly God-fearing, trusting man is drinking, carrying on with women, blackmailing, and surrounding himself with all the trappings of a king. Ambition overtook his good intentions.The rise and fall of Willie is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, the non-committal reporter who Willie hires as one of his \\"men\\". Jack's responsibilities are usually working as a researcher looking for dirt on political opponents or simply listening quietly. Eventually Jack's boyhood world and the world of politics collide, and almost against his will he must give up his role as observer and become a man of action and take responsibility for his life.Robert Penn Warren wrote a a stupendous novel (1946) that is considered the definitive book about politics. But \\"All the King's Men\\" is so much more than a political novel. The insights into human nature, the beautiful language that brings the South alive to where you can taste the saltwater and feel the warm ocean breeze against your cheek, the lively descriptions of the characters, and the ability to create dialogue that moves and makes you laugh is the writing of a true genius. \\"All the King's Men\\" is a delightful page-turner about men and women trying to find their way in life. And is full of surprises that catch you off guard until the end."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I almost feel it unnecessary to write this review, given the positive responses I see in the review section. But let me simply add my thoughts on this highly acclaimed, and deservedly so, novel. It certainly belongs on any list of great 20th century American novels. From the beautifully constructed plot to the poetic prose, the book is triumph. It tells the story of Willie Stark (Talos in the Warren original and based on the Louisiana governor, Huey Long) -- his political rise and fall, the corruption that is endemic in politics and in man, and the clash of the man of action (Stark) versus the man of the idea, represented in this book by the narrator, Jack Burden. His journey from cynic to admirer to mature observer of Stark's method and madness is in itself fascinating. But even the throw away stuff in this book is great, such as Burden's descriptions of the old men sitting on a park bench, observing the world, almost outside time, or the droll descriptions of the locals who clamor for Willie, and even the interview with the man that Burden believes might be his father, and the crisis of faith he encounters as he explores the history of a Judge he admires and knows better than even he realizes. An American classic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The first Poet Laureate of the United States, Robert Penn Warren created his life-long masterpiece with \\"All The King's Men\\" (1946). Drawing upon his first-hand experience in Europe as Germany and Italy invaded their neighbors and Spain fought a bloody civil war, the author makes his best attempt to showcase the ill effects of demagoguery and the fine line Americans tread between freedom and totalitarianism.Set in the 1930s, \\"All The King's Men\\" follows the exploits of Willie Stark - a master politician and an expert in class warfare and corruption, who transforms from an idealistic man of the people into a creature driven by an insatiable lust for power. Readers would do well to learn more about the life story of Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long of Louisiana. In the depths of the depression, he managed to become Governor and Senator of Louisiana (at the same time!!!), and he built a private army that rivaled the state militia and the national guard. Effectively, he became dictator of Louisiana before his assassination cut short his ambitions. With his eye on the White House, Long posed a true threat to FDR and the American republic, and his life serves as much of the basis for Warren's novel.\\"All The King's Men\\" is viewed through the eyes of Jack Burden, one of Stark's aides - a man still possessed of idealism, but paralyzed from action. From an insider's point-of-view, the reader witnesses the rise and fall of Louisiana's \\"man of the people\\".It has been said that \\"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\\". If so, \\"All The King's Men\\" should be red in the face. The book's themes and ideas have been mimicked numerous times, most recently in 1996's best-selling novel \\"Primary Colors\\", a roman a clef with Jack Stanton (Bill Clinton) in place of Willie Stark (Huey Long). One of the finest novels of the last century, lovers of literature can't afford to miss \\"All The King's Men\\".Britt Gillette"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I can not recommend this book more highly.

I oftentimes found myself reading the same passage over and over again, rolling the words around in my mouth like a delicous food. This epic novel also has many themes that one can put into use in one's own life. Some of the many important themes? Power, responsibility, and the meaning of life.

ATKM might teach you how to. Second, if you read past the first few chapters, the action speeds up. Like any good book, the author needs to set up the action. Why'd you fool even bother reading the Cliff notes, which are written in boring scholarly tones? Warren was a true poet, and each and every word of this book was carefully selected to convey Penn's message of corruption and fate. By taking the reader through a story through the eyes of Jack Burden, Penn documents the changes of Jack's philosophy of events. An extremely rich book, gripping, and for you ignorant girls, the plot resembles TV soaps that you're probably spending too much time watching. If you want soap-opera twists, ATKM has them also.

Unfortunately, some view this work as a retelling of the Huey Long story but, of course, it is far more than that, for in Willie Stark, Warren has created a character both more complex and more sympathetic than Long. How greatful we all should be that Warren abandoned his play, Proud Flesh, and chose the novel format instead. I doubt the play, if produced, would ever have been successfully transformed into a novel, while the novel has generated numerous plays and a successful screenplay. With the exception of the Cass Mastern episode, which tends to drag, this work is up there with the very greatest fiction in the English language."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"A rich political tale following the path of a small town lawyer to the governor's manson.

A long time ago I read RPW's &quot;Band of Angels&quot; which I liked but forgot the writer until I saw this book right beside it. I was so amazaed at this story and the very rounded characters. I really liked Jack Burden and as the story went on and incidents came to light I was just surprised. Usually I can figure things out before they happen but this book was one thing after another. A few weeks ago I was longing for a good book to read maybe about the south and an old book and presto this book jumped off the shelf to me. (Well, not literally). You can taste this book, the words just want to roll around in your mouth like good food, and you can feel the weather, and feel the sea against your skin, you can see the cotton fields, you feel the gritty red dirt. This book is like a Thanksgiving dinner and I will have to say it's one of the best books I have ever read and I have read about 1,000 or more in my life I'm sure. I like the part when Willie realizes he's a sap and gets up to address the crowd as hicks and rednecks. Then there's that part about how all a man needs is something, something and Coca-Cola. Yeah, I thought Coca-Cola is real big down south and it was good back then before they messed with the formula. You know the old green bottles that you had to pop off and it burned sweet and cold down your throat in that dusty delta bayou. Take this book, read it, let it be your pal."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I must admit that part of my interest in this book is provincial, as I spent part of my growing years in Louisiana, where the name of Huey P. Long is still familiar. Robert Penn Warren's novel starts off a little slowly, but the action picks up, and Willie Stark is a finely drawn character whose resemblance to the real life Long will not be overlooked by those familiar with Louisiana's political history in this century. Warren captures the FLAVOR of Huey Long's political milieau with his portrait of Willie Stark.

The problem lies in the utterly self-referencial nature of the narrator, which sometimes obscures the fascination of every other character save himself. Of course this is meant to be part of the point of the book, but to me it just emphasizes my conviction that Warren tried too hard with this novel. He had everything working but for some reason decided to blur the facts (perhaps as an intential obscuring of history) in the muddled numbness of someone who has distanced himself from his own life and relegated himself to an observer.Second person narration is a difficult goal to maintain (one inevitably thinks of The Great Gatsby, helped out a great deal by its brief length) and Jack Burden ultimately comes across as a gloomy, arrogant, pompous jerk, so self-obsessed that the legitimicy of the tragedy and greatness of others is numbed, dragged down, trapped in the lowered expectations of his own world view. This brash imposition of reality is to be commended--as highly praised as anything that has been highly praised in this book. Jack is miserable and for good reason. He'd never expected anything of anyone in his life and can be satisfied that no one can disappoint him (until the betrayal of a long since ended romance comes along, but I should be honest--this sub-plot contains most of the parts I found boring and 'self-reflective'--I guess I don't imagine liking the author personally very much--).The prose, clearly, is confidently assured, a guy never struggling with style and language. Even the characterizations of others is profound, dense with meaning and the full force of graphic realization. But when he gets to himself, despite Jack's boasts to the contrary, he backs off and grows defensive, merely covering up, seeking not only to prove but to justify every wrong turn he's ever taken in his life.I don't like Jack Burden. I think I love this book . . ."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is a very good book. It takes a while to get into but once you do it is really interesting. It is a good book to read while taking philosophy. Beautifully written.

The narrator's prose mixes tough-guy cynicism with over-the-top poeticizing. The author's literary ability is always in the foreground. Several stories, each entertainingly pulpy, are interwoven, except a historical romance that remains unrelated to the main plot. While basically chronological, the organization often makes better thematic than narrative sense. The weakness of the book is that almost all of it comes off as artifice and contrivance. Only Willie Stark and Jack Burden intermittently ring true. The other characters, especially the women, are props stuffed with clich&eacute;s. The plots churn with coincidences and melodramatic events. And some passages are close to camp in their laughably extravagant rhetoric."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"let me start off bye saything that the book is a good book but it has its flaws. One of the few flaws it has however is that alot of the dialogue between different characters is to long and drawn out and not very exctiteing, but the actions bye the powerful polictical leaders in this book is what will get you hooked. It make want to see what happens next. See its about a man named willie stark whos corruption and crave for power almost led the us to have a dictatorship. Throughtout the book he learns how to bend the rules without breaking them however once he gets the power he has craved for so long he is slowyly taken down by senators and people in office with him seeing his true goals for america. It puts you in a possesion to wonder what would america be like with a dictator. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history or good villians."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Warren has created a book not about &quot;the rise and fall or an American dictator&quot; as one edition has written across the cover- which has deprived the novel of its due fame. &quot;All the King's Men&quot; deals with Jack Burden's inability to fathom actions have consequences and this is rather interesting. Anyone can see Warren is a very learnt and well-read author. His novel relates to Huey Long (Willie Stark) - the political figure in Lousiana although the main character is NOT Willie Stark - but Jack Burden the narrator and reporter. I found this book philosphical and well-written. It is true one can not sympathize with the protagonist who palys the role of an anti-hero. Not the most interesting but very thought-provoking. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Most of my life I have heard people talk about \\"the great American novel\\" and how they were either looking for it or were planning on writing it some day. If you are one of those people, you are wasting your time. The Great American Novel was written in 1946 and people will be reading this thing 500 years from now. Robert Penn Warren was essentially a poet, the first Poet Laureate of the United States, in fact. If you have not read any of his poems, you are in for a treat. His prose works are actually secondary in his great oeuvre, though many would have a hard time believing that after reading All the King's Men. Actually, the poetry is there, embedded in the crackling prose, almost mystically entwined in the magical descriptions and staccato dialogue. When Faulkner read this book, he was amazed and declared it one of the finest pieces of fiction he had ever encountered. It's easy to see why. If you have ever been deterred from dipping into literary fiction because you were afraid you would get bored, you needn't worry about this story. Once you get past the first chapter, the velocity of the plot development takes over and you ride the rapids to their swirling conclusion. There's no getting off this ride once you're strapped in. About half way through this tumult of American civilization, I consciously made myself slow down. I refused to read more than ten pages a day because I knew once I had finished this grand spectacle of artistry, I would probably never come across another American novel quite this well written. So far, and I'm 53 years old, this has proven to be true."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I'd seen &quot;All the King's Men&quot; described as one of the best American political novels, and after reading it, I don't see it as a political novel whatsoever. While it is based around the rise and fall of the fictitional Southern politician, Willie Talos, it is really just the story of the narrator, Jack Burden. Robert Penn Warren uses Burden to tell the story of Willie Talos and those around him but the novel ultimately ends up being just an insight into the relationships and emotions of Burden, which aren't too different than many that would be experienced by any modern-day American. At times, Burden's storytelling drifts far away from the topic that launched it, but Warren's writing is so pretty and the scenes described are so picturesque, that the drifting is enjoyable. While this also makes the book a slower read, it is more entertaining for being so. The novel is generally somber though, as life in the poor, early 20th Century, rural South could be, but the characters of the novel are very endearing. Their lives, intertwined with that of the man that has attracted them to him, rise with Talos' successes but are also doomed to crash with him and his all-or-nothing style. But while Talos is the protagonist, the most important parts of this book are those that focus on Jack Burden's life, especially the beautiful narrations he gives of his early-life memories."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"For those who are having a hard time with reading this very long book with the very long sentences, let me recommend the audiobook. Yeah, it's long, too-- 21 hours-- but I've been listening to it during my long commute and my evening walks, and it is absolutely riveting. In fact, it's so engrossing that I've started taking it to bed to listen to the way I used to sit up and read in bed. The long sentences are pure poetry, once you just relax and listen. The version I'm listening to (which I downloaded to my iPod from audible) is read by a very talented man who captures the inflections in the voices of all the characters. I only have about five more hours of it to go, and frankly, I hate to see it end."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Power and corruption go hand in hand in Warren's literary gem, set at the zenith of nineteen-thirty's Louisiana state politics. Mirroring the life of the infamous Huey Long, the novel's Willie Stark is ostensibly and outrageously a man of the people, shunning pretensions while appealing to the common man, capturing the attention of a mass audience, speaking in language they can relate to. While Stark cuts his political teeth on the betrayals of the wealthy and powerful, he quickly adapts to the tricks of the trade, a master manipulator and a quick study. Bred of poverty in a nation defined by the Great Depression, Stark is that rare genius who can take the public's pulse while seducing the powerbrokers, out-dealing their schemes with his own instinctive prowess.In a parallel story, Jack Burden shadows Stark's progress, doing the dirty work to maintain Stark's iron-fisted control of Louisiana government, the Governor with an eye to the state senate. An equally complex character, Jack hails from a well-connected family that hides its dysfunction behind the refinements of wealth, often the \\"Boss's\\" convenient pawn (Stark is never one to waste the talents of those in his employ). Burden comes of age under Stark's tutelage, eventually pushed beyond endurance by the duplicity of his position, especially when forced to confront a long-time family friend with the secrets of the past. Hurtling towards a confrontation of epic proportions, Willie Stark has a date with fate; his attitude subtly altered by recent events, Jack watches dispassionately, clinging to the threads of his tattered integrity, all but physically removed from the once-consuming relationship, a fitting end to a reign of excess and hubris, reality the great leveler.Filled with larger-than-life personalities, the novel exposes the coarse underbelly of state politics, the natural corruption of power and those whose lives are destroyed by the voracious appetite of Stark's ambition. Timeless, filled with the inherent contradictions of the democratic process, the author's scathing indictment of Louisiana politics is a harsh reminder that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Peppered with tragedy and excess, All the King's Men is as relevant today as in its heyday, a compelling contrast of two personalities, Burden stepping aside as the wily politician self-destructs, trapped in a web of his own making. To be sure, the politics of expedience warp the senses and the soul, idealism and compassion expensive conceits when the dust has settled: \\"Maybe that is the only way you can tell that a certain piece of knowledge is worth anything: it has to coast some blood.\\" Luan Gaines/2006."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"There's not much left to say about a Pulitzer prize winning novel that's already stood the test of time. (the book was written in 1946)A few points:1. The quintessential American novel about corruption, power, religion, money, lust, love, and madness. Like all great literature, Warren's book works on several levels. Don't put off reading this book because you think it's just about a corrupt Southern politician who falls from grace. It's all that and a lot more.2. One last point: it's a sad state of affairs that most of the reviews for classics are written by students required to read them for literature class. It's too bad that more people don't return to great literature after having children, serving in the military, traveling around the world, dealing with death, personal tragedy,and after the illusions of youth are gone. Great literature is written for mankind.An absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"\\"All The King's Men\\" is one of those great, weighty tomes of American literature that I had avoided reading for many years, simply because I didn't see the appeal of a 400+ page novel. But I finally got around to picking this up a month ago, and I have to say it is a fantastic example of the great American Novel.Based on the life and career of Huey Long (governor of Louisiana and major rival to FDR for the presidency before his death), the tale of Willie Stark is one of a good man corrupted by the very political machine that he needed to enact his reforms. We first meet Willie in the full swing of his corruption, but vingettes to the past reveal how innocent and truthful he was back in the beginning. The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, Stark's righthand man who does what he's told no matter what. He has a mind of his own, but he sees Stark as a man who can affect positive change. But Stark's own corrupted nature renders that impossible, and everything he touches (including Burden and his family) turns to dust.Robert Penn Warren's book does have some faults: some might want more of Stark's story than is provided, and the Cass Mastern detour is interesting only in retrospect (at the time you're reading it, I challenge you not to count how many pages are left before the chapter is over).There are no real heroes in the piece, simply men and women caught up in the fury of Willie Stark and his desire for glory, and everyone comes to an unfortunate end through contact with him. Jack emerges as complicated and unsure of his own function within the Stark machinery, and Adam Stanton's descent towards his final actions (echoing the real-life assassination of Long by Carl Weiss) is rendered brilliantly. Perhaps the most moving chapter is when Jack relieves his first falling in love with Anne Stanton, in the wake of revelations which force him to reevaluate that summer.Warren doesn't adhere strictly to the Long story: he starts the \\"present day\\" portion of the book in 1936, well after Huey Long's death in September 1935. And Stark does not meet his end until the end of 1937, while still Governor (Huey Long had gone to the Senate in 1932 but still controlled Louisiana through his goons). Was Long simply the wellspring upon which Warren fashioned his extraordinary tale, or was there more of him in Willie Stark than Warren might have wanted? It's really up to the reader to decide.All in all, \\"All The King's Men\\" takes the story of a man who means good but loses his way and turns it into one of the Great American Novels of the first half of the twentieth century. Willie Stark's rise and fall make for a moving, illuminating tale, but his reign affects all those around him. And it is his presence that causes the events of the novel, and the actions of Jack Burden and those he loves. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and nowhere is that more evident than in \\"All The King's Men\\"."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The end justifies the means. Make the good out of the bad. That ostensibly sums up the intriguing philosophy of Willie Stark, the Huey Long-modeled demagogue protagonist. All the King's Men follows the political career of country boy Willie Stark - from a small fry County Treasurer known as \\"Cousin Willy\\" all the way to Louisiana Governor referred to simply as \\"The Boss\\". The reader follows Willie undergo a transformation from a young, naive, idealist politician who despises corruption into a hardened, cynical machine politician who will use any means necessary to aid his poor and disenfranchised constituents - all the while helping himself as well as the cronies of his machine.But this is not entirely about Willie Stark. It is beautifully written in 1st person narrative as told by Stark's right hand man, Jack Burden, a man facing many struggles of his own. Throughout the book, Jack's inward struggle with morality parallels Willie's outward struggle with his actions and their moral repercussions. Both Jack and Willie believe the paradoxical philosophy that \\"you had to make the good out of the bad because there wasn't anything else to make it out of.\\" At the end they both undergo an epiphany of sorts as Jack starts a clean new life and rids himself of all the residue of his corruption while Willie states on his deathbed, \\"It might have been different, Jack. You got to believe that.\\"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1946, All the King's Men is a masterpiece and is unequivocally the best politcal novel ever written.

It is a book to be treasured and referenced early and often for its wisdom, which resonates as strongly today as at its first printing."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is not really about politics, and it is just plain wrong and naive for anyone could possibly think it is more relevant today than it was in 1946 when it came out.Some of reviewers who insist on saying this is about politics obviously never studied history. Or psychology. Or literature. No, there isn't a single President, governor, or elected dogcatcher before or after All The King's Men to whom this story is not relevant. Nor is there a single preacher, lawyer, farmer, or skidrow bum to whom it lacks relevance. Jack Burden and Willie Stark are Everyman in two persons. The most careless reader of this novel will understand that. The relevance to President Clinton is the same as it is to Richard Nixon, Richard Burton, Ronald Reagan, and Ronald McDonald.Now that these folks have read All the King's Men, I would suggest trying All the President's Men. That one is about politics, and the comparison would be useful."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"And maybe that's good.This American classic and Pulitzer winner is wonderful and absolutely worth reading if you like your books to have depth and girth and that they be truly literary instead of merely entertaining for the plane ride, the beach, et al. Nothing wrong with that, if you do. But be warned: it is, even, I dare say, for its time, way overwritten and the writer's writing, the literary pyrotechnics, stands out in front of the story, often burying it in its spent ordinance and soot.Yes, Warren's a literal poet, and there are jaw-dropping turns of phrase on nearly every page. The reason I give a 4 and not a 5 is because it is turgid, overwritten, overwrought and purple as hell. There's too much time spent in Jack's head reflecting, thinking and philosophizing for my taste. But these are gorgeous flaws and, in the end, I found the writing too good to worry about the fact that there's too much of it. Also, the novel-within-the-novel regarding Cass Mastern was not needed and really dragged the already slagging story to a halt. The book did not need that background, per se, but it is what it is. It ain't a breathless thriller. It's hundreds of thousands of words of shimmering prose. Tap in and drink it with relish. They just don't make them like this anymore. Why? Because no house would publish it because they know nobody will read it in the numbers necessary to make it remotely profitable. Books are products; books must show sales growth potential or they get snuffed out. Sixty years ago, before the world 'o screens we live in now, this book was fodder for actual conversations at the proverbial water cooler. Now it's mostly seen as a \\"book to read before you die\\" or something inane like that, like climbing El Capitan or something.

A gregarious, larger than life and country boy politician and his loyal assistant set about conquering Louisianna politics and do so, but not without costs. As the politician, based on Louisianna's legendary Huey Long, Governor Talos outsizes himself so that his original principles no longer fit. They sink, with his marriage his temperance and his honesty. Incremental excesses, adulteries and ruthlessness devour him and his assistant, our narrator whose interests became the same as the governors whom he followed unquestionably. Each generation of readers can find similarities in this very American story with its matching story of their age. Many of the people who reviewed the novel before me wrote during the Clinton sex scandal and, in their outrage and sense of being manipulated could draw similarities with Warren's book. I read the book during the year anniversary of 9/11 and found the mythic themes and Eastern philosophical overtones outstanding. Southern writers who incorporate the heat and the light into their passages inevitably recall the landscapes of the ancients. Myths caution us that when humans live fully as products of the light, they will ultimately suffer. That was certainly the case in this group of characters. The themes of young idealism, success, excess and loss of soul are never out of touch with modern life. We find the most revered 'gentlemen' in this case the white male protestant old guard (Judge Irwin and Dr. Stanton) felled by their attachment to their position and protection of their class. Their respective descent into murder and adultery were the consequences of their inability to integrate the dark impulses into their addiction to the perfect glow of the light. Similarly the characters who were gifted with great beauty and physical superiority, a hero- athlete and an Olympian beauty did each fail to do the work of mortals and were equally doomed. One, the Governor's son, to a drunken and debauched death scene and the other, the narrator's mother, to solitude and lost youth. The indignities and normal sufferings that their bodies protected were merely delayed and undisciplined, they ultimately had nothing to do but fall.Politics is naturally a metaphor for so much of the conflict between good and evil in mankind. Jack, our narrator, was a traveller, also a lost child, one who attached himself to families in the absence of his own. He was not, as some have noted, a voice of honor or reason, he had an ambivalent moral code, but a developing one. He pursued his tasks with an indifference to cruelty, but not as a person who received pleasure in inflicting pain. He did retain loyalties, however, even toward his physically and emotionally repulsive father and the ancestors that propelled him to seek his legacy and ultimately his livelihood. Jack was a pilgrim and Governor Talos a sort of master, and in the end, the student outdistanced the teacher. All, at least in my own life space, quite mystical and mythic. It was also emotionally moving, not in a sentimental way, but in the way that we recognize so much of our own struggles and the fact that we are neither perfect nor complete, and unlikely to ever feel that sublime contentment.But most significantly, this is a good story that 'sounds' Southern and conveys in the smell of stale beer and smoke, isolation and back road honkey tonks-a photographic and gritty realism that works. That it offers even more for those who care to reflect- is a bonus- but you don't have to care a bit about that stuff to enjoy."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This Pulitzer Prize winning novel is a thinly veiled, fictionalized account of the life of the former populist Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, written by an aide, Jack Burden. Burden is something of an idealist who has somehow become attached to the political machine of southern Governor Willie Stark, known throughout the story as simply \\"The Boss\\". Also playing a prominent part is Burden's relationship to Adam and Anne Stanton, two childhood friends who were the children of a former Governor.The narrator of the story, Burden, seems to wander aimlessly through the events of the book, often as not doing much of the Governor's dirtiest work, while seldom seeming to question the morality or legality of his actions. There is much talk of good, bad and evil between repeated scenes of political graft, bribery and corruption.Much of the book is fascinating in its portrayal of raw political power and manipulation. However, far too frequently the author diverts to almost stream of consciousness prose with little or no advancement of the underlying story line. One hundred pages of such florid drivel could have easily been excised from the novel, resulting in a far more captivating tale. As it was, I'd immensely enjoy fifty pages of narrative only to be faced with ten pages of garbage that could literally be skimmed over.So, how to rate such a book? I give the approximately 80% of the book that contained actual narrative, five stars. The remaining 20%, which consisted primarily of meaningless babble, earns one star. That comes to 4.2 stars. Read the book, skim the garbage."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is Southern literature at its peak of perfection. I bought this for my BF a few years back when Sean Penn starred in the film remake of the original classic, as he usualy likes to read the books behind the film. Happily, I got much more than I bargained for. While I disagree about this being a \\"the best novel about American Politics\\", it is inarguably one of the best about Southern American life.There are many kinds of writers: poets, storytellers(novelists), playwrites, and investigative journalists (reporters). Great literary works need to involve a combination of these, I think. Literature is what happens when language is spoken through the eyes of the soul. Literature transcends mere writing. Literature hits a nerve and pulsates throughout your entire being. It's what makes you speechless after you put it down. Such is the power of ATKM.ATKM's force is driven by RPW's rich characterizations and narrative, seasoned by his deft prosaic hand. Clearly, the man knows how to tell a story. But this is more than that. It's an intimate look through a window in time and place that does what every great novel should do...pick you up and transport you, right into Willie Stark's crisp seersucker suits and spectator oxfords.That being said, nothing feels more like summer than good ole', southern-fried drama lit, and this book was no exception. RPW's . glorious poetic prose reels you in form the first page. Hell, you can just hear the damned kudzu growing, taste the whiskey, the sweet tea, collards, fried-green tomatoes, feel the scorching, molasses-thick humidity dripping rivulets down your back with every page.I'm not going to waste space feeding back to you the entire plot and storyline here. You already know that. Just add this one to your summer book list along with some Faulkner, Twain, O'Connor, Welty, Williams, et.al., and enjoy the ride with The Boss, Sugar Boy and Jack!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"As with many of the \\"classics\\" it seems like there are a bunch of editions of \\"All the King's Men\\" floating around. I recommend that you get the originally published Robert Penn Warren edition, in which the main character is \\"Willie Stark\\", and not this \\"Willie Talos\\" edition. In my opinion, the tale of Willie Stark is one of the best books in 20th century literature, from a pure story-craft standpoint, and not to be messed with.I'll admit I first came upon this book as part of the \\"summer reading list\\" for a school English class. There were some truly enjoyable books on that list as well as some that just seemed incomprehensible (\\"The Sound and the Fury\\", for example) and others where I had very little idea of what the author was getting at. \\"All the King's Men\\" was just a knock-your-socks-off novel. It has interesting characters, a (mostly) believable context, and enough suspense that you're not sure just what might happen next. The main characters in the book are Willie Stark, a powerful and corrupt state politician in the American pre-war South, and Jack Burden, a journalist from a wealthy background who essentially works for Willie. As the story begins, Willie hires Jack to find some dirt on a political rival that Willie wants out of the way. Jack's efforts to do so, and Willie's own hubris, eventually impact the lives of Jack and several people he loves, including the only consistent father figure he ever knew (an elderly judge) and Jack's teenage love. Jack tells the story of his own life intertwined with Willie's life, leading up to the climactic events where Willie finally falls from grace. In doing so, Jack shows how both he and Willie started out innocent but were gradually corrupted by the machinations of a system outside their control.Although Willie's tactics seem brutal, they may also be seen as a way of exerting control over a system that would otherwise crush him and other common people. An outwardly even less powerful person, Willie's secretary Sadie Burke, who is herself from a poor background and is scarred by pock marks, turns out to be the one who pulls the strings that both bring Willie to power and knock him back down. Sadie is one of the most interesting female characters in 20th-century literature (much more so than her foil, the quiet, retiring, beautiful Southern belle Anne Stanton, who is barely developed) and is as much of a politician as any of the men.This is a book that you can just enjoy reading from a pure standpoint of reading a political or historical novel, even if you don't want to get too deeply into analyzing it or understanding all the allusions and English-majory stuff. It's just a darn good book, period. I have seen the older movie adaptation but it is hard to do this book justice in the movie format since there's simply too much going on in it to fit comfortable into two hours."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book sat on my shelf for a couple months before I even opened it. Originally getting it because it was a bargain book on Amazon, I initially didn't think much of it. I attempted reading it twice and wasn't quite ready for it. It took an English professor in college who recommended I read it to get past the first twenty pages. What I first found to be boring pretty language transformed into something transcendent. After completing the novel I found that Robert Penn Warren was the only person in history to receive a Pulitzer in poetry and prose. \\"All the Kings Men\\" clearly illustrates Warren's poetic language and imagery. My first mistake with this book was to dismiss it as a \\"political\\" novel. While politics is involved and part of the story is set around southern politics, it in no way encompasses the novel. Instead this is novel about life. The story is both alien and deeply personal for the reader. The narrator walks you through his life and introduces you to the people around him. Willie Stark, while an impressive figure in American Literature is more like a supporting character throughout the novel. Instead it's a novel that focus' on the narrator's trials and tribulations. Everything from love, and loss, to past and present and how these things shape our lives. It is perhaps my favorite novel in American Literature. If at first you seem daunted, stop reading and come back to it. A novel that sticks with you, that is Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This book covered so much ground and was so well written and so absorbing that I've put it at the very top of my Best Books list.It said so much about American - especially southern - style politics and so much about human frailties. Warren philosophized about life in a very satisfying way that left me feeling good about life's struggles. Best of all I was fascinated by the story of the two brothers who were slave owners before and after the Civil War. I think that part was always left out of plays and movies that were based on this book. Read it! Great story!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Being a European I had never heard of this book before the picture came out, which I liked very much and saw it 3 times. I then bought the bookand it knocked me of my feet. It is praised as the great American Novel and it certainly is that, but I believe that it is not limited to the American readers. Wherever one lives if he loves a great story written in a unique way, this is \\"The Book\\".It certainly is one of the best American Novels I have read so far."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"You'll be a more ethically mature person for reading All the King's Men. A thoughtful study (from a political viewpoint) of the question \\"Do the ends justify the means?\\" Really entertaining and a pleasure to read as well; one of those books that leave you amazed that the human race could produce such a gifted writer."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All The Kings Men is written from the perspective of Jack Burden, a poetic, lost, troubled insider in the 1930s administration of southern-state Governor Willie Stark. In some ways, the book traces the trajectory of Willie from idealistic country boy to The Boss, but Jack is so present in his account of events and so in control of the narrative flow that it ends up being Jack's story well more than Willie's. And Jack's story is bleak. There are light moments, but they seem pale and washed out compared to the depth of the wounds that Jack, and ultimately all the central characters, carry.The book is beautifully written, slow, lush, and incredibly rich. The first few pages are among the best openings I've ever read. There are places where it's hard to see where the story is going (including a strange interlude set during the Civil War), but there isn't a lot that seems careless. Warren is a meticulous writer. Although it's hardly a political thriller or a romance, both of these elements peek through in the last half of the book, where the writing thins out a little and the story really takes hold.As a note of caution: Warren doesn't shy away from some pretty offensive depictions of both African Americans and women. It's an old boys club in the novel, and Jack's first person narrative is deep in the thick of it. My take is that this is less about who Warren is as a writer than it is about who Jack is as a deeply flawed protagonist, but some passages were hard for me to swallow even then.This is a book to read very slowly, undistracted, in small doses. One of those books that you can flip open to any page after you're done, and see a dozen layers and nuances you missed the first time through."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Whether you're Southern or non-Southern, this book brings together the personal and political, the observer and observed, the spectrum of a single point in time, like few other American novels.

This is one of the contenders for the Great American Novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Perhaps it's because the beginning was so slow... I just couldn't get into the characters. I have yet to see the movie but I am tempted to rent it just to see if it might spark more of an interest in the subject. A far better political novel is The Last Hurrah by Edwin O'Connor."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"All the King's Men is based on Louisiana's Huey Long. Willie Stark's story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, an aide to Gov. Stark. One can quickly realize where the entire notion for Primary Colors came from. A note of warning: the book is set in the 1920's through 1940's of the Deep South; within that time-line and region comes nasty social realities. I haven't a clue as to whether Warren himself comes out in the derogatory racism or if he just wants to truly capture the era, however, it is difficult to accept how casually and easily such fowl language can be used against other human beings. With that said, I think a far greater harm would be done by trying to sugar coat the past into something it wasn't. The book is incredibly well written and one can feel themselves a part of the story with the intense description throughout. All the King's Men is a classic story of how a politician feels he must resort to achievement by any means necessary as opposed to exhibiting proper means AND ends. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Please note: &quot;Aweful&quot; is spelled &quot;awful.&quot; 0 for 2 on that one. &quot;And it made me want to through myself into a brick wall.&quot; &quot;Through&quot; is a preposition -- and sometimes an adverb -- not a verb. &quot;Obviously the teachers want us to be stressed out since they force us to read this book.&quot; If one's education were composed entirely of studying things which one already enjoyed, then one would end up being a fairly ignorant person.

I was then on the second reading of the book, and decided that it had no merits other than the writing style. That was earlier today. Well, I began reading again, from the beginning, and the most insane thing happened - I began loving the book. And not just that, I read for hours on end, finishing at least a quarter of the book before my first break. Still, I don't feel that this is the best book ever, and in a similar vein (as far as writing style is concerned anyway) Ulysses is much better, but then again, Ulysses is one of my all-time favourites."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The following review was based on seeing both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic political noir All the King's Men recently as well as having read the book some time ago. Many of the points about the character of Willie Stark as portrayed on the screen apply to the book, especially the Crawford portrayal. However, the book gets much more into the grit of what ails Willie and his seemingly endless quest for power and control-when he actually gets his hands on it. Every class and personal resentment seems to come to the fore. An amazing piece of writing. As noted below, the Sean Penn version is a little closer to Warren's intent in that the narrator/ reporter Jack Burden is the real 'anti-hero'of the piece. Why? He gives legitimacy to Willie's efforts in quarters where Willie cannot go-the old Southern aristoracy that scorned the 'hicks'.I might also add that one can benefit from a careful reading of this book as a quasi-historical document of what stump-style politics looked like up close and personal- a type of politics that has practically vanished from the American political scene in the age of mass media and 24/7 'talking heads'. Today, one probably could not get elected to town selectmen with old Willie's style, but such is life.I have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a \`populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the \`little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of \`little people' or anyone else, for that matter.The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially nave country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do \`good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world-weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the \`people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience, Crawford wins this duel. View both films and you decide."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"In the Noel Polk version of All the King's Men, Willie Stark becomes Willie Talos. TALOS?!? Yes, I get the classical allusion, but that doesn't mean it's not a terrible name for the character. He's supposed to be a hardscrabble, down-and-dirty American politician, and you're giving him a highfalutin, European-sounding name like \\"Talos?\\" As opposed to the perfectly-fitting Stark? This egregious miscalculation makes me seriously doubt Polk's judgment on all matters relating to this novel. I stuck with the original.And the original is enough. Because really, people. This novel is badly overwritten as IS. Almost grotesquely so in parts. Do we truly need MORE of this? Warren is very much given to investing events and characters with baroque, pointlessly elaborate verbal curlicues that quickly collapse under their own weight and only serve to gum up the novel and remove whatever narrative momentum it might have had.The opening is a great example of this: two and a half densely-packed pages describing the highway on which the protagonists are driving. What does this do? Does it contribute to the plot? Does it add any sort of meaningful atmosphere to the proceedings? No and no. And it certainly is not sufficiently arresting on its own terms to make up for that. It's empty, self-indulgent fluff. All that it does is demonstrate that Warren is truly madly deeply in love with the sound of his own voice. And if we weren't convinced, he demonstrates it again. And again. And BANG.This isn't a political novel. Don't let anyone tell you it is. Everyone always identifies Willie Stark as the central figure--presumably because otherwise, it would be hard to nail it down as being about much of anything--but he is very much a secondary character; we only get a very sketchy idea of who he is or what his appeal to his constituents is, and his corruption, such as it is, is so laughably picayune that you barely raise an eyebrow. The mechanics of power are barely explored. \\"The rise and fall of an American dictator!\\" my copy breathlessly proclaims on the cover. Yeah, not so much. There are the seeds of something interesting here, but they never grow into anything.No, this is about the narrator, Jack Burden. Forget Willie; forget all the other characters--none of them are more than half-formed; it's a stretch to even call them \\"characters.\\" This is All Jack All The Time. Which means an awful lot of windy philosophizing about morality and duty and history, none of which amounts to much of anything. A deep psychological exploration this is not.The fact that no one else is defined in any real way also means no one to care about and no drama either. There is a murder. It's meant to be the novel's climax. It's not climactic, because all the people involved are just shadowy puppets. Nothing they do matters or signifies.I do admit that I was caught up on occasion. I liked the Cass Mastern story, and I liked the Judge Irwin plot. But then, oh lord, I had to slog through the Ballad of Jack and Anne. I think I'm at least as romantic as the next man, but I defy anyone to claim with a straight face that this long digression is in any way affecting. It's not. Anne's not a character (did I mention that there's a fair bit of misogyny here?), and Jack's not an interesting one. Overall, the interesting-to-mind-numbing ratio here is distressingly low.I see that most of the negative reviews for the book on this site seem to come from apathetic high school kids. My normal inclination is to mock such people, but in this case, I have to admit, the apathetic high school kids kinda have a point. It was painful enough for me, a graduate student who's used to this stuff, to get through--you're gonna force it on teenagers who have no interest in literature? I mean, at least for me, there's a certain value in having read such an (however inexplicably) acclaimed book; for them, it just seems pointlessly sadistic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"The book was top notched and wasn't dat bad even though it was use.

The Washington Post made a comment about the novel and how if the idea of naming the Great American Novel is still being tossed around in 50 years (or, now), All the King's Men would certainly be a finalist. The novel won the highest literary prize in America, the Pulitzer Prize.The novel is set in the 1930's and follows the political career of Willie Stark, a provincial man with ambition tempered by honesty and integrity. He begins with integrity, but we see how the power he gains corrupts the man he used to be. His fictional career mirrors (in some ways) the real life career of \\"Kingfish\\" Huey Long (Louisiana). The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, a reporter who eventually ends up working for Willie Stark. Burden tells his own story at the same time as he is revealing the life of Willie Stark. The reader only gets to see what Burden shows us. The novel is told with a first person narrative.As would be expected with a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the writing is quite exceptional. It was a little bit slow going at first, but about halfway through, i had a thought: \\"Damn, this is a good book.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"My choice for Greatest American Novel of the 20th Century is this Robert Penn Warren classic. Unfortunately for Warren (and us), this novel got off to a rotten start. The New York Times hailed it as \`The definitive novel about American politics,' and doomed it to be shelved with other drab tomes in that otherwise unimpressive genre. The Times, sad to say, widely missed the point on All the King's Men.Jack Burden is the point. Jack Burden, the politician's hack, makes this book. His is an evolution from disaffection to purpose, from carelessness to thoughtfulness. Willie Stark-the politician-is merely the means to Warren's greater goals. Warren originally set out to show, through Stark, the Dionysian allure of power and the grand effect it has on those who attain it. And he did; Stark himself is a great literary character.But Warren fooled himself: he created a character much greater than Stark, even though he planned Burden only to be a sort of an omniscient narrator of little value to the novel except as the storyteller of Stark's rise.In the end, Burden says (paraphrase), \\"This has been the story of Willie Stark. But it has been my story too.\\" And thankfully, it was. The novel is brilliant, Warren is brilliant, and political books are still boring-but this is not one of them!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"ALL THE KING'S MEN is about the corrosive and corrupting forces of politics. When good people get involved in politics they generally become bad people. Its the story of a country chicken-kicker named Willie Stark who gets into politics to do good then becomes the king of the corrupt after he's elected governor.My problems with this book are the backstories and the 'and then a miracle happened' moments. There is too much backstory, and much of it is irrelevant; Stark's election to the governor spot is a miracle that fell out of the sky; Stark was a chump and then he was governor.

But you may be surprised to learn that Willie Stark is not the main character of this potboiler of a southern novel. That honor goes to Jack Burden, the book's first person narrator. Jack, a journalist by profession, becomes Willie's friend and righthand man despite their markedly different backgrounds. Willie is a self-described hick, while Jack was born of wealth and breeding.All the King's Men is about Jack and the complex relationship he has, not just with Willie, but with his parents, his friends, his childhood sweetheart as well as other political operatives. There is also a fair amount of text devoted to one of Jack's great uncles, a deeply troubled man who died fighting for the Confederacy decades before Jack was ever born.Artfully written using a very detailed and evocative brand of descriptive prose, this engaging novel succeeds in conveying a number of interesting messages. Prominent among these messages is the idea that mankind is corrupt by nature. But this, says Warren, is not necessarily cause for despair since in the fullness of time evil can give rise to good.All the King's Men is a wonderfully substantial and satisfying work of American fiction arising from the literary tradition of the South. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Of course, there is little I can add in praise of the book. It is one of the most outstanding examples of use of language, development of character and of setting that I have ever encountered. But I would like to call the reader's attention to the latest audio version (unabridged) read by Michael Emerson for Recorded Books. This is beautifully read, and in some ways enhances the experience of reading the book, because the exquisite language is sometimes even more enthralling to listen to than it is to read. I noticed a negative review of what I assume is an earlier audio version, and I wanted to share my very positive experience with this newer one.Any format you choose, this is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This well-written, Pulitzer prize winning American classic was enjoyable from cover to cover. The poet inside of Robert Warren Penn came through in this novel- with many poetical musings about the mundane and ordinary things in life. Several of these musings were so mixed with southern culture, that I could not understand them. But more often than not, they put a smile on my face. I don't know, there is just something about southern culture that is just funny in itself.The story itself develops slowly at first and then snowballs in tragedy at the end. Though an interesting and unpredictable story- the novel would be a dud without Penn's captivating writing style. Besides the story, the glimpse into deep-south politics was enjoyable. This is a world far removed from a west-coast boy like myself who is generally ignorant about politics in the first place. Not that the book is primarily about politics- it is not. I believe the book is about man's attempt to do right and how this is utterly impossible. There are a wide variety of characters in the book, yet all of them succumb to some sort of evil. It was not presented fatalistically, but factually.

Somehow it feels out of place to list this among other \\"books\\", like it's been misclassified or misslabled. This isn't a book, it's rare genius hitting on all cylinders -- a spark from the shattered vessel of the deeper truths of life."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I have a list of books that I put into the category, \\"Books Every American Must Read.\\" I don't put books on that list thoughtlessly, but All the King's Men occupies one of the top spots. Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city or country come down to the mentality of one or two individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates you to the point of becoming unable to consider the humanity that surrounds you, so that the meaning of what you are doing is disconnected from your ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\"friend of his youth,\\" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\"boss,\\" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it \\"predicted\\" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades. Finally, the main female character in this book is one of the most complex, unforgettable people you will ever meet in a novel.As an aside, the recent bestseller, \\"Primary Colors,\\" has a main character with the name Jack Stanton, which happens to also be the name of one of the main political figures in this book. I have always thought it was NOT a coincidence, but no other reviewer writing about either the book or the movie that came later has pointed this out. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This Pulitzer-Prize winner is a great book, an astounding outflow of words that meander from delicate beauty to gut-punch brutality, particularly when dealing with machinations in the political arena.It is a riveting exploration of the rise and demise of Willie Stark, a loosely-disguised Huey Long, a Southern politician of the traditional confiscate-from-the-rich-and-buy-votes-from-the-poor school of governance. Here's a blustery mogul who assures everyone he just wants to help poor folks, yet he treats most of the people around him like dirt. He weilds power by breaking people, digging up dirt and blackmailing them, a good example of the politics of personal destruction that our recent real-life First Felon whined about so pitifully (while employing those very techniques every chance he got).Willie gives great speeches, the old-fashioned stump sermons that were rendered before television scared politicians into hiding their real personalities. Willie speaks from the heart to his constituents, performing for them, making them mad, making them laugh, making them LISTEN. Reading this makes you yearn for just one contemporary politician who would address people in such a manner. It would be such a refreshing change from all those podium lemmings who continually grovel in search of sound bytes.Willie vows to do good for all the poor folks who love him -- and, of course, his only means for doing that is to loot earned income from people who were foolish enough to be productive. Willie is the master of doing good with other people's money. He'd fit right in, with our Congress today.In the end, Willie got what he deserved. I just wish it had happened to him a lot earlier."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Two pages into this exquisite work, the Southern torpor that I had experienced for a good deal of my life wafted off the page, and I knew I would take my sweet time with this reading. Strangely, though, it didn't feel like a leisurely read when I was done; so smoothly crafted is the language that it glides across the page and melts into one's senses like a pat of butter on a hot skillet.Beyond his quasi-impressionistic portrait of the Deep South, Robert Penn Warren does a stunning job with the theme of Redemption. Contrary to popular belief, the central figure here is not the well-meaning Governor who loses his way, but his hard-bitten, ex-newspaperman troubleshooter who is able to justify most any action he is asked to take.Warren presents us with a riveting cast of supporting characters who represent the continuum of moral choices that we, the Body Politic, must make every waking day: The stoic politician's wife, who looks the other way; the Attorney General, who eschews power when it comes with a price; the idealist who throws himself into his profession but commits a crime to honor his sister; his sibling, somewhat isolated in a rarified social setting, choosing to do &quot;good works&quot; but succumbing to temptation; the hard-boiled female pol, for whom &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;; and, among others, the narrator himself, Jackie Burden, for whom Moral Relativism becomes High Art.This is a story not of people who rule, but of their loyal subjects, and how they drift from their original moorings and hit the shoals, with rationalizations 'a plenty. In the end, Warren may be telling us that while our elected officials are capable of being corrupted during their finite tenure in office, it is the citizenry in any democracy whose quieter, everyday choices richochet from one member of the community to another, oftentimes with unintended and far-reaching consequences - and with only so much time to repair the damage, if indeed that is possible.This is masterful storytelling that forces the reader to consider what unknown ripples he himself may have created in his life. It is, without question, a leading candidate for &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Alex KippermanReviewAll The King's Men, by Robert Penn Warren, is not only the story of a man's becoming of a politician, but is also a book that delves into analysis of human nature. Within it are several fascinating characters, but the two main ones are Jack Burden, a very well educated fellow and narrates with wonderful insight in the events that occur and Willie Stark, the man in which the story line is centered upon who is a raving politician, who's methods are be not that highly thought of by the other's in his field, but is loved by the people.What I found to be most noteworthy was the author's mastery over the language and skill of writing. Often he would go into detail of the minutest event and then make in-depth analogies. The detail was overdone though, as one might find a Dickenson novel to be, because it is always surprisingly thoughtful and insightful. The descriptions are often of small events and moments in life with striking precision For instance, There is a part where Lucy, Willie's wife, is sitting with a number of other men eating and first Warren describes her as she is \\"watching the jaws work\\" and hen he likens her face to that of \\"the chief engineer... when he goes down to the engine room at night and the big steel throws are leaping\\" and it's these parallels which make his writing most enjoyable.The ending is somewhat happy, though unfortunately it is filled with tragedy; the lives of all the characters intersect in some form and not always pleasant ways. But they and the different time periods covered in the story blend gracefully to form a book which is \\"brilliantly done\\" as the New York Times would put it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"It is in fact a book that insightfully probes relationships -- friendships, romances and yes, those of a political nature. But to call it just a political novel doesn't do it justice. Recently reread after many years and rediscovered what a wonderful, compelling tale RPW wove."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Just reread this after reading it 25 years ago in high school. Brilliant- you can taste the dust and feel the sweat trickling down your back... I really enjoyed every word of this masterpiece. Poses the big questions, makes you ponder the big things in life. Get this version instead of the newer paperback- the print is twice as big. Great American Novel, 1900-1950... what have you got to put against it? Bring it on. This is better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Penn Warren's All the Kings Men is an extremely involved read. The book focuses not so much on American politics and the myth of the demagogue politician but rather on one man's journey into himself into finding his place in the world. The book also provides the basis for one man's understanding of the meaning of responsibility for his actions.That said, a lot of the critical focus of this novel has been placed on the character of Willie (Stark) Talos the fictional governor who starts out as a simple man of the people and evolves into a Machiavellian powerhouse who demands that the ends justify the means for all his actions. The book has been called the ultimate political novel or even a novel about the rise and fall of an American dictator. This rather general review barely scratches the surface of Penn Warrens attention.In its most basic aspect, this is a novel which deals literally with one of the King's men. In this case that man is Jack Burden. Jack, for the most part, is an observer of the world around him. This is his most basic take on life. He observes and basically floats through his existence as a sort of thinking yes man for his political leader. He will do anything that his boss tells him and he will feel very little, if any responsibility for his actions. This view of life gradually changes through his interaction with Willie (Stark) Talos and the immediate circle of people around the governor. Jack through this novel grows into a responsible person.I called the novel flawed in the title to this review for a few reasons. The first is the narrative style. Jack is a first person narrator and an observer of life. As such everything (and I mean everything) gets described. This has a great tendency to slow the novel almost to a crawl at some points. The flip side of this, however, is that Penn Warren creates prose that almost has the feel of a painting in its description. The novelist forces his reader to view the entire world through the narrators eyes. There is very little direct narration and ore than a little of Warren's personal philosophy involved in reading this.The second point that has been called a flaw is the placement of the Cass Mastern episode. This however is a centralpart of the novel. It is also the portion of the novel that William Faulker thought to be the best writing of the book. The episode runs nearly fifty pages and contributes nothing to the existing narrative structure. First looks however can be deceiving. This section of the novel provides a model for Burden's eventual change into a more responsible person.On the whole this was probably one of the most difficult books that I've read in quite a while. At times one wants to scream in frustration but with some patience the careful reader is left with a feeling of great accomplishment and the feeling of having read something truly great and uniquely American."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Warren's All the King's Men is deeply political in story, yet it also very insightful in its point of view, examining one man's role and perspective towards the monumental rise and fall of a political figure. As much as the plot is devoted to Willie Stark, it is more so linked to narrator Jack Burden, his ideologies about the world of politics, campaigning and playing hard ball and dirty politics, being Willie's right hand man, and his coming to terms with the tragic consequences that unfold later. Jack Burden lives essentially in two different worlds, the rural Burden's Landing, which is reminiscent of Jack's past, his family and close friends and past hopes, and the world of Willie Stark, where Jack, even as a dutiful employee, expresses his jadedness and cynicism towards \\"the Boss\\" and his methods.Warren is the king of lyrical prose; he has a way of taking long avenues and digressions to get to the point. This can be literally in the form of verbose sentences that cover half a page, or in the form of single reflections that go on for forty or fifty pages. When this meandering is for effect and purpose, it's pure genius. When it involves the trivial or unnecessary, it's quite cumbersome. At moments, this novel feels overwritten. There were points that I had to set this novel aside for awhile and pick it back up just because of the daunting nature of the chapters, but then I would read a passage that was a stroke of pure genius, where Warren had such an insightful revelation into Jack's views or life in general, and I was reminded why I wanted to read it through until the end. For instance, many readers thought the back story of Cass Mastern was unnecessary, but I thought it was a nice touch, an essential linking point between Jack's story and his uncle's story, as they parallel each other.The dirty politics aspects and its ultimate theme of corruption with unsympathetic characters made All the King's Men difficult to fully enjoy, even though the novel ultimately arrives at a moral and point.I'm glad I persevered though, and I won't knock the book's classic status as a political masterpiece, as others seemed to fully enjoy the book. The novel helped me discover Warren as a writer, and I look forward to reading some of his poems in the future."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is the kind of fiction I like--fiction with a strong moral and message, fiction bent towards standing against power. It's obviously a very famous book so I don't need to sell it too much here. It is the fictional account of a Huey Long-type demagogue in the 1930s, told from the perspective of one of his fixers-a sort of disenchanted but entangled observer not unlike those of Budd Schulberg's novels or The Great Gatsby. If you enjoy this book and want to explore a real-life embodiment of it (other than the Ken Burns' documentary on Huey Long) then I would definitely recommend The Power Broker by Robert Caro. It is incredibly long, but as one of the first books someone gave me when I moved to Hollywood, it holds a special sway over me. Like Huey Long and Willie Stark, Robert Moses was a man who got power, loved power and was transformed by power. We can learn from him-mostly what not to be and who not to become."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren, America's first Poet Laureate, won a Pulitzer Prize for this 600- page novel, considered by many as one of the greatest works by any American author. Set in the 1930's, it traces the rise and fall of a dictatorial demagogue loosely based on Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long, governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1931. Long was loved by his supporters and hated by his detractors and ultimately assassinated in 1935 after he announced his run for the Democratic nomination for presidency against FDR. Warren was a professor at LSU during Long's rise in politics.What I actually read was the 2001 version taken from Warren's original manuscript, held at Yale University. Noel Polk, a professor of literature from the University of Southern Mississippi, \\"restored\\" the author's unedited version. There is debate among literary experts regarding Polk's version. And Warren agreed, in fact, participated in the editorial changes back then--he never indicated dissatisfaction with the 1946 publication. The true work, perhaps, is the published version, approved by Warren, vs. the Polk version. Polk claimed that the editorial decisions of 1945-1946 tampered with authenticity and bastardized Warren's first creative words. Well, I'll just leave that argument to the pundits. The restored \\"Willie Talos\\" version is what I found at the library, so it's what I read. And it was fantastic, as I'm sure the 1946 \\"Willie Stark\\" version is, since it's the one that has been critically acclaimed for over fifty years.I won't retell the story. It's long, complex, filled with multiple themes--and while Willie may seem to be the protagonist, the book is ultimately about Jack Burden, gopher for Governor Willie Talos. Just who is the protagonist is perhaps an interesting question for literary students (or old guys who like books). Does Willie or Jack drive the action? Regardless, one must conclude that Jack is the voice of Robert Penn Warren; and it's Jack's voice that is predominant. Jack is intelligent, from a southern genteel upbringing, but he seems to go through the motions, living in the Boss's world of dirty politics and increasing corruption. He just takes orders, appears to lack personal ambition, and is an observer of his world. Jack's got a sardonic wit. He's a realist but inside, he seems to question his own human nature. He's not a particularly happy person.This book is filled with fascinating well-defined characters, richly described--even the minor ones. While it was difficult to be sympathetic with any of them, I could identify with pieces of them, became familiar with them and wanted to learn more about them. A couple times, it struck me that Warren went a bit over-the-top with detail, like his description of Anne Stanton's laugh; it was so ornate, I concluded that only Pulitzer Prize winners must think like that! I particularly like the Cass Mastern episode. Jack did extensive historical research digging into the motives of this Civil War relative. Just why did Cass try so hard to find Phebe, the sold slave? Jack never finds out and in frustration, dropped his PHD work. Penn's writing style, his descriptions, his word choices and sentences, his steady use of creative similes grabbed me. Examples:Jack: \\"She kept on looking at me, not saying anything, with that look which always said, \`You've got something I want, something I need, something, I've got to have,' and said too, \`I've got something for you, I won't tell you what, not yet, but I've got something for you, too.' The hollow in the cheeks: the hungry business. The glittering eyes: the promising business. And both at the same time. It was quite a trick.\\" (Italics mine)Jack in an argument: \\"and the absorbent silence sucked up words like blotting paper.\\"Willie: \\"Folks, there's going to be a leetle mite of trouble back in town. Between me and the Legislature-full of hyena-headed, feist-faced, belly-dragging sons of slack-gutted she-wolves.\\" (It's the voice of a creative cracker. While I'd love to be able say such a thing to somebody sometime, it wouldn't be me).\\"...like the ocean chewing its gums.\\"Jack, cynicism on taking the state bar exam: \\"But maybe it had taken too long. If something takes too long, something happens to you. You become all and the only thing you want and nothing else, for you have paid too much for it, too much in wanting and too much in waiting and too much in getting. In the end, they just ask those crappy little questions.\\"Jack, frustrated with Willie's early speeches on the tax program: \\"Yeah... I heard the speech. But they don't give a damn about that... so it's up to you to give \`em something to stir \`em up and make \`em feel alive again... Tell \`em anything. But for Sweet Jesus' sake don't try to improve their minds.\\"I can partly relate to Jack's sensibilities: \\"At the hotel I ate a sandwich and went up to my room, and got the fan turned on and a pitcher of ice water sent up and took off my shoes and shirt and propped myself in a chair with a good book. There is nothing like a good book to put you to sleep with the illusion that life is rich and meaningful.\\" (But to me, good books do make life rich and meaningful.)Jack: \\"There is a kind of snobbery of failure. It's a club, it's old school... and there is no nasty supercilious twist to a mouth like the twist a drunk gets when he hangs over the bar beside an old pal who has turned out to be a big-shot and who hasn't changed a bit...\\"Jack: \\"\`It's a nice night,'I said in, I confess, the voice one reserves for small children, old ladies with ear-trumpets, and idiots.\\"Jack, with the goods on his old mentor Judge Irwin: \\"So I had it after all the months. For nothing is lost, nothing is ever lost. There is always the clue, the cancelled check, the smear of lipstick, the footprint in the canna bed, the condom on the park path, the twitch in the old wound, the baby shoes dipped in bronze, the taint in the blood stream. And all times are one time, and all those dead in the past never lived before our definition gives them life, and out of the shadow their eyes implore us. That is what all of us historical researchers believe. And we love the truth.\\"I loved the philosophical meanderings built into Warren's developing story:Jack Burden: \\"The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can't know. He can't know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can't know whether he is killed because of the knowledge he has got or because of the knowledge he hasn't got and which if he had, would save him.\\"An example of Willie's belief that everyone is bad and the moral man makes goodness out of badness: \\"... the trouble with Governors is they think they got to keep their dignity. But listen here, there ain't anything worth doing a man can do and keep his dignity.\\"Jack: \\"One feels incredulity at opening the breaking of a habit, but horror at the violation of a principle. Therefore what virtue and honor I had known in the past had been an accident of habit and not the fruit of will. Or can virtue be the fruit of human will? The thought is pride.\\"Jack: \\"...is any relationship a relationship in time and only in time? I eat a persimmon and the teeth of a tinker in Tibet are put on edge.\\" (Or I buy a shirt at Dillard's department store and somebody in China gets to eat, but not very much).Jack, at Willie's request (or order), asking Adam to be director of the new hospital: \\" But I let my voice trail off, watching him shake his head again and smile now with a smile which did not forgive me but humbly asked me to forgive him for not being like me, for not being like everybody else, for not being like the world.\\" And more with Adam in the same conversation: \\"Listen pal, there was a man named Dante, who said that the truly proud man who knew his own worth did never commit the sin of envy, for he could believe that there was no one for him to envy. He might just as well have said that the proud man who knew his own worth would not be susceptible to flattery, for he would believe that there was nothing anybody else could tell him about his own worth he didn't already know. No, you couldn't be flattered.\\"On Jack's melancholy trip to the West coast, and back: \\"...you can go back in great spirits, for you will have learned two very great truths. First, that you cannot lose what you have never had. Second, that you are never guilty of a crime for which you did not commit. So there is innocence and a new start in the West, after all. If you believe the dream you dream when you go there.\\"Or... just great writing:An angry Sadie Burke: \\"...with her black chopped-off hair wild and her face like a riddled plaster-of-paris mask of Medusa except for the hot bituminous eyes, which were in full blaze with a bellows pumping the flame.\\" (Italics mine)Jack, at the place where he got the proof about Judge Irwin taking a bribe, describing a scene that made me feel like I was there: \\"There was Miss Lily Mae Littlepaugh, whom, after five weeks, I tracked down to a dark, foul, fox-smelling lair in a rooming house on the edge of the slums in Memphis. She was a gaunt old woman, wearing black spotted and stained with old food, almost past the pretense of gentility, blinking slowly at me from weak red eyes set in the age-crusted face, sitting there in the near dark room, exuding her old-fox smell, which mixed with the smell of oriental incense and candle wax... And in that room. Before it, on the table, a candle burned fatly as though fed not merely from the wax but from the substance of the greasy air.\\" (Italics mine)And finally, near the end, this:\\"The creation of man whom God in his foreknowledge knew doomed to sin was the awful index of God's omnipotence. For it would have been a thing of trifling and contemptible ease for Perfection to create more perfection. To do so would, to speak truth, be not creation but extension. Separateness is identity and the only way for God to create, truly create, man was to make him separate from God himself, and to be separate from God was to be sinful. The creation of evil is therefore the index of God's glory and his power. That had to be so that the creation of good might be the index of man's glory and power. But by God's help. By his help and in His wisdom.\\" (Hmmm... I'll have to think about that).A good book, to me, has to have interesting believable characters, a setting (or settings) that can been pictured, writing so vivid that it makes me want to write down the words, steal them for future use. I want it to make me think, and it must be a well-plotted, plausible story where things happen and lives change. Reading All the King's Men was a wonderful excursion.

My comments are on the story itself, and not on this particular edition, which other reviewers have criticized. I would say, though, that if you can, read not this \\"corrected\\" edition put together by somebody else, but the original 1946 edition which was, after all, the one the author had published and the one that won the Pulitzer Prize.Some critics call Willie Stark, who rises from poverty to become the all-powerful state governor in this novel, the hero. But if the hero is the person whose actions move events forward, then this novel has two heroes: Willie Stark and Jack Burden. And their lives are inextricably bound. The actions of Jack Burden, as much as the actions of Willie Stark, move events forward. Burden is more of an observer than a participant: to observe and analyze and comment and not act -- that is what he wants. But, in investigating the past at Stark's bequest, trying to find \\"dirt\\" on Judge Irwin, Jack sets in motion a tragic series of events that lead to more than one loss, more than one death. What Burden learns is that there is no such thing as standing aloof from life's events, and that even seemingly \\"not doing anything\\" is doing something -- and repercussions follow.

A \\"Great American Novel,\\" like Huckleberry Finn, or Moby Dick, this book is also widely considered the finest fictional work about the political system of the United States ever written. Robert Penn Warren's crowning achievment, it tells the story of one Willie Stark, who rises in stature from absurd country bumpkin to serious presidential candidate in the years immediately preceding World War II. It's a beautiful, gripping narrative concerned with the conflict between the world as we wish or perceive it to be, and as it actually is, or as Warren considered it to be. Follow Willie as his genial innocence is gradually corrupted by a corrupt system and decide for yourself whether he becomes the tragic hero or cruel villain of the piece, a Hamlet or a ham-fisted Iago. Witness Jack Burden, Willie's right-hand man, undergo a transformation of such breathtaking, agonizing proportions that eventually it engulfs the lives of everyone around him, friends and enemies alike. Watch treasured illusions shatter and intricately-wrought characters unexpectedly fragment against a setting that can only be described as monolithic. And along the way find yourself questioning your own assumptions about people and the world.

Willie Stark stands in for Long as the demagoguing governor of Louisiana.The main character and narrator is Jack Burden, a rich boy turned newspaper man turned political fixer. Much more attention is paid to his story than that of Stark relative to the 2006 movie version. Characteristic is an aside in no way related to the main story that tells a tragic, horrifying story of Jack's family in the Antebellum South. We learn that Jack is a failed law student and failed history phd candidate. But we also learn more about Stark's relationship with his wife and about his son. All that said, I must say it very closely matches the tone of the movie even though it shares little dialogue and events diverge.All the Kings Men is the sort of book with a very high ratio of words to plot progress. But the language is just beautiful, and Warren draws the reader into the dirty world of 1920s/30s Louisiana politics. You just want to drink it in, to peel back the layers of story.All the King's Men is widely considered to be the greatest novel ever written about American politics. I cannot lodge any protest, although for a man keenly interested in politics my bookshelves are shamefully unadorned with political fiction. But it's really not in my mind a book about politics. It's a book about New Orleans and a book about Louisiana. It's a book about what could have been and choices we make that effect our lives forever.This review is of a paperback edition of the original version, NOT Noel Polk's revised edition."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"A steamroller of a book, All the King's Men begins in action and ends in action.

But inside our journey through mankind is the powerful engine of human enotion and All the King's Men runs the gamut.Warren had great facility with the language, in line with Twain and Faulkner, utilizing an extensive vocabulary that does not cloud or interfere with story or plot.Get the idea of a man who \\"debauched massively\\" from an automobile seat, and you see what I mean.

I ate through it during a couple of weekends of lazing about the patio on sunny afternoons. To someone with a certain interest but not fascination with American politics, this was still an incredible piece of writing. It deserves to be considered one of the quintessential Great American Novels. It was also surprisingly timeless. Written by the Pulitzer Prize-Winner, Warren in 1946, with the exception of occasional allusions to current events, this novel was as relevant and readable today as it must have been over fifty years ago. The novel traces the rise and fall of a fictional governor of Louisiana whose profile, most recognize, is that of the infamous Huey Long. I came away from it with two impressions: Robert Penn Warren's prose is absolutely beautiful (he was the country's first Poet Laureate and I see clearly why), and two, I have never spoken to anyone or read anything that would encourage me to travel to Louisiana, and this book drove the last nail in that coffin."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I'm going to go against the grain and say what I didn't like about this book. But first I'll say that I enjoyed the story and Warren's punchy writing style.My disappointment stems from the buildup to the book. So many people say that it is a great book, a true landmark realistic examination of political idealism turned to corruption. It's also supposed to be loosely based on Huey Long. But there is precious little in this story about Willie Stark, a.k.a. Huey Long; it's much more about the intellectually cynical Jack Burden, an assistent to Stark, essentially a nobody and someone I don't care about. Jack is a \\"truth-seeker\\" for Stark; majoring in history at college helped develop his skills at digging up dirt on the people that Stark wants to manipulate. But other than getting paid a good salary, it's unclear why Jack seems to feel such loyalty and devotion to Stark. Perhaps he was mesmerized by Stark's powerful personality like the others?The character of Jack offers up a non-standard version of morality. Jack feels no ethical qualms about digging up dirt on people at the bidding of his employer, Governor Stark, because truth is the highest morality. But if the \\"truth\\" is used for untruthful ends, shouldn't that compromise Jack's purported integrity? Jack never seems to ask that question.Not only do we never get to see Stark, the young idealist, we never get a good look at the corrupted Stark. Through Jack we learn that Stark occasionally uses bribery or blackmail. We never see Stark as a complete person, on the one hand as an effective, energetic, charismatic, get-things-done leader, and on the other hand as a heavy-handed, hardball-playing politician who bends the law and pushes up against constitutional restrictions. We never even really get a good look at all of the \\"king's men,\\" except for Jack, and he's just the guy who digs up dirt. So I never really learned anything about the corrupting influences of politics, or any of the specific practices of corrupt politicians.To remedy the shortcomings of this book, I am reading \\"Kingfish\\" by Richard White, a biography of Huey Long. That is perhaps the best redeeming feature of \\"All The King's Men\\"!By the way, both movies - the old and the new - are so-so. The book is better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Overall, I thought the story was okay. I am not much of a fan of Penn's prose, and this book dragged until Jack Burden retells the story of Cass Mastern. For me, this is where the book starts falling into place. Maybe I was set up for failure with this book because I keep seeing this novel being called \\"political fiction.\\" As someone picking this up expecting \\"political fiction,\\" you'd expect the story to focus on Willie Stark and in much more detail of his humble beginnings to his tragic downfall, but he is only a distant focal point in this novel as the story belongs to one of Stark's cronies, Jack Burden. I don't know WHY I'm supposed to give a flip about Jack Burden and after finishing the novel, I still don't give a toss for the character. There are so many sub-plots and interesting characters within the story that I was much more interested in than the big picture of Burden's personal \\"odyssey.\\" I felt that some of the story was predictable (Burden's father) and some of the book just didn't seem feasible (the relationship between Stark and Anne Stanton). So all in all, this book didn't do it for me. I have read better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren was one of the most outstanding writers of the twentieth century. He was the Poet Laureate of the United States and won two Pulitzer Prizes. After a brief stay in Italy Warren wrote a drama called Proud Flesh where he deals with many issues of political power and moral corruption for that power, also in this drama Warren tried to use the ideas of Louisiana politician Huey long. After not being satisfied with this piece of work he elaborate his drama into a novel called All the King's Men. All the King's Men is a book about the lives of southern governor Willie Stark and his right hand man Jack Burden as the live through the depression (1930's) in an unnamed southern state.The book starts with Willie becoming a noticeable politician after he warns many people that a school building was going to collapse. No one listens until one day the building dose collapse killing three children. He then is chosen to run for governor but unknowns to him he is only a dummy candidate to break up the vote. After he learns this he tells the rural people that the government only thinks of them as \\"dummies\\" and he drops out. He eventually runs for governor and wins a few years later and wins. Jack becomes very interested in Willie after covering Willie when Jack was a reporter and eventually Jack becomes Willies right hand man. Along with being Willies right hand man Jack also uses his skills in research to dig up info on all of Willies enemies. Along with this the book also focuses on Willie becoming more corrupt when he has more power. We also see Jack's role as the moral compass in the story. Even as Willie becomes more and more corrupted jack keeps a steady path of working toward good for the poor. In addition we see how Jack works toward marrying his childhood sweetheart Anne. In the end Willie is murdered after all the political corruption gets the better of him and the doctor of a under funded hospital assassinates him. In a side note Huey Long was also assassinated but only after he went to the senate.After reading both this book and many sites that offered commentaries. I have found that this was one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. Although as a critical reader I would not recommend this book to the average person. Personally I am very interested in the inner workings of politics, the West Wing is one of my favorite shows on television. But for people that are not as interested in politics this book may also be interesting because is dose deal a lot with personal relationship that everyone can relate to. For example everyone has someone in their life that they view as a moral compass.In conclusion this was a great book that I would strongly recommend to people that like the workings of politics, but I would still recommend this book to everyone. It was a great read and interested me greatly."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"With well over 150 reviews, most of them five stars, I am not going to add much to the mountain of positives. This is simply a powerful, emotional, influential, and sage philosophical novel about the timeless struggles of man. It is more than a political novel, it is much deeper and full of humanity than that. If you enjoy writing that is prescient and intelligent, that makes you stop and re-read and pause to reflect, than you will cherish this book as I did. This is not a pop fiction piece by any means, it is rather a book that will linger long in your mind, challenge you, disturb you, and leave its mark. Writing like this reinforces my belief in what we are capable of in our finest moments."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"Robert Penn Warren stretches a lovely novella into a less lovely collection of casually related short stories. The principal story is a GREAT ONE, AND one to which I kept wishing Penn Warren would return to. Those intermittent detours - Cass Mastern, Annabelle Trice, pigtailed Annie & Borax Pete - are, each of them, charming, but each intermittently detours from the story for which I bought the book - the story of Governor Willie Stark.A less tightly tailored Americanization of \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" with more spilt booze than blood."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"I read the reviews and agree with them all. They summarize the story, they praise it (for some it's the best novel they have ever read but I'd hate to forget \\"East of Eden\\"), and they analyze Jack Burden. I think there is another dimension, though, one that is not mentioned. I found it to be a love story where a young man (Jack) meets a girl (Ann Stanton), man loses girl because he himself is lost in his quest for self discovery, man finds and redeems himself and in the end man and woman live happily ever after.I certainly did enjoy the trip Warren took us on during Jack's journey. After reading the novel and feasting on his writing I can see why he was selected the nation's first poet laureate."},{"Title":"All the King's Men","review":"This is my favorite book of all times. Its sensual flow captivated me and carried me on a fascinating trip. I felt like it was a long poem and understood when I discovered Robert Warren Penn is a poet first and novelist second.

Robert Penn Warren writes of Lousiana politician Willie Stark, in a Lousiana long before Katrina, but not so long before politics corrupted and paralyzed the system. But it's not just about politics, or I wouldn't be reading it. It's about every other thing in this world besides that.Warren is most known for his poetry, and this long, rambling book is filled with poetic moments, grand gestures of philosophical phrases, and the bombastic arrogance of someone who things he knows much more about life than you, and as it turns out, probably does.Take a pencil, underline the good parts, watch for the cows, the bugs, the road, the twitch, the clock towers, all the things that mean everything and yet still mean just the cow. Absolutely amazing work! And no movie can come close to fulfilling the poetic wonders that fill &lt;u>All the Kings Men&lt;/u>'s pages.

Forever in awe of the &quot;great social forces&quot; lurching mankind forward, and inspired by the great financial titans and clever capitalist geniuses who attempted to reap the whirlwind, Dreiser nevertheless embraced communism late in his life as the antidote for the injustices plaguing mankind. He was a spirited social rebel, railing against orthodoxy and Puritan &quot;Babbitts&quot; who would foist their Midwestern morality down upon him, but at the same time, as he demonstrates in this book, his idealization of the small-town Hoosier philistines in Warsaw, Sullivan, and other whistle stop towns far removed from the Broadway footlights he had known intimately by the time this epic journey to the Heartland commences. Dreiser devoted hundreds, perhaps thousands of pages of prose to attacking the small-town &quot;Babbitts&quot; sharing the views of another world-weary cynic, Henry Louis Mencken. And yet, for all his caustic attitudes toward rigid conventions, Dreiser swoons in near reverie after catching first glimpse of the mundane streets, the old grammar school, feed store, and the simple folk he remembered from his youth. In other passages,examples of plain country living he encounters along the bumpy, dusty backroads of America circa 1914, are ridiculed and scorned as one would commonly expect of Theodore Dreiser and his war against society's religious and social conventions. Nevertheless, Dreiser's personal observations on life are often more engaging and inciteful than in some of his later novels. He is an American master; a pioneer of literary realism, and despite the contradictions, this is a fine and engaging volume exploring a vanished American landscape. Mr. Brinkley is to be commended for presenting it to the reading public again after all these years."},{"Title":"A Hoosier holiday","review":"In the summer of 1915, at a party in NYC for Edgar Lee Masters, illustrator Franklin Booth, a fellow Hoosier, asked Dreiser if he would care to accompany him on a motor trip to Indiana. Sensing the possibility of making a book out of the trip, Dreiser agreed. On August 11, Dreiser and Booth, along with a driver/mechanic named Speed, left NYC for the great midwest of their childhoods.This, the book that resulted from the trip, is many things: travelogue, personal memoir, soap box for Dreiser's unorthodox beliefs, among other things. As a travelogue, it's relatively easy to trace their journey almost town to town (no maps are in the book) because Dreiser names many of them; he is also impressed by a lot of them and seems to be consistently enthused about what might be around the next bend. The year being 1915, one might assume they would've taken the newly established Lincoln Highway, but they didn't, electing to go via a more circuitous route through Scranton, Elmira, and Buffalo. Dreiser is obviously thrilled by motor travel and waxes ecstatically about it throughout the trip.After reaching Indiana and visiting some old familiar places, Dreiser's comments are sometimes cynical and critical (especially of small-town attitudes and prejudices), but are also enthusiastic and proud (he has a Whitmanesque belief in the American people). But the reader must also endure sentences like these: \\"I often ask myself what it is all about, anyhow, and what are we here for, and why should anyone worry whether they are low or high, or moral or immoral. What difference does it really make?\\" Expressing sentiments like these is what kept Dreiser in trouble with the critics.All in all, it's a very interesting book. Dreiser's muscular prose pulls the reader along, and most of what he has to say is still relevant. The only thing sorely missing is an index, which would be very helpful. Like all long car trips there are slow, dreary stretches, but not nearly enough to wish you stayed home."},{"Title":"A Hoosier holiday","review":"bought this for my indiana boyfriend to give to an indiana senior citizen he works with--they both attended the same grammer school, 60 years apart.

What is divine, is not up for debate. (and will never be) It is insulting and arrogant to think that the core religious ideologies of Islam she disagrees upon she can attack. On the other hand, what is cultural, is of human making and can often be backwards in interpretation. These tribalistic and sometimes overbearing manipulations can be slowly smoothed and refined through dialog and diplomacy. However, it is a slow process and usually comes with the passing of each new generation. I feel Asra is so deeply caught up in her feminism and \\"her\\" point of view, that she fails to recognize she is overstepping the boundaries of respect and fairness to the great religion of Islam."},{"Title":"Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam (Plus)","review":"I picked up this book just on the spur of the moment from my local library. I'll admit that the title grabbed me. Not knowing what it was really about, or what to expect, I began to read with half-interest. I was quickly gripped, however, with the honesty and heart from which this woman has told her story. Many of us choose to withold those things we consider too personal, painful, or private for public view, but Asra Nomani pushes this norm aside in her pursuit to share a journey she felt the world needed to hear.Nomani, a daughter of Indian immigrant parents, grows up in a typical American lifestyle. At a young age, she begins to come aware of some of the tensions between that of her Islamic and American upbringings. As an adult, she becomes pregnant outside of marriage and is suddenly hurled into the heart of these matters as she struggles to find her place in a religion, which at first appears to reject her situation and struggle. Undaunted, Nomani begins a journey with her year-old son to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam. This journey parallels a travel made by both her body and her spirit as she goes physically to the heart of Mecca during the holy pilgrimage of Hajj, and spiritually as she plunges to the very heart of her spiritually, faith, and definition of self. Her honesty is both riveting and inspiring.The only drawbacks I saw with the book: a lot of name-dropping. As an accomplished journalist and traveler, Nomani has met and built lasting friendships with numerous big names. She doesn't hesitate to sprinkle them all over throughout the book. Also, she digresses, at times, into side and back-stories that don't seem to really be necessary. But this is a biography, of sorts, so both these issues are not that bothersome.I am forever moved by Nomani's courage and sincerity to seek harmony between all the aspects of herself, her faith, and her American values. By reading this book, you do not need to be a woman or Muslim to be inspired to take on your own journey of self-discovery and clarity. As a Muslim woman myself, I don't agree with all of Nomani's statements and views, but I don't have to. This is her story, not mine, and I applaud her heartful journey to the very soul of herself and her place in Islam and the world. This book is well worth the read for anyone seeking to better understand religion in the modern world, Islam, or women's struggle of self-definition the world-around."},{"Title":"Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam (Plus)","review":"This book will give the reader who is not very familiar with Islam a wonderful look inside this fascinating religion.

As a bonus, the reader receives a detailed lesson and analysis of modern Islam and its deviation from the origans of Islam founded my Muhammad during the early 600AD. This widely knowledgeable author also includes relevant history as it effects the modern Islamic world. Having known little of Islam, I found it a very worthwhile read in learning about a world that often conflicts with American's interests."},{"Title":"Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam (Plus)","review":"(review previously written, based on reading ARC)Journalist Asra Nomani is a woman of much complexity-she is a single mom, a career woman and an American Muslim. The birth of her son Shibli, and her desertion by Shibli's father, marks a turning point in her life and leads her to give more serious thought to her spiritual life, the result of which is her desire to participate in the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.Standing Alone is the very personal memoir of Nomani's experiences during the hajj, of her struggles as a woman in what has become a male dominant religion, of her search for a God of love among all the dogma, and finally of how the journey helped her redefine her spiritual life. She examines her life prior to the hajj, tries to work out the knotty problems of issues like pre-marital sex and divine forgiveness and the horror that some have done in the name of her faith. Nomani bares her heart and her soul to the reader as she seeks her truth.This books is more than just a spiritual journal, though. It also gives outsiders a closer, clearer few of Islam, it's practices and it's history. I found it to be not only enlightening, but very timely for our age.Ms. Nomani has opened a new world for me by helping me be rid of many stereotypes and prejudices that I had unwittingly harbored.

It angered me that she was so confused yet thought she was always right. Meaning she would say incorrect things with confidence that it was right, when it was completely wrong.shes one of the Muslims that confuse RELIGION with CULTURE..often she would say \\"Islamic culture\\". There is no such thing as an Islamic culture. Islam is a religion, and from it you know what to follow from your culture (since some of it may be forbidden in the RELIGION of ISLAM).Or she would say things and include them as solely part of her culture, when its really part of the religion. Or she would do the opposite! say something was part of Islam, when really its a cultural issue. She herself is confused about all that and in her book, if the reader was not Muslim or of the the culture she is from (or is familiar with it), they would also get confused!the plot was sort of scattered.. or well, she mentions things out of no where that need not be mentioned at the time.Overall, i just dont think that she understands THE RELIGION of Islam, without associating any culture into it. Its important to tell the difference between your CULTURE and RELIGION. They are completely two different things.I would definitely not recommend it.

It seems that among those who have read at least two of Irving's novels, there is usually one that they pick and passionately cling to as their favorite. Most then judge the rest of Irving books as falling short of the glory of their favorite. How unfortunate.&quot;Setting Free the Bears,&quot; when taken by itself, is more than worth reading. However, far too many people seem predisposed to shoot it down without finishing reading it...usually because it's supposedly &quot;not as good as&quot; (insert favorite Irving novel here). People may well be extra harsh on &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; because Irving's style is not yet fully formed here (it is something along the lines of Irving plus Jack Kerouac with a dash of Tom Robbins thrown in to boot).All this notwithstanding, I am glad to have read this book; to have encountered characters such as Siggy, Graff, Gallen and the rest of this unique cast. The literary device of splitting up the book with Siggy's notebook is pure genius.One of the reasons I enjoy Irving so much is his great sense of humor. There is plenty of it here (though much of it is of a darker kind than later Irving). In particular, I laughed out loud upon reading the scene where Siggy gets his &quot;shave&quot;.All in all, I give &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; a most hearty recommendation. Though it is not perfect by any means (I only know of one such book), it has great moments of beauty and humor. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"In all honesty, it's been years since I last read Setting Free The Bears, but I can still find the paragraphs that resonate:&quot;Some people are proud and some have their doubts. And I can look at how left out of these times I feel - how I rely on pre-history for any sense and influence - and I can simplify this aforementioned garble. I can say: all anyone has is their pre-history. Feeling that you live at an interim time is something in the nature of being born and all the things that never happen to you after birth.&quot;If these words strike a chord with you, this is a book you should read. It is closer to &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; or &quot;A Prayer For Owen Meany&quot; in character but is more cohesive; it is fantastic but wisely stops short of the extremes of &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; or &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;. It is a novel full of ghosts, of surreal acknowledgement of the things that *do* happen to us after birth, even as we fail to recognize their importance."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I have always felt that John Irving is a literary idealist of very respectable stature. This book is vintage Irving in terms of its outrageous story line, cast of soul-searching characters, and witticism-infused style of prose, but it lacks the formality which is the inescapable inheritance of a Writer of Major Recognition. This being his first novel, it seems to be the one written with the greatest freedom, and as a tale of misguided, wayfaring characters bound to their less than idyllic fates, it still manages to be heartbreaking in its portrayal of innocent idealism. This is a great book; I consider it Irving's best. I can't say many bad things about _A Prayer For Owen Meany_, either, but the manner in which it is told is much different than this story about the reckless spirit of youth."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"'Setting Free the Bears' is an early work by John Irving that would have been normally out of print, and deservedly so, if it were not for his later fame from 'The World According to Garp'. In some ways the book is similar to 'The New Hotel Hampshire', a book I actually didn't care for, but lacks the humor or the huggable characters (or the curious incest sub-plot, thank goodness). So what exactly is wrong with 'Setting Free the Bears'?Well the plot itself is rather strange and somewhat incomprehensible. A young Austrian college student bumps into a very quirky fellow, and together the tour Austria on motorcycle. Just when you think the book will turn into a funny road story with an Austrian twist the author decides to split the story in two, with the a narrative of the main character camped out at a zoo and his strange friend narrating his (pre-war) family history. Very disappointing, and very dull. The ending concludes in comical fashion back at the zoo. But this fun ending is too little, too late.Bottom line: a very amateurish effort by the often outstanding John Irving. A definite miss."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I really can't understand the head-up-the-assedness of many of these reviews. I loved this book when I first read it and I still love it now, having just finished it again.If John Irving believes that Setting Free the Bears would not be published as a first novel today, then that is more an indictment of the publishing industry than any reflection on the book.This multi-layered story is involving, illuminating, touching and shocking. Perhaps it is not as rich and polished as his later novels, but since those later works must rank as some of the best ever written in the English language, I think we can cut the guy a little slack. As a first novel, it is simply outstanding.So yes, contrary to a rather bizarre opinion found here, I did finish it."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Having read Garp, Owen, Hotel NH, and Widow, I decided that I should read some of Irving's earlier stuff. I tore through 158-lb., but not because it was any good. It was, in fact, one of the most poorly-written novels I've read in a long time. Setting Free the Bears, on the other hand, was absolutely marvelous. The zoo-diary interspersed with the 'highly-selective autobiography' was pure magic, and the end, with the Rare Spectacled Bears loping across a field together after Gallen had just left the hero (I'm blanking on his name) was an exquisite, classic Irving irony."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Easily the best Irving book that I've ever read. This is an especially good read if you're not a huge Irving fan. Much more complex underneath, it does take an appreciation of fine art to understand the subtle nuances in this book, and if you're used to mainstream (boring) fiction, you may not like it. But if you like to see how unreal reality can sometimes be, this is truly a winner."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I've read at least five other Irving books including Garp and none left me as satisfied. The stories were cleverly interwoven and like so many Irving stories included traumatic turns that where you least expect them.

I only wish that Irving would doctor this one into a screen play and let some cool young director go nuts with it."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I've never before been pretentious enough to think I could see an author developing through their work but I think I'm starting to with John Irving. This is his first book I believe and has some strong characters and an interesting plot but it very hard to read. Obsenities in the story are weakened into something unintelligable and the whole thing is hard to get through.I read his second book, 'The Water Method Man', right after this, and it is similar in style but a nicer story and easier to read (a bit).If you are just starting out with John Irving, don't start here! 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' and 'The World According to Garp' are delightful - start there!"},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Nazis and ill-tempered Asiatic bears, Communists and geleda baboons systematically intersect in John Irving's deliberately schizophrenic debut novel, Setting Free The Bears. Set in 1960s Vienna, some 20 years after the war, where the narrator, a college student Hannes Graff first meets the cryptic Siegfried \\"Siggy\\" Javotnik. Graff had often observed this strange fellow sitting by himself in the park, eating radishes and shaking his saltshakers. They, armed with no plans, decide to take a trip across Europe leading to wherever, arriving whenever. In those first 100 pages Irving is at his most irritating, his bland narrator joylessly and endlessly describing the countryside while absorbing the ramblings of the bizarre and obviously more interesting Siggy.Siggy is one of those passive aggressive intellectuals present in most of Irving's novels (see Freud in The Hotel New Hampshire, Owen Meany in A Prayer For Owen Meany). He often talks to the animals, of the animals, as he plans their emancipation from the Vienna zoo. But unlike some Irving's other intellectuals, who often serve as reflective surfaces for the boring protagonists, Siggy is given a voice, a character and a motive. The novel's masterful midsection is The Highly Selective Biography of Siefried Javotnik, where he hilariously recounts what \\"could\\" be the history of his family in WW2, what they \\"probably\\" did and what the Nazis, Russians, Chetnick ressitance fighters, Communists and their Partisans actually did. His history, the way he sees it, explains his insane plan to let the animals run free. And what Setting Free The Bears is about is this young mans quest to \\"to have a thing going for yourself that isn't somehow the apprenticeship to something that's gone before; and not yours and never will be.\\" Born in a land where the lines have been drawn, the enemies pointed out and rules set, they want to define their own morality. They want an atrocity to stop. A cause to fight for. The animals of Vienna Zoo are that cause. In the broadest sense, Setting Free The Bears is about the search for something to believe in.What they discover is that their grand metaphor for independence doesn't quite fit. Life can not be navigated at right angles, and square jawed logic doesn't cut it. For the zoo bust to be a goal in of its-self, the perpetrators must ignore the consequences. They must not consider the danger of letting predators run among their prey, or what the scavenging humans will do to those free animals. They must dig up injustices, real or imagined, that would justify their crusade. Perhaps a cruel night guard named O. Schrutt, who puts naturally antagonistic animals in a five foot cage for his own sadistic pleasure, would provide them with sufficient righteous indignation for their quest. What are they supposed to do, sit back and let the poor Antelope fight the Indo-Chinese Cat? They have to do something. One thing they must not do is plan. Never plan.Unfortunately, the figures don't always make a certain sum. And there is a beautiful passage in the book where Graff waits solemnly to hear that Bear's roar. If the now free bear roars, then the bust was a success and both he and his faraway friend can take comfort in the obedience of real life to their ill-defined pipe dreams. What Irving grants the kid, as a measure of empathy, is a vision that may or may not be a dream.Setting Free The Bears contains the seeds of a masterwork, but is too riled with Irving's detachment to achieve that status. He often resembles a ninety-year-old man, eloquently and slowly describing fantastic events. His \\"I'm too wise to be moved by this, but I'll laugh at it\\" writing style drove me up the wall with The Hotel New Hampshire. But his debut is better then that, it has a sense of joy and poignancy that escapes its elaborate metaphoric pretense. Almost despite its author."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"This book has a great deal of mediocre writing, poor character development, and forced humor; however, it was a very enjoyable and stimulating read. I think that this paradox is part of the enjoyment, in that a book that begins so poorly could grow on you to the point that you don't want to put it down. All the later themes and symbols of Irving's more mature work are here: bears, motorcycles, conspirators, Vienna, the sudden unexpected catastrophe, and the story within a story.The novel is divided into three parts and is concerned with Siggy's plan to free the animals of the Vienna zoo. While this story line is central to the book, it is the flashback, or the Notebook section, that is the strongest part of the novel. The notebook section is in many ways a precursor of &quot;The Pension Grillparzer&quot; of Garp and deals with the Anschluss era of Austrian history and Yugoslav civil strife during World War II. This section is written with the same humor, compassion and clarity that are to be found in his later works. Freedom in all its manifestations (and its inherent disadvantages) is the apparent theme of the novel and this theme is dramatized with the freeing of the animals of the zoo. This idealistic, but irrational, act proves that one man's (creature's) bars are another's security.Perhaps giving this book four stars is a little generous, but after I had finished the book I was surprised by how much I was moved by the novel and amazed at the young Irving's ability to manipulate his complex material into a coherent satisfying whole."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Being a big John Irving fan I was most dissapointed with this book.I found it tedious and BORING! Do read Garp and Cider House Rules."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"John Irving (once again) shows us his love of detail - his novels must be read slowly, and appreciatively. His &quot;back-and-forth&quot; in this novel truly illustrates his unique talent as THE American author of the late 20th century.

A real disappointment! DO READ The World According to Garp &amp; The Cider House Rules."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"This work, my introduction to the brilliant John Irving, was exquisite. I was drawn into the protagonist's world, and then into another world, via a diary, that the protagonist was pulled into. These worlds had such texture, rich characters, and fascinating plot developments, that I feared reaching the end of the novel.To my utmost satisfaction however, the work culminated in a thrilling and deeply gratifying series of events, and i left this novel at peace with myself and the world."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I suppose that if you liked Robin Williams as Garp or laugh at Pepsi commercials, this book may not be for you. Hoever, if you liked the imaginitive &quot;lunacy and sorrow&quot; of Garp and Hotel New Hampshire, and/or the rich world of Owen Meany, you will probably like Setting Free the Bears. I agree with readers who feel the zoo part of the story is slim and not very compelling, however, I disagree with those who say this is too unpolished and immature. Instead, the highly recommended flashback sections I think foreshadow the essence of &quot;Pension Grillparzer&quot;, and show that Irving does have in him enough talent and imagination to write a novel on the order of &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. Unfortunately for my tastes, I think that his later books relect more reminiscing and moralizing, although I am hoping for more farce and less political correctness in his future books. Bottom line: you MUST read the flashback chapters, but skipping the main story is optional."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I cannot understand why ALL of John Irving's books aren't on Kindle. No Garp, no Setting Free the Bears, no Water Method man or 158 Pound Marriage? I am hoping Kindle can start adding more books. They are about 750,000 books behind the Nook now. Not good. I don't even see a box where I can \\"tell the publisher\\" I want this on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"After reading the wonderfully Irving's imaginative, captivating and sometimes zany books, The World According to Garp, A prayer for Owen Meany, The Cider House Rules, Hotel New Hampshire and Widow for One Year, Setting Free the Bears was a let down. The characters were extremely annoying and hard to stomach. After reading about Siggy for 150 pages I was ready to put the book down. I don't know much about motorcycles, and dodn't care to learn. I'll admit, maybe Setting Free the Bears just wasn't a book for me. Whatever you do, don't let reading this bland novel turn you off to John Irving's other novels. Most of them are supurb."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Debut book by John Irving is disappointing only when you have previously read all others, like I did. The story is about Vienna (a recurring theme in all of his prose) and misery of the postwar aftermath with foreign occupants. The Viennese Zoo animals were released and eaten at the end of the war. Irving fantasizes about this event. I could not manage to finish the book, however. He is a talented novelist, but I should have switched the order of reading and start with &quot;Bears&quot;. After all others, I am not able to recommend the book even to myself."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"As a long time fan of John Irving's post Garp books, you can't imagine how disappointed I was in this incomprehensible mess. So many words wasted on such a slim idea."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"There's no John Irving novel I don't love, except this one. Most of them, I have re-read about five times. Even &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot;, one of his weaker novels, I read twice.I couldn't finish this one, not in THREE separate attempts, at three very different times in my life, three different frames of mind. There's nothing wrong with my reading skills. I'm forced to conclude the rest of you are lying.Siggy and Hannes are simply not characters one can care about, and the actual writing is wretched."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I have to give this book two stars for being a John Irving novel, and one star for the story of Siggy's mother and father. However, the rest of the story leaves much to be desired. I'm not surprised that this turns out to be his first novel. In fact, in Trying to Save Piggy Sneed, Irving states that he doesn't believe that this novel would even be published today as a first novel. If you're a huge Irving fan this is worth a read as it contains the common Irving themes of Vienna and bears, but don't expect the quality of his other novels. If Irving's work is something that you either love or hate, you'll love all his other works but hate this one."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"The bears of the title are in the Heitzinger Zoo in Vienna, which is why I read this first novel of Irving's. Giving a choice of his novels to begin with, I probably would have selected The World According to Garp or A Prayer for Owen Meany. But in preparation for our trip to Austria, this novel popped up as having a tenuous tie, and due to the fact that we were not finding much to go on, tenuous was better than nothing.If you take the middle section, called ''The Notebook,&quot; and remove the bits about the zoo, what you are left with is the prehistory it the Siggy character, a biographical compilation of one family from right before World War II up to the time that the Soviets withdrew from Austria. In this section you get a highly detailed and personal account of what was taking place from the point-of-view of the street. I found it strangely similar to Morton's A Nervous Splendour--a feeling of history contained in a microcosm. While fictionalized, Irving gives a clue as to his research on page 222 where in the fictional diarist lists some books of &quot;influence.&quot;The other parts of the story were less successful, at least for me. This could have been because I was looking to learn about Austria and Vienna, and took less enjoyment from the crazed antics of Siggy and Graff. Although many scenes were vivid--the climactic meeting of motorcycle and beehives, the brutality of the milkman to his horse--the overall plot was extremely disjointed. While I am likely to read another Irving novel, due to his reputation, this novel has soured me on the idea for the moment."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"If this were written later in Irving's career I'd rate it lower, but it's his first book, so you got to cut him some slack. The so-called plot of the story involves letting animals out of the zoo in Vienna, a harebrained scheme if there ever was one. The zoo bust is a bust, and I couldn't decide if I should laugh or just be sickened by the results.Almost half the book is given to Siggy's \\"autobiography\\" detailing the lives of his parents and how he came to be during the years leading up to and after WWII. Siggy is a little disillusioned about his generation not having a war to fight, so \\"rescuing\\" the zoo animals is similar to the antics of his father and his mother's first boyfriend, Zahn (who may or may not have tried to set free the zoo animals at the end of the war). Siggy's results (through Graff) are similar. The problem with the autobiography and zoo watches is that you spend so much time slogging through them that you get taken out of the rest of the story. Which could be a good thing, because none of the characters come off to be all that sympathetic (which I say for every Irving book I've read to date) and I never did understand why Gallen stayed with Graff as long as she did.A somewhat enjoyable read, but I think it's best function is to compare Irving's earliest work with his later ones. I think he improved in coming up with better stories, but I've always had a hard time liking any of his characters. If you do purchase this book and have read his later works, just try to keep in mind that this is the first so you won't judge it too unfairly."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Having met John in Iowa City before Garp was published, BEARS was all I knew of his work. I just re-read it.Despite some lack of polish, it still moves me the most. Could be I love motobikes, could be I know Austria, but mostly it captures the ridiculous intensity and bittersweet nature of relationships at that age."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Love the premise of this work: Setting free the animals in a German zoo. It inspired lots of fantasies as to how the same could be done in Chicago!!! Irving can craft a fine story, and make it entertaining and compelling. He's certainly done that in this book."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I didn't like this book. It was silly and juvenile in a bad way.

As always Irving does a wonderful job creating his characters and making the reader interested in their lives, but Irving was not at his best this early in his career. I am never a fan of Irving's short stories that he puts in the middle of his novels (Pension Gripalzer etc.) and a majority of this book is a journal written by ine of the characters, so that upset me. He also does not include wrestling and does not make any of the characters writers, which I always like in his novels because he knows the subjects and writes about them so well. I think if you are looking for an introduction to Irving or are just looking for a good book A Prayer for Owen Meany, The World According to Garp, or Cider House Rules would be much better bets."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I don't want this to be a running theme, but in concurrance with the other reviewers, this book is definitely not for the Irving connoisseur. It is broken into three sections, of which the second is the only one worth reading as it foreshadows Irving's later-to-flourish talent of weaving together storylines and plots from various sources into a meaningul synergy. If you can make it through the first two hundred pages, don't stop because there is a kernel of beauty to be found; however, if you don't make it that far, nobody (including me) is going to blame you. As a final note, I did appreciate the lengths to which Irving was able to prorogue the title's implied theme throughout all of the story's happenings and not just in the zoo break itself (not to spill the beans)."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"I first read Irving's later books, A Prayer for Owen Meany, Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and Son of the Circus. I loved those books and only wish that I had more of John Irvings to read. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by Setting Free the Bears. As one of his earlier works, I could see where he was headed, but it does not compare favorably to his more mature work."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"Talk about an inauspicious start!John Irving's books come with some clearly recognizable traits. The oh-so-cute coincidences, the not-so-subtle personality quirks of the characters, give Irving's novels a distinctive flavor that readers either love or hate. Although there are differences of opinion as to whether such traits make for good books or merely for gimmicky ones, people usually agree that the writing itself has an easy flow to it. The eye slides over phrases and sentences without difficulty, allowing one to soak up the story without struggling with bad prose.Reading SETTING FREE THE BEARS illuminates just how far Irving has come in this regard. The writing is as rough as sandpaper. Sentences, far from flowing smoothly, get bogged down in thorny verbiage, making the actual plot almost secondary to simply getting through the written page itself.As for the plot, well, Irving has grown in more ways than one. When Graff, a young college student, meets up with Siggy, an idiosyncratic motorcyclist, they decide to \`liberate' the animals at the Vienna zoo, as happened after World War II. The two go their separate ways, however, and we are thereupon \`treated' to a pre-War history of Siggy's family. It is not very interesting. But then, not much about this book really is.Irving has written some excellent books through the years.A Widow for One YearandA Prayer for Owen Meany (Ballantine Reader's Circle)are excellent, and even his second tier, such asA Son of the Circus (Ballantine Reader's Circle)andThe Hotel New Hampshire (Ballantine Reader's Circle)range from not bad to pretty good. SETTING FREE THE BEARS, however, is really for only two audience. The first is die hard Irving fans. The second is literary scholars examining the evolution of a writer's style, providing a powerful example of going from the bad to the good."},{"Title":"Setting Free the Bears","review":"If you like Irving's work, you will like this book. It's very wierd but that is what ol' Johnny is all about. It takes place in Germany and basically involves the plans of two guys to free all of the animals in this zoo. Of course, it doesn't go all to plan...but it is a very creative and interesting story by the then-budding novelist Irving. So basically you will not be disappointed by this novel if you like his other stuff. If you have never read anything by Irving, I would suggest you start with \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany.\\""},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"While this is not the best of JAK's Harmony books -- the flower-named novels in the beginning were more intriguing, with their psi energy battles -- it is nevertheless a worthy addition to her earlier work.

The book is engaging reading, particularly the mystery aspect of it. The characters were well-developed and had some sparkling dialogue. BUT, the hero seemed out of place. He was a bit too tame and mild-mannered for the heroine. The plot, the setting, and the personality of his lady love seemed to call for a more Alpha male.

She accepted, but now knows that he does not as her father and Cooper arranged for a Guild Covenant Marriage between them as expected of the two most powerful local members. The psychic duel she heard rumors of between Cooper and Palmer Frazier over her adds to her reasoning to end their engagement and move to Cadence City, an hour and a half away, to start over.Six months later, Elly searches for a lost friend private investigator Bertha Newell, who disappeared somewhere in the catacombs beneath the city. Cooper is in town for the first time since she returned his ring to him so Elly asks him to help find her pal, which he agrees to do. As they confront legends, ghosts, and drug dealers in their quest to rescue Bertha, his plan to win her back continues to fail because he fails to recognize that he never lost her.Writing as Jayne Castle, Jayne Ann Krentz takes her readers back to Harmony, a fascinating world where the supernatural is the norm. The fascinating story line is made even more enchanting by the lead couple whose dysfunctional relationship enables the audience to understand guild politics. The investigation is fun to follow as the heroes battle the paranormal, the normal, and each other in a quest to rescue Bertha.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read and I was really disappointed. The cover blurb made it sound like a much better story than it turned out to be.Elly breaks her engagement to Cooper (the new Guild boss)and runs away from him to the big city. I thought she was a spoiled brat with a huge chip on her shoulder. Cooper is a likeable guy, mature and serious - opposite of Elly.He goes after her and the resulting adventure was predictable and did not keep my attention. You could see from a mile away who the bad guy is. There were a few twists that you didn't expect and I suspect if I had read previous Harmony stories I may have liked this better. All the jargon about rezzing etc. without really explaining what it meant was distracting too. There didn't seem to be any romance between Elly and Cooper either. It was like - ok - time for them to get together so they got together. I would be tempted to try another story because I like paranormal romance and the world of Harmony could be really good but maybe borrow it first."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Jayne Castle returns to her fascinating and highly entertaining Harmony series with GHOST HUNTER.Elly St. Clair called off the marriage to Aurora Springs Guild boss, Cooper Boone, six months ago after she learned he had fought a ghost hunter duel with her ex-boyfriend, Palmer Frazier- and not over Elly as she secretly hoped but rather over Guild business. Elly was tired of being sheltered by her Guild family and moved to Cadence where she now has her own herbal shop.However, Cooper is back to claim Elly for his bride. He has carefully planned his strategy but he forgot one thing- the personality of Elly herself. Now, he must first help her locate her missing friend and ruin rat, Bertha Newell, who has disappeared in the mysterious catacombs that are under the city. Bertha has stumbled onto an underground drug lab as well as a blue ghost freak. Unfortunately, blue ghosts are a thing of legend and very few ghost hunters have the power to de-rez them; Cooper is one of these few. Cooper and Elly will have to reveal all of their secrets to one another and learn the value of communication if they hope to stop both the blue ghost freak as well as the drug manufacturing.Jayne Castle shows once again why she is a master of this genre. The richly developed and multilayered world of Harmony is easily explained to first-time readers without boring those of us very familiar with it. Rose, the jewel-loving dust bunny, is a great sidekick for Elly and her penchant for sensing trouble keeps Elly out of more than one dangerous situation.Authors frequently struggle with creating believable futuristic worlds but Jayne Castle appears to do so effortlessly. Highly unbelievable concepts become real in her hands and it is only after the reader surfaces from the final page that reality sets in and reminds the reader that Harmony is unfortunately not real. Both Cooper and Elly are strong characters, each with a good sense of self and it is perhaps this sense of realism and common sense that anchors the story. In addition, as Castle points out in her introduction, certain things never change despite the environment. A story about a workaholic who learns to put love first is a story that resonates with everyone regardless of the locale.GHOST HUNTER is not a novel to be picked up just before bedtime as you are guaranteed to remain sleepless until its conclusion. Jayne Castle captivates the reader's attention immediately and the intrigue in GHOST HUNTER keeps the reader enthralled.COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"JAK has been on my pre-order list for two decades - Jayne Ann Krentz, Amanda Quick and her Jayne Castle paranormals.

The type of books that stays in my mind ten years later. After Dark and After Glow are tied to Ghost Hunter, and just JAK as her very best. Okay, it's \\"formula\\". JAK has set patterns and she gravitates toward that, but it's a formula I adore. I simply love her males. They are properly male, bossy, arrogant, love to control everything including the woman in their lives. Naturally, you have the female who wants to be loved for herself, not her family connections.Elly St. Clair is engaged to the Guild Boss of Aurora Spring, Cooper Boone. Her father and brothers were always involved in the Guild, so naturally they were please when Elly became engaged to Cooper. Getting bridal jitters, she wants Cooper to declare his love and passion, not how suitable they are for marriage. When Cooper doesn't give her the reassurance she needs, fearing he wants her for her connections not love, she breaks off the engagement and moves to Cadence. In the six months past, she'd hope Cooper would come after her, like a dashing knight on a charger. Cooper thinks to give Elly time and she would come back. Boy was he mistaken. She's opened a plant shop and enjoys her life in Cadence.When Elly contacts Cooper and asks him to help her, he believes she wants to reconcile. That is at the very back of her mind, but her current concern is her friend Bertha is missing down in the alien catacombs, and she needs a Ghost Hunter to save her. Cooper is delighted to get the call. Only, once again, he is combining business and romance as he rides to Elly's rescue of Bertha. There is someone, a Guild hunter, summoning legendary Blue Ghosts in connection to the manufacturing of illegal drugs. Cooper is out to put a stop to the drugs, take down the Ghost Hunter who handles Blue Ghosts, and win his ladylove.Cooper stole my heart. Elly was properly feisty.

Such duels are discouraged due to the very real danger of fatalities. Elly barges into Cooper's office to see him and finds him with her dad who is also a powerful ghost hunter. Since Cooper has been very cool and controlled during their two-month plus courtship, Elly is excited thinking he may have fought a duel over her and thus loves her.

Everything was great until that curtain suddenly closed and the settlers had to learn how to survive all over again. Two hundred years later, most of the citizens have developed certain psychic powers. Most of these abilities center around the ruins of settlements abandoned by an earlier culture on the planet that died out. Now they spend a large amount of time in these underground catacombs and ghost hunters use their abilities at defusing large masses of energy to keep archeologists and others safe.Cooper Boone is the head of one of the major ghost hunters guilds. The love of his life, Elly St. Clair, has made it clear though that she has finally had enough of him and the guild. It seems his plan not to come on to strong has backfired and Elly feels he isn't actually interested in her but in the stature she can give him as future firstv lady of the guild. So she ends their engagement and high tails it out of town to the big city for her first shot at independance.Cooper gives her six months before finally chasing after her. Both of them are still in love but each wants to play it cool and make the other one confess their feelings. Elly uses the disapearances of a friend down in the catacombs as a way to hook back up with Cooper. But as he helps her, Cooper finds something fishy is going on in the big city. He'll stay to investigate and to win Elly back. And maybe it's finally time to unleash a few secrets about the rare abilities that both of them possess.With a baddy running around to foil them, a starlight hogging cop on their tales, a few past characters from Castle's series popping into help, and an adorably disarming pet dustbunny set to gaurding them the couple may have their hands full.

If I would have known that Jayne Castle is also Jane Krentz, I probably would not have bothered even picking up this book. Yet, I did give it a try and was really surprised on how much I enjoyed it. I found the beginning slow, because I had no idea what they were talking about. The language was obscured to me, probably because I have not read any of the Harmony books before. Basically, from what I understand this is a new world cut off from the old one and only just making it to a parallel with the 21st century. The world needs these ghost hunters to get to the stones that allows everything to run. The people have developed these unique talents just by being exposed to the planet over generations--I guess in a sense they adapted to their environment.This book contains action, romance, suspense, and drama.

If this is new to you it is a fast, eventful read and worth picking up."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Elly St. Clair decides that her engagement to former librarian now head of the guild, Cooper Boone, is built on delusion and leaves for the big city of Cadence.

Elly and Cooper live in Harmony, a planet of colonized humans who have developed psi abilities. Cooper is in charge of the guild of ghost hunters in Aurora Springs, and therefore suspect to many people, including Elly. But Elly must swallow her pride and ask for Cooper's help in going into the catacombs to find her friend, a ruin rat. Cooper just happens to be in town, unbeknownst to Elly, and their partnership begins to bring the romance back into their lives - along with murderers and smugglers. The dust bunnies ARE the story, IMO. Great stories, lots of humor, and a great read."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"While I usually love the quirky heroines in JAK's novels, I have to agree with another reviewer that Elly acted like a spoiled brat at the beginning of the book and I too didn't like that she dumped orange juice on the hero. She didn't seem like JAK's usual heroines. Unlike the other reviewer however, I did think she improved as the book went along.I loved Cooper Boone. He was enigmatic and sexy, as are most of her heroes, but he had more funny lines than others I've read. That set him apart for me. I especially loved his relationship with Rose.Rose was the true star of this story. She was even better than Fuzz. I loved how she kept taking Elly's bracelets and wearing them like a collar. That dust bunny had definite personality.Some people have commented that JAK's books are formulaic. I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's a formula that works for her."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I LOVE Jayne Castle (Amanda Quick and Jayne Ann Krentz)!!!

At first he seems like the strong silent type, but I soon realized that he had a mischievous streak a mile wild. I really liked Cooper and think he is a great match for Elly.Elly is tired of Ghost Hunter's and their barbaric ways, but she soon finds that not all Ghost Hunter's are as they seem. Elly is very stubborn, opinionated, and very kind making her the perfect match for Cooper. I really liked Elly as a character and felt she had a very interesting and fun personality making reading about her all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"A more engaging novel than the two previous in the Harmony series, Ghost Hunter is the tale of Cooper Boone, ghost hunter guild boss of the Cadence suburb of Aurora Springs, and Elly St. Clair, daughter of a guild boss with a new psi talent, the ability to resonate with plants. Cooper and Elly are on the trail of some drug dealers and a 'blue freak,' a hunter who can make and manipulate blue ghost energy, something previously unheard of.Because of the nuances of these two rare psi talents, I found this story to be more interesting. Castle is a master of creating a world and then building up on it. Her paranormal romances resonate with exciting twists. Really, it's like reading three genres at once: romance, science fiction, and mystery. I would definitely recommend this book to a fan of any of those genres."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoy Jayne Castle's Harmony books. She can't write them fast enough for me."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"This was my first Harmony book and I realize I started close to the middle of the series, but I never felt lost. I love sci-fi romance, but I tend to prefer the lighter fare, so this was an absolute pleasure to read. The sci-fi lingo in this book takes some getting used to, but the story is cute and entertaining. Smart and independent heroine, strong but loving hero. Great love scenes, innovative concepts, and fun world building. I'm a geek for botany and herbal remedies, so I appreciated that aspect of this story. And I really want my own pet Dust Bunny! I highly recommend the audio versions of this book as well, as the narrator is absolutely fantastic. I've bought the first few books in the series and I plan to catch up very soon. Fun, light read."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Loved it! Elements of Physchichal powers, future setting (fantasy), murder, and romance! Great combination!"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Albeit this book is a paranormal story is not eerie or spooky at any time. The love story is different from other books because it starts backwards -they're going to marry and Elly decides to jilt Cooper. This is written in the third page of the book.In the other hand you'll read about a futuristic planet far far away."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"People unfamilar with Jayne Castle's Lost Space Colony stories might now realize this isn't the usual kind of human residue type of ghosts but an force natural to another planet (very dangerous) that can be manipulated or controlled by people with the proper psi talents. I believe this is maybe her fifth science-fictional romance based on this world. I have been reading her books for years and really love these Lost Colony ones. I am very amused by the native creatures known as \\"dust bunnies\\"."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Elly St. Clair and Cooper Boone are engaged-until Elly finds out that Cooper has fought a duel over her. It's not the dueling she minds so much, as the reason for it-control of the Aurora Springs Guild. Elly had hoped Cooper was at last showing a bit of passion toward her. Instead he was only concerned with his rival's attempt to worm his way into Guild leadership by marrying Elly, whose father sits on the Guild council.And Elly naturally suspects Cooper of the same motive-especially since he has always wanted to head the Guild. So she breaks off their engagement and moves to the big city-Cadence City-where she starts her own business. But Cooper has no intention of letting her go.Taking us into the world of Harmony, a planet settled by earth's descendants, who have begun to develop psi powers after a few centuries there, Jayne Castle, AKA Jayne Ann Krentz, AKA Amanda Quick pens yet another winner for the reader to enjoy.Mix action, suspense, drama, hot romance and plop it down into the middle of Castle's lush and intriguing world, and you have the author's usual can't-put-it-down-\`til-the-last-page success. Castle's imagination has carried us through many incredible and riveting yarns, and it doesn't fail us here as she skillfully draws us into Elly and Cooper's hunt for a psi killer who is peddling an extremely dangerous new drug.I enjoyed this book as I always enjoy Castle's work: way too much. But when Castle/Krentz/Quick has a new book available, the rest of the world will just have to wait. Recommended.Reviewed by Lee MCopyright 2006-2007 CK2S Kwips and Kritiques.

Harmony's many tunnels are infested with dangerous energy ghosts that only the Guild can handle. The Guilds are secretive organizations, members are almost exclusively men.Elly St. Clair is a botanist from a Guild family. Her ancestors were Guild founders, her father is a powerful Guild leader and her brothers are following in his footsteps. She can \\"read\\" plants, a talent her family has hidden. Elly recently became engaged to Cooper Boone, the new Guild boss in Aurora Springs.Cooper is from a family of academics; he's psychically powerful and can hunt blue ghosts, a very rare ability. Elly thinks Cooper wants to marry her so he can advance his career. She breaks their engagement and moves to Cadence City, opening St. Clair's Herbal Emporium, and gets on with her life. Six months later Cooper comes to see her and hopes she's ready to come back to him.This is a typical and formulaic Krentz book. The heroine is sweet, gentle and loving. The hero is calm, powerful and self-assured. The villain is not really very important. Some interesting ideas but no surprises. Wished there was more from Elly's mother - she was only referenced but we never met her. Since she was obviously an influence on Elly's Guild opinions, it would have been nice to have seen them interact."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I must admit, I was looking forward to listening to this book. I'm a big fan of Laural (the narrator). But even her amazing voice and stunning narration can't do much with this fairly boring boiler plate story.The worst part of this novel is the heroine. She is extremely irritating. She acts like a clueless 13 year old girl rather than a seasoned college professor. She throws tantrums several times in the story, both scenes were nearly showstoppers for me. One time she has a fit in her fiancee's office...Her biggest concern is what his actions are doing to her career. Aren't there better places to discuss it that the fiancee's place of business? I think the last straw for me was when the heroine throws a pitcher of orange juice on the hero for saying something she doesn't like. I can't imagine any sane person acting the way Ellie does. She's just really, really immature. I'm beginning to wonder if the author is really this out to touch with how modern young women behave. Further, her dislike of Cooper seemed contrived. She always seems to be holding a grudge or acting contrary to spite Cooper. Very immature. The heroine isn't liberated, fiesty, or spunky. She's just plain annoying.I liked Cooper, a lot. He seemed sincere, interesting and patient with Ellie. His only flaw as I see it was his attraction to Ellie. Poor Man.As audiobooks go, I liked the narration. The story was sub-par, and I would barely consider this sci-fi. Its basically a juiced up contemporary romance with some really bad characterization on the part of the heroine.3 stars."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I like Jayne Castle and her si-fi books.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"On the planet of Harmony, Elly St. Clair breaks her engagement when she thinks Cooper Boone, the Aurora Springs Guild boss, wants to marry her because of her family's standing in the ghost hunter guild. She moves to Cadence to start a life away from her guild family, who all have psi abilities except for her. She does have a strange affinity with plants, but her mother warned her when she was an adolescent not to mention it.In her herb shop in Cadence, Elly surrounds herself with caring neighbors. When one of them, a tough ruin rat, disappears, Cooper appears in the city in time to help Elly find her. The rescue raises more questions-dangerous questions. Some of the answers are in the catacombs beneath the surface of Cadence. Elly finds out she and Cooper are both more than they seem on the surface too.The theme of GHOST HUNTER is discovery, giving the reader a fun journey from beginning to The End. Jayne Castle, aka Jayne Ann Krentz, always writes solid, fast reading books with likeable heroines and alpha heroes with a touch of beta. My one complaint is the info dumps to explain the world, but although they slowed the story, they weren't long enough to stop it. If you like your JAK with a dash of paranormal, GHOST HUNTER is the book for you."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"My attention was completely focused on this book. I just wanted the world to go away so that I could enjoy it uninterupted. It didn't quite happen like that but I never left the book for longer than I had to. That is a ringing endorsement of how much I was enjoying this story. GHOST HUNTER had it all; excitement, mystery, romance, and two lead characters that I really liked.Elly was considered the unusual one in her family. Her parents and brothers had powers which she did not posess and so she was always treated as the delicate one. A future in botany was just fine with her, she loved that field of science and was content with her teaching role. What she wasn't content with was the seeming indifference Cooper Boone had to her and their upcoming marriage. He was not interested in a Marriage of Convenience but wanted to go directly to a Covenant Marriage. How could she commit to being his wife when he so obviously put being the Guild Boss ahead of her? Like any red blooded woman she broke the engagement, quit her job, and moved to the big city. Life began to change for her immediately and she learned a lot about herself.Cooper Boone had wanted to be a Guild Boss since the age of nine. He was a man who planned every move in his life. His only problem was that he did not remember to include Elly's possible reactions to his well laid plans. He was stunned to have her return his ring. He decided to give her six months to get tired of big city life and then he would tell her he had never considered their engagement at an end, the marriage had just been postponed. Imagine his surprise when he arrived in Cadence City to find Elly with a new haircut, sexy new clothes and a thriving herbal shop.Jayne Castle has written the third novel featuring Cadence City and ghost hunters with her usual style and high quality. It contained a wonderful romance and a good suspense/mystery plot which was not quite as exciting and absorbing as the plots of AFTER DARK and AFTER GLOW, at least for me. But the fantasy world which she has created is so interesting and the interaction between Elly and Cooper was such a delight for me to read that I am willing to accept whatever her creative imagination has to offer. I would love to meet this woman, she has incredible storytelling abilities."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I really liked this story, I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"I love Jayne Castle/Ann Krentz's futuristic world and this was no exception.

I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunter (Ghost Hunters, Book 3)","review":"Welcome back to Harmony, the world where amber + psychic power = the #1 energy source. In this book, we meet Elly St.Clair and Cooper Boone.Elly grew up in Aurora Springs, amidst an important Hunter Guild family; in the prologue, she's engaged to - and in love with - Cooper, the new Guild boss (yes, it's supposed to sound like \\"mafia boss\\"). But when she suspects that Cooper asked her in marriage for her family connections and not for love, she breaks her engagement and leaves for Cadence City.6 months later, Cooper is in Cadence City on \\"personal business\\" and Elly sought him out because she needs a Hunter. They then become embroiled in a scheme to discover who hurt one of Elly's new friend when she stumbled into a drug-making operation, while clues of a mysterious and mystique legend keep cropping up, etc. etc. For those familiar with Jayne Ann Krentz, you know the drill.This, however, is nowhere near the range of \\"Zinnia\\", \\"Family Man\\" or \\"Absolutely, Positively\\". Her characters' pithy remarks - which used to be funny - now feel cold instead of ironic, and so, too, do her characters. We don't believe in Elly or Cooper and even less in their story. And yes, Rose the dust-bunny is cute, but to have her mumbling or drifting or crooning every third phrase does get to be too much.As for the suspense/mystery side of the story, it doesn't take either; by the end of the first chapter, we know who is the bad guy. It's all so static and contrived, as if JAK is writing by rote.I am a HUGE fan of Jayne Ann Krentz; a lot of her books are among my all-time favorites.

However, I was disappointed that there was so little expansion of the description of the planet and it's unusual lifestyle, especially of the catacombs. It seemed awfully and ordinarily Earth-like at times. Surely, when the jungle was discovered, there was a great opportunity for more graphic exposition in the style of her description of the \\"burial rooms\\" in an earlier title.

It's useful for students and teachers alike, but -- and I don't mean to nitpick -- it's by no means definitive. Readers should be aware of alternative attributions before they announce these etymologies to their friends or pupils.For instance, the author, Rosalie Baker, claims that the name for Africa originated from the Latin word \\"aprica,\\" meaning \\"sunny,\\" as if this were a settled matter. But it's only one of many possible origins; numerous alternative theories point to North African tribes and languages for the word's derivation.The same thing happens to \\"ketchup,\\" which Baker claims is Malaysian in origin. But it may well have come from Chinese, Arabic, or other languages.The author traces the etymology of \\"arctic\\" to the Greek words for the constellation Ursa Major. However, because Polaris, the North Star, is in Ursa Minor, this constellation may also be the source of the word.This caveat aside, there are a lot of fun and interesting tidbits of geographic, cultural, and historical knowledge to be gleaned from the book."},{"Title":"In a Word: 750 Words and Their Fascinating Stories and Origins","review":"I ordered this book for my 6 year old grand son who has expressed great interest in word origin.

And I have read many of them including Core Performance, Body for Life, Hotpoint, Body Flow, etc. I wanted ProBodX to work. After not liking it initially, I put it on my shelf. A few days later, I took at second look thinking perhaps &quot;there's got to be something to appreciate about this.&quot;Well, not only were my feelings affirmed, but I the more I read, the more infuriated I became. This book is nothing more than an informerical. If there is real content, it can hardly be seen because it is enshrounded in hype and merchandising. Where do I begin?1) First, there is a blatently self-serving Forward from Barry Sears. This is no exaggeration. He spends about 75% of the Forward talking about himself and the greatness of his diet plan.2) Then, there is the bashing. The authors spend an entire chapter attacking every popular fitness approach such as conventional weight training, yoga, cardio etc. They don't just point out deficiencies or pros and cons. They just utterly rip everybody else apart while at the same time making the argument that ProBodX is the only thing that really works.3) Of course there is the merchandising. Natually, you can only do ProBodX if you spend $200 on equipment. Where to do you buy the equipment from? Naturally, from one of the authors' websites.4) And there is the whole writing style of the book. The same attitude of &quot;this is great, everybody else stinks&quot; pervades the whole book from beginning to end. It reads like a very poorly written brochure.All that said, you're probably wondering if I am kind of overboard. Yes and no. I believe there are probably some very valid ideas contained in this book. But the everything that I have said above utterly destroys whatever genuine value this book may have had.If you are looking for this type of core building building and integrated approach to fitness, the best book on the topic is Core Performance by Mark Verstegan"},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"The excersize program presented in this book is far more challenging and rewarding than the cling and jerk of the free weights program.That said, and the other testimonies of satisfied customers of the excersizes, I would like to emphasize the excellent diet and recipe section.

However, the exercises are excellent. I think the point is to teach your body to stabilize from the core while doing sports or just moving generally. It's a full body approach, and you definitely feel like you've a had a workout and a good stretch afterwards. It's kind of like pilates but more functional. It has lots of progressions so even if you're in great shape you'll be challenged. The diet at the end is basically the zone diet except it tells you only to eat organic food if possible, and it has lots of recipes.If you don't want to buy the 'pro bells' then use two small bottles of laundry detergent that fit your hand well and use those.

Grumble.Another reviewer said that this is a great program to do \\"on the road or at [her] house.\\" I'd take this endorsement with a grain of salt, too. Look at the gear listed above. It would be problematic to travel with several of these pieces of gear unless you're driving to your destination in your own car. This workout only works \\"on the road\\" if they've already got their own set of the gear at your destination."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"&quot;The Path to True Fitness&quot; is the perfect subtitle for this book. My two sons have been working out with Marv Marinovich for approx 9 months, and he's the real deal! They have worked out with several different trainers in the past, and never have they had the kind of results they have achieved with Marv's program. I am a true believer that Marv's program of total fitness for the athlete gets the results! I have seen it work in my two sons - a dramatic difference from the other programs they have tried. This is why I can personally endorse this book, as it outlines a successful and appropriate lifestyle of health and fitness. Marv focuses on exercise and a proper diet, along with a dedicated work ethic. Marv is the real deal in that he is always there for anyone who participates in his program. He is not about the money or the notariaty. Marv is an expert in his field, and this is the one health and fitness program that actually gets the results you want!"},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"Love this book.

Can't wait for the rest of the world to catch up."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"I have been using ProBodX for over four months now, and I love it. In fact, this is the single best workout I have ever experienced. I am still strong, yet I have not worked out with a weight over 25 lbs in all that time. Which is remarkable for me, who regularly worked out with 250+ on the bench and 500+ on the squat rack.The routines are a refreshing change of pace. I do not feel tired after working out, but invigorated. In fact, the balancing exercises often make me laugh since they are so much fun. I also feel a tinge of excitement when I momentarily lose my balance when doing the other exercises.Results: The stiffness in my shoulders, hamstrings and arms is gone. My knee, ankle and rotator cuff pain has disappeared. For the first time since I was in junior high, I was able to ride a skateboard proficiently, to the delight of my niece and nephew who kept expecting me to fall off like I used to. My golf swing is more fluid, my drives longer, and my direction much more in control. While I imagine that my bench press has gone down, who cares give all the benefits?As to the diet the authors prescribe the Zone Diet. Eat whole foods, lean meats. Cut out all refined flour and sugars. Solid. Health and tasty to boot.The negative interviews seem silly, especially since none of the \\"one-star-nit-pickers\\" have actually done the exercises.A picker of nits complains about the cost of the equipment. Show a little Yankee ingenuity for crying out loud! I built my own balance boards and slant board with materials from Home Depot for about $30.The book, however, is not perfect. The movements are complex, and only one or two illustrations per exercise is insufficient. The accompanying text clarifies, but having 5-10 smaller photos per exercise would have helped matters. Further, instead of Easy, Basic and Basic+, why not Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced? Sometimes, applying conventions is a good thing.One other thing I am a little concerned about is their \\"scientific\\" study in the appendix. They ran a group of baseball players through their program. They improved. So, they declare, their training was successful. Which begs the true scientific question: Did they improve more than a group would have being trained with traditional methods? What about traditional methods with the improved diet? Or using ProBodX without the improved diets? This would be a properly structure experiment that would yield true data.But, now I'm nit-picking. What can I say? I'm a stickler for science.Minuses aside, buy this book, and do the exercises. It is a solid, well-rounded and balanced exercise system. Fun to do, and very beneficial."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"I am a woman living in Manhattan and for something I can do on the road or in my house, this book is amazing. For 40-something, I look and feel better than I did twenty years ago! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"There are some interesting exercise concepts in this book. The required equipment is:2 high wobble boards2 tall poles (they look 6 feet tall or so)2 small-ball hand weights1 slant board1 small bench that appears to be at least 1 x 1 x 2 feet1 swiss ballThe authors have a ProBodX website (the URL is the obvious one) where they forward you to their own equipment website. As of the time of writing this review (9/3/2003), this \\"official website\\" still lacks prices for some of the equipment. Given the long lead times for publishing a book and the fact that the equipment is essential for doing the exercises, I don't understand why the authors didn't have this website ready to go before the book hit the streets.The equipment is also expensive -- a set of all the gear would seem to cost between $... and $... That's a lot of money to invest to try an exercise system that you may not even like! I'm also a bit skeptical of the current \\"reviewers\\" of this book, since the full set of gear is not yet commercially available. How did they get a set? If they don't have a set, how could they evaluate the effectiveness of these exercises? Finally, there's also a glaring misspelling of \\"equipment\\" on the home page of the site!To those who want to challenge their balance, there are many less expensive core-oriented balance-challenging systems available. The book _Abs on the Ball_ completely describes a system that can be done with a Swiss Ball and a couple of small, inexpensive Overballs. I've also recently tried workouts using the BOSU, which is the top half of a swiss ball mounted on a sturdy platform. With a good instructor, a BOSU class will develop core strength, aerobic capacity, and be tremendous FUN!!!This brings me to my final point: while the authors have clearly been effective working one-on-one with elite athletes in developing this material, it's not at all clear how effective it would be to for the less-than-elite to try to learn these exercises at home by themselves. I've diligently studied Pilates for years through a variety of group and private lessons; my balance and strength have improved dramatically. However, without consistently working with experienced instructors, it would not have been possible to get where I am today.Will this program be the best thing since sliced bread? Maybe. But it's way too early to tell. If it is great, then cheaper sources for buying the required equipment should soon arise. If not, there are other interesting core-oriented exercises programs out there to explore. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"Well organized, easily understood, and well written.

Of particular interest is the knowledge imparted about the nerve and micromuscular development. Also, it helps to have different levels of the program in detail. Love the recipes!"},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"As a personal trainer and an athletic coach I stay open to ALL performance enhancement techniques and will try anything with myself and my athletes, and this is why I can tell you pro bod X is without a shadow of a doubt one of the WORST programs I have ever tried.The authors of this book would have you believe that they invented plyometrics, dynamic movement training, the principle of reversing strength, the \\"less is more\\" training approach etc, but they actually put all these elements together in a piecemeal, random way. This book is like a third rate version of better books by Charles Stayly, Louie Simmons, Charles Poloquin, Dr Chu, Bompa etc.The last half of this book is just the zone diet book over again, problem is I already HAVE Enter the Zone on my book shelf. Also as mentioned in the other reviews, you need a lot of specialized equipment which coincidentally can only be purchased from the authors website.Proprioception training works great as a warm up or cool down for more strenuous physical activity, but about 5 min of this type of training will maximize the effects and all you really need is a Bosu.

I can't tell if a single person actully learned this program from scratch.As for the guy who says it's easy to build the equipment yourself, be skeptical. He didn't say that he built -- or even has -- the wobble boards. They are a key component in the program; those would be tricky for the average citizen to build from scratch. Ditto for the small workout bench -- you'd have to apply padding to the bench or risk getting splinters every time you used it. Poles would not be as hard, but you'd have to get end-plugs or risk scratching the floor, etc.Also, read the testiamonials published here closely. See if you can find any of them where the person actually learned and applied the exercises by themselves at home with no coaching sessions from the authors. I can't find a single one."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"I read a review that made me think twice about starting ProBodX. And actually this person has written several reviews which all seem to be nit picking. It is not expensive if you use alternatives suggested by the authors. I read the Men's Journal article and I wasn't confused at all. To me some people learn by video, some learn with trianers and some learn by reading. I think that the article was saying that clubs are offering to those who want trainers. The book says you don't need a trainer. I certainly didn't. It takes a little getting used to but I feel better with each workout.I am feeling less lower back pain and no workout has left me feeling so good. I feel energetic, not exxhausted after the workout. I looked over all the reviews and for the most part they were very postive. The few that were negative starts with one by someone who hadn't even tried the program yet and they wre complaining. I think anyone who sticks with this program is NOT going to be disappointed. So far so good and I have only been doing it a short while.You don't need to use or buy all the equipment to get something from this. I don't use the disks but I love the PVC pipes which cost me $3.00 at home depot. I made my own slantboard that cost next to nothing. The balls are easy and cheap. The handweights I am buying, but in the meantime I am using half-filled ater bottles.I think the book gives you the ideal. But there is so much here to gain no matter what shape you are in. By the way I love the Chilli and the Waldorf Salad.Those who seem determined to turn people away should perhaps contact the writers directly and air his misgivings. I like to hear other people's opinions, but so far I feel good and have kept up the workout where other workouts such as &quot;Abs on the Ball&quot; were boring and in some ways same old same old only done on the ball. The exercises in ProBodX for the most part are very different.Everyone is entitled to thier opinion, but that is all it is. I am glad that I tried ProBodX for myself. I am not a workout junkie, but I just love the way this program makes me feel."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"The book may make some bold statements, but give the exercises a chance. Positions in the book look graceful and easy, but I was really challenged. As a grappling instructor and competitor I consider myself in better than average physical condition (especially with strength and balance).I thought ProBodX looked challenging and rehabilitative(!) in the Men's Journal Oct 2003 article. Having trained on balance balls, rubberized medicine balls, core stuff, etc., in the past with professional fighters, I was wanted to give it a shot. &quot;Minor&quot; back problems, a sore shoulder and lack of flexibility were also some reasons the program appealed to me.The order of the exercises made sense only as I was performing them. I could really feel how much I had been compensating for areas of weakness in certain areas of my body. I could even feel an area of discomfort in my big toe on one side. I had been &quot;babying&quot; it on that side for some time (subconsciously). I could feel stabilizer muscles in my sore shoulder being worked again as I was limiting my movement on that side. Basically, many established types of exercise and stretching are combined in this workout. A bit of yoga spine elongation, a bit of iso-type contractions, rehab movements, explosive firing of many muscle groups (minor and major), balance work. Plus it is fun (especially the pipes)! I really feel great after these drills. I do not have the dumbells so I tried the first 4 exercises with 20 pound dumbells (not the best idea). I used 5 pound weights from then on, and plan on ordering the probodx soft dumbells soon (or dumbballs which look similar).I did not delve into the diet for many reasons.I bought &quot;a.b.s.&quot; pipe instead of &quot;pvc&quot; for health reasons. I did not get a balance disk, or a slant board. $24 dollars for the dowells, dowell tips, and pipe, and $26 for the ball.The exercises have improved the quality of my life. There are many good &quot;exercise ball&quot; programs out there, but ProBodX really puts it all together. Every day tasks feel different to me, I feel like a spring. I do more - because things don't hurt.David"},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"I have spent six months using Marv's training program, and it transformed me into a new person. I used to lift hard 3-4 times/week, and eat about 6000 calories/day, thinking it would make me a better athlete. I was big, stiff/inflexible, slow, and tired all the time. After 6 weeks of ballwork, I loosened up tremendously, the diet not only leaned me out to about 8% body fat, but also gave me energy all day long. The nervous system work helped me retrain my muscles to fire faster than ever before. So, naturally, when I put it together with the running program, I looked like a completely different person.I understand that I hit this program much harder than your average person will. That person isn't looking for the same results though. Simply doing the warm-up, ball-work, foot-work, and eating well will result in a level of total body fitness beyond what you've ever experienced before. Once you learn the program, you can do the warm-up, ball-work, and footwork in under 30 minutes. This makes the remaining 23.5 hrs much more enjoyable.Whoever slams the program in this book either doesn't know much about total body fitness, or doesn't have the discipline to use the program correctly.Yes there are other programs out there. However, this is the most effective, and efficient, in the realm of total body fitness."},{"Title":"ProBodX : Proper Body Exercise: The Path to True Fitness","review":"I have actually read ProBodX and done the exercises (unlike the two \\"one star\\" reviewers below) and this is by far the best program I've ever done. The results are fast, the program is challenging, and the time needed is moderate (though it does take longer at first when you're learning how to do the exercises). My biggest complaint is the name \\"ProBodX\\" - it does nothing for me. The program is more of a \\"total\\" or \\"complete\\" or \\"comprehensive\\" body workout.About those \\"one star\\" reviews. Normally I would let it slide but these two are so full of it I need to respond.\\"Never read the book. Never did the exercises? Easy?\\" Need I say more. No, but I will. First, the authors have numerous examples of professional athletes who use ProBodX exclusively and get great, tangle results (without lifting more that 35 lbs.!) The authors beef with traditional weight training is simple: why only exercise 10-20 major muscles (out of 640 skeletal muscles) when we need all of them to operate optimally. And the reviewer claims that ProBodX is another \\"easy\\" program?! This is by far the most challenging program I've ever done or seen. You do all of the exercise on a unstable or uneven surface; you use your muscles on multiple planes (not just up and down or side to side); you reverse the exercise; and you use muscles that you didn't even know you had! Easy? Not unless you're just perusing.1) Yes, the Forward is by Barry Sears, who uses the \\"Z\\" word four times - not 75% of the time. He mentions his \\"Z\\" diet because it\`s part of the ProBodX program - taking up over 80 pages in the book!2) \\"The bashing? The attacking?\\" The authors compare over 30 types of exercises/sports to ProBodX, including a very extensive comparative chart, like the ones used in Consumer Reports. The authors remind readers to continue their own exercise program if they want to - just understand that there may be some limitations not previously known.3) \\"Merchandising?\\" There is ONE reference to purchasing ProBodX equipment in the book. Let's see, they've designed a new exercise program that requires an unusual set of equipment. How dare they tell us where we can buy it! I went online and found only one other company that sells all of the equipment needed to do ProBodX (Sissel-online.com). Personally, I shopped at both.4) \\"The writing style? The attitude?\\" Just about everything they claim is backed by examples from real life professional and college athletes. Performance improves across the board.

The equipment is easy to store if space is an issue. The equipment was easy to come by. I purchased a ball and made the rest of the equipment. I used a cutting board and phone book for the slantboard, closet rods for the poles, I used water bottles for weights and found pvc pipe at my local hardware store.

All of these, especially when combined into a yearly schedule with reasonable goals, are effective. Yet, the proprioceptive facilitation, core fitness and holistic body coordination that Marinovich and Heus present here are the best single program you could adopt. They give you several different programs, from beginners to elite athletes, that help your aerobic capacity, anaerobic strength, coordination, balance and agility - sometimes all within a single exercise!

The format is easy to understand with significant practical support for the concepts introduced and detailed in Marv's book.Having done the ProBodX workout, along with my son training with Marv at Sports Lab and now having read his book, I have witnessed tangible results from the concepts contained in ProBodx. Through the ProBodx principles both my son and I have experienced tremendous progress in reaching our respective health and sports training goals. My son has increased strength, flexibility and power evidenced by significant increases in speed, vertical leaping, quickness and overall athleticism. Just in terms of his vertical leaping he has gone from not being able to touch the rim to dunking a basketball with two hands in less than six months. His strength has more than doubled in the same time frame. I have also witnessed several other athletes work with Marv during the past six months (performing the exercises covered in the book) and they all have experienced similar or greater results in their performance.Yes, Marv's philosophy may be controversial when compared to more &quot;conventional&quot; approaches to sports training; however, I contend that these &quot;conventional&quot; approaches have left us &quot;wanting more.&quot; If one thinks through the traditional movements found in other training techniques (weight lifting, distance running, etc.) to sports related activities (i.e. basketball, golf, football, baseball, volleyball, etc.) the movements used in these other conventional techniques fall short when compared to the dynamic movements in ProBodx and Marv's other training regimens. Having participated in sports for over thirty-five years, I have not found any other training technique that parallels the movements required in athletics better than Marv's contained in ProBodx and his other training regimens. The bottom line is that the concepts contained in ProBodx WORKS!So for those athletes who wish to compete at the highest level or those of us who contend merely to be the &quot;weekend warriors&quot; the concepts contained in this book are ESSENTIAL to reaching our respective health and sports related goals.

I had one of those really big rubber balls around the house, which I never use. And I had hand weights (not what was recommended in the book, but still I used them anyway, thinking something was better than nothing.) It took me a couple tries before I got the hang of it, but truly almost immediately, I felt energized. My body felt good. And an old pectoral injury which causes me pain seemed a bit better, which is amazing because I've been living with this pain for three years!

Afterwards there's a section on each group, explaining how the verb used, and identifies the exception cases.This is a great educational tool for all those studying in french."},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"Useful, especially working with French linguistics or writing papers- conjugates any verb you can imagine and more!"},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"This is not a must-have book. Advanced students may find it useful as a compact reference for a quick lookup, but they probably already have more substantial works, including dictionaries, that cover what is in this overpriced Bescherelle offering.The attentive student will acquire gradually an intuitive feel for the most common regular and irregular conjugations. When he looks up in a French/English dictionary an irregular French verb unknown to him, he will see usually -- and, often, in bold type -- a reference number that points elsewhere in the dictionary to a conjugation-pattern chart (a collection of which constitutes 1/3 of this Bescherelle book. Another 1/3 is just a simple index of verbs pointing to the conjugation-pattern pages. The remaining 1/3, beginning with Qu'est-ce qu'un verbe? / \\"What Is a Verb?\\", is covered in most grammar books.). The well-made, decades-old Collins-Robert dictionaries that I own provide such charts and so much more; without clear, carefully selected, illustrative examples of usage, a book of foreign verbs falls flat. Except where a verb happens to be one of the 88 model patterns, looking up a verb in the Bescherelle index leads to the matching conjugation pattern of a different verb, and that is it: There is no definition of the verb or modicum of usage examples. For peculiar verbs, this is particularly unhelpful.Another sin is that Bescherelle's small-format, hardcover book (half an inch thick and half the size of a sheet of paper) is printed on low-quality, low-opacity paper whose show-through, small-font print makes every page more difficult to read. Compromise the paperback version, not the hardcover. If the Bescherelle book bothered to define each verb briefly (my Barron's \\"501 French Verbs\\" does so and also provides a handful of usage examples), the book would be nearly as compact.To this day, I find my full-size, chintzy-newsprint, decades-old paperback copy of the incomplete, lazily authored Barron's \\"501 French Verbs\\" more comforting than Bescherelle's smaller-print, definition-deficient tome: If you are a beginning student, get the \\"501\\" now, and save yourself a lot of conjugation grief. A beginner should not have to guess at verb conjugations; faster to use than a big dictionary, the \\"501,\\" limited as it is, spells out its conjugations, one verb per page, so, the reader sees the conjugation of the verb sought, not a different verb with a matching pattern.My advice for the advanced student who enjoys a variety of grammar books is to buy a cheaper, used copy of the Bescherelle book, even if it is an older edition. Verb conjugations in French have been static in recent decades, despite the few related spelling reforms, none of which has been adopted widely.IMPORTANT NOTE: Per Amazon's politically correct, \\"green\\" campaign of \\"Frustration-Free Packaging,\\" my new Bescherelle hardcover was packaged and Ground-shipped in two pieces of Amazon-logo-stamped 13\\"x13\\" grocery-bag paper glued together, with the book centered inside of them. As a result, my NEW book is DENTED in several spots. I wonder if Jeff Bezos likes to receive his new purchases with dents in them. I suspect that this lightweight, INFERIOR PACKAGING is more about saving Amazon a few cents than pandering to \\"green\\" idiots. No matter: I shall not be ordering any books from Amazon as gifts, knowing that Amazon will nickel-and-dime me by shipping them UNPROTECTED in cheap, craptastic sheets of recycled grocery-bag paper."},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"As I wrote in another review of the Verb book by Bescherelle, this line of books is incredibly organized and full of information.

This wonderful little book is INVALUABLE. It is the ONLY reference you will ever need to learn how to conjugate all 12,000 verbs of the French language.The first part of the book are the Tables of Conjugations, which show by examples all 85 unique forms of conjugated verbs in all the tenses and moods -- these include all the irregular verbs as well as those verbs which vary slightly from the regular forms. In the back of the book is an alphabetical listing of the 12,000 verbs, each with a reference to which of the 85 forms they follow when conjugated. Anywhere where the conjugation is irregular or the stem has changed (for example, the accent is changed), or there are differences in certain persons (e.g. the nous and vous persons), these warnings are printed in red to call the reader's attention to them. Bescherelle takes the extra step of listing as an individual form for certain verbs which may cause doubt. For example, take the verb &quot;apprecier&quot; (accent accute on the first e), which has its own page listing instead of under &quot;aimer&quot;. This verb is in fact a regular -er verb and can be conjugated just like &quot;aimer&quot;. However, because of the &quot;i&quot; in the stem before the &quot;er&quot;, the student may be confused or even forget to keep the &quot;i&quot; when adding an ending such as &quot;ions&quot; in the imperfect tense. Therefore, in the conjugation &quot;nous appreciions&quot;, the double ii's are printed in RED to call our attention to them. This is just one of the many things I love about this book.Additionally, Bescherelle is beautifully typeset in color and is visually pleasing. It is amazing that they managed to pack so much information into each page, yet the condensed information is not tiring to the eyes. And as if this isn't enough, you would be surprised to discover just how small and compact the book is! It weighs less than a pound (I think) and is relatively thin, unlike other references that weigh a ton because of the conjugations of multiple verbs that are conjugated in the same way -- in my opinion this just adds to unnecessary extra pages. And why have only 500 verbs in a reference book, for example, when it is more than likely that one will come across many more verbs that are not listed in the reference?The middle part of the book is a section on grammar and is the one part of the book that I haven't read yet because it is all in French, and although I'm at a level now where I can read French, I'm not quite ready to delve into the technical stuff yet. (For grammar, I have a separate comprehensive reference with explanations in English.) This does lead me to my last point: that you should get the all French version instead of the English one, even if you are a beginner, because you don't need to know any French to figure out how to use the Conjugation Tables and listing. I have used Bescherelle ever since I was a beginner and was able to conjugate verbs very early on even without knowing much about the explanations. This book will carry you through to the advance level and beyond, at which point you can decide to tackle the French grammatical explanations if you would like. With so many books already explained in English, it is a good opportunity to read some French technical text. This version is a real French book printed in France. But keep in mind that I'm recommending this book for the conjugation; and besides, Bescherelle (La Grammaire pour tous) as well as others have separate books on grammar that are probably more comprehensive. But of course, get the English version if you will be more comfortable.So, to conclude, I recommend &quot;La Conjugaison pour tous&quot; highly to all students at all levels of study. Now...if only there is a similar version for Italian!"},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"Indispensable. It's THE reference for verbs and verbal grammar. I much prefer it to &quot;501 Verbs&quot; because (1) it concisely provides each unique conjugation pattern once and only once (which makes it easier to learn the pattern), and (2) irregular forms are highlighted in red.If you haven't finished at least one year of college French (maybe two) I'd suggest that you start with the English version. There's a tremendous amount of information in the grammer section that you really won't understand well until you speak pretty decent French. What I'd really like to suggest is that you buy both versions, Use the English book until you are comfortable with the one in French and then pass it on to some budding Francophile. Bonne chance!"},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"The Bescherelle is the must-have French verb conjugation book. It is used by French schoolkids so I was surprised when I saw that my French school in Paris used it for its (foreign) students. However, it is really the best verb conjugation book out there. It does not have the flip-to convenience of 501 French verbs, but once you get the hang of it (find your verb in the back, then flip to page with conjugation of \\"model\\" verb belonging to same family), it will become 2nd nature. At first I thought that this was a disadvantage; since you are looking at the conjugation of a model verb and not of the verb itself (unless it's the model verb whose conjugation you're looking for), you miss the visual component of memorization that you get with 501 FV, which has the full conjugation of each of its verbs. Since, I have found that this is an ADVANTAGE. Memorizing the conjugation of each French verb (the 501 approach) is daunting. Memorizing conjugation by \\"family,\\" i.e., associating the conjugation of related verbs, is MUCH EASIER. And unlike 501FV, Bescherelle allows you to find the conjugation of every French verb out there! 501 gives you decent coverage, but once you reach an intermediate level of French, you will find more and more verbs that are NOT in 501FV. I bought a variety of French books for study while I was in France, but left most of these behind when I came back to the States, including 501FV... but not the Bescherelle! I take it with me wherever I move, and since it's hardcover, it won't die on me anytime soon neither."},{"Title":"Bescherelle: La Conjugaison Pour Tous (French Edition)","review":"This book is a must for serious students of French who want to easily understand the conjugations of regular and irregular French verbs.

I have been reading extensively in preparation for our trip. A reasonable understanding of french verbs will be critical if I am to communicate effectively with the people of France. I have used and become quite familiar with the following verb books: \\"501 French Verbs\\" and the \\"Blue book of 555 French Verbs\\". First of all let me say that both are fine books. I will say that the explanations about what the different tenses and moods actually mean are better in the \\"555\\" than \\"501\\". In terms of the physical size of the books I would say that they are BIG (\\"501\\") and BIGGER (\\"555\\"). \\"501\\" lists an additional 1500 or so verbs and \\"555\\" lists an additional 2500.I have recently finished reading the french version of \\"Bescherelle - 12000 verbs\\". I needed to look up a few words in the grammar section in order to fully grasp the ideas. My understanding of the tenses and moods increased exponentially. The writing style was highly lucid and direct. Just the grammar section alone was worth the cost of the book for me and well worth the effort to translate it fully on my own. The conjugation tables, as alluded to in other fine reviews, simply blow the competition away. The brilliant (literally and figuratively) verb charts are a masterpiece of organization and memory enhancing devices. The verb charts alone are worth twice the cost of the book. Finally, there is the index of ALL 12000 VERBS IN THE ENTIRE FRENCH LANGUAGE. This is far more than in \\"501\\" or \\"555\\". Incredibly, \\"Bescherelle\\" packs this punch into a book a tiny fraction of the size of the competition.

When you take away a man's right to live where he pleases, or keeps him from earning a living and be able to take care of his family, when you thwart his every attempt to rise above his circumstances and try to keep him where you believe he should be, you will have to deal with the consequences. Sustained mistreatment breeds anger that seethes and becomes consuming. The adject racism was too much to read about at times. To think that people have such a high opinion of themselves where they feel justified to discriminate against a whole culture of people is mind-boggling. The decline of Detroit is just the beginning. I always believed that America could be so much greater if people would realize that we are all human beings. We all think the same, we all want the same things - safe neighborhoods, safe schools, no violence, shelter, access to healthcare, good food and good paying jobs to take care of our families and educate our children. The city of Detroit is a sad reminder that man is its own worse enemy. I had wondered for years what exactly happened to cause such a vibrant city like Detroit to now look like a small third world country within the United States. I understand it now and it is so sad. America can do so much better."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"I needed this for a history class last semester. It came quite quickly and was very useful. This was an interesting book and did a good job of going into racial inequality issues in Detroit."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Sugrue's book packs quite a punch. He describes in some detail the effects of institutional racism in Detroit over several decades. He combines personal accounts with indisputable numbers backed by research. Any honest reader would see this as a scathing refutation of the idea that poor people of colour are responsible for their own conditions, rather than de facto segregation at the workplace and in the housing market. He also describes the results for workers of automation and the drive to maximize profits by the capitalists who own this country and its politicians. The rabid racism inherent in American culture and exhibited by working white people is woven throughout this narrative. If you want to understand how deeply rooted racism and its consequences are in the United States, read this book."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"The book is just as it should be, in good shape, and captivating in the language used to describe Detroit and its glory, or lack thereof."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Thomas Sugrue is extremely qualified to write this book--professionally and experientially. He grew up in Detroit, and is a professor of the subject. His decription of how the \\"system\\" created the devastation in our inner cities is both accurate (based on research and studies) and compelling. Anyone who cares about this situation must read this book."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Thomas Sugrue's book The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit aims to take a closer look at the cause and effects of racism and poverty specifically within the context of Detroit. Sugrue's main argument was to debunk previous scholarship that rooted the cause of racial turmoil and poverty within Detroit and other large metropolitan cities in the United States as \\"excesses of the 1960's liberalism, black power, and identity politics\\" which unraveled the New Deal gains. (p. xix) Sugrue instead turned the tables of the cause of racial turmoil and poverty from liberalism and the black people to resting the blame on the other side of racism from government policies, white activism against racial equality, and politics. Surgue even blames the New Deal itself for being part of the catalyst for racial inequality and poverty among blacks in Detroit because it promoted among the white population a sense of empowerment and entitled rights that they felt they were owed as citizens and had the right to defend. Sugrue uses sources from the U.S. Government, local politics, Unions, civil rights activists, homeowner associations and real estate brokers to prove the point that it was a concerted effort on all fronts long before the 1960's that kept blacks in isolation in which they lacked opportunities to better themselves that has only become worse over time and continues to the present.Sugrue certainly uses the sources effectively to illustrate how all white forces were purposefully trying to keep black people in their supposed place. Unfortunately there is not a counterbalance or another side of the story. The book is written with the tone, that for the most part, all white people were evil racists except for a handful of enlightened activists that belong to civil rights movements from the 40's onward. As a Caucasian reader it is getting very old to feel as though all scholars portray white people as the root of all evil and racism and that every single white person besides a handful of activists against racism played a part in keeping the \\"black people down\\". It is truly offensive to have scholars imply all white people whether they admit it or not deep down have racist tendencies. One counterbalance to make the portrayal of racism and poverty more even would be to juxtapose the black poverty experience with the white poverty experience and look where the experiences are different or the same. This book implies that all white people were at least somewhat better off than all black people. Sugrue references poor blacks, lower middle class blue collar blacks, middle class blacks, well to do blacks, lower middle class blue collar whites, middle class whites, and well to do whites, but never mentions the experience of poor white people. Does Sugrue feel that there is not such a thing as poor white people? Did he ever investigate any records or oral histories from white people who were not activists, but just part of a regular white community, that did not feel that blacks should be kept in their place? Usually people that don't feel the same about a particular issue who are in a larger group who feel strongly about an issue are too afraid to raise their voice of discontent because they feel that they will suffer ostracizing from the group they are in. Sugrue never mentioned community pressure within white groups to keep white people that thought racism was wrong in their place. Certainly without a doubt black people in general have had a far more difficult experience in this country than white people. Furthermore, it seems rather obvious to a person who doesn't know in detail the previous scholarship Sugrue was referring to in which all of today's current inner-city problems stemmed from the 1960's is false and that it has far older roots. Racism and group class does not drop out of the sky at one particular moment. All situations have long history of circumstances that leads to the current state of affairs and on that point the book does a good job of revealing the history which led to the present day situation of Detroit's inner-city as well as other cities in the Untied States. Unfortunately, counterbalance even in small amounts was lacking."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Thomas Sugrue, in his classic work The Origins of the Urban Crisis, has given us a case study of a Northern City that has fallen from grace: Detroit, Michigan. Sugrue promotes the theory that the decay of urban America can be explained by reviewing the situation in Detroit.Prior to and during World War II, Detroit was a hopping metropolis - one of many jobs and a mecca for blacks migrating from the South in search of work and a better life. Economics drove this city's growth in industry and population. Unfortunately for the city, however, there was only one industry in town - the auto industry, and such critical events as automation of the plants and the movement of the plants out of center city Detroit led to the economic collapse.Sugrue spends much of the book focused, rightfully so, on the plight of housing in Detroit - with the great influx of migrants, housing was at a premium, and because of racism, many of the migrants were restricted only to certain areas of the city, which then turned into overcrowded residential zones, thus perpetuating a crisis of where to house all of these people.This book is a fascinating work studying an urban area that has indeed come crashing down; one of the most important facets of the book is that it forces Northerners to face something that they may not be interested in hearing; that racism was very active in post-war Detroit, and often it was even more prevalent than in the South."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"I doubt any east coast intellectual can objectively look at Detroit. Since Detroit became the wiping boy of writers everywhere, criticism has been piled on by one writer after the other about a city they don't even know. Have any of them lived there? Grown up there? Visited? For How Long?While living in other large cities, I noticed a routine of citicism by one city's newspaper about another city. Having seen this time and time again I concluded that this phenomenon is human nature to make people feel better about themselves by putting someone else down. This is how the east coast folks feel good about their own lousy circumstances in the urban jungle. Since the publishing world has been centered in New York, it is apparent how attractive Detroit bashing is. Would it sell to write about the horrible things that a New Yorker puts up with on any ordinary day? The energy it takes to make it through all the indignities on the way to work alone? Or to write about housing so unaffordable that it is better to stay out than in? Of course not. Writing about how bad it is somewhere else sells. It makes people feel a little better to know that there is a place lousier than their own.The fact of the matter is that no Detroiter would put up with some of the disgusting conditions present in the large cities on the east coast and the midwest. Here are some examples of situations that no one from Detroit would put up with: Roads that can't accommodate the traffic so that hours are spent sitting in your car? Unaffordable housing? Two hour commutes by mass transit? Streets that are unwalkable? Entertainment that only tourists can afford? Parking fees higher than a dinner out for four? Filth and Squalor? Parts of town that have been totally forgotten? Renting out part of your house in order to make the monthly mortgage payment? Verbal abuse as the common discourse between individuals? Hyper insecurity about their personal circumstances? Greed beyond avarice?Detroit is segregated? Did you take a look at Chicago? Let's talk about Philadelphia?.Highways built through vibrant neighborhoods? Have you read about Robert Moses and the influence the modern movement in urban planning had on him?Here is a view of Detroit from the eyes of someone who lived in Detroit during the riots and remained there until 1985. I am going to sugar coat it for you: Once the balance of the races became overwhelmingly black, discrimination against whites was common. In the twenty years after the 1967 riots, not only did white people leave the city, so did all the the supporting services that a community would need. In order to find daily essentials, it was necessary to travel to the suburbs. It only made sense to locate in an area where the basic amenities were available.He neglects to mention that unlike other urban areas, Detroit is made up of single family homes and does not have an urban feel, even in the downtown area. It is those single family homes that attracted workers to the city along with the assembly line that Henry Ford set up over a hundred years ago. Those houses are well beyond the point where they need to be fully rebuilt. It costs more to fix them than they are worth. The owners can not sell them and relocate, so instead they remain until their death. Cheap, Run down houses are an attractive nuisance. Detroit became a haven for the down and out who have a multitude of difficulties and a as a result, create even more difficulties for themsleves.On the east coast, the cities lack the modern infastructure that is needed to move traffic in order to get to the suburbs in a timely manner. As a result, the inner cities were renovated.Instead of looking elsewhere for self satisfaction, take a look at Philadelphia's racial tensions and describe how crummy it is to sit in West Philadelphia and rewrite the same old rubbish."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"A telling chronicle of a Detroit divided. Sugrue reveals that beneath the luster of the prosperous economy and industrial prosperity lied a neglected rusted core, fostered by racial discrimination, economic fluctuations and one-sided politics. The Origins Of The Urban Crisis, reveals two Detroit's, which we've rarely seen or heard of in mainstream media or historical text. The author explains how a city once on the leading edge of industry fell from grace due to a rapidly changing economy, de-industrialization, and business flight. Leaving those without the means to escape the declining metropolis behind.As a result of discriminatory practices and a fledgling economy, housing choices and career choice was sorely limited for Detroit blacks which had substantial social, environmental and political consequences that would plague Detroit for years to come. As a consequence Detroit whites fearing an ever changing racial and economic landscape fought black migration into there neighborhoods to mantain there neighborhoods racial and financial composition at the expense of blacks fleeing the instability and despair of the inner city ghetto. This is an impressive and sobering commentary on urban America, race relations and the immense consequences of neglect and discrimination. Fully recomended for anybody wanting insight into post war Detroit and the factors which fostered poverty, societal instability and its current day status."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"fantastic book that argues capitalism generates economic inequalities and African Americans have disproportionately experienced the impact of these inequalities. falls within other books that explore the rise of the new right, but this book is unique in its focus on suburbanization and race.re-periodizes work on deindustrialization, arguing that seeds of the urban crisis were sown in the 40s and 50s- out of the contradictions of New Deal liberalism. this book shows how the racialized new deal effectively excluded african americans- but the language of rights inherent in the new deal was used by african americans to makes claims to rights. however, at the same time whites were using the same language to make claims on property rights, which redrew racial lines.on of the key- yet somewhat unexplored points is the impact of antiradicalism and anticommunism on postwar America- generating feelings of conformity and setting limits on acceptable bounds of debate."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"I think Origins of the Urban Crisis is the best book about deindustrialization, white resistance to open housing, and Detroit that I have ever read, but I am not sure if Origins fully explains the urban crisis. I still recommend it, but I am not sure if Sugrue proves what he sets out to prove.In the early 1960s people had cause for optimism about Detroit. The city had a building boom and racial divisions from 1943 were supposed to be healing. Also, Sugrue never addresses the increase in illegitimate births in the African-American community. A very high proportion of the 1967 rioters were from female-headed households.All of the following are from 1960s studies of Detroit. These quotes are from From Detroit: City of Race and Class ViolenceFrom a U MIch and Wayne State study:Long before the enactment of the Fed Civil Rights Act of 1964, and even while the State of Michigan adopted its own civil rights act there was much evidence that the disadvantaged minorities were beginning to break out of their ghetto patterns and establish first class citizenship in many areas.From Fortune magazine:the most significant is the progress Detroit has made in race relations. The grim specter of the 1943 riots never quite fadesfrom the minds of city leaders. As much as anything else, that specter has enabled the power struture to overcome tenacious prejudice and give the Negro communitiy a role in teh consensus probably unparalleled in any major American city.Negroes in Detroit have deep roots in the community, compared with the more transient population of NEgro ghettos in Harlem and elsewhere in the North. . . . more than 40% of the negro pop own their own houses.nor was Detroit doing so badly economicallyFrom the National ObserverThe evidence, both statistical and visual, is everywhere. Retail sales are up dramatically. Earnings are higher. Unemployment is lower. People are putting new aluminum sidings on their homes, new carpets on the floor, new cars in the garage.Some people are forsaking the suburbs and returning to the city. Physically Detroit has acquired freshness and vitality. Acres of slums have been razed, and steel and glass apartments, angular and lonely in the vacated landscape, have sprung up in their place. In the central business district, hard by the Detroit River, severely [sic] rectangular skyscrapers - none more than 5 years old - jostle uncomfortably with the gilded behemoths of another age.Accustomed to years of adversity, to decades of drabness and civil immobility, Detroiters are naturally exhilerated. They note with particular pride that D has been removed the the Fed Bureau of Employment Security's classification of &quot;an area with substantial and persistent unemployment.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Sugrue's thesis in this book is that endemic racism (along with economic decline) is responsible for Detroit being largely Black, poor and greatly in decline. He's a revisionist historian who wants to refute older narratives that Detroit is corrupt (because all the city governments after 1967 have been run by Democrats and Blacks). Instead he attempts to refute that by showing the deeply ingrained racism in the community.Sugrue's attempt at political polemics is bad history. He fails to mention the obvious: Detroit is over-taxed and run by incompetent, corrupt politicians. It's public unions have caused government workers to be some of the highest paid in the country with little to show for it. This is thanks to former-Mayor Young who instituted an arbitration law. To pay for this, the city's taxes are exorbitant which pushes businesses further out. Because of this, Detroit never found other businesses to take the place of the declining auto-industry which has inflated pay for its jobs in the first place.Of the past three mayors, two have been highly corrupt. Archer who was mayor in the '90s, after a distinguished career in the state Supreme Court, tried to reform the city but was kicked out of office. Young and the current mayor, Kilpatrick, are very corrupt. Just do a google news search of \\"Kwame Kilpatrick\\" and \\"corrupt\\" and you'll see the various scandals that have plagued him. Other than stealing city funds for himself and his family he turned down a $200,000,000 private gift to the city for charter schools because the teacher's unions were against it. Young, mayor in the '70s and '80s, made room for a GM plant by confiscating private land through eminent domain. Few could understand why he buldozed tax producing land when he could have given over acres of abandoned property, except that the residents of that neighborhood voted overwhelmingly against him.Yes, white people with means fled Detroit for the suburbs. But Sugrue glosses over that fact that middle class Black residents left as soon as the could too. Southfield, a surburb township, is overwhelming Black and middle class, populated by those who couldn't stand the crime and corruption of Detroit.Far from being an example of a typical post-industrial American City, Detroit is the exception. It should be held up as a prime example of how not to run a city. That being said, unless you've been assigned this book, don't read it. Sugrue gives excuses and vague general reasons (aka racism) for Detroit's decline when the real problems are staring him in the face"},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"This book is essential for anyone who really wants to understand the roots of urban decline in the United States since World War 2. Too many books focus solely on the debilitating effect of the welfare state. Urban decline is far too complicated to blame factor alone. The author of this book does an excellent job in examining the combined effects of housing and job discrimination, deindustrialization and the racist attitudes of many white Detroiters. To his credit, the author tells all sides of the story, so that no one side garners all the sympathy or hatred. Neighborhood associations are not mobs of angry, unthinking whites motivated solely by hatred of blacks; nor are blacks criminally-minded characters too lazy to find work. Once you look at everthing, you realize how intractable Detroit's problems were in 1970 and how they remain so today.Although this book is about Detroit, this book also sheds light on the fate of other American cities (i.e. Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Newark, NJ) that also experienced massive deindustrialization and population loss in the last third of the century."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"The Detroit metropolitan area today is arguably the most racially segregated region in the United States, with a primarily African-American, largely abandoned and dilapidated urban center surrounded by layers of primarily white, affluent suburbs. This book is essential reading for anyone who lives in southeast Michigan as well as other cities that have similar histories of industrialization, urban decline and concentrated poverty such as Cleveland, Gary, Philadelphia, and South Chicago.Thomas Sugrue provides a thoughtful, well-researched, and fascinating analysis of systematic racial inequality in Detroit during the post World War II automotive industry boom of the 1940s through deindustrialization and &quot;white flight&quot;, and ending with the catastrophic race riots of 1967. Sugrue avoids the current, common oversimplifications of blaming Detroit's urban crisis on the '67 riots or Mayor Colman Young by weaving together a complex story of human behaviors, fears, and incentive structures backed by data, references, and personal accounts: &quot;By the time Young was inaugurated, the forces of economic decay and racial animosity were far too powerful for a single elected official to stem.&quot;Sugrue's analysis provides insight to understand major groups of stakeholders and their interactions: Workers flocked from the southern states to Detroit seeking relatively high-paying automotive jobs. In the free market, resulting housing shortages allowed landlords to divide properties into tiny apartments and charge premium prices, protecting their investments by being selective in their choice of &quot;low risk&quot; white tenants. Bankers also preferred &quot;low risk&quot; clients, resulting in unequal access to funds. White home owners, wanting to protect their families and financial investment, resisted neighborhood integration to avoid declining property values and perceived dangers. Real estate agents capitalized on fears of mixed neighborhoods by buying property from fleeing whites at junk prices and selling immediately to blacks at premium prices. Labor unions protected seniority, which unequally benefited whites, and tended to compromise on racial issues in order to gain bargaining ground. Store owners avoided hiring black workers, wishing to avoid offending or frightening mostly white, mostly female, customers. Suburban tax incentives and new technology made large, flat assembly plants more efficient than the old multi-story plants. This drove automakers away from Detroit, where the rail and riverside real estate was largely developed, and contributed to unemployment and race and class polarization.Racial inequality in Detroit stems from complex social systems of incentives and categorical isolation caused by systematic inequality in access to employment, housing, networking and other resources. Recognizing the complexity of this social system helps the reader understand how individuals who fail to actively oppose racism actually support it, and why official &quot;race-blind&quot; policies fail to stop the polarization caused by chain-reactions of systematic, historic, self-reinforcing racial inequalities and the ruthless self-interest of capitalist culture."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Sugrue's work builds on that of other urban scholars, notably Arnold Hirsch and Raymond Mohl. Sugrue challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decay is the product of the social programs and racial problems of the 1960s. He looks beneath the surface prosperity and social consensus associated with the 1950s and finds the rise of hidden racial violence, a new ghetto (sim. to what Hirsch and Mohl term the &quot;second ghetto&quot;), discrimination, and deindustrialization. Sugrue seeks to rectify the lacking historical perspective that has hindered &quot;underclass&quot; studies. His work suggests that the intersection of race, economics, and politics in the 1940s-1960s paved the way for a social and economic disaster in modern cities. Sugrue argues that in the wake of Detroit's World War II boom, the city fell on hard times. As a result, a shrinking pie (so to speak) became highly contested by blacks and whites, particularly in the workplace and in marginal neighborhoods. Sugrue examines the racism associated with federal and local collusion to keep blacks confined in low-rent districts. Further, urban slum clearance and freeway construction worked to the detriment of the black community. Sugrue also shows how industries and businesses deserted the city in a mass exodus as whites went to the suburbs. The result? A spatial mismatch between jobs and the jobless. In the interest of space, I neglect numerous important aspects of Sugrue's seminal work. THE ORIGINS OF THE URBAN CRISIS should be mandatory reading for anyone who is too quick to blame &quot;liberalism&quot; and the Great Society for our urban ills. Essentially, Sugrue confirms for Detroit what Arnold Hirsch found true of Chicago in the 1940s and 1950s -- that the conservative backlash does not spring completely from a sense of a failed Great Society."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"This is quite a remarkable book. It attempts to explain the riots that occurred in Detroit in the late 1967. These riots were racially based and some of the most brutal in America.The book basically is about racism. It describes the history of racism in Detroit between the 1930's and the 1960's. Unlike other books that tend to be anecdotal this book attempts to look at the mechanics of the process and to provide empirical material to illustrate and validate the material in the text.The story of the book is that racism is a complex phenomenon. Detroit in the 1940's had a vast appetite for labor. This lead to it being a city in which Afro Americans could be employed. Large numbers began to migrate and to fill the more lowly paid jobs in the auto industry. The book explains the sorts of mechanisms, which governed this process. How employers would discriminate against blacks, to keep them in lowly paid positions and the fights that some unions engaged in to overcome such practices.The book goes on to explain how housing was one of the main ways in which blacks were able to be limited to certain areas. The widespread use of housing covenants permitted blacks to be excluded from more affluent areas. This meant that blacks became concentrated in small areas which subsequently became ghettos. The action of courts and legislatures to overcome the use of discriminatory covenants was opposed violently. The book shows how populist politicians would ply the race card to gain election at the expense of the more principled. How they would exploit the fear of residents about the alleged nexus between Afro Americans and crime. This in turn led to violence being unleashed on those Afro Americans who were able to afford housing in more affluent areas.With the 50's and 60's came the widespread use of automation. The number of jobs in the auto industry began to decline. As the jobs dried up the position of Afro Americans eroded further. As employment fell away the areas they lived in began to run down and become the stereotypical ghettoes, wracked with decay and unemployment. This decay occurred against a background of a society which battled hard to exclude Afro Americans from good housing, employment and the political process. The violence of 1967 was thus hardly a surprise.The book is extremely good. Often books dealing with such subjects can rely on clich&eacute; and assertion. This book consists of fact after fact and it is full of tables and maps. It is one of the more interesting studies to come out in years. No wonder it won a prize."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"As a resident of the metro Detroit area for the first 30 years of my life who finally fled last year, I write this review with a bit of nostalgic sorrow. What happened to Detroit - formerly the fourth most populous city in the U.S. and once considered the \\"Paris of the Midwest\\" - is nothing short of a very sad, sad tale.The Origins of the Urban Crisis does an excellent job at going all the way back to examine the causal factors, with a decidedly un-biased eye. The sad reality is that there's more than enough blame to go around on all sides, and the book details this without stooping to broad-sweeping generalizations; instead, it presents the facts & supporting arguments for your review.I will warn that it's a bit over-whelming in that one constantly asks themself \\"what could have prevented that\\" and \\"would X have worked\\" as they read tale of riot after riot, and injustice after injustice."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"In my perfect world, every student in public schools would be taught the major points of this book. Sugrue clearly explains, through statistical and anecdotal evidence, how Detroit went from the \\"arsenal of Democracy\\" during World War II to the rundown, segregated and impoverished city it has become. This book is fascinating.Sugrue focuses on housing, employment and, to a lesser extent, politics, to illustrate the disintegration of Detroit. African-Americans flocked to the city around the time of WWII for the chance to escape Jim Crow discrimination and find employment in Detroit's thriving industries, primarily auto and defense. But they were met with myriad problems -- white employers either refused to hire them, barred them from apprenticeships and/or relegated them to unskilled jobs that left them barely able to scrape by and always afraid of a layoff; and white residents used violence, remarkably cohesive organization and political power to keep them out of the \\"white\\" neighborhoods as long as possible, fleeing to the suburbs when the barriers were finally broken.The result? A city of poor blacks largely ignored by whites in power; industrial departure for suburbs or other regions; unfair stereotypes of African-Americans; insufficient tax money from the impoverished residents to support reasonable public schools or needed improvements. Surgrue breaks the book into three parts that are easy to follow and leave the reader fully understanding what went wrong in Detroit in the postwar years. If I have a criticism it's that the thematic approach occasionally makes it tough to remember the chronology of the major events. But it's hardly a concern. A thematic writing was necessary in this case.I will also note that in the Kindle version of this book, the photographs are terrible. They look like somebody photocopied them from the book, spilled black ink on them, and then scanned them for publication. And it's disappointing because I think some of those photos would have been useful. But I can't detract from the rating of the book since photo reproduction isn't the author' fault."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"In 2005, Detroit looks more like a city awaiting reconstruction after a series of aerial bomber raids than the dynamo of manufacturing it was at the close of the Second World War. The combinations of white flight, race riots, massive deindustrialization by the automotive industry and the industries attached to it coupled with chronic unemployment and discrimination and racism in nearly every facet of life did a great a deal to make Detroit the wasteland it is today.Thomas J. Sugrue's short study of Detroit, from the late 1930's through the 1970's is an attempt to understand the structure of Detroit's decline in racial, political, economic, and sometimes spatial terms. Through analysis of all these factors, Sugrue creates a cogent explanation of why so many formerly industrial cities of the United States are increasingly poorer, blacker, and more hopeless about their future with every passing year.Sugrue sees the problems of Detroit stemming from a multiplicity of conscious and unconscious decisions made on the part of local and national government officials, corporate boards, union leadership, neighborhood associations, and self-interested individuals in day to day life. This is nothing new in the study of post-war urban and industrial decline. What is new, and rather eye opening, is that Sugrue traces the beginnings of Detroit's economic woes to be nearly co-terminus with the war and not after the disastrous riot of 1967. This analysis is incredibly important for understanding how a massive black underclass with only minimal connections to the job market came into existence, and expanded, in the 1950's.By a combination of discrimination and bad luck, a large number of black workers missed out on the relatively high paying automotive jobs that allowed huge numbers of white blue collar workers to aspire to home ownership and middle class respectability. For a small number of black workers who were able to find auto jobs immediately before or during the war some measure of job security and the upward mobility. This was not the situation of most black workers though. Without the benefits of seniority, most often confined to jobs that were made redundant by automation or plant movements and closure, black workers were most likely to be the victims of the vagaries of Detroit's labor market. The vast body of black workers most often found themselves getting the hot end of the economic poker.Sugrue's analysis of race and the meaning of postwar liberalism is the most succinct and cogent portion of the work. One of the great conundrums post-war Detroit politics with overwhelming presence of the militant and fighting union UAW-CIO could not prevent housing segregation from becoming so thoroughly entrenched. In recounting the wartime and post war fights over public housing, Sugrue points to the dual identities that white male union members had as rank and filers and bread winning home owners tenuously holding onto newly won middle class status and their own whiteness.The part of Roman Catholic identity is something Sugrue finds to be very important to the territorial fights that occurred in residential Detroit, as well as the grass roots neighborhood organizing which occurred in white neighborhoods--both factors he identifies as being woefully under analyzed. Through Sugrue's descriptions of neighborhood attempts to stop racial turn over, or the pernicious practice of \\"block busting\\" by opportunistic real estate agents, the reader is privy to seeing grass roots mass mobilization which would have most likely have formally adopted segregation if there had been legal means to do so. The housing battles of the forties and fifties were a grim precursor of white working class abandonment of the city proper and savage and complicated forms of inequalities that plague the rust belt today.One of the most interesting portions of Sugrue's work is his analysis of how the automotive industry, in line with a great many other industries the country over, left the cities in the Northeast, Middle Atlantic and Midwest portions of the country--cities whose advantages laid in their location vis-&agrave;-vis lakes, rivers, or railway hubs. In line with Cold War planning which expected major metropolitan areas to be first strike targets by the Soviets, and because of the massive highway system built during the Eisenhower administration, it became possible for industry to disperse over greater distances than ever before. Facing the prospect of negotiating with militant unions in urban areas with powerful allies in public offices at every, much of the auto industry was more than happy to relocate to areas where unions were either weak or simply not organized--after 1947 the Taft-Hartley act made this much simpler as even Southern states with strong union presence enacted \\"right to work\\" legislation.Mixing national security rationales with a great deal of pecuniary interest, Sugrue recounts how huge sections of the automotive industry simply left Detroit without the slightest concern for what their departure would mean for the future of the city. Sugure shows how the UAW and other Detroit area unions were possibly lost a golden opportunity to redefine corporate responsibility when they did not oppose shareholder and corporate prerogatives about the free movement of property anywhere they pleased. Although any union would have had a difficult time attempting to halt the movement of corporate property from one area of the country, no international union gave their support to stopping what the militant members of Detroit's UAW Local 600 called the \\"Runaway Shop,\\" and we call deindustrialization. Some restrictions on the free flow of corporate property may have insured that Detroit's colossal unemployment of the late twentieth century would not be so colossal and seemingly intractable.The Origin of the Urban Crisis is possibly the most solid book on why so many areas of the United States sit in utter ruin today. The analysis of Detroit he gives can be extended de-industrialized cities in every region of the country with their largely black and poor inner cities and their outlying more prosperous suburbs."},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Sugrue's thoroughly researched and documented history of racial segregation in Detroit is an essential tool for anyone working on behalf of America's cities. Detailed GIS maps show the razor sharp lines that have divided the city decade after decade in what is still the most racially segregated metropolitan statistical area of over 1 million people in the United States and the only one to get worse over the past 20 years. Sugrue does a good job of examining how racism distorts free market economics. As a result, free market approaches, critical to urban recapitalization, have received a much more cautious acceptance in Detroit than in many other cities that are coming back, such as Cleveland, Baltimore and Portland. David Dworkin Director Fannie Mae Detroit Partnership Office"},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"Detroit, Michigan has been a city with numerous serious problems, one of which is a declining population (loss of approximately one million in the last 55-60 years). A common perception is that Detroit's decline began with the riot (people usually say \\"riots\\") of 1967, during which at least 43 persons died, and then continued during the mayoral administration (1974-1994) of Coleman Young. According to this perception, Detroit literally went to hell in a handcart during the 1960s-1990s period. Several journalistic accounts have appeared reflecting this viewpoint; perhaps the best-known is DEVIL'S NIGHT AND OTHER TRUE TALES OF DETROIT (1990) by Ze'ev Chafets.Historian and native Detroiter Thomas Sugrue sees things rather differently. In this book, THE ORIGINS OF THE URBAN CRISIS, a revision of a dissertation and thus heavily documented, the author argues that Detroit's problems predate the riot and can be traced back to the 1940s and, in some areas, earlier still. For Sugrue, two words beginning with the letter \\"d\\" are at the root of Detroit's (and, by extension, some other northern cities') problems: discrimination and deindustrialization. A few words about each.(Racial) discrimination in this case refers to efforts by Detroit's then white majority to make blacks live in certain prescribed areas of the city and to frustrate their efforts to move outside these areas. It also involved efforts to stymie blacks' efforts to seek and obtain better jobs especially in the auto industry, Detroit's major industry during the last one hundred years. Blacks were thus essentially confined to what one called \\"the meanest and dirtiest jobs\\" (chapter 4).Deindustrialization is brilliantly described in perhaps the book's most convincing chapter (number 5). We learn that during the 1949-1960 period four major recessions decimated the Detroit auto industry, causing the Big 3 (and others) to permanently reduce their work forces, close their plants, and, worst of all, relocate their operations to other areas. Detroit's loss of manufacturing jobs between 1947 and 1963 amounted to 134,000;during that same period the city's number of working age males and females increased.As the author makes clear in Chapter 5, Detroit's population decline did not begin in the 1960s; it started during the 1950s as a result of deindustrialization. (Detroit's population peaked in about 1954 or 1955 at a little under two million.) And while he does not mention another fact, it was also in the middle 1950s that the first of the Detroit area's suburban shopping malls opened. Might this have been a contributing factor in the population decline? I am also curious about Appendix A, which purports to show the \\"Dissimilarity of Blacks and Whites in Major US Cities\\". I could not locate a discussion of this concept in the text of the book and have no idea what it means. Perhaps someone reading this will assist me.The book sheds much light on Detroit today and is must reading for anyone interested in the city, past or present. There are some very interesting photographs (e.g. a cement wall on page 65, sometimes known as \\"the wailing wall\\") but, sadly, no bibliography. I'll give it 4.75 stars.Tim Koerner August 2010"},{"Title":"The Origins of the Urban Crisis","review":"There's quite a bit of repetitiveness in this sprawling, scholarly work, but despite its excessive thoroughness (the bibliography alone comprises almost 1/4 of the book) it's actually quite readable. The factual, dispassionate approach does lean heavily on the side of black Detroit, but does justify itself and unlike some black power/black pride diatribe, this didn't make me feel defensive (as a white person). Instead, I came away from this book armed with an improved understanding of the complex systemic factors which exacerbated inequality between blacks and whites in postwar Detroit- and by inference other rust belt cities.Being a social service researcher, I was disappointed in the relative lack of statistical rigor. Correlation often seems to be confused with causation, and in some places statistics are provided without context. For example, in one place the author notes that \\"of twelve proposed public housing sites in Detroit in the 1940s, only three were built\\"- yes, but these were just \\"proposed\\" projects, how does that rate compare to urban planning at large? In another place \\"37,382 black families and 56,758 white families applied for public housing. 41 percent of white applicants and only 24 percent of black applicants made it onto the waiting list\\"- yes, but is race the only variable here or could there other factors involved? Considering that this book probably didn't aspire to be a controlled trial or formal research study, though, those flaws can be forgiven, and in fact aren't so bad compared to most other books of its kind.Overall, Sugrue clearly and convincingly makes the argument that the problems of Detroit today do not reflect inherent limitations of its current residents, but rather stem from \\"interconnected forces of race, residence, discrimination, and industrial decline, the consequences of a troubled and still unresolved past.\\" He provides us with a powerful argument against those who say, \\"why don't they just get a job\\" by providing a detailed history of the forces of decentralization, deindustrialization, and automation stripping away the lowest rung of the economic ladder, chiefly low skill automotive jobs not requiring literacy. He attributes the burgeoning \\"alternative economy of gambling, drugs, and prostitution\\" to this lost economy. Most of us don't see this dynamic, but they should.Though the work focuses primarily on describing policy and trends, it's at its most powerful when it's anecdotal. For example, the most enduring image for me is that of the presumably well-intentioned Easby Wilson becoming the first black in an all-white neighborhood, only to see his home repeatedly vandalized and his family harassed by literally an all-ages mob of neighbors."},{"Title":"Kidstress: What It Is, How It Feels, How to Help","review":"Rather, parents should eliminate the unwarranted stresses they are responsible for.The author writes, \\"You've gotten over the breakup, and so have your children.\\"Could any statement be more ridiculous?

I've only read the Swedish original, so I can't vouch for the American translation. This review, for all its worth, is therefore based on the original version.I read \\"Children's Island\\" already as a kid. I shouldn't have. It's not a children's story. Rather, it's a sick, twisted and bizarre novel for adults. Even the contents are very \\"adult\\". My father mistook the novel for a children's story, probably because of its appealing and childish cover (different from the American cover pictured here). In fact, many of Jersild's novels are macabre, and border the surrealistic. There is also a streak of perverted sexuality running through the stories. \\"Children's Island\\" is no exception.The main character of the novel, Reine, is a 10 year old kid. He runs away from home, and meets a string of absurd characters, most of them adults. For a while, he gets a job at a kind of undertakers' firm, run by an old refugee from the Soviet Union. He gets in trouble with his mother's lover, a real bum named Stig Utler who apparently hates kids. Later, Reine joins a hypocritical, left-wing theatre company, who talk a lot about \\"solidarity\\" and \\"anti-fascism\\" while actually being fiercely competitive. Reine also encounters a strange subculture known as \\"raggare\\", often seen as menacing when the novel was written (today, they are usually considered harmless and quite cool). The \\"raggare\\" are criminal and cultish, vandalize an amusement park and carry out a strange ritual during which they demolish Reine's bike. Reine then meets a bald-headed young woman and her old lover, who turns out to be crazy, and attempts to torture Reine in a gynaecologists' chair! During the final part of the story, our childhood hero meets a group of criminal boys at a boat in the Baltic Sea. They consider the clean-cut Reine to be \\"upper class\\" and steals his toy monkey (he eventually gets it back).As for Reine himself, he is obsessed with perverse sexuality and frequently delusional. His private thoughts are more like those of a disturbed teenager or adult than those of a child. Reine comes across as a quite unsympathetic character, a kind of petty little sociopath who hates his parents, wants to become world dictator and believes that he is the only person in the universe. He is convinced that UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold is his real father. Despite being so young, Reine is also quite street smart and something of a survival artist. And no, he's definitely not upper class!\\"Children's Island\\" was first published in 1976. The plot is set in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, during the summer of 1975. When I re-read the novel this week, I was struck by the fact that many places described in the novel still look exactly the same, 35 years later! Sweden seems to have been caught in a time warp. Does nothing ever change around here? Despite the absurd character of much of the storyline, \\"Children's Island\\" nevertheless gives a very realistic impression (at least to Swedish readers). I haven't bothered checking all of the places, but I know that the flower shop mentioned in the novel still exists (or at least there is a flower shop at exactly the same spot). Incidentally, Children's Island is also a real place, although not an actual island. It's a summer camp area north of Stockholm. (Poor Reine never reaches it.)I'm not sure what the point of \\"Children's Island\\" really is. Is Reine Jersild's alter ego? Is he a symbol of wayward children? Is the story a critique of adult-children relationships in the post-Woodstock West? The novel ends with Reine apparently going back to school and his grey, everyday existence, making you wonder whether his odyssey through Stockholm was some kind of dream.Honestly, I didn't get this one. But then, Jersild's other oeuvres are even stranger!Stay tuned..."},{"Title":"Don Carter's 10 secrets of bowling","review":"Before all the new folks who write books on bowling were even born, Don Carter was defining the classic style and technique that helped many thousands of bowlers.

While most people believe the popular fallacy that the Roman Empire was in a state of decline in the 4th Century, Professor Brown shows us the Roman state at the peak of its power. He discusses what bound the various local elite to the emperor, arguring that a shared sense of education and culture provided a crucial sense of coherency to the Empire. In addition, he discusses the nature of public largess in the late empire, how local nobles maintained their positions as &quot;nourishers of the cities.&quot;He chronicles a world undergoing intense change, and the focus of the book is largly how the Christian clergy adopts traditional methods of &quot;power and persuasion&quot; to establish itself as the leading power in cities.Students of Classics tend to ignore the 4th and 5th centuries, brusquely declaring them &quot;medieval&quot; and thus inconsequential to a student of Rome's classical glory. Brown's book brings to life a dynamic and important moment in Roman history, a moment at once rooted in traditional Roman values, yet at the same time caught up in a whirlwind of religious change. As always, Professor Brown writes with a humane and style, making the book a joy to read."},{"Title":"Power and Persuasion in Late Antiquity: Towards a Christian Empire (Curti Lecture Series)","review":"Peter Brown is one of the greatest living historians of the 4th-6th centuries and this book is a fine example of the quality and incisive nature of his insights and writing.In four clear and concise chapters, Brown offers deeply clarifying and engaging examples of how the Roman Empire was \\"christianized:\\" not in moving closer to embodying the Way of Jesus Christ, but in shifting power from the old urban elite to the bishops and their clergy. The key theme is the shift from focus on the power of local elites to contain and control imperial governors to the \\"love of the poor\\" which expanded and transformed the social understanding of civic identity and its relationship to \\"the center\\" of imperial power in Rome. Brown shows clearly how theology and politics are never separate by offering numerous illustrations of how the state of the Roman Empire greatly shaped the power shift he documents and describes so clearly.These lectures are an easy to read foundation for understanding both the Roman world of the 4th-6th centuries and the ways in which that world shaped the christological doctrines that have remained at the heart of the creeds professed by Catholics and Protestants alike to this day."},{"Title":"Power and Persuasion in Late Antiquity: Towards a Christian Empire (Curti Lecture Series)","review":"I recently told a friend that I don't study history so as to avoid repeating it. That is an exercise in futility. I study history so that when it repeats, I can ride along in style.We live in a time when things are changing, perhaps more than they ever have in the history of man. The times are volatile, and there is no common footing, mutual understanding, the narratives have been destroyed, our leaders no longer even know their history much less understand it. The problems of the third fourth and fifth centuries, the problems of late antiquity have returned.For that reason Peter Brown's insights into that fateful era are of infinite worth for understanding what is happening today, and perhaps understanding what needs to be done to help things along, to ride it out, to capture influence. The book gives phenomenal insights into the economy of power, what gained a man power, how power was to be wielded, what went in to being a citizen, and what was at stake. Perhaps I betray my own Christian background when I say these things have not changed, perhaps they have morphed a little since then, but people are people. We still need the same things, we want the same things, and our deepest needs and wants are sometimes things we are unaware of. This book allows a person to reflect on the differences and parallels to our own times and society.As always Peter Brown writes in a fascinating and engaging manner with interesting insight gleaned from what could pass as boring material if you were someone else. In short he understands the paideia of which he writes. In doing so he elucidates late antiquity with daylight of understanding, rectifying false interpretations of history, perhaps correcting myths of understanding. I could not put this book down. Peter Brown shows why a degree in political science is really a degree in history.For pastors, this book is of incredible value. This is a period of time in which giants of the church and theology took great strides in shaping and forming who we are as Western Christians. It was a time when the church began, perhaps not as innocently as we would like to believe, to wield power. But that power came with a price. As bishops and other church men took over positions of power in the politics of empire, and the Bible came to replace Homer, interpretations of the Bible were given new meaning. When the position of \\"philosopher\\", who was to be a buffer and arbitrator, was taken over by priests, monks, and holy men then the ascetic lifestyle of the philosopher came to be their lifestyle. To this day this is reflected in the piety a pastor or priest is supposed to have, a piety not so much derived from scripture, as it is from the philosopher's paideia, the his learning, instruction and manner of life which gave him power in the face of governors and emperors. The idea of being baptized later in life, after you had sown your oats, and were willing to truly take on \\"true Christianity\\" as the higher paideia of the philosopher, came about at this time, and is reflected in the life of Gregory Nazianzen. This became a time when becoming a bishop was good reason to divorce your wife, and then to converse with her for the purpose of taking care of family business was reason enough to be deposed. (Pg. 138, ftn 93.) One can see from this how the idea of digamy, and not, bigamy, polygamy or womanizing, comes to form the interpretation of 1 Timothy 3 as justification for this new form of asceticism among the clergy, in a letter meant to speak out against such asceticism!"},{"Title":"Power and Persuasion in Late Antiquity: Towards a Christian Empire (Curti Lecture Series)","review":"Truth telling is ordinarily irrelevant or annoying to power. Most media is mere echo chamber for the talking points of whatever power happens to be in. Similarly, for most Greeks and Romans of means, Demosthenes and Cicero were more fairytale figures in stories these peoples wanted to believe about themselves. We are familiar with many a golden age gone dross.The Emperor was the Decider. You may be permitted to trundle in from your province and speak your piece. But killing the messenger was rather commonplace, especially if there was anything except the respectful silence and sotto voce groveling once the Emperor had risen from his seat. Professor Brown mentions a delegation from Sardis (the one before the popular Broadway bar), feeling afterwards for their heads, making sure they were still attached.Still, in a far reaching empire of 104 districts, the local elites held both the benefit of belonging and the benefit of distance. Emperors spent not much time on their roads apart from summer vacation to the villa. Mostly, they dispatched limited term governors who were best served by keeping peace with their local elites, especially with the Legions away on the frontiers. Pilate washing his hands comes to mind.That most Greek of cultural cornerstones, liberal education, featuring rhetoric, formed their virtual highway upon the Roman road. As once was true in sport as in war, personal excellence in education and rhetorical skill are what really persisted into and flourished with the Roman Age.\\"Timing is everything.\\" The stand-up will tell you. So a polished speech must delivered with perfect poise, deportment, carriage and bearing. Those are much to put over all as one appearance. Think of the perfect balance and stance of the Greek statue, extend it to voice and movement, to launch the perfect words. Here is the staged harmony of content, appearance and sound. Then think of Ross Perot. \\"Can I finish?\\" No, not with a spear in your neck.You needed every and any psychological edge. Anger carried stigma; worse, it invited corporal punishment, always a prerogative of the state.The Philosopher became the special emissary of truth. Highly educated and well spoken, the Philosopher was freed from normal society and free to intervene. Fearless, the Philosopher was sometimes burnished by torture - the ticket to the show. Death was rare; after all, 90% of gladiators retired comfortably. Death did come to Hypatia, the great Greek Mathematician Philosopher in Egypt, at the hands of Christian terrorists. You might like the film Agora which is nicely faithful and unusually accurate to the history. Rachel Weisz dies more gently but gives a commanding performance as Hypatia.Professor Brown is no soppy romantic idealist. He states clearly that the term \\"philosopher\\" has become shop-soiled from abuse. He is one of the best Classical scholars of any age. He has done landmark work in late antiquity and in the rise of Christianity. He recently completely rewrote his masterpiece on this subject because of feverish scholarship and discovery in this field since he first published - no mere revised edition.The Philosopher still, in the post Demosthenes and Cicero Age, could become the privileged advisor. Themistius, we are told, who was made proconsul of Constantinople under Constantius II, refused the grand salary. Thereby he remained advisor to the many subsequent Emperors for thirty years.Enter the Christians. In particular here come the monks. Suddenly they were everywhere. And they were not much popular with the local notables, whose world was being turned upside down. The educated elite of the old classical world were being overwhelmed by the popular crowd. \\"Any old woman\\", Augustine quipped, could be baptized into the inner circle. This was still tat time when the bible, so to speak, was accessible by all. Holy Cow, for want of a better image, the last really can be first. Big time, to quote Jerome. The Church Fathers could have been strictly Via Madison types, Ambrose and these just mentioned - - all Madmen.As the fourth century wore on, the shift to Christianity was appreciated by the local notables, who jumped on the cart. The bishop became a vital connection to the Imperial government. Here is Professor Brown:In the name of a religion that claimed to challenge the values of the elite, upper-class Christians gained control of the lower classes of the cities.De facto temporal power thus accrued to the bishops. Flavian of Antioch dashed off to see the Emperor Theodosius, attempting to head-off a wagon wreck. Fabian, sorry, Flavian had a media moment. He engaged the boys' choir to sing the petitions. They brought down the house; and Theo bawled like Peter Ustinov into his cup. As Professor Brown understates: It was a good sign.In case you are curious, the Flavian flap was over the Riot of the Statues in 387. The statues of Theodosius and his Empress were toppled and dragged into talcum powder. It was a more convincing predecessor of the Sadam statue, where the camera, in the unofficial footage, panned back to a square empty of people. Cheers were dubbed later.Professor Peter Brown wrote his lectures of 1988 at University of Wisconsin at Madison, honoring Merle Curti, into this 1992 book of just 158 pages of important scholarship."},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance Pontiac V8s (S-A Design)","review":"really interesting book even if you don't own a pontiac excellent general info applicable to any carburated engine,easy to understand and.... just get it you won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance Pontiac V8s (S-A Design)","review":"This book takes the reader through the stages of tuning a Pontiac V8, from 350 ci, through to 455 ci.

Hint: try PerformanceYearsAND BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance Pontiac V8s (S-A Design)","review":"Great book for the Pontiac enthusiast and experience engine builder. This is not the \\"101 Class\\" of Pontiac engine assembly. This book is for those who already have engine assembly knowledge or experience and want to root out the most performance using matching parts and the shared modification tips that Jim Hand has acquired through his years of hands on experience. The book provides a concise and short history of the Pontiac V-8 engine performance years. It offers insight and tips on building your short Block, assuming you already know how to assemble an engine. Camshaft selection, degreeing, and valvetrain gear is thoroughly explored and made simple to understand. Step by step modifications are shown for the Q-jet carburetor, and the AFB, Thermoquad, and multiple carb set ups. Intake manifolds and modifications are shown with test results revealed. Here is where this publication really shines - a step by step walk through in head modification; grinding, porting, polishing, valve application, and flow numbers. Good photos accompany the text and guide those who want to really make their cast iron factory heads wake up. You could skip all this and just simply buy the aftermarket Edelbrock aluminum heads, but you most likely bought this book like me because you like to do all your own assembly and want to accept the challenge of making you iron block and heads produce the most available power without going way over budget in doing so. If nothing else, it gives you a template that your buddy or local machine shop can use in modifying your iron heads for maximum performance. Next is the exhaust section that shows you what works in scavenging those spent gases out of the engine, from the high-performance Ram Air cast iron manifolds to headers, pipes, mufflers, and again, the results. Finally, many of the nations Pontiac engine builders have submitted their engine package builds and this is another great plus in using these as a guideline in building your engine. If you don't care to build your own engine, one of these builders can, but at least using this book you can ensure you understand what is being done to your engine and where you want to invest your money in gaining horsepower. Owning many stock Pontiacs over the last 30 years, and several were worn out GTO's, I was never disappointed with the factory's engine performance even when they were tired. Adding a few speed goodies and tweaking a few adjustments always made them a little faster. This book will maximize the performance potential of your new engine build and have you grinning from ear to ear when your attention to the performance details that this book offers rolls out of your driveway and lights up the rear tires to everyone else's annoyance!"},{"Title":"How to Build Max Performance Pontiac V8s (S-A Design)","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I really identify with his scientific approach to basically getting the most for your money from what you have to work with, rather than throwing money at it until it goes fast. You'll find a lot of very good, useful information in his book. The book isn't a step-by-step assembly manual, nor a shopping list of speed parts. It's really all about putting together a matched and well thought-out combo for your Pontiac-powered ride.The book covers cams, carbs, intakes, heads, blocks, exhaust, cooling and ignition and generally simple, effective modifications, tips and tricks to tailor those things to your particular combo. You'll find a good bit of Pontiac engine development history in the front and a section on engine combos from the various Pontiac performance vendors around the country in the back.I really only have one even slightly negative thing to say about this book and maybe I'm just nit-picking. I feel the title isn't exactly accurate. The book is really more about building a fast, powerful, reliable and STREETABLE Pontiac, reflecting what Mr. Hand has done with his own 11.0 second station wagon. From the first paragraph on the first page, \\"...how to obtain high performance at the most reasonable cost.\\" The title would lead you to believe you'll be learning how to build full-on dragster engines or something, which is not the focus of the book. I'd guess true \\"Max Perfomance\\" and \\"reasonable cost\\" are generally mutually exclusive.Luckily, I already had an idea what to expect from the book, being familiar with Jim Hand's car and having read all the online articles he's done along with a great many of his postings on Pontiac sites.

The pizza recipes are great, and the scones and yeast breads are delectable. But I don't feel that I can always count on Mr. Malgieri's selection of recipes, and I find Maida Heatter, for example, to be much more reliable and careful in both her choice of recipes and in her instructions.The Chocolate Chip Cookies are, hands-down, the worst I've ever made: I was skeptical when I noticed that his recipe didn't include vanilla or even a pinch of salt. The resulting cookies were lackluster --not good enough to serve to company. The Coconut Layer Cake yielded too little batter for the 9&quot; layer cake pans that were called for, leaving me with two VERY thin layers, and the directions for the accompanying coconut buttercream frosting weren't helpful enough.Although the Apricot Crumb Cake was outstanding, a Hazelnut Gugelhupf was just okay, the Banana Cake was ho-hum,and the Chocolate Sour Cream Pound Cake was dry and dull. The cheesecake recipes are very good, though.Also, I feel that the title &quot;How to Bake&quot; is misleading. This is a big collection of recipes, and there are tips for success included with each, but I haven't found this a manual to learn by."},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"Nick Malgieri's book \`How to Bake' is not perfect, but it is a very, very good survey of baking methods and baking recipes by one of the most widely respected and referenced baking experts in the country. That some reviewers have observed that he is a less than nice man to students and admirers in book signing lines is irrelevant. I have baked several recipes from this book and all have produced very successful products. In each case, I have also baked the same product from an alternate recipe and Malgieri's recipe has produced a superior result. To those who have not had any luck with his recipes, I would suggest they try some of the simpler recipes first.While Malgieri is a widely recognized teacher of baking at some important culinary schools and this book's title may lead you to believe it is a textbook covering all aspects of baking, I believe it does not succeed as a textbook on several counts. The most important is that Malgieri makes several statements, which are scientifically incorrect. One was that glass conducts heat much faster than metal. This is patently false. The odd thing is, he uses this statement to give a false reason for using glass pie plates, which may still be the best choice for other reasons. Another false statement is that yeast is mixed with warm water until it dissolves. Strictly speaking, the proper word should be \`incorporated' or \`combined'. Microorganisms cannot dissolve in water. Again, while the statement is false, it has no effect on the efficacy of the recipe. I only point these out because Malgieri is an educator and should know better.There is another sense in which I believe this cannot be a textbook for baking. This is the fact that I believe the coverage of bread baking is rather light. For breads, I would refer you to either Rose Levy Beranbaum's \`The Bread Bible' or Peter Reinhart's \`The Bread Baker's Apprentice. This doesn't mean you will not find a lot of good stuff here. In fact, I go to this book before any other when I want to bake something (other than bread) to see if Malgieri has a recipe for the product I'm interested in. This book is very similar to the book \`Baking With Julia' in that both are surveys of a lot of different baking techniques giving some very commonly baked goods as models for those techniques. This makes these two books my first and second choices when I want to bake.Therefore, the subtitle on the front of the book, which calls itself a \`Complete Guide', is a bit of a stretch. You should still buy this book if you enjoy baking. In fact, the most accurate reflection of the book's value is in Nick's introduction where he quotes a colleague who says \`Bake something, You will feel better.' This is an especially good book to help you bake something and feel better."},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"Again, I was impressed.

Nick Malgieri does not go into any type of specific detail about 'how to bake' in the meaning itself, but he does tell us how to bake many delicious treats.This book is packed with recipes for assorted breads, scones, biscuits and muffins. Pizza and Focaccia, chicken and fruit pies. Many different fruit and creme tarts. Beautiful to look at and eat Cookies and Filled Cookies. He has included a wide assortment of Cakes (my family's favorite), with frosting. He even has plenty of recipes using certain types of dough, such as Pate a Choux, to make many different kinds of pastries. Some of the pastry doughs are a little time consuming, as are some of the bread recipes, but they are pretty uncomplicated, and very much worth the time and effort.I have tried out several different kinds of breads and pastries, which of course, were all superb. Every recipe is clear in its description, and there are illustrations for many of them. There are two sections of beautiful color pictures that are pleasing to the eye as well as the pallette.This book is a welcome addition to any cooks library.

I have tried about 2/3 of all the recipes, and all came out perfect.First of all, this is one of the few American baking books that uses an appropriate amount of sugar for sweet cakes......most books use a ratio of 3 parts flour, 2 parts sugar, which is too sweet for me. In this book, the author uses the classical 2 parts flour, 1 part sugar.One of the biggest successes is his recipe for the genoise. Unlike other recipes, he uses extra yolks instead of butter, which makes them super, super soft and moist. The pizza dough is to die for, a pizzeria can't make it any better.The book has a good balance between easily understandable recipes, variations to all recipes, guides, notes and general explanations as to how to get great results. Each chapter starts with a general comment on the kind of cake/pizza/pastry that is to be baked, where the recipe originated, possible variations of the recipe, and a perfect description of the consistency and taste of the finished product.The bread section gives a wonderful explanation about the different starters, the effect of the different risings in bread, and it has great quick breads as well as some wonderful artesian breads with a crackly-crunchy crust.If you don't want to invest in a lot of specialized baking books, this is the ideal book: it covers everything from pizza to bread to cookies to croissants to cakes. And if you already have a great collection of cooking and baking books, this one is an absolute necessity!"},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"After seeing Mr. Malgieri on the Food Network, I waited quite some time to obtain this book...and I wish I hadn't. The recipes are perfectly detailed and easy to follow. Many of them tell you how to mix the ingredients three different ways: by hand, with a heavy-duty mixer or with a food processor. As a baker for many years, I found myself not only baking with this book, but reading it, too. It is finely detailed and contains many hints and recipe variations that you won't want to miss. Can't wait to receive my recently ordered Malgieri book, &quot;Great Italian Dessert.&quot;"},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"I like Malgieri's practical, no nonsense instruction. This book is a great teacher as well as a good cookbook. It is equally good for beginner and expert. His recipes are achievable and delicious. He explains and teaches so that one is not left in the dark as to any of the \\"how tos.\\"Last Christmas, I gave countless loaves of panettone...all met with great appreciation and raves. I fear it is now an expected tradition for me. His challah is one of my favorites and was my first attempt at this beautiful braided bread. I am hooked. It is interesting as each time I make it, I think \\"this isn't going to rise\\" but each time it rises beautifully.My only critique is that I wish he'd included comments on oven spring. Some rise like crazy in the oven, some do not. All in all, it's a good book to have."},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"I descend from a long line of Sicilian cooks. I bought Nick's book to help refine techniques when I opened my Cottage Tea Room last July (after having retired from teaching 46 years) which serves traditional English Cream Teas with an &quot;as my Wimsey takes me&quot; flight into cakes, cookies, pastries, candies and other delights not particularly English. However, I did need a perfect Scone recipe - rich, light and moist. I was joyful to find several recipes in Nick's book. I tried the basic recipe and it delighted me and my clients! Of course, I made several modifications as all of us who love to cook do. Imagine my mischievous delight to be able to tell my clients who were certain I had brought back the recipe from England (where I have studied and which I visit as often as I can) that my scone recipe is based on that of a Sicilian culinary genius. Bravo Nicola! This June I am expanding to a lunch service. You can bet I am purchasing more Malgieri cook books. Maybe I can find a caponata or a gemelle recipe to match my late mother's. And yes, I find all the recipes a joy to follow. I especially like the fact that Nick adapts recipes to be made by food processor, mixer, blender or the old way - by hand and strong arm.Caterina Musso Lacey The Cottage Tea Room Moriah, N.Y. 12960 mussolacey@mindspring.com"},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"Nick Malgieri, renowned Peter Kump cooking school teacher, has put himself on the line by entitling this cookbook &quot;How to Bake.&quot; The good news is: he knows how! The even better news is: he's a master at teaching and coaxing you along gently so that before you know it, you'll be baking better than you ever have in your life.Although the title makes this sound as though it's perhaps aimed at beginning bakers, it's really for intermediate or advanced bakers--or beginners with a lot of werewithal and confidence. Malgieri doesn't spell every tiny little thing out for you (there's very little of the hand-holding and overly detailed directions that are in most cookbooks nowadays). Where he excels is in making you feel that, you, too could turn out the gorgeous baked goods in the book with a little bit of effort and a minimum of fuss.Especially fine are the recipes for Raspberry and Almonds Tarts and Chocolate Chestnut Buche de Noel. I also loved the Scottish Shortbread, although I rolled it thinner than he called for AND baked it longer. All in all an excellent guide to baking by an accomplished master baker."},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"I love the recipes in this book so much that the pages are food splattered.

But that damn chocolate chip cookie recipe is TERRIBLE!!! I can't believe it was included in the book. Dry, textureless and even tasteless. What a mistake! So all the recipes (except for the superb breads) are quite hit and miss.

Recently I made the hamantaschen, and as I was mixing the dough, I kept thinking that the proportions of ingredients in the recipe was wrong. Generally I try a recipe as written the first time around, though, and then decide whether to keep, tweak, or toss. This one falls into the last category. The dough was so short it was almost impossible to work with. Also, the recipe calls for using a 2 1/2 to 3\\" cutter, but the number of pastries is based on a 2\\" cutter. With a three inch cutter, the cookies came out teeny by the time they were shaped into traditional hamantaschen. They don't spread at all, so I wound up with cocktail sized pastries. They taste OK, but nothing special and although the apricot filling was good, it's kind of a no-brainer.

But the content is great. The recipes that I have tried (scones, muffins, breads, cakes) were all wonderful. I was afraid to try the cookies because previous reviewers were so negative about them. I'll try them eventually myself.

The instructions are clear and specific, and if you follow the directions, the product is pretty reliable.However, the title that the book is a \\"Complete guide\\" is a misnomer as the book does not teach the principles of baking, nor is it comprehensive in its scope of even the basic materials. While the bread section is good, it has fairly few recipes, and if you ever have a specific recipe in mind, chances are the book will not have it.That being said, there are some very good recipes in this book, and if you are not interested in knowing \\"what's the difference between baking powder and baking soda\\" questions, it can certainly serve as a good recipe book. However, after reading all about Mr. Malgheri's excellent as an instructor and given the title, I was expecting something more.I think the problem is that I'm not sure which audience this book is supposedly to target. For bread baking, there are much better ones by Peter Reinhardt. For general baking there's King Arthur and Julia's books. For cakes there's Dorie Greenspan. So while it is certainly not a bad cookbook, I feel there're better options out there for most categories.

His instructions are far more complete. In a good number of cases he provides separate instructions for preparation using a food processor, a dough hook, and by hand. So those who would teach baking will find this a valuable resource, especially when the discussion gets around to scaling up a test recipe to production levels.Malgieri also includes in his commentary some discussion on the history of baking, which sometimes helps us understand how recipes relate to other recipes.The recipes I tried came out fine. My own cooking goes through occasional phases where I go light on salt. I've learned to be careful about salt levels in recipe books ...both to avoid unneeded salt, or to make the taste appealing to a wider audience, depending on my goal for the day. When adapting recipes from other cooks, there's no substitute for tasting at critical steps. If you're uncomfortable making these changes just because some expert wrote the book, you may not like all the recipes in How to Bake. Even when you start from the advice of an expert, you must keep your goals in mind.And there's no question Malgieri is both an expert and someone clearly passionate about teaching.

I used it to bake bread, muffins, scones, cookies, and cakes, and these recipes are well tested and easy to follow. Many (if not all) of these recipes are used at the Institute for Culinary Education where Malgieri is the head of the baking program. I've taken classes there and received some of the recipes that appear in this book, so you know they work. Although I love to bake, I had never made bread from scratch before (other than using my bread machine) and I was amazed at how delicious and easy the bread was - it was comparable to bread I would have eaten in a fine restaurant.

The best recipes that I've found are the sourdough bread recipe, and the quick puff pastry recipe. The puff pastry never fails to turn out perfectly as long as I follow his directions.Another thing I really like about the book is that it is laid out well so recipes are easy to follow.

Said, maybe this is the hospital care poor, nicked non-bakers like me needed to get mended and back on that pastry and floured up rolling pin thing.To be sure, this is first aid of the first class for those of us who would desire to bake better and more frequently if only we could.

This comes out in the directions which are clear and clean. Thanks to the clear directions and the well-tested recipes you can consistently make excellent foods using this book. There are beautiful, glossy color photos in two sections. There are only a few hand-drawn pictures otherwise, but I haven't found that to be a hindrance at all because the directions are so well done.Of my 200+ cookbooks, this is one that I pull out over and over, and I try new recipes from it all the time.

I've used many of these basic recipes in both home and professional kitchens; I've made many my own. The book is methodical. It is geared toward intelligent cooks. I believe it is critically important when dealing with recipes on this level to acquire as much background information and perspective as possible, to learn the ins and outs of ingredients, to understand the moods of your oven, take altitude into careful consideration, and, in all ways, treat recipes as beginnings rather than ends. You can find recipes anywhere. The deep perspective and commitment to teaching of How To Bake is something much rarer.Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at www.stylegourmet.com"},{"Title":"How to Bake : Complete Guide to Perfect Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Tarts, Breads, Pizzas, Muffins,","review":"While considered a excellent cook by family and friends, I have greatly honed my skills after purchasing this tome.

I now see all the baked breads in the supermarket and specialty stores and smile knowing that this book has helped me to be able to make the same stuff at home for a fraction of the cost. In class we had to learn the recipes without using a Kitchen Aid or food processor. Now that I am baking at home, I feel no guilt in using my machines finally. Even a more complex bread recipe is not that much of a challenge any more for me. I've also made some of the cake recipes.

George. On the other hand, if you're looking for a bold and froward-looking social commentary told in the form of an allegory, I would also recommend the same StoryBook. If you enjoy the writing style of someone like Hemmingway but prefer a less vacuous philosophy, then you will find this story enjoyable to read and satisfying to contemplate on many different levels. How much of this story, if any, is &quot;fact' as the author tempts us to speculate as opposed to truth on a more universal scale is up for your conjecture. But the simple truth that he promises is delivered with striking clarity and yet with subtle brush strokes and a depth of both characterization and emotion surpassing most stories of this type. But then, it really isn't easy to categorize, since it isn't really a simple fairy tale. The first of the three books that it is divided into appears to be just that, but as the plot continues to unfold in the second book, so does the complexity. By the third book, the plot is merely an overlay for a very in depth philosophical treatise, in which the author, through his characters various perspectives, reviews the \`Great Work' of the main character which has been hinted at from the beginning. This clearly is a work of social commentary and yet of almost mystical insight which helps each of the characters to find his or her place in the larger purpose of their transforming society. This society is strikingly similar in many ways to our own and the solutions offered are ones that you may not wholly agree with but which will surely make you think about them form a different perspective. It may also cause you to realize, as I did, how easily we defer thinking of solutions to these problems, when they only grow more unwieldy each year. This isn't for those of you who like \`happily ever after' Disney-like endings, but it does contain the potential for optimism if we would all make the effort to find and face the truth of our daily existence and have the courage to fight our own personal dragons and live a life which is more awake and immediate."},{"Title":"A StoryBook","review":"I want to be the first to be on record as stating that this new book, A StoryBook, is going to become a cult classic similar to books like Dharma Bums or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or even The Trilogy of the Ring. In fact, it is written as a trilogy, although all under one cover. It is based in fact, yet it is a work of fantasy with classic fairy tale archetypal characters. It starts out as a very enjoyable, easy to read narrative, which can be deceiving in its simplicity. As the story unfolds, we, the readers, realize that it is much more than a simple tale of a princess and a man and a dragon. It is the story of all of us and the society that we live in, of its great flaws and it's our greater potential as human beings. It is a dire warning and also filled with optimism, if not always for individual characters then for humanity as a whole. One of the main messages in this trilogy is about the power of love (which is intimately bound up with trust) to overcome fear and to be a transformative force in the life of an individual and ultimately in the life of a society. We've heard this message before in many different ways. The Beatles said, &quot;All you need is love!&quot; At the end of the musical Les Miserables, we hear, &quot;To love another person is to see the face of God&quot;. Most of us claim to believe it on some level, yet to make it an actual force in our lives and in the world, seems to escape most of us. So, like little children learning our lessons, this one seems to bear repeating again and again. And, as any child will tell you, hearing an enchanting, romantic story, which will entertain while it teaches, sure beats the \`preachy-teachy' stuff hands down. The story in A StoryBook is as familiar as the fairytale romances, which it is patterned after and yet as fresh and engaging as the futuristic fantasy that also lurks between the lines. It's truly an original! You won't find a dozen knock-off's of this on the discount racks next year, but hopefully you will find it cropping up on the book shelves of the truly aware and awake among us."},{"Title":"A StoryBook","review":"It has dragons and dragon slayers, a princess but no prince, yet a man who would be king, if only he can save the princess from the dragon (who's real name is Fear) and convince her that she really is a princess, because... but I don't want to spoil too much of the plot. It's a beautifully romantic love story, yet it's so much more. It's really an allegory of life in our world today and, as the story progresses, gets into some pretty heady social commentary and some very serious philosophy. In the opening blurb, the author promises us a simple truth. I'm not sure about how simple it is. In fact, it seems that there is quite a bit of fairly complex, even at times mystical, truth to be found in this storybook which is actually divided into three books. You can read it on many levels and get out of it as much as you are willing to put into it. At first, when I started reading, I had been lured by the fairy tale quality of the book, so I went along at a good clip, really enjoying the author's sparse yet colorful style. But, about halfway through the second book, I realized that I was missing a lot and went back to the beginning, reading with a more open mind and finding lots of parallels in my own life and that of other people that I know. I even got a few new insights into the way things work in this world, even though the story is set in a time that isn't time and a place that isn't really a place, or the realm of the imagination. Check out the author's website at A StoryBook.com to find out more info about the author and to check out other reviews. You can even get a small sample of the book for free. Yum, imagination candy!

This book uses words and a generous amount of pictures to tell the story of the leaders, both talented and flawed that held together the two struggling armies in a time of chaos and devastating loss. Although many of the stories have been told in one form or another, &quot;Commanders...&quot; compiles this study in a single book that makes it very easy to compare and contrast the styles and techniques employed by officers of both armies. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it to others. I look forward to reading the next book in the 'Rebels and Yankees' series."},{"Title":"Rebels and Yankees: Commanders of the Civil War","review":"There is virtually no end to the books that have been published on the Civil War.This is a very large book,10 1/2 X 13 1/2 inches with 256 pages. When first seeing it, one might be tempted to write it off as just another glossy coffee table book. That would be a big mistake. This is one of 3 books in the Rebels & Yankees Series,by two who have great knowledge,involvement and experience andwho have done much consulting work on TV,Films,Museums and other historical efforts on the Civil War.When I first thumbed through the book, I was immediately impressed by the artwork on the cover and drawings of men and officers in military dress. These are actually more than just drawings; they are full page works of supurb art and detail. The book is loaded with some of the best photographs taken during the war which are used to explain much that is glossed over in Civil War mooks ;that tend to concentrate on the battles. Then we are also given dozens of excellent photographic plates showing, as well as explaining,the uniforms,equipment,pistols and swords that were actually the ones used by the well known as well as those not so well known. These photographs were made from artifacts now held in the best museums in the country.Not only is the artwork and photography outstanding; the text throughout extremely informative;but it also covers a lot that is not usually found in history books.The book does a teriffic job of showing how in 1861,there were a relatively few militarily trained, organized or equipped men in the the country and how the great armies were put together in such a short time. The book deals mainly on how the officers were created and how and why some were successful as well as why those who were not,got into the positions they held. Personally,I've often wondered how come some of the great Generals were only in their twenties. After reading this book,I have a much better understanding. Another thing that often made me wonder was the variety of both weapons and uniforms;which is well explained. Another thing that intrigued me was the ever present image of the fancy swords carried by all the officers.The role of those is also explained.There is still one thing that I still wonder about is the gold boxed epaulettes that appear in every photograph of officer's uniforms and equipment. In all the actual photogrphs as well as the portraits the epaullettes almost never appear.They seem to have been used on only 'dress\\" or very formal occassions. For instance the portraits of Grant and Sherman on page 172, or Lee on page 195 don't have them .That being said,they do appear once in a while as we see on page 10; or at the Cavalry School of Practice on page 220.The book is of excellent construction with fine paper,printing,color rendition and binding. The hard cover even has a glossy surface identical to the dust jacket. It is hard to imagine anyone with an interest in the Civil War who would not be impressed with the effort that went into this book and the results achieve."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"Constitutional issues are explored in depth. This is not a book about the various battles of the Civil War but an in depth analysis of the causes and the philosophy. A must read for the serious historian. Originally this was in several volumes but Kindle has combined all into one. Superb!!!!"},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"Jefferson Davis is one of the enigmas of our history. His epitaph might read something like: \\"The Failed Leader of the Lost Cause.\\" He is generally portrayed as a crotchety old man of bad temper whose constant feuding with subordinates over petty issues distracted the Confederacy during its fight for life. Sam Houston famously said, \\"A drop of Jeff Davis' blood would freeze a frog.\\"And yet the Southern people chose this man above all others to be their President. He seems to have been enormously well respected in the South for his military career in the Mexican War and for his efficient administration of the War Department during Franklin Pierce's administration. As a Senator he was admired for his logic and oratory. Most Southerners who knew him spoke and wrote well of him. Those few who actively despised him were known for stirring up controversies themselves.No question but that Davis was a complex character. He was no rabid Yankee-hater. He loved every inch of the United States, including the Northern States. Before the war he was one of the few Southerners cheered by Yankee crowds when he spoke in Northern cities like Boston and Portland. He urged patience with the Union at a time when many Southern hotheads were agitating for secession. Yet he also believed in State Sovereignty, the theory that any state had the unquestioned lawful right to leave the Union at any time that a majority of its people decided that the Federal Government no longer suited them. In the end State Sovereignty trumped Davis' unionism. When Davis became convinced that the majority of Mississippians desired to leave the Union he became a leader of the Secessionists.Despite presiding over a lost war, Davis remained immensely popular in the South until the end of his days. And although many Yankees sung \\"Hang Jeff Davis from a sour apple tree\\" there were others like Horace Greely who befriended Davis and offered to pay his legal expenses if the Federal Government put him on trial for treason. He seems to have been remarkably well liked for a \\"crotchety, self-centered old fogy who lost a war that was fought for the awful cause of destroying the Union and preserving slavery.\\"Davis' character thus shows many contradictions. I think the best way to resolve these contradictions is to read this book and listen as Davis speaks for himself. Davis was indeed wedded to an archaic belief system of State Sovereignty and Slavery. But his book also makes clear that the cardboard-character image of him as a stubborn and pompous pettifogger and military martinet is also wide of the mark.I came away with the impression that Jefferson Davis operated upon the principles of selflessness, due consideration for others' opinions, military competence, and fortitude in purpose that might have destined him to be remembered as a great leader --- IF he had led any cause other than the creation of a slave-holding confederation of states. IMO after reading this book my feeling is that a fitting epitaph for Jefferson Davis would be: \\"A leader of many virtues who was deceived by the current of his times into fighting for archaic ideals.\\"btw. I wrote about Jefferson Davis in my Civil War novelFire in the Heartlandbefore reading Jefferson Davis' book. I portrayed Davis as a thoughtful and competent leader of the Confederate States (without passing judgment on the worthiness of the cause). After reading this book I am confirmed in my original estimation of Davis' competence, again without endorsing the cause of State Sovereignty and perpetuation of slavery that he led."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"Mr. Davis makes the case for state's rights about as well as I think it will ever be made. Much of the book he spends citing the arguments of the framers of the Constitution to demonstrate, to his own satisfaction at least: (1) that sovereignty lies with the several states; (2) that the Federal government is merely an agent created to act for the states in areas specifically designated in the Constitution; and (3) the framers themselves rejected the idea that the Federal government should have a means of coercing the states, and states definitely had the right to secede if they felt their interests were no longer being served by being part of the Union. I would almost buy into this, but I still find it disturbing that the major incidents in our history where we've battled over state's rights have been on the rights of states to practice slavery and resist school integration.Davis also spends a good deal of time defending his own record during the war, in particular the charges that he interfered with the decisions of his generals in ways; he gives the text of many letters written to, by, or about him. This is all quite interesting, though he does come across as almost being -too- defensive.One very interesting section deals with the logistics issues the Confederacy faced, particularly in supplying arms and ammunition to its soldiers; the south started with almost nothing in the way of a munitions industry, and had to build it from the ground up and with the Union blockading much of its foreign trade. Its success in this area at least is something I think any American can feel proud about, not too dissimilar from the way our industrial based met the challenge of the second world war.The book ends rather abruptly, however, in the middle of the war. The \\"Fall\\" of the Confederacy is entirely missing. I had thought the book included the text of two volumes, but I think perhaps it only has one.It's certainly worth a read for anyone with a deep interest in the Civil War, and the causes that led to it, particularly for giving the views from what I've always thought of as the \\"other side.\\" One interesting project I think would be to essentially \\"fact-check\\" some of the claims, to see if they can be substantiated."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"This lays out the southern defense in good detail, refuting the arguments used by the north prior to, during, and since the civil war.

This is one of the worst...or perhaps more accurately, one of the most boring ones I've read yet. Confederate President Jefferson Davis spends the majority of his book attempting to defend all of his political actions & war actions and the actions of the south and the Confederate military. He repeats himself quite a bit. (I felt while reading it that the main person he was attempting to convince was....himself!) Maybe it would have been more interesting if it hadnt been so darn long, as that made it quite boring. I could see this book coming into good use though for a college student electing to read it for a term paper. Otherwise dont waste your time."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"This was a good but at times tedious read. Davis talks about his beliefs about why the Civil War began and why the south was justified. Davis clearly had given this a lot thought. Davis also discusses many of the political issues of the day including the administration of the war, financing the war, taxation, etc.. Readers of the book should enjoy legal and constitutional theory. If you don't this could be an impossible read. I read the entire book less the appendixes. The text is about 65% of the book. The balance are appendixes which are mostly copies of speeches.Based on the book, I concluded that Davis was a whiner: It just was not his fault. He never asked to be President. Others did follow his orders. And, Lincoln did not fight fair. Davis seemed to remember every slight and blame cast his way. Davis did not accept the adage \\"The buck stops here.\\" He also seemed to be unable to see events through the eyes of his enemy. I came away wondering if the south had a better leader that Lincoln would have had a tougher time.I do recommend this book for civil war buffs. It was well written and Davis was obviously well educated."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"I am a southern history buff, this stuff is top secret !I highly recommend this to everyone.Oh Yeah !"},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"I was taught in school (the place where all my historical falsehoods began)that the civil war was a righteous battle to end slavery. This book gives a different perspective and exposes the federal government as the bully that I have come to know that it is. The constitutional rights of states are thoroughly explored in the states relationship to the federal government. The constitution has flaws in it by giving rights to some people living in the US at that time but not extending rights equally to all human beings. I wish by now that we could have evolved as a country to extend our belief in free rights to all people whether they are citizens or not and whether they are standing on our soil or not but we haven't. This book had some very interesting arguments on constitutional principals as well as examples of abuses of power by the federal government bringing to me a new perspective on the civil war that I was previously unaware of."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Vol I & II (I & II)","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government: Jefferson Davis. I reviewed Jefferson Davis's book and his elegant defense of the Southern States in their cling to act independently of the United States believing the Decaration of Independence upheld a united fight against England but each State was in control of their sovereignty. Proceeding with this in mind each Southern State had the right to control the lives of their slaves, and if an owner wished to move their slaves to an expanding territory he could do so without interference of the United States government. He also stated that the slaves would be happier in a new area and more food would be available to the slaves.He refers to the Constitution which states that slaves are not to be considered to be citizens and that in fact they are property which the owners can disperse as they see fit. He tries to prove his point by comparing the wealth of the Northern States to the Southern States stating that they did not need the slaves as much as the South. As the Empire was expanding and after the Treaty of 1783 there was a constant movement of people from the Alantic coast to the West with increased childbirth requring more land.As the population grew and the numbers needed for applying for statehood increased, the South wanted the new states to permit slavery and the Northern States objected. In 1820 the Missouri Compromise was passed, based on an abitary line to separate the Northern States that lacked slaves from the Southern States that wanted slaves. Missouri was admitted to the Union as a slave state. In 1854 the Missouri Compromise was declared void. Kansas and Nebraska Bill was passed that allowed Kansas and Nebraski to choose whether they wanted to be a slave or free State. In the meantime there were people which were protesting Slavery. There was the John Brown incident and the ruling in the Dred Scott case by the Supreme Court. The South was fighting hard because of the slavery question, there economy depended on free labor.President Lincoln won the election in 1861 and the States were activly considering leavin the Union. South Carolina was the first State to secede, followded by other states. The Southern States confiscated federal arsenals and equipment, They formed their government of Confederate States with Jefferson Davis as their President, and the first battle was at Fort Sumter.SPRApple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)Eyewitness to the Civil WarChancellorsville and Gettysburg - Campaigns of the Civil War - VIThe New York Times The Complete Civil War 1861-1865"},{"Title":"Wild Notion","review":"The marriage of romance and suspense never felt so good as in Cathy McDavid's debut novel Wild Notion.

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

Well-integrated love and erotic scenes, I could also say.I highly recommend this book to lovers of all kinds of fiction."},{"Title":"Time of Grace","review":"I first discovered Gabriella West's writing last year when I read her most recent novel entitled The Leaving. I have been enamored with her writing ever since, slowly working my way back through some of her short E-fiction, and finally getting to read her first novel, Time of Grace.This book takes place in Ireland and England during 1916, a historical romance of sorts centered around the upheaval of the Easter Rising when the Irish sought to end British rule in their homeland and establish the formal Irish Republic during the first World War.Caroline, a young lady, has just landed a job as a governess with a wealthy family. She moves into their household where she meets a young maid, Grace, who she immediately befriends even after the hesitant warnings from other workers and the lady of the house herself. The two soon become involved in an illicit romance that could cause both of them their jobs, not to mention quite a bit of emotional turmoil.I am a fond admirer (and jealous writer myself) of West's ability to breathe life into her characters so easily on the page. Her narration and dialogue is pure perfection and is truly something to be commended. At just over 260 pages, I purposely read this book slowly because I wanted to absorb the characters and their stories as they unfolded. West just has a way of capturing the smallest of details that really give the novel great depth as a whole.Caroline seems socially inept at times, though she is quite a scholar and is immediately liked by the young girl within her care. Grace is bold and defiant, eager to return to her Irish roots to join in the rebellion. But it is Caroline who longs for Grace's companionship, and worries over Grace's acceptance and attention at times. We even see Caroline questioning herself. Should she give up on Grace and settle down with a man instead because that's what her mother would have wanted? Upon returning to Ireland, has Grace given up on her? Her need for assurance drives the second half of the book.The book culminates around the historical events of the Easter Rising. Social tensions build as Grace joins her brother in the fight, and Caroline awaits the outcome - of the rebellion and of her time of Grace. With a dash of light erotica, heavy and sincere characterization, and wonderful historical setting, Gabriella West's first novel solidifies why I consider her one of my favorite authors today."},{"Title":"Shatto","review":"Loved reading the story.

It fails, in my opinion, because only the absolute genius of Nabokov can make this genuinely repellent subject matter appealling. Prager is certainly a good writer, but her protagonist speaks with the voice of a mildly unappealing teenage girl.

He is quite scathing about the duplicitous character of Charles II, the only point Ogg can find in his favour is that in compromising to avoid domestic conflict and in his double-dealing in foreign policy, Charles ensured an era of peace in which the commerce flourished. However he is scathing about Charles debauchery, his corruption, his (ab)use of his councillors and the general \`unEnglishness' of his Court and influences.However the history centres on the development of English society rather than the Court of Charles II. There are excellent descriptions of the events of the period - the Restoration Settlement and the Popish Plot are described in great detail and with relish.Ogg shows how adroit the Anglican Church was during this period - with the Restoration of the House of Lords, the Anglican Bishops resumed their place and regained political power - successfully opposing the toleration which Charles had proposed at Breda. In essence Charles Breda Declaration had left a lot of power to parliament - in terms of retribution, toleration and settlement - and the Bishops used this fact to entrench themselves and Anglicanism and to oppose toleration. At the same time, they formally gave up a large amount of (titular) power in terms of reducing the rights of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and ensured that they made common cause with Charles' councillors - at first Clarendon, later Danby, who needed to be able to guarantee Charles parliamentary support. The Bishops ability to manoeuvre in the shifting sands of Restoration politics is well outlined here, and one is left wanting to know more.Another point Ogg introduces is the commercial challenge which the Dutch represented and the fact that although two wars were fought with the Dutch, Britain's eventual commercial success resulted more from a conscious repositioning of Britains naval trade towards long distance commerce with the American colonies, Africa and the Spanish Empire. Thus the importance of the Navigation Acts, Britain's relations with Spain and the structure and nature of the change in Britain's commercial and naval shipbuilding industry are introduced. Again this is well described and whet's ones appetite for more.There are excellent descriptions of the development of parliamentary opposition, the evolution of the powers of the houses of Lords and Commons and the implementation of local government and its interaction with the administration of common law. While veryEngland centred the book also takes some note of the emergence of France as the dominant European power and makes the best sense I have so far read of the relationship between Louis and Charles - most descriptions I have seen so far describe Charles as a client of Louis, and Ogg describes the various requests Charles made for French money, he also describes the lengths Charles went to, to avoid actually doing anything tangible in return for this cash. So is it more (or less) corrupt if the client doesn't do anything in return for the bribes? In relation to the Stuarts Ogg finds Charles possessed of a gift for compromise, indolence, corruption and self preservation and, if anything, James possessed even worse traits.The only negative point I could find about the book was the speed at which it draws to a conclusion, Charles is dispatched in half a page and the last chapter recounts the thinking of some of the notable learned Englishmen of the age - Newton, Boyle, Locke, Hobbs, Halifax among others. I found this ending less than satisfying as it seemed out of context with the flow of the rest of the book and I was expected a greater amount of analysis of the era.However and excellent overview and introduction of the Restoration period"},{"Title":"England in the reign of Charles II,","review":"Ogg's scholarly work is a delight to read in part because you can have such confidence in his scholarship. But this book has special relevance to Americans as the nation swings towards a fundamentalist mindset and an ultra-conservative world view. In 1660 when Charles II was recalled to England to re-impose absolute monarchy after the failure of the Puritan experiment in democracy, the fashion of the times was to celebrate the \\"return of the king.\\" But what actually happened was an imposition of authoritarianism, the abrogation of personal liberty, enormous government deficits and the creation of enormous personal profits by friends of the king. How Charles succeeded in revenging the death of his father, in subduing the desire for self-rule, in taxing the kingdom virtually into oblivion, into fighting three pointless wars with the Dutch, and in enriching himself and his friends at the expense of the country are all detailed in this magnificent work. More to the point, Ogg's work is a salutary tale duplicated almost point for point by the current Republican administration. Only the names have been changed by the times."},{"Title":"True detective stories: From the archives of the Pinkertons","review":"I rate this one four stars. The writing is straight forward and the author never needs to embellish the tale as the facts speak for themselves. Written over a century ago, the stories themselves are essentially timeless, being the true tales of that tireless band of detectives known as the Pinkertons and their methods of solving crime. Most of the stories told don't rely on chance or circumstance, instead, a tireless search for the criminal, and the necessity of using various methods to trap or capture the culprits gets the job done. What sticks out in my mind is that the essential tools of the detective haven't changed; scrupulously researching every aspect of the crime and the crime scene, the endless leg work of following suspects and researching their backgrounds, and that most important element of all, the detective's knowledge of human behavior and their instinctive ability to ferret out the truth. Time and again the instincts of the detectives on the case, along with their intimate knowledge of the criminal world, are the tools that prove to be most valuable.

Greyboar is the strangler and Ignace is his longtime friend and agent.Ignace, being the greedy & practical type, looks at strangling as an occupation where the work's steady, the pay's good, and what more can a person ask for in life. As the wise man says, \\"Greater greed is the greedy man's gratuity.\\" That, and the other sayings of the wise man such as the realistic \\"It's all nuts anyway,\\" the insighful \\"I hate to be the one to break the news to you, General, but you're a foot soldier,\\" the prescient \\"Never try to think of the worst thing that could happen. It's bound to be worse than that anyway\\" and the wise admonition \\"Don't ask. Just don't\\", are about as far into philosophy as Ignace is willing to venture.Greyboar is a bit more philosophical, and while he is on his way to becoming the greatest strangler alive -- enough so that Jane's The World's Perps states \\"Our AAA rating may well be obsolete, as by all accounts the chokester known as 'The Thumbs of Eternity' perhaps requires his own AAAA rating.\\" -- he is also heavily involved in a search for the philosophical meaning to life. Aside from the strangling, he views most of his work as being a classic application of Occam's razor, and he is committed to studying ethical entropy, following the path of Languor, Torpor & Stupor.However, Ignace & Greyboar keep getting mixed up with a strange array of very philosophical individuals, such as Cat, short for Schrodinger's Cat, who is never where you expect her to be but who will go almost anywhere if there is a chance to find (& kill) Schrodinger; Gwendolyn, Greyboar's sister who hasn't been seen for years, but who is heavily involved in the dwarf issue and is one of the prime organizers of the dwarf underground railroad; Hrundig, an Alsask barbarian who's actually quite a bit smarter than he looks; Benvenuti, an artist & all around master-of-everything-with-the-looks-of-a-Greek-god; Abbess Hildegaard, who has been carrying on an increasingly heated discussion with the Old Geister, God himself, via the post; and Zulkeh the sorcerer who is a pedant's pedant.Because of this damned philosophy, Ignace & Greyboar get increasingly involved in the Joe business, the dwarf underground railroad, affairs of the church (including close brushes with the Goatmonk and Cardinal Fornacaese), and having to rescue Benvenuti from Even Worse Hands in the Place Even Worse Than Hell.At the end of the day Ignace finds true love, Greyboar redeems himself in the eyes of his sister Gwendolyn, and everything turns out pretty well. But had he been given his choice at the beginning of the story, Ignace would probably have preferred to stay in New Sfinctr, having ale with Greyboar at The Trough.I really liked the book. The sayings of the wise man are almost worth a book in themselves. The great poses that Ignace classifies along the way (\\"Ogre in Repose, Regretting His Fangs & Talons,\\" and \\"Still Life with Amour Propre, Injured\\") inspired a chuckle more than once, and Zulkeh's speeches are works of art in stupefying the audience."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"This book had me laughing out loud. Not only is the protagonist an evil horrible uh, er uh, being, but he is absolutely ethical and excellent at it. I think, unless he's a hero in disguise. No, no surely that isn't possible.This is a great funny book. Read it."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"THE PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER starts off hot--with a great combination of adventure and humor. Grayboar, a strangler with an inclination to philosophy, and his business manager Ignace, have a good thing going. There's no lack of customers and Ignace hoards every penny he can. So long as they can stay away from politics and religion, they've got it made. A philosophical strangler is inherently funny and author Eric Flint's writing, humorous insights, and throw aways (e.g., Grayboar's girlfriend is Schrodenger's Cat) will keep you laughingNaturally, they can't quite follow Ignace's rules. Ignace (the narrator)loses the argument to Grayboar's philosophy and the two end up plunged deep into both politics and especially religion.The second half of this novel becomes a much more predictable adventure story. I was disappointed to find that Grayboar's philosophy somehow got lost. Although Ignace stayed consistent (and consistently funny), the second half felt as if it was running short a cylinder.I enjoyed this book and feel no shame in recommending it. Unfortunately, it fell slightly short of the promise offered in the first half."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"It's like the shadow of a Platonic Ideal of a fantasy-humor novel. Think Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser meet Pulp Fiction - only funnier. This book probably should have been written by Avram Davidson, who could have milked the silly names and goofy situations for a lot more literary goodness. As it stands, hey, I've paid more for worse."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"This story is witty, irreligious, and occasionally nonsensical. Along with many stranglings, an angel is interrogated and Hell is trespassed. Greyboar, the strangler, does most of the heavy lifting, while his agent, Ignace, narrates, complains, and watches over the money. But, even a whining tightwad like Ignace has a few redeeming qualities, and a way with women - certain women, anyway.Ignace and Greyboar meet a number of eccentric characters as the story unfolds. The Cat especially, is so eccentric, that it's no wonder that Schr&ouml;dinger has so much difficulty predicting what she'll do. It's a light reading story and the pages will fly by quickly."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Philosophical Strangler. The characters capture your attention and keep it throughout the story. A worthwhile read from an outstanding author."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Take one very talented strangler with an interest in philosophy and his cynical profit-driven manager. Now, put them into a set of loosely connected vignettes and a sprinkling of equally loosely connected fantasy tropes. Mash them together - don't worry about how they fit around the edges - and shamelessly pad out the last third to bring the whole thing up to some reasonable word count. The Philosophical Strangler tries very hard to have the wit and depth of the Discworld novels, and it just doesn't manage it. Still, two stars for some decent puns."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Ok, based on the other reviews the author appears to either tickle your fancy... or not. I enjoyed the book: light-hearted fare, intelligent humor (gotta love the cat), tongue-in-cheek story line, creative characterization, what's not to like? I for one will be reading more of Eric Flint's fun farcical fiction (apologies for that aside). Thanks Eric!"},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"The Philosophical Strangler (2001) is the first fantasy novel in the Joe's World series. It is set in a milieu of sorcerers, abbesses and stranglers, not to mention a militant church. These adventures occur mostly in the town of New Sfinctr on the continent of Grotum, although side trips happen now and then.In this novel, Greyboar is a professional strangler. He is very tall and built like an ox. He is a member of the Guild of Stranglers and strictly follows their code of professional ethics. His weapons of choice are his hands. Greyboar likes to say that it is all in the thumbs.Gwendolyn is Greyboar's sister. She is built like her brother, but shorter and voluptuous. They grew up together, but parted when Greyboar left the slaughter house to become a strangler. Gwendolyn is an agitator for dwarf's rights and objects to Greyboar becoming a well paid thug.Ignace is an old friend of the siblings. He is short, red-headed and freckled and looks like a dwarf compared to Greyboar. He was rescued by Gwendolyn as a child and then grew up with Greyboar. He worked with Greyboar in the slaughter house and then left with him. Now he is Greyboar's agent and financial manager.Benvenuti Sfondrati-Piccolomini is an artist, He is also very handsome and graceful; women fall in love with him at first sight. Benvenuti is totally unfair competition to any male.Shrodinger's Cat is a woman with a sword, thick glasses and a vague manner. She is looking for Shrodinger, probably with malice afore thought. Cat is a very ineffectual swordswoman, except that she is never where you would expect her to be. She hacks away here and then somewhere else until her opponent is slashed to pieces or flees the scene.In this story, Ignace arranges an engagement for Greyboar to choke the King of the Sundjhab. They force their way through the elite soldiers, the Grand Sorcerer, and the master of martial arts. Then the King catches Greyboar's attention by claiming to be a philosopher. After a pleasant discussion of entrophic philosophy, Greyboar reluctantly strangles the King. He has professional ethics, don't you know.Afterward, Greyboar and Ignace leave town for a while to allow Queen Belladonna III time to cool down. They have a very exciting time in Prygg and Blain, but don't talk about it much. But Greyboar does meet Cat while he is away and, after returning to Sfinctr, he invites her to the Sign of the Trough for a drink or three.Greyboar also meets Benvenuti in the Sign of the Trough. Ignace hates him on sight. Benvenuti wants advice from Greyboar on a painting of one of Greyboar's targets. The heirs claim that the painting belongs to them and insist on its completion and delivery. Benvenuti has an idea and would like Greyboar's assistance.Later, Greyboar learns that Benvenuti had been Gwendolyn's lover. She had left him to attend to Underground Railroad business. He still pines for her and takes out his sorrow by painting portraits of her in various states of dress. After an initial bit of confusion, they join in adoration of Gwendolyn.This tale is narrated by Ignace, a hard-hearted manager with a greatly suppressed heart of gold. He always tries to be reasonable, but everybody ignores him and goes ahead into some risky venture. He really starts having internal conflicts when he becomes involved with Jenny and Angela.This farce involves Greyboar and Ignace is a series of mishaps and troubles with the authorities. Greyboar is summoned to the Abbey of the Sisters of Tranquility to provide assistance to Hildegard -- the Abbess -- in a spiritual task. Greyboar also arranges a rescue of Cat from the Durance Pile. Then they become even more deeply involved in the Joeist heresy.The story is a series of episodes, each mentioning other episodes, which involve further episodes. The work is woven of many threads that are never fully explained. Only the main storyline (if you can follow it) leads to a conclusion. Although many other personae impinge upon the story, at least the central characters are limited in number.This volume is followed byForward the Mage. Surely some loose threads will be exposed more fully in the sequel or maybe the subsequent books. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Flint fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of high adventure, confused heroes, and a touch of romance.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"There's nothing wrong with this book -- it's just like watching Michael Jordan play with a junior-high team. The execution is fine, but he's not being pushed very hard. The book is fairly funny, but Flint's writing talents go way beyond this, and at times you get the feeling that Flint knows it.I paid full hardcover price for this book, and I wouldn't recommend that others do the same.

The manager is the narrator and he talks a good game of cynicism, while not thinking too highly of himself."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Shamelessly derivative of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld series, difffering primarily in the fact that it is free of plot, interest, or humor, if you define humor as being funny. I read over two thirds of the book before I realized there was nothing there. Thanks for wasting eleven hours of my life. As our illustrious commander in chief said, \\"fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, won't get fooled again.\\""},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"\\"Early Terry Pratchett\\", \\"Brilliant satire\\" and \\"word play never seen since Harry Turtledove\\".Well, I'm here to tell you folks that \\"The Philosophical Strangler\\" is flat out horrible.Eric Flint isn't the heir to anything even close to Terry Pratchett and as to word play, Harry Turtledove doesn't have a lot to worry about either. This is the first book I've read by Eric Flint and I don't think I'll be pursuing any of his other books anytime in the near future. If somebody wants to give me one, maybe, but I won't be all that enthusiastic about it.The story is set in an alternate fantasy reality involving a professional assassin who chokes his victims to death and his \\"agent\\". That's the plot - pretty simple.I managed to plow through about half of the book before I gave up. The \\"word play\\" so beloved by the reviewers is virtually unreadable. It's like hearing the same joke over and over and over again - eventually you can predict what the next joke will be because they are all the same - only the words are different.With respect to the \\"humor\\" it's forced and in a bizarro kind of way - a word change here or a change in phrase there would have made it truly funny instead of sort-of funny.Eric Flint is trying to be very clever and he falls flat on his face. He's clearly not a gifted enough writer nor clever enough to pull off this type of multifaceted satire. He should be ashamed he took money to publish this tripe. Baen, who normally publishes decent fantasy and scifi, should be forced to refund the purchase price for selling this to the general public."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"I have to admit, I bought this book because it seemed to compare itself to books like \\"Myth Adventures\\" by David Asprin, or \\"Xanth\\" by Piers Anthony. However, knowing Eric Flint, I should have expected something else.Eric Flint is probably one of the most unoriginal writers I have ever read. His \\"1632\\" is such a blatent rip-off of the \\"Island In The Sea Of Time\\" series by Bruce Sterling, it is not even funny. But his writing ability is much worse, leaving me that time with an unsatisfying \\"alternate history\\" story, which is my favorite genre.The cover of Strangler tells us it is \\"Monty Python meets Tolkein\\". Well, that is true. We get the tasteless parts of Python, mixed with the dry bore-you-to-death parts of Tolkein. We do not get any part of Python's humor, nor do we get Tolkein's intelligence. The result is very unsatisfying.I have to admit, I find little to recommend this book to anybody. Even the map at the beginning is so bizzare, that it makes no sense. A good example is when Mr. Flint takes us on a 7 page description of a bar. 3 of those pages are about the physical bar where the drinks are served! I mean, who cares??? He must have been paid per word, because there is so much stuffing thrown in it is amazing. It gave me the feeling of a 30 minute script blown up to a 2 hour movie.And to make it worse, there are so many anachronisms thrown in, it is quickly obvious that he once again forgot to do any real editing or research. A good example is in the preface of the story, where the main characters actually get into a Hansom Cab! For goodness sake, make it a generic carriage, not a specific type of cab from 19th Century England!I can go on and on about these blunders, but it is to painfull to recall them all, and it would make this review as bloated as the original book was. Just avoid this book, it is not worth it."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"While not in quite the same class as Terry Pratchett(Discworld) or Peter David (Sir Apropos of Nothing), Eric Flint provides a welcome addition to the world of humorous fantasy. Laughter is on every page and very few fantastical memes remain unskewered. Readers with no knowledge of philosophy, physics, Dante or the Beowulf will find themselves missing out occasionally, but overall the laughs are clever and accessible. The translation of metaphorical concepts into real life are frequent and funny, if sometimes a bit too ridiculous. It's one thing to be told that God writes on stone tablets in words of fire, but quite another to see that one of His correspondants maintains a collection of the burning slabs she receives in a separate alcove and uses them to keep down the heating bill. I also laughed out loud at the description of the enigmatic female warrior Shrodinger's Cat, especially when it comes to her combat technique: her opponents are aggravated to learn that while they can see where she is or where she's going, it's somehow impossible to determine both at any given moment.However, the joy ride is not without its flaws. Grayboar's philosophical leanings quickly recede into the background and the book begins to feel like a bunch of incomplete short stories that were mashed together for expediency. That said, this is still perfectly good book for fantasy fans looking for lighter, less-serious fare."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Well, looking at the other reviews of this book, I can't help but feel I must have been reading a completely different book altogether.I really, really did not like this book. At all. As a matter of fact, this is the first book in many years that I have seriously considered stopping in the middle of, and not finishing. I finished it, but I really didn't see any improvement.That said, I will explain.It was interesting, and different, having the main characters be.... well, a strangler, and his manager. It had a lot of promise, but right from the start this book just rubbed me the wrong way. I have nothing against stranglers, or their managers, but....Well, I found myself with an intense dislike of these characters from the beginning.The first-person writting style doesn't bother me at all, but in this case I just really, REALLY didn't want to be in this guy's head.I couldn't see what the various parts of the story had to do with any of the others, and my frustration was getting the best of me.The overall book was.... not good. I was disappointed, and annoyed that I had actually spent my time on this.In this case though, this is only my opinion. The reason I went with 2 stars, as opposed to 1, or none if I could, was because most of my problems with this book were personal. I really disliked the plot, and the characters, and the story was just dull. So, 2 stars for the book based on the elements that were good about it.I find it strange, because I like Eric Flint.Sorry, but this one I will not be reading again, nor it's sequels, if there are any."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"The book is written from the viewpoint of Ignace (the whiney, I call him), agent to Greyboar, greatest assassin/strangler in the world, &quot;the man by whom professional thuggee should be judged.&quot; You'd think that would be an easy life. Sit back and let the assignments roll in. The Amazon editorial commentary on this book mentioned the problems: Philosophical conundrums and ethical dilemmas. What it didn't mention is the greatest horror of all, LOST COMMISSIONS. Mind you, you get all three of these things in just the first chapter of the book. After that, things get weird.This book is a riot. You'll understand after you've read it why I'll never be able to deal with the term &quot;aftermarket&quot; again without a giggle.My advice, get this book, and Fetch the Comfy Chair, one you can't fall out of no matter how hard you laugh. Make sure you have some privacy for reading, lest you cause concern, remarks on your cackles and gusts of laughter, or frantic calls for the men in the white coats.

However, if the intended victim can engage Greyboar in his passion, not sex but philosophical discussion and debate, the target might survive in a Sherherazade type of way.Like any pro, Greyboar has an agent Ignace and he hopes a significant other in the nearsighted swordswoman Cat who he just met at his favorite drinking spot the Sign of the Trough. However, Greyboar has also learned that his estranged sibling, the amazon Gwendolyn has a lover who apparently has vanished perhaps into the bows of hell or some place even worse geographically. A commission for his sibling is not what Greyboar or Ignace prefers, but family, even a card-carrying member of the dwarf liberation movement, is still family.A visit to THE PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER is a visit to weirdness where even Rod Serling would wonder if this might be one step beyond the Twilight Zone. The story line is satire at its sharpest as the cast skewer many of modern society's values. The plot is more a series of vignettes tied together by the key cast members rather than a novel, but fans of ironic fantasy will devour this tale and demand more from Eric Flint.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"This novel was an utter delight. Do not let the title fool you, there is no real need to understand the philosophical contents of the novel to truely enjoy it.You have fun poked at philosphy, human nature, politics, the whole works.There is always a joke or pun to be had, nary a page where you don't at least chuckle.The story is told from a the first person (Ignance) who is the Strangler's Agent. Ignance gives his insight to everything those around him do, adding his own flare to the actions of others.You find yourself laughing at his interpretation of events.In short, its a whimsical tale which pokes fun at human nature, and a joy to read."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"I found this book a wonderful blend of moral and philosophical commentary and fantasy/mind candy. It didn't read like many fantasies because the plot was not the author's main interest. Rather it seemed as though Flynt wanted to present ideas for both the characters and the reader to mull and idle over, which I just loved. I will say that because of this, the book rambles and wanders rather than leading a clear path from point to point. If you don't like that style, you will probably dislike the book immensely. But for the reader who wants a little intellectual fodder with their fantasy, I think this is a great choice and I am personally hoping to find that others of Flynt's books provide more of the same. And in contrast with other reviewers, I enjoyed the ending. While it was somewhat anticlimactic, I found the ending unpredictable and satisfyingly appropriate for the characters."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"I wish I could have given this froth a 3 1/2.

I even laughed out loud a few times...not often, but a few times. Do you understand my problem?This book has a lot of wasted potential. It was like a series of short stories strung together with very thin connecting material. It's a very light weight tale, unfortunately in hardbound, with spotty, but amusing, character development. This wasn't up to Flint's usual standards...but amusing, rather amusing."},{"Title":"PHILOSOPHICAL STRANGLER","review":"Greyboar is the world's greatest strangler (\\"Have Thumb, Will Travel\\") and Ignace is his manager. During the course of this hilariously chaotic book they have such adventures as: visiting Abbess Hildegaard, who regularly corresponds with God (he insists on using the postal service); helping steal a Rap Sheet (a Joe relic) in Prygg; breaking into a high-level cleric's house (after setting him up to be kidnapped) and breaking into The Pile (high level security prison) to break out Schrodinger's Cat, who is Greyboar's girlfriend; and descending into the Place Worse than Hell and facing Hands Worse Than (the CEO of Hell's) to rescue Benvenuti, who is Greyboar's sister's ex-boyfriend. Along the way, in the various courses of their adventures, they meet such characters as: a fallen angel (and learn the differences between a fallen angel and a devil); a troll (and learn the differences between a troll and an ogre); and various types of snarls.It is almost impossible to define the plot of this book; it wanders, it rambles, it carries on. But it is WONDERFULLY fun! Eric Flint is one of the best at writing humorous fantasy/science fiction/military science fiction (and if you don't believe me, check outRats, Bats & Vatsand/orThe Rats, the Bats & the Ugly (The Rbv Series)) and is sure to keep you coming back for more.

Not too much can be said about the story line that would make a lot of sense...you have to read it to get the full effect... but I'll give it a try.Greyboar is a professional strangler at the top of his game. He is universally recognized as the best in the business. He is what you would expect with such a character: big, brawny, strong, mayhem personified. He is also surprising in that he loves philosophy.On one of his assignments, he is commissioned to strangle the ruler of a foreign land. While doing so, he becomes enamored with that ruler's philosophical system. It doesn't save the ruler but it does change the strangler's life as he tires to come to grips with his new perception of reality. The result is amusing to everyone except the strangler's business agent. No one is more horrified than he when they lose their standing at the top of the rich assassin's guild and wind up in the impoverished hero's guild.It's lots of fun and makes for a pleasant afternoon."},{"Title":"Trinity","review":"The doctrine of the Trinity is not an easy thing to comprehend, but understanding is critical in our chaotic modern world where various groups reject the full divinity of Jesus; to truly understand the New Testament, you need to know the truth about the Trinity. In this short but well-constructed book, Robert Crossley attempts to clear up any confusion about this doctrine and enable readers to arm themselves with the truth of One God - Three Persons.There is only one God, yet the Bible speaks of God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. How can this be? That is a question each Christian must grapple with in order to fully realize the truth of God's love. Crossley begins by gleaning the revealed facts about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit from both the Old and New Testaments. The core truths do not change, but they are sharpened in the pages of the New Testament for the simple reason that the promises of the Old Testament have been realized, in Jesus. By comparing the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, he shows that they are all one and the same.Crossley's central argument is that the Trinity consists of one God in three persons. He presents an impressive argument for the separation of the Trinity into three persons, making extensive use of the Bible to show the distinction that must be made between God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I was most interested in Crossley's discussion of the Holy Spirit, for this is the least understood concept of the doctrine. He makes the case that the Holy Spirit is a distinct personality and not some kind of murky &quot;influence.&quot; He describes the Holy Spirit as a distinct person who revolutionizes people's lives; indeed, salvation comes from God through the Holy Spirit.The word Trinity cannot be found in the New Testament, which came as something of a surprise to me. Does this mean the doctrine of the Trinity is unimportant to the Christian? Of course not; it is in fact of supreme importance to those who would know God. Crossley explains how this doctrine grew out of the early Christian Church. Those earliest Christians knew God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit from close, personal experience; the questions Crossley attempts to answer in this book would never even have occurred to those early Christians. What they knew from experience gradually became incorporated into the doctrine of the Trinity. In formulating the doctrine, they were attempting to explain in human terms the majesty and glory of God, which of course transcends human reason, and the limitations of the human mind and of language account for the confusion that naturally surrounds the concept even today.Crossley ends the book by addressing three of the most common questions asked about the doctrine of the Trinity, reiterating the fact that Jesus was both fully human and fully divine. This takes him to an area of great concern for him, namely the rejection of Jesus' full deity by some groups, but it also challenges Christians who believe that Jesus was God in human form. Crossley effectively proves that God the Father and Jesus the Son are distinct persons and that Jesus was both fully divine and fully human - had this not been the case, Jesus could not have become the Savior of the world.This is a well-argued, thought-provoking little book that all Christians can benefit from. The doctrine of the Trinity is a hard one to grasp, but the Christian must make the effort to understand the concept of three persons in one God in order to truly understand the message of the New Testament."},{"Title":"No Regrets: Last Chance for a Father and Son","review":"This books emphasizes the opportunities presented when the challenge of facing the death of a loved one knocks at your door.

Struggle and discord are replaced with openness, kindness and ease. No Regrets teaches by example and thoughtful reflection the possibility of building bridges and deepening relationships which might have once seemed impossible.

It might even make you cry. It makes me think of Mike & the Mechanics' 1989 hit \\"The Living Years\\" which is about a father and son who initially don't see eye to eye. This book is about how a father and son converted a strained relationship into an openly loving one. As a father, Barry Neil Kaufman is, from all accounts an extremely loving person. That comes through in his writings and in the things his family says.This book generates new hope of the possibilities and options available in restoring and repairing relationships. The entire tone of the book is gentle and positive. If you are looking for a good place to take away some life lessons, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"No Regrets: Last Chance for a Father and Son","review":"This is an excellent book as the previous reviews attest. However I was very disappointed to discover that I am not able to loan the E-book to friends and family. So disappointed that I docked it a whole star."},{"Title":"Dead In The Hay (Amanda Hazard Mysteries)","review":"Amanda Hazard finds a body or two. Nick Thorn, her husband and police, is determined that the body she finds dead in the hay was caused by an accident. After all, farm accidents do happen. Amanda, however, is determined that it was no accident - that it was indeed murder!Amanda is the town CPA in small-town Vamoose, Oklahoma. This book has a rural flavor, and is spiced with country jargon and plenty of gossip at the town beauty shop. There are cows, hay, hydraulic hoses, tractors, combines, barns, cattleguards, cowboy hats and boots, country-western music.Through the complex sleuthing and clues and fact-finding, there is also humor: Amanda has a beauty shop disaster with her hair. (I will not tell you what it is, because I do not want to ruin it for those who have not read the book.) She also has a smaller disaster at the beauty shop with her fingernails.Amanda is determined to solve the mystery, even though her husband tells her to be careful. There is a nice twist, and the mystery-solving is very interesting and clever."},{"Title":"Dead In The Hay (Amanda Hazard Mysteries)","review":"This is another installment in the sleuthing career of Amanda Hazard. As always this book contains the great combination of romance, humor, and the mystery of how the mean nasty person died. They sure grow them mean out there. I am always waiting for a new book in the series and this one is a good one."},{"Title":"Left-Handed Kids: Why Are They So Different","review":"A great book for leftie's of all ages. Finally someone realizes our natural greatness! :o) Many interesting facts are included here that are sure to provide hours of enjoyment. Fascinating information will stupify those stubborn righties on why left is right! The easy to read format is great for lefty kids who'll also have fun dumbfounding their right-handed counterparts who try to make fun of them. :o)"},{"Title":"Left-Handed Kids: Why Are They So Different","review":"I was looking for something that would help me to better understand my left-handed son, but this book was full of one-liners and useless facts."},{"Title":"Left-Handed Kids: Why Are They So Different","review":"Was hoping to find some insight on \\"how to raise\\" a lefty...but this had great facts and interesting tidbits to read. Fast read!"},{"Title":"Left-Handed Kids: Why Are They So Different","review":"This book is okay, but definitely not for young children to read (3-7 year-olds). The book is not written to hold the attention of young children, so we will keep it until they get a little bit older."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"If you like depressing ghettoism-- This would be the book to read. This lady (Mildred) was not strong- Harriet Tubman was strong, Coretta Scott King was strong, Fannie Mae Smith was strong. . . I could go on, but I'll stop there. Mildred was a weak drunk, who did a terrible job of taking care of her kids. To those considering buying this book- DON'T check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I would first have to definitely give Ms. McMillan her props on a well written book; however, it was quite unrealistic. As a well read college student, I have experienced many &quot;flat&quot; characters and &quot;deep&quot; ones too. .... These were positively the FLAT ones! I merely finished the book in hopes that each character would gain some depth. Not so bad, yet not so good either!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I know I'm probably gonna get slammed for saying this but I don't care. I'm sorry but I read this book a few years back and I just don't agree with the rest of the reviewers. I must have been really bored to read this book in its entirety. Mildred was just not a strong woman and she did a piss poor job as a mother. She was a sloppy drunk who cared more about chasing men than her own children. I'm glad I didn't spend any money to read this book and I would advise you not to either. If you must read this sloppily written ghetto trash, rent it from the library and save your money. For a much better read, check out Alice Walker's \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\" or the classic \\"The Color Purple\\". Excellent books by a much better author. Very well written and meaningful. A far contrast to this garbage. Terry McMillan is a man-bashing, non-talented writer. I was just not impressed by this book or her writing ability. However, \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\" was an excellent novel. Unless you are another man-basher, skip anything by this author."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"'Mama' is a very nice book to read because it emphasize on poverty and other relationship dilemmas. This could be the story of your sister, cousin, or mother. It is the tale of a true womans defeat against the battles of sex, money, liquor, and children (life). Enjoyed book. Great Job"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"\\"Mama\\" held my interest. I love Terry McMillian's storytelling skills. She's creative and wrote an unpredictable novel. The novel was realistic and I could relate to the story about some of the things that happened in my childhood. I was cheering for the family and was glad that they were turning their life around until the story ended abruptly. \\"Mama\\" gets 4 stars because of the abrupt ending. It needed a least a few more chapters or epilogue to bring the novel to full circle.Overall rating: 4.0 stars."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"The very first time I heard about Terry McMillan's debut novel, Mama, was in my African-American literature class in college. The book was not on our reading list but McMillan's name came up in a discussion where the professor stated that Mama was some her best writing. I held that statement in the back of my mind for years. After reading Getting to Happy, McMillan's latest novel, I decided to read Mama.The story is being told by Mildred the matriarch of the Peacock family and the main character of the novel. The peacock family consists of four girls and one boy: Freda, Bootsey, Angel, Doll and Money (the son). Mildred's husband name is Crook and he is nothing but a drunken womanizer who beats her. Mildred has this fierce love for her children but it never comes through as affection. She has this do as I say, but not as I do type way of raising her children. We come to realize that Mildred cannot display anything she has never received. Mildred marries two times after her and Crook's divorce but it is always for the wrong reasons and never lasts. What makes Mildred's quest for love so ironic is that she knew her father, Buster, loved and favored her.Of the children we see the most promise in the oldest, Freda. Freda was always the caretaker when Mildred fell short even for Mildred herself when her drinking and mind got the best of her for a season. Money because he never really had a father figure in his life turned to a life of crime and drugs. Bootsey, Angel, and Doll all grew up married and had children and problems of their own. Freda too was plagued by drugs and alcoholism but was determined to persevere. Mildred also daily turned to the bottle to wash away her problems.This was a novel about family. A family with their own unique problems and how they depended on and were there for each other during the hard times. Mildred did not always get it right but she always had a connection to her children. Mildred came across as your stereotypical angry black woman throughout the entire novel. McMillan never really \\"redeemed\\" her in my opinion. There was also a flow to this novel you never got stuck. The chronological order of this story was simply amazing. One quality that reins true of all of McMillan's novels is that they are all \\"true\\" stories that we can relate to."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This was a real, down to earth, back to basics book. It captured what inner city life is like in black America.The book traces a family, mostly concentrating on the matriarch and her kids. It chronicles the struggles she faces and how they were overcome. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This is my favorite Terry McMillan book. It's a great and well written story."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This book was a naked perspective of a single mother spanning twenty-odd years of scrimping, surviving, and loving, and letting herself be loved. Mama doesn't apologize for much, is too busy surviving to be self-aware. I almost wanted to rescue her, just to give her the escape she needed. I wanted/needed McMillian's character's to evolve to another level, and I'm not certain the author convinced me that they had. It was a satisfying book though, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I always love how Terry's characters are sooo real. I didn't want the book to stop, that's a sign I think when a book is good. Maybe I didn't agree with everything that Mildred did but we are all different. I still enjoyed the story about this family. Great job Terry McMillan!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Characters weren't particularly likable but you will want to keep reading just to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Was told by a friend to read this several years ago, I finally read it and learned alot. I reccomend it to any book reader."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Well, I have to agree with Katherine. I thought this book was great, it is a great story, but Mildred damn sure was a terrible mother. It was made pretty clear that wasnt her intention, but she was. Freda was a better person and a better mother than mildred, and she was rewarded. All those times Mildred leavning Freda in charge of four younger children while she went out and slept with men, is this really what we think of as a strong mother trying to keep her family together? I sure hope not because that means family values are going staight to hell. Even I feel people praise this book for the wrong reasons, there is no doubt this story was touching and leaves you thinking about the story when your finished."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This is my third Terry McMillan novel and once again, I am a huge fan. Her books are REAL, lively, and full of life's lessons and hurts. And although I am white, this family story resonates in my head as my own.Mama, the mother of five, is a struggling black woman who's lived in near poverty her entire life. She is strong, opinionated, bossy, with a grit that only comes from living life the hard way, but also has the character to 'want a back yard', shine the windows and keep her babies polite, hard workers and knowin' they got some good in this life. All of that while she put up with thier Daddy, a boozer and abuser, who Mildred (Mama) finally cuts loose.The story goes on for a couple of decades, with each of her babies lives opening like a flower. All the while, Mildred is growing and then wilting, on and on...This story is real! NO family has happy or unhappy endings. We are all on a journey that doesn't stop... and Terry McMillan knows how to display this more than any other modern writer I've experienced!Awesome, excellent, terrific!!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This book was wonderful, when they cried, I cried, when they laughted, I laughted!! I read this book in 92' I can still remember most of the details. I know that when reading I wanted so most for each of the daughters to accomplish something and at end some did and some didn't. A MUST READ, ENJOY"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I have enjoyed reading Terry McMillan's books from the moment I picked up &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; and &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back.&quot; I love Ms. McMillians sassiness in her characters and her straight forward, in your face approach.This book was another hit as far as I am concerned. It was another page turner that I could not put down. I may not have like the characters personally, such as Mama, she needed a swift kicked in the butt. I found her to be very selfish and cold. She whinned to much for me and I would not have given her my forwarding address if I were one of her children. She was a horrible example for her children in a lot of ways. God's hands were helping these children survive and thrive in a desolate place.Terry, thanks for writing this story. I love your style and wish you continued success. I am looking forward to reading your next book."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Mama was one of the first books I ever read outside of school. I enjoyed this book very much. It was a page turner. While reading the book I felt like I was right there. Everyone of the characters (in the family) reminded me of someone in my family.Mildred was a hard person but felt she had to do what she thought was best. You want to hate her but you can't. This book will have you up all night and you won't care what time it is, you just want to know what happens next. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Terry McMillan put much of my life into words with Mama. This book helped me realize there is a purpose for everyone, and sometimes our problems are not so unique. It helps you get over yourself and start to look for your own answers, instead of snuggling up with your all-too-familiar problems. Viscious circles will allow you to fester and die, not far from where you began, but a straight path from here will at least get you somewhere else. Although, Waiting to Exhale, is not a \\"sequel\\" it does seem to progress to the next phase of life for young black women, therefore, I would begin the Terry McMillan experience with Mama, and then read Waiting to Exhale, following with either How Stella Got Grove Back or Disappearing Acts. In all honesty, I was disappointed in the movie Waiting to Exhale, it does not substitute for the book. Each woman is more evolved in the book, however Angela Bassett did handle her business!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Okay, I have to be honest, I've read this book several times. First, because I enjoyed it and secondly because of the dynamics of Fredda's character, and her love-hate relationship she has with her mother.In spite of McMillan entitling this book \\"Mama\\" freda is clearly the focus [of the story]. Still, I did over-stand Mildred Peacock [Mama]. Mildred was a disparate woman surrounded by the narrow-minded expectations and demands of a small town in Michican during a time where there was little opportunities offered to women of color -- especially one with five children and no husband. So, like many women, Mildred did what she deemed necessary, to survive. Admirable in light of her also surviving spousal abuse. Okay, so Mildred was no nun, and she used everyman that took a fancy to her and justified her every mistake. But her redeeming quality is she wanted more for her children and pushed them toward the bigger picture.Altough Terry McMillian's first novel, I thought it showed more promise than most of her current works available. Now don't get me wrong, I am not a fan of McMillian's. But, Mama was an exception, it's a superb reminder [in my oppinion] of so many LOUD, good intentioned, Sistas (mothers) raising kids in the hood during my own childhood. So placing one face on her was an almost impossible task.Was this book realistic? Absolutely, I honestly knew Mildred. When the moral of the story is \\"life's tough\\" and \\"Sometimes, you hurt the one's you love\\" and even (and especially in the case of \\"Money,\\" Mildred's wayward son) \\"It's never to late to change\\"...Now I ask you: Which of that isn't true to life?... The truth is, [at least in my case] I can still look out the window and point out a Mildred, and look in the Mirror to see Fredda(smile)."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Terry Mcmillan has changed my life. I was never the one to pick up a book and read it from front to back. But then I got a hold on to Terry Mcmillan's MAMA. I was 12 years old and I read it twice. I have been reading ever since. I tell every one about her. Everything I read is based on one of her books. Or should I say that I compare every book to her books. Mama was and still is the best book I have ever picked up. I love the book! I have all of her books. I can't help book read Mama more then once. It showed me how real somepeople write. That book is so raw. I would just turn page after page and not care about the time. I would get finish reading Mama in one day. It got me reading and writing more then I ever did. And oh yeah I am now 19 years old. I have read over 100 books. And I owe it all to Terry Mcmillan's MAMA. Thank You Terry Mcmillan!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I have enjoyed reading Terry McMillan's books from the moment I picked up \\"Breaking Ice: An Anthology of contemporary African American Fiction,\\" and \\"Waiting to Exhale.\\" I love Ms. McMillan's sassiness in her characters and her straight forward, in your face approach.Terry McMillan has always done it for me. Mama is a real story of the reality of growing up in the real world. Mildred is the resourceful, funny, strong mother of five kids that she is raising on her own. She has to go through the trials and tribulations of raising her five children and keeping a steady paycheck. To Mildred, this is as hard as keeping a steady man in her life. I like how Terry makes Mildred the same way a real single, working mother would be while trying to push her kids towards goals that she knows she will not be able to reach her self. Anyone in a family can read this story and have a character that they can relate to. Mama isn't told like a Brady Bunch episode, but it tells of true survival without any handouts. The story keeps you wondering what will happen next. You might find Mildred, Mama, to be very selfish and cold but she has her reasons. To me she was a bit whiney at times but if I was one of her kids I would not have given her my forwarding address. God's hands were helping these children survive and thrive in a desolate place.I really had enjoyed this book. Terry thanks for writing these stories. I love your style and wish you continued success."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Mama was a great book. Mildred the main character in the book was a example of a strong black lady. She triumphed over the biggest feats like rape and domestic abuse. The only thing I didn't like in the book is how she was so mean to Fredda her oldest daughter. She treated her wrongly and not helping her. She did that to all her kids. She left them to fend out in the world by themselves. She was supposed to be an adult but instead the kids were more of adults. Mildred was two faced. She didn't help her children but inspected of her children to help her. Overall it is good that Mildred got back her sense to not to be cold and heartless and learn to show her feelings. I think this book was great"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Again the Strong Black Man image is not in this book. Terry is a great writer, and I have to take it as that. I just would like to see more positive Images about us Black Men! She needs to be around more positive black men so she has some to write about. Not all the black men are negative in this book just 90 %. Anyway this is one of my favorite books by Terry. It would make a good movie, but Terry has stated that this book is too close to her heart, and she did not want to let it be made into a movie. Well trust me she will change her mind if she wants that $$. Good book, pick it up on your kindle."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This book is awesome. I was really loving it.

She didn't have any feelings. She left her kids to fend out in the world alone. She was also two faced. She didn't want to help her kids but expected her kids to help her. I think she selfish. She was lucky she had kids that loved her so much"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I think this novel was a real good novel to read.

She is very heartless, has no feelings and no empathy to her children, especially to her son, Money. No wonder he turned out the way he did!

This is one of the first books I read from her. She portrays the story very well. And also being black myself I can see what they were going through. Mama has some points in it that make this book important. The family goes through many trials. And after you get in to it, it is hard to put down.

In a previous review of Terry's book it was stated &quot;no emotions&quot;. I had so many emotions reading this book. I did not understand why so much profanity.

Her books are interesting and a quick spell binding read. Continue to write Terry, to help to broaden our world!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I must have read this book about ten times. I really liked it. The characters will really touch your heart. Mildred is a strict mother who is trying to have a life of her own while raising five kids.

If you are a family person, then read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"Terry did an amazing job when she penned Mama. I see so many people who think the book is unrealistic, I want to know what world do you live in? There are millions of Mildreds that come in all ages and races.

The characters of Mama and Freda will stay with me: they are real. Mama (Mildred) Peacock and her five children live in the ghetto of a Michigan town, and they are shaped by the ever-present, oppressive racism of the nation, which accepts as given high unemployment, menial jobs for African-Americans, and exorbitant rents for run-down housing. Within this context, so well depicted by the author, the main characters either struggle to live their dreams or go with the flow and are battered about. The love is \\"tough love,\\" which is also necessary for survival. This book is honest, it's real, it's very worth reading. Think of it as a slice-of-life novel which is stronger on situation and character than on plot."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I am very please with my book MOMA by Terry McMillan.It is one of my favorite books!Thanks So Much!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. My inintial interest in the book was from a purely clinical curiosity, but after several chapters I was riding the emotional roller coaster right along with Mildred and her children.

Mildred is the resourceful, funny, strong mother of five kids that she is raising on her own.

I like how Terry makes Mildred the same way a real single, working mother would be while trying to push her kids towards goals that she knows she will not be able to reach her self. I can really relate to Mildred's oldest daughter the way she has to assume the role as the second mother to her younger siblings while trying to live a normal life of her own. That's what makes the story so good, because everyone in the family can read the same story and have a character that they can relate to. Mama isn't told like a Brady Bunch episode, but it tells of true survival without any handouts. The story keeps you wondering what will happen next. I really enjoyed it, and I can't wait to see what Terry McMillan will come up with next. I also recommend Disappearing Acts, Waiting To Exhale, and How Stella Got Her Groove Back."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I had looked forward to reading a book by Terry McMillan because she is such an acclaimed author. I chose Mama because the synopsis sounded interesting. I wouldn't have believed it possible that someone with as much obvious writing talent as Ms. McMillan has, could create such a wealth of morally-bankrupt, patently unlikeable characters. The only person I thought was even partly decent was her oldest daughter, Freda. Mama was a heartless, vicious, opportunistic person who treated other people (including her own children) like garbage. And I'm sorry, but all these other reviewers talking about a woman trying to rise above her poverty and disenfranchisement? She spent the entire book drinking, and looking for a man that she could get to buy her things, and take over her financial responsibilities. This is someone we are supposed to be rooting for? The fact that so many readers purported to relate to Mama, and to have shared the same experiences as single parents, I think bodes for the end of the world. I was raised by a single parent who actually worked, and treated me with love and respect. I thought this book was an insult to any loving mother. I can only hope that Ms. McMillan's other books warrant the high praise they have received. This one did not."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I know the title of this review sounds contradictory, but that's what I think of this book. Frankly I did not like this story. It made me depressed! But I have to give the author her props on her writing as usual.You're a natural!"},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This book was very unrealistic. Being from a poverty background I found it not having a very good picture of the struggle. Just because they were poor the mother did not have to go around sleeping with every man in town to get the rent. That is not how it is in the real world. All homes are different but this was not a good portrayal of the african amerian family in poverty."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"I hope you will use my review though it is far from glowing. I could barely finish this book. Ms. McMillan has clearly not lived the life of an impoverished black person. Her story is farcical. There is no mention of race-related problems in this 60s era novel. Apparently, blacks and whites got along just fine in Ms. McMillan's world. Furhtermore, although this family seems to be close to rock bottom, there seems to always be enough money lying around for them to do with what they wanted. Totally unrealistic. I couldn't stand the main character. She has no redeeming qualities."},{"Title":"Mama","review":"This novel was written more than ten years ago and I'm just now reading it!

I was immensely pleased that I was given the chance to read it my mom read it several times and absolutely loved it and now I know why. Mildred the main character is a single mother with 5 children (4 daughters Freda,Bootsey,Angel,and Doll) an a son Money and she had a lying abusvie husband Crook (which in my opinion is a an appropriate name for him) considering his actions towards Mildred were appalling the fact that Mildered fought back was endearing to me and I cheered her for it. It seems to me that after Crook left Mildred's living situation declined a bit but in life everyone has troubles and her endeavors to make a better life for her and children in the beginning was great. I was dismayed though by the fact that Mildred seemed to need a &quot;man&quot; in her life to make herself feel better I mean couldn't her children have been enough for her but on the other hand a woman sometimes wants to feel wanted by somene other then her children.

I wish she would have expanded on some of the characters that seemed so important to the book when they were introduced, like Bootsey and Angel. They are perfect examples of children coming from a disfunctional family. The best part about it is that it was so real much like all of her books.

The 'Labyrinth of Solitude' this book is NOT. I approached this book--and the work of Stavans in general--based on the blurbs by writers and authors of such high reputation as Henry Louis Gates, Gregory Barrasa and others but I am sorely dissapointed. I'm happy if Stavans can exist as a 'Hispanic' (rather than a Latino) in the 'hyphens' Americans tend to create to label non-whites, but language is not the only force shaping cultures. This books seems to shine only if you forget the historic forces that have forced millions of Latinos to be labeled with the hyphens of compound identities. His posturing on a number of important issues--bilingual education, Latino sexuality, affirmative action--is more often than not biased and superficial, and worse of all, feels like the posturing of an academic unconcerned with the fate and the condition of Latinos in general. This makes you realize that there is no such thing as a 'Hispanic condition.' A thought-provoking but ultimately confused and superficial book. Strictly to please white 'Hispanic' academics. Read or reread 'The Labyrinth of Solitude' by Octavio Paz and 'Massacre of the Dreamers' by Ana Castillo for more compelling reading on the 'Latino Condition.'"},{"Title":"The Hispanic Condition: Reflections on Culture and Identity in America","review":"The attention--and place--this book has already earned in mainstream AND Hispanic America is well deserved.

I was really surprised by the freshness of the comments.

The real truth about America is that it's a covert cold race war in progress, where the only way to survive as a person of non-Anglo-Germanic ethnicity is to find your particular ethnic niche -- black, hispanic, asian, etc. -- and do whatever you can to empower your ethnicity in a reciprocal relationship with empowering yourself. Why? Because, beneath all the soft smiles and wiles, ethnic tribalism rules everything in America -- and if you ever become ignorant of that fact, you will suffer for it.Hispanics in America are now and forevermore -- so long as Anglo-Germanics continue to rule America -- a racially-designated permanent underclass, with the rare exception being where they are particularly militant and educated and thus hold much power, such as in the greater Miami area. But everywhere else in America? No way -- not by a long shot. Throughout America, the entire now-corporate system utilizes so-called \\"human resources\\" departments to racially screen applicants by way of the apparent ethnicity on the top of their resumes, and \\"Equal Employment Opportunity\\" officers to then back up the racist discriminations that go on in those \\"human resources\\" front lines of the race war. It's all a flawlessly tight system, quite neat and tidy.Hispanics -- with REAL Spanish surnames (which I'll get to in just a moment) -- are free in our Anglo-Germanic America to apply to any job they like, for which they may or may not be qualified. However, the instant a \\"human resources\\" race gestapo sees a patently hispanic name on the top of a resume, such as, say -- oh, I don't know -- \\"Gonzalez\\", then they immediately dismiss that applicant as a desired candidate for any and all positions which might bear real influence or critical input, or employ real intelligence and creativity. Those jobs, instead, are near-exclusively reserved for the more \\"adept\\" and \\"naturally intelligent\\" applicants whose names bear the ethnic mark of Europe's Hanseatic north.In America, ethnicity is A-okay, but only so long as it's in restaurant form, dodging bullets in social work, cleaning toilets, or doing other manual labor. Because, as we all know, \\"darkies work best below the neckline\\".2) \\"Ilan Stavans\\" -- what a name. You don't get much more tactically perfect than that, in terms of ethnic opacity. Just to hear and see that name, one would most obviously ask, \\"Is it Scandinavian? Romanian? Where the hell is it from?\\" And that's the power of such a name, because it absolutely and slyly conceals all traces of the bearer's ethnicity -- which, in this case, we are told is (drum roll, please) Spanish. Well, how convenient.(continued in part two)"},{"Title":"The Hispanic Condition: Reflections on Culture and Identity in America","review":"Very challenging read, Exposes the inner workings of a misunderstood Culture and defines not only highlights of the Hispanic Culture but defines as well the diferences between the races existing within.

It's the same with the dictionaries of any other language, duh. Please no more entries by people who have been studying Persian for two days ... learn the script, at most it will take you a couple of hours. There are generally about three factors that comprise a good Persian dictionary: it includes some form of phonetic representation of the word, verbs need to be shown with their present tense roots, and examples of usage (with an emphasis on the use of prepositions and also commonly found idioms). This particular dictionary doesn't seem to give you any of these three. If you want a good dictionary stick to the 40-dollar Aryanpur volume. It makes all of the competitors look like crap."},{"Title":"English-Persian Dictionary","review":"This dictionary likely has more than you need, unless you happen to be a professional translator of Farsi and/or English, but it is miles ahead of the other dictionaries, which tend to contain too little. Please note, however, that this book is one half of a two volume set. The companion volume is the Hippocrene Standard Dictionary: Farsi (Persian) - English Dictionary, also by S. Haim. By Webster's, I am referring to the quality of the dictionary, rather than any definitions, which, to be clear, are not here, only translations."},{"Title":"English-Persian Dictionary","review":"I am learning Farsi--I don't speak Farsi. The dictionary appears to be made for the Persian speaker who needs to check the meaning of an English word. None of the short vowels are marked--so the student must guess at the correct pronunciation. My Iranian friends love this dictionary, but it is not very helpful to me. The best dictionaries for the student are: 1. Persian-English, English-Persian Learner's Dictionary which contains the Farsi script, transliterations and the present tense verb stems and 2. An English Persian Dictionary by Gilani--very large vocabulary with Farsi and transliterations but no present tense verb stems and \\"one-way\\" only. It has no Persian to English.

I didn't want something directed at the popular level (little or no math), but I also didn't want a text that would go into agonizing analysis of every plasma instability under the sun. There are many fine books on plasma physics (e.g F. F. Chen's &quot;Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion&quot;); that is not what I was looking for and that is not the emphasis of this text.This covers the basic physics and explains the basic concepts behind several of the more popular fusion approaches. The reader should have college level physics and calculus to get the most out of this book. I found it useful but not comprehensive (you can only fit so much in under 300 pages).

There's nothing like a true friend to grow up with."},{"Title":"How Writers Work: Finding A Process That Works For You (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is unique in that it talks directly to kids about writing, in a personal rather than a \\"textbook\\" manner. I can't think of any other books for kids that do this (other than the others by Fletcher listed at the end), and it is so valuable! The book is also simply very interesting and well-written.This book is not about the craft and mechanics of writing, but about how to establish that all-important *habit* of writing. It's about all the elements that enable and support a person to actually write. I don't know whether this book or \\"A Writer's Notebook\\" by Ralph Fletcher should be read first; they are both so important. I'm thinking of having my students read them concurrently.I love the fact that Fletcher does not teach \\"the process,\\" but rather encourages kids to find their own process. He cautions students not to \\"prewrite the life out of their topic\\" through excessive prewriting. It is also made clear, through the book's inspiring interviews with children's writers, that the processes that these successful writers use differ greatly from each other. One of the authors says she would never talk about her topic before writing about it, because \\"ideas bring with them an energy to write them. If I talk about them instead, I lose that initial energy that's crucial.\\" I am a prolific writer, have almost never written an outline (before writing) in my life, and have always disagreed with requiring kids to do so (see Peter Elbow books for more on the process I use - freewriting).Some of the topics this book goes into are where to write, finding an idea, brainstorming, getting started, amount to write, rereading, handwriting vs. using a computer, research, rough drafting, revision, and the proper place of grammar and spelling (definitely never \\"disturb the flow,\\" when you're writing well, to deal with them). In all these topics, a variety of options are given, with liberal use of quotes from both kids and adult authors.Fletcher makes it clear that \\"getting an idea\\" and \\"getting started\\" are two distinct activities, and not necessarily related. It's common to have a great idea that you never bring to fruition, and even more common to just start writing, with no ideas initially. In fact he goes into the value of writing \\"just a bunch of slop,\\" and valuing it as a form of \\"exercising.\\"His overall message is that although some people are born or inspired writers, for most people, writing is hard work. You have to live a full life to have material; be conscientious in capturing those inspired thoughts and moments in your writer's notebook; do the tough work of writing something bad as a first draft; be open to \\"radical surgery\\" type revision; reread your own work incessantly; solicit feedback; be a careful editor; and look for appropriate places to publish.Lastly, I read this book as a mother of three and a teacher who supervises homeschooling families. Since reading this (and Fletcher's other wonderful books: \\"A Writer's Notebook\\" and \\"Live Writing\\"), I haven't been able to stop writing poetry myself (which is not something I normally do)!"},{"Title":"How Writers Work: Finding A Process That Works For You (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This charming little book offers a solid, user-friendly introduction to the fundamental steps of the writing process. Fletcher uses a clear and simple prose style to lead young readers through the creative writing process, from generating an idea and writing the first draft, to rereading and revising, to proofreading, editing, and publishing. Along the way, he discusses the importance of finding a suitable place to write, strategies for brainstorming, and methods of overcoming writer's block. Also included are several author interviews to provide alternative approaches to the writing process as well as a bibliography of recommended fiction and writing-related nonfiction. Beginning writers of any age may find inspiration in the practical strategies and encouraging sentiments set forth in this simple but elegant guide."},{"Title":"How Writers Work: Finding A Process That Works For You (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. Fletcher wrote this book as a how-to for younger students, but anyone can get something from this book. It does a great job of walking the reader through a step-by-step process of how to be the best writer possible with an easy to follow format and many helpful ideas to accomplish the process. I think the point Mr. Fletcher is trying to convey to his reader is that writers are not mysticals who exist in a far off wonderland; they are everyday people, and anyone can be a writer-all it requires is releasing the energy of talking on paper. I think this book would be a beneficial part of any classroom library because it's a quick read and packed with ways to start out even the youngest of writers. The section of this book that is dedicated to expaining what students do when they are facing problems writing, will help other students relate to this book."},{"Title":"How Writers Work: Finding A Process That Works For You (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Similar to other Fletcher writing booksExcellent to use with writing lessons--esp. at the beginning of the school year"},{"Title":"How Writers Work: Finding A Process That Works For You (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This little book, at only 111 pages, was written with the young writer in mind. It's the perfect tool for teachers in elementary schools to help their students begin writing, especially the reluctant ones. Ralph Fletcher uses samples of student writing and some of his own pieces to illustrate and motivate. He is always positive, as this, from pages 40 and 41 shows:\\"You probably won't write too much when you start. One paragraph is fine. Two paragraphs is terrific. A whole page of writing is heroic.Don't expect profound thoughts of brilliant poetry to flow out of your pen. If you do, and nothing comes, you'll get so depressed you'll stop writing. Lower your standards enough so you can get something down on paper. And whatever you do, don't beat yourself up if what you write sounds pretty awful Start. Begin. Write.\\"Pretty sound advice, I think. I've read a few books on the craft of writing, but this one actually motivated me to sit down and write...and not beat myself up when nothing \\"Fine. Terrific.

Cole does not examine the kArikA on a verse by verse basis. He is particularly concerned with looking at the practical aspects of Gaudapada's teaching rather than its purely metaphysical ones. In the author's words, he is 'investigating the nature of the soteriology of Advaita Vedanta'. [i.e. the teaching of the way to salvation or mokSha.] And it succeeds very well, providing a very readable account of the essence of the teaching and relegating the references to footnotes. It is academic in tone but this does not detract from the value of this excellent interpretation.Dennis Waite, author of Back to the Truth: 5000 years of Advaita"},{"Title":"Halachos of Muktza","review":"This is is the book (written in 1981) that set the standard for all the halachic textbooks to follow, and nobody has succeded in surpassing it. It's still the most organized, comprehensive, and easy-to-follow halachic compendium that you'll find anywhere.Rav Bodner begins by pulling the rug from under one of the most widely-held misconceptions regarding muktza--that it's synonymous with \\"tool made for forbidden work\\" (kli she'melachto l'issur). Not the case! In fact, the class of \\"tools\\" is just one type of muktza among many, and it's actually a fairly lenient one. The laws of moving rocks and raw meat are more stringent than the laws of moving a pen or a power drill. Surprised? Read this book, and you'll be able to answer such puzzlers as, why is sand at the beach muktza, but sand in a sandbox is not? Or why are we more lenient about moving an unlit match than a match that has been lit and blown out? If you've ever scratched your head over an inscrutable muktza din in Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata, this is the book for you. More about principles than about practical halacha, the book delves deep into the theory behind the halachos before moving to applications. Detailed footnotes (in Hebrew) go into Shas, Shulhan Aruch, Mishneh Brureh, and various poskim whenever a disagreement or question arises. You will need some Hebrew reading ability, since technical terms are given in unpointed Hebrew.Other authors writing in the same genre are Shimon Eider, Simcha Bunim Cohen, and Binyomin Forst. They're good (especially Eider), but Bodner is the master."},{"Title":"The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy","review":"Eighty percent of the 260 pages of this book describe the daily surveillance police made on the drug importers. It includes watching what they were doing in their business locations, the restaurants and bars they visited, etc. Tailing their cars everyday is also part of the job. The book is full of details like how the detectives felt while sitting in their cars for hours, what they talked to each other, etc.It reveals how hard it is to be police detectives. It's so hard that it destroyed the love life of one of them. Their gratuitous devotion and sacrifice moves me.After finishing half of the book, it became dry and boring.I give it 5 stars for details, painstakingly and vividly depicting the hard work and hard life of the detectives. I give it 3 stars for entertaining value. So, on average, it deserves 4 stars.P.S.This book makes me wonder if North American governments are losing the Drug war. The amount of drug confiscated these days is at least hundred of times larger than the one in this book. However, drug is still flooding our streets. Why? Below are some of the reasons I've found. If any readers found different ones, please list them in your comment so that they can be beneficial to all of us.1. Money, money.Making, and selling drug are ways to get rich quickly. As a result, more people are selling them than in the 70s when this book was first printed. You can see on the news these days, the drug trade is taking over border cities in Mexico. Thousands of people were killed each year! Moreover, it has spilled out on to U.S big cities. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, more than one hundered of people were kidnapped a year. Most of them are drug related according to CNN.2. Easier ways to make drugs.These days a lot of people are making meth or growing marijuana in their homes. It's more difficult to detect them.3. Drugs are more potent.They say drugs are more potent now. For example, if a person tries Meth once, he'll get hooked. The potency also makes it's much harder to get rid of the addiction.4. More addicts.There are more people doing drugs now than in the 70s when this book was first printed. That makes a huge demand. That explains why the drug trade is flourishing. Why is it so?The amazing thing is the majority of addicts are not rich. So, I can not say people have got it all and they try drugs because they're bored with their lives. Does that means Drug Education has failed? I don't know. I have no answer for this.One simple logic is if nobody is buying drug then nobody is selling it. Yes, I believe the best solution is reducing the number of users to minimum. Other solutions just complement this. We can never make it so that nobody is buying it. There are always a few people doing drugs to get new excitement. The question is how can we effectively reduce the numbers of user?5. Problems with Drug-Fighting Agencies.A lot of books have proved bureaucracy, in-fighting, and lack of co-operation, as the reasons why these agencies are not efficient in the war against drug. Right now, I forget their titles. I'll update this information later.6. Corruption in law-enforcement agencyAlso corruption of some policemen is another reason.

I found it to be fascinating and a page turner. I could see how some might find it boring through the middle half of the book because it involes many episodes of sitting and watching suspects and tailing the same suspects endlessly on foot or in cars. I think young CSI fans considering a career in LE should read this and see if the greuling work needed to catch serious criminals sounds appealing. I'm not sure I would be motivated enough to stand in place outside in 0 degree weather for hours waiting for a suspect to make a move. Not to mention the 120 hr weeks, 36 hr days and apparently unpaid overtime. I've seen the movie several times, which is why I got this when I happened upon it.

He contacted friends in the New York Police Department and discovered what he would later call 'The French Connection Case', a French syndicate smuggling heroin into New York.

These are now known to contain several quite different organisms from Euglena to Chara and from diatoms to desmids and Spirogyra. The flora is huge and often poorly known. Thus it was with some enthusiasm that I welcomed the publication of this massive tome. A much-needed updating of Smith's classic book and more, it contains numerous black and white photos and drawings, plus extensive bibliographies for each chapter. I also much appreciate the keys, having been involved in writing several for spider genera. The only down side is the rather high price, which is quite a bit more than its companion volume on freshwater invertebrates.I don't fault this book for lack of color because that might have easily made it even more expensive. If you want to see color photos of algae, and indeed very good ones, try &quot;Freshwater Algae: Their Microscopic World Explored&quot; by Hilda Canter-Lund and her husband J. W.

He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain. The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America. Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class. The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America). For all of those who are interested in a better understanding of Latin American societies of today this great book is a must. Lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the Hispanic American societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Christian youth wants to know: Questions and answers on subjects of interest to our youth : for use in Bible Schools, instruction classes, post-baptism instruction classes, and for personal use","review":"This book was a very well written and looks at every aspect of the revolution.

If you're looking for a deep, serious plot, this isn't it. ;) Lots of fast paced lines, kewel twists and turns, terrific irony. The humor and almost frantic pace remind me of those black and white comedies Cary Grant used to do with Katharine Hepburn. Which I adore, btw, even though I can't for the life of me remember what they're called.Amanda's and Lesley's families are longtime friends and have decided they should marry. She does not have fond memories of him and he doesn't like being blackmailed by his mother, so they each set out to get out of the engagement by making the other cry off. Throw in a Zorro-ish second plot about him wearing a mask and getting mistaken for a thief then recruited by Bow Street and you have a great ride."},{"Title":"Captain Rakehell (Large Print)","review":"Captain Rakehell was a fun regency romance. Much did seem unbelievable for the era but it made for some smiles and cheering up while reading. It did get confusing with the various characters, like the thiefs and others introduced as family and friends. They were put into the story so fast that when reading on, it was often needed to go back and remember who they were. Even with these issues, its worth the read for some fun time reading."},{"Title":"Captain Rakehell (Large Print)","review":"I read Captain Rakehell when it was originally published.

Mistaken identities, meddling relatives and a Countess who has fainting down to an art form are just a few of the obstacles that stymie two people determined not to honor their family's wishes to be betrothed and mark Captain Rakehell as a thoroughly enjoyable Regency romp."},{"Title":"Captain Rakehell (Large Print)","review":"My mistake was not reading the free sample before purchasing this book. I trusted the other review. However, I found this book to not be worth nearly 2.99, although that could be because I've been reading $.99 ebooks for the past week or so, and those have been better than this, which I paid three times as much for. I'm all for fun and silly books, but this one was so shallow it wasn't even worth the effort. His whole love thought process was \\"hey, she's hot!\\" and her's was \\"hey, he kissed me! And I liked it!\\" Nobody had any depth, or grew as a person. Which I admit, is probably a bit of a lofty goal for a romance novel, but I can dream, can't I? If you're looking for good cheap regency romance novels, I'd suggest trying Delle Jacobs, particularly The Mudlark or His Majesty, Prince of Toads. Don't waste your time on this one, as it moves too fast, gives the characters little background motivation for the things they do, and ends quite ridiculously."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"This is the second book by Manfredi that I have read - the first one being Last Legion - and I must say this was more intense than Last Legion. I have always wondered when people talk about joy and anguish being twin emotions. I could never imagine how 2 very different feelings could be as close. But reading this book makes you realise what it exactly feels like. To be exuberant and torn by anguish at the same time. This story is truly about Talos (Kleidemos), but his brother plays an important part in the story as well. In a way, Brithos is a fixed point of reference against the changes that occur in Talos/Kleidemos character. Its about the 2 lives that the Talos (Kleidemos) lives through and the choice he makes. I felt that this work might have had more stylish translation, it seemed to have a serene quality. I would recommend it to any history buff. Its a very moving tale. It can make you cry, but it definitely makes respect Spartans and Helots for who they were, and what they valued most."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"I had seen a lot of Manfredi's novels about and had attended a lecture of his when he was in Australia, so I was very interested to see what sort of a writer he was and how he would capture the period of the Ancient Greeks and Sparta.I must admit that I was dissappointed.While the storyline is ok (if not a little fantastic), it felt like I was reading a sort of laymans guide to Ancient Sparta. Integral cultural aspects of the Spartans were glossed over, while others were poorly explained and portrayed, ultimately (for someone who has read a lot on Ancient Sparta anyway) giving the novel a simplistic fantasy novel feel.Certainly not even close to being in the same league as Pressfield, Nicastro or Curtis Ford, I would have to say that if all Manfredi's Ancient Greek novels are like this, they are more for people with only a passing interest in the historical setting."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"There is no doubt that this author knows his history, and given his credentials he should. I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Legion, although the following movie fell far short of the original book. Spartan, however, never really explained itself the way I hoped it would. By the end, I was still confused about the mysteries surrounding the long-lost brother and his adopted people. The story zigzagged back and forth so many times that I lost interest and had to force myself to finish."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"Overall this is a worthwhile read with interesting historical facts woven throughout the fictional account. Portions that bothered me were the way Manfredi used character dialogue to explain the culture of the time. He would create conversation that basically would answer any question someone might have, but explaiend details that would have been everyday knowledge for people of the time. It felt like he was \\"dumbing down\\" the characters uneccesarily instead of creating a Glossary. An example is when a group of soliders runs into their barracks nude, from bathing after exercies, and meet with a command officer. One recruit says to the Officer something to the effect of \\"We would salute, but we cant as we are nude, and thats against Military rules\\". An Officer would know that and that would not need explaining to him by a lower ranking soldier. This type of unsensible explanation during conversations replayed itself multiple times and was annoying as well as made it seem like a book for a middle school age reading level. Other than these annoyances, I enjoyed the book and will keep it on the shelf, although it may not become a multiple read."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"&gt; Manfredi, author of the best-selling Alexander trilogy, is back with a new epic adventure. Two men, both sons of a valorous Spartan commander, are brothers by blood, but yet fate has destined them to be enemies instead. Amid the cruel law of Spartan, it was thus that the crippled brother Talos, whose genuine name was Kleidemos, was reluctantly separated from his family at birth. Yet, the Gods did not entirely abandon this baby. By chance, a helot finds Talos and saves him from the wild. Helots were a once proud race of men now enslaved by the Spartans. Therefore, raised by the helot shepherd, Talos lives in servitude while his brother, Brithos, remains in the mighty warrior class of Spartans.&gt; As the years passed, the two boys become men, both concealed from the existence of each other. It is till one day, when Brithos stands over Talos, ready to give him a fatal blow that he realizes that there is a special bond between them two. Their blood ties were still shrouded from Brithos, yet a mysterious force stopped him from killing his brother. Determined to find an understanding, both Brithos and Talos becomes entangled in a series of adventure, eventually discovering their identity as brothers.&gt; However, as war clashes between the Greeks and the Persians, petrifying incidents occur and Talos is left dealing with yet the many baffling puzzles of his life. When Talos finally learns that he is both a Helot and a Spartan, he is harassed by a final and decisive decision; the decision between whether he should pursue the footsteps of his noble father and brother, or whether he should lead the people that once raised him and gave him a chance to live. Full of passion and valor, Spartan is a thrilling novel that portrays a realistic scenario of the ancient world."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"Although this book didn't focus DIRECTLY on the '300', thier story was a very important part to this story. I did enjoy this novel but the reason why I only gave it 3 stars was because it had to many down parts for me. Not enough to keep me from reading, but enough to bother me a little.The story was a good one and I enjoyed the battle, blood, and gore! Exactly what a story in this time frame ought to have."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"I'm halfway through this book and have to admit I can't quite agree with the over the top praise this author is receiving. Does he know his subject? Absolutely. At times though I think that he falls back into the role of professor and the unpronouceable (for me at least since the peoples and age of which he writes is not completely familiar to me) names come rolling out one after the other barely giving me time to digest one before trying to figure out who or what the next one is. I think he takes for granted that anyone picking up this book must have a working knowledge of the time period and be aquainted with all diverse people that filled the army of &quot;the Great King&quot;. I have to admit I am partial to Bernard Cornwell's writing and it was because of his praise printed on the cover of the book that I purchased it. I'm used to Mr Cornwell gently introducing peoples, customs and devices of a past age thoroughly explaining their purpose and existance in well crafted prose. I know the author is Italian and the writing feels like an interpreted work (I'm not sure if it was originally written in Italian which would explain a lot if it was)with stilted often very unrealistic conversations between the characters. I haven't so far gotten a very good sense of the characters either and feel they could have been fleshed out a little more. On the plus side, I have found the story itself intriguing enough to continue reading. It's almost as if I feel I need to finish this to see if it gets any better or was worth the read to begin with. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"I'm halfway through the book now, and am seriously considering putting it down. See the other reader reviews for comments on the storyline. It is indeed a nice tale, set against a most powerful backdrop. However, it just feels like the author rushes through events at too fast a pace. Entire battles are described in a few paragraphs, what should be long prolongued drama filled scenes of major character death is boiled down to a few sentences. Really, the story told in this book is good enough to have been expanded into 6-8 books, but instead we are treated on a whirlwind tour spanning from the birth of the main character, to teenage years, to Thermopylae, to Platea and across the ocean - all in half the book so far. It's beginning to get tiresome."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"For those who've read and enjoyed Pressfield's GATES OF FIRE, it may seem hopless that anyone will ever write another tale of the Spartans in as moving and powerful a fashion. But this one nearly attains that goal. Here is a novel of two brothers, separated as babes, the elder a perfect Spartan paragon, the younger deformed at birth and abandoned by his parents to die of exposure in the wild. Rescued by a shepherd of the Helots, that people who were enslaved by the Spartan citizenry, the crippled child is raised and strengthened by his adopted people and taught to become their long dreamed of champion. But the Spartan blood of Talos the Cripple calls to him and draws him inexorably back to his Spartan roots even while the Spartans alternately torment and tolerate him, recognizing him as one of their own. Drawn into the great Battle of Thermopylae, the crucial plot-point of GATES OF FIRE, Manfredi's SPARTAN follows Talos in his struggles against the brutal inhumanities of Sparta and his own return to their ranks . . . and the conspiracies that characterized the ancient Hellenic world of the Greek city-states. The depth and poetry of Talos' personal experiences and the war in his soul carry this tale, though, perhaps, some of the other characterizatations grow pale by comparison. His Helot and Spartan mothers seem ghostly shades, even in life, while his beloved Antinea has but a bit part. The other Spartans are not much stronger and the plot feels a trifle contrived as we follow Talos from slavery to heroism and then to the point where he must choose a path between the two. The tale was compelling and kept me going throughout, but the ending felt just a bit too melodramatic, with one too many loose ends. But, in the end, this was a tale that aimed to spin a modern myth out of ancient Greek cloth, complete with prophecies and mysterious dreams and a sense of fate, and the gods, at work. Not quite a tragedy in the old Greek sense, it's nevertheless finely done for all its faults. If not quite perfect, it's yet a fine rendering of an ancient and, by modern standards, despicable people, though we come to see their humanity even through the harsh and brutal measures that define them. A good one and worth it, if you like historical fiction, especially the kind that comes to us from the ancients.Stuart W. Mirskyauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"Let's cut to the chase: This novel is at least as good as Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" (an excellent book), but in two areas I feel it surpasses it. The first is that it is a faster moving story. The second is that although Manfredi, like Pressfield, clearly admires the spartans, he doesn't sanitize them quite as much. Both novels are written from the perspective of a slave, but Manfredi's Talos has feelings much more in line with what a slave would feel, I think. Both involve Thermopylae, but where that is the central theme of \\"Gates of Fire\\", here it is one occurance among many halfway through the story. Elsewhere in the reviews for this book, I found one reader who felt a little lost with a few of the characters. Manfredi does an excellent job of bringing to life historical figures such as exiled King Demaratus, but I admit that it may help to have a general understanding of the Persian war. Interestingly, the prose flows particularly well for a translation. If you like reading about ancient heroics, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"VMM is one of the greatest writer ever, he has such an in depth knowledge of the hellenistic, roman and greek period. His background does not only supports his writing, but he is also an extremely capable stroy teller. I had read all his books, the alexander trilogy, the lost legion and spartan and I always had difficulties in stop reading them and always end up rereading them all over again.in Spartan, VMM vividly described the spartan way of life and all the historical happenings that surrounded the spartan legacy, from the suppresion of the helots, the persian invasion, the famous death of King Leonidas and his 300 spartans, the earthquake that prompted the helots to revolt and the subsequent battles.VMM has a 'fluid' way in writing his works, hence he is not trapped in following the familiar pattern all over again which tends to happen to other authors, thus VMM managed to avaoid the boredom of a repeated story line.And an merit should also be rewarded to the translator, without whom the books will be non accesibe to the english readers. The translators had indeed managed to capture the very essence and beauty of VMM's works. 2 thumbs up for the translators.I recommend all of VMM books, he is truly a marvelous historian and story teller. Simply impossible to stop reading.I am eagerly waiting for VMM's next book."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"I got this book from a friend in Puerto Galera, Philippines, about 3 years ago. It didn't seem like my kind of book. Boy, was I wrong!SPARTAN has it all. The story is simple -- two brothers separated at birth but inextricably bound in a common destiny, and the triumph of good (the freedom of a conquered and enslaved people) over evil. As a simple yet incredibly consistent and complex story, you get caught up in the action from the first page. So the book succeeds in the most important task: telling a good story.Second, Manfredi (or rather Christine Feddersen-Manfredi, the translator) tells the story using language that begs to be reread to be fully enjoyed. The book has almost poetic merit in places. Indeed, this book will get taken back to Thailand this summer for a second read! I'd highly recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"I've finished this book only days ago and still want to go back and re-read it again. It's a fantastic story. The story was about Talos and Brithos who were brothers but because of their unfortunate that they had to be separated and walked in t a different path. When time came, they met again but.......ANyway, it's boring to write the plot of the story for u guys to read, u could read it at the back of the book. My review of the story is that it's a very touchign story as I don't know much about twins stuff, their emotion towards each other....The second part is about mostly Talos and the war he had ahead of him which is also very good.I agree with one of the guy who wrote comment about Valerio not introduce some of the characters well enough and we might be a bit confused about some of the not-so-important characters but that wouldn't be much of a problem actually.Buy it ppl, I know u guys would like it.

But when Talos has to defend a young woman he comes to the attention of a group of Spartans and not only that but the Spartan General looks at him with such pain in his eyes. The story follows two young men as they battle at Thermopylae - one as a Spartan warrior the other as a servant and leanr that together they can make a terrible pair. I really enjoyed this book and haing actually studied the time period that it describes I greatly enjoyed the different perspective on it. Though I did feel sorry for Talos and I must admit shed a few tears - which I don't do very often with books but is becoming more regular."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"You can always tell who favors or despises the Spartan legacy by what they write about. Although you can hardly call the Spartans sweethearts one still admires them for their discipline and the way they upheld their laws. Mr. Manfredi it seems didn't like them very much, and i can understand it. I did enjoy this book, although i found it a bit lopsided. It seems that Talos goes through alot of hardship just to disappear at the end. Sometimes he would be portrayed as happy as a slave then it would portray him as downtrodden. winch one is it?? well the story line was good, alot of these types of books always revolve around a servant and what he witnesses in his servitude. ie. (the ten thousand, Gates of Fire). This was kind of more about the Helots than the Spartans and the Messenian revolt. Its a good read, im not sure how much of this was made up, but its good anyway. Yes I love Historical Fiction and I've basically read all of these books in about 3 days or less but I think that I'm going to have to get used to the fact that i will never find another book as good as Gates of Fire...(sigh)"},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"\\"Spartan\\" by Valerio Massimo Manfredi is not really too bad of a book with a interesting plot and nice character development. It is very clear that the author has researched but sometimes the names gets confusing. Overall though, not a bad read for plain enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"SPARTAN is a unique book in that it is the fictional story of a fellow who has one foot in the camp of the Lacedamons (Spartans) and one foot in the camp of the Helots (the Messenian slave race of the Spartans). Born with a deformed foot, the protaganist is a fellow named Talos who is rejected by Spartan society. In accordance with their customs, he is exposed. That is to say, left in the woods to die. Of course, as is the case in Greek mythology, he is picked up by a Helot and given a chance to live an alternate life.The bulk of the storyline takes us through the Persian wars, from the battle of Marathon through the climactic battle of Platea. It then continues on with the campaigns of the Spartan king Pausanius in Asia minor. Ultimately, we relive the earthquake which nearly brought Sparta to its knees, and spurred on a revolt of the Helots.There are a great many historical tidbits that the author creatively entwines Talos in. Of course, in doing so, Manfredi also takes some liberties and does a little bit of rewriting of history. Many who are familiar with this epoch of history will be a little disappointed with the denouement of the book as it offers a happy ending where history says there wasn't one.Nonetheless, this is a fine read & is worthy to be on the bookshelf of people who are fascinated by the ancient Spartans (like me!). This book will likely be compared toGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae. Like GOF, it tells the story of an unconventional Spartan Helot. The present book is not as intense as GOF, and paints with a wider brush than does Pressfield's masterpiece. I would recommend both books to those who are enthused about the Lacedamon tradition."},{"Title":"The Spartan","review":"Nice novel about ancient Sparta, which has few smaller weak points. For instance the description of the pontoon bridge construction by Persian engineers is presented obscurely.

This book is even historically accurate."},{"Title":"Acoustic wave scattering from a random ocean bottom (WHOI-91-25)","review":"Suzanne Massie creates a moving, romantic view of the palace and park at Pavlovsk. Indeed, the author gives an interesting history of the palace, the creative force of its first mistress, Maria Fedorovna, in shaping its structure and extraordinary park.The history falls thin in unfolding the history of subsequent inhabitants; and in describing the development of the many features of the park (at one time the largest private park in Europe). That Suzanne Massie skimps on the history of those post Maria Fedorovna inhabitants and in placing the park in its proper framework mars the descriptive of Pavlovsk's story.The historic descriptive becomes a prelude for the heroically painted picture of A. M. Kuchumov, the head preservationist at the time of palace's reconstruction (A. M. Kuchumov's story by itself, would be substantial material a book); and, thus, may explain the scant detail of the park's restoration, since A. M. Kuchumov displayed heroic dedication and courage to his work that would overshadow the story of the park in favour of that of the palace itself. There is no information on the continuing efforts to address all the problems persisting from that palace reconstruction--the first to be rebuilt after WW2--or the continuing story of the park.Suzanne Massie does leave out the dimensions of the incredible collections at the palace-museum; and the continuing extraordinary work of the conservators. (It also may be of interest to note that the legendary Rose Pavilion has been reconstructed (1993-94); and that Suzanne Massie had contributed work towards fundraising for lighting for the palace, but no longer maintains such connections with the palace-museum and park.)I should like to see an update and an expansion of this book."},{"Title":"Acoustic wave scattering from a random ocean bottom (WHOI-91-25)","review":"This is a book about a Russian palace, Pavlovsk, a classically beautiful building which was designed by Charles Cameron and furnished by Maria Feodorova, the daughter-in-law of Catherine the Great. The palace managed to escape the uncertain taste of descendants and the Revolutionary commissars to somehow remain intact. Then came the Second World War. The Nazis occupied the palace, stripped it to the walls and set it on fire. It was reduced to smouldering shell. A devoted band of Russians devoted their lives to restoring the palace to its former glory. Their work is like a detective story as they trace looted furnishings and use old blue-prints and photos to rebuild. Rebuild they did, and the palace is now open to the public. A heroic story, though not in the conventional sense."},{"Title":"Acoustic wave scattering from a random ocean bottom (WHOI-91-25)","review":"If you have any genuine interest in Russian History, this is a great book for you!

It tells Russian history through the lens of a particular palace, Pavlosk, just outside of St. Petersburg. (Pavlosk was built by the somewhat crazy son of Catherine the Great.) First, the reader relishes in the grandeur of tsarist lifestyle -- music (including a Strauss residency at the palace), art, international travel, palace intrigues, and more. Then the glamour dims to the horrors of WWII and the destruction of the palace. And just like the firebird (a symbol of Russia), the palace rises again to its former glory through the efforts of some very, very dedicated people. The details Massey provides are numerous, such that the reader feels he or she is there. Who knew that children from the ballet school could use their dainty toes to root out landmines around the palace? Read this book and you'll know this detail and lots more."},{"Title":"Teaching as the Learning Profession : Handbook of Policy and Practice","review":"This is a VERY GOOD book for anyone interested in Teacher develoment.

Specifically, he included opinions of other people and made sure the reader knew the sources. His footnotes and extensive bibliography show that he did a lot of research. Throughout the book, his language shows a love of vocabulary, but clear ideas. From the beginning he quickly summarizes the history of Mexico up to 1940, then, starting with geography, he discusses a variety of topics, all relating to the revolution. With charts and maps he illustrates his points very well. This book delves deeply into Mexico's revolution, but is not interesting nor useful for the current time period. However, Cline wrote an extremely informative book for his time period, with an official approach caused by his federal job. The book is quite similar to a book called Mexico: A Country Study, I think. More recent books are better for information. Because the book is about the specified time period, I would only recommend the book to an historian. Anyways, I did not like this book because it was boring and very long because I am not that interested in Mexico and I don't need to know that much."},{"Title":"The art of leadership,","review":"Captain Roskill\`s book on leadership is a thoughtful review and analysis of a very complex and difficult subject. Unlike some books, Captain Roskill is not so catholic in his outlook that he neglects to cite examples of leadership traits and experiences from other British services. He also draws on his own experiences as a senior executive office in ships of the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy. He also discusses what he feels are areas that help develope a leader\`s skills in great detail and cites numerous examples of men with excellent qualities of leadership.While this is a study of leadership from a British perspective the basic structure of leadership is the same in any service in any nation so his writing is as appplicable to the US and to any other country with a military service. It is a subject that is international in scope and applicability. You don\`t need an extensive knowledge of British militiary leaders as Captain Roskill gives a quick summary of their role as he introduces them. These thumbnail sketches are excellent and you read them and move into the theme of the writing without missing a beat.While his book was written in the early 1960s it is still meaningful in today\`s naval and military services across the globe.

Some folks may not be familiar with tomatillos, but you must try the delightful Tomatillo-Avocado sauce (p. 174), which is scrumptious with crab cakes and everything else!

A species-by-species account would take hundreds of pages. Although such volumes do exist, they are often very expensive. In this book, husband and wife naturalists Chris &amp; Tilde Stuart have presented a beautifully illustrated introduction to Africa's bird diversity which is both affordable and informative. The book is neither a field guide nor an academic tome. The authors have divided the book into several chapters, each one on a group of birds that share similar general characteristics--penguins and terns are in the seabird chapter, and hornbills and marabou storks are in another. Within each chapter, the birds are subdivided into families, which adds a nice systematic touch to the book. The text includes details on natural history and biology--I would like to have seen more biological detail and inclusion of more species, but as previously mentioned, the book is intended as an introduction to the birds of Africa, not as an in-depth treatment. Although the text is useful, perhaps the best part of the book is the spectacular colour photographs that adorn every page. The Stuarts' are renowned wildlife photographers, and their talent shines through. For what it sets out to accomplish, Birds of Africa succeeds admirably."},{"Title":"Teachings on Love","review":"Once more our beloved Zen master and amazing poet does it again in yet another spiritual masterpiece, guiding us all towards a more meaningful and joyful life. I actually may very well believe that this particular text is the very finest you will ever read on this much debated topic: Love. In Buddhism there is a teaching known as The Four Immeasurable Minds. They are love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. The root and source of love is in all human beings, and it is our responsibility to realize this and cultivate love as the way of our very lives.He starts with beneficial practices here on just how to do that seemingly arduous task; how to listen to others with patience, how to accept and love yourself, and ultimately how in a sense \\"rewrite your karma.\\" Thich covers issues like anger and jealousy, which of course cause ourselves and countless others innumerable amounts of stress and trouble. As with some of his other works where he advises we create, for instance, our own sutra -Thich likewise develops 4 original mantras in a chapter here intended to develop a loving relationship with all that is through a program of awareness, respect for ourselves and others, nurturing, and perhaps most importantly communication.It's with practice suggestions and the like which Thay provides here that make this work a landmark in his teaching career. Just when you think you've reaped all which Thich Nhat Hanh has to offer you, a book like this comes along to refresh your expert mind back to a baby. After all, a baby's mind is open to most anything, it has nothing to do but learn. And so is our practice. Learning, cultivation, hardship. To sum up, practice is our life.Teachings on Love may be that book you are looking for in times of Great Doubt which reminds you of the potential of your practice, thus renewing your Great Belief. This work is a testament to the wonderful teachings this modern master always seems to deliver. I can't actually recommend this one enough. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Teachings on Love","review":"\\"Teachings on Love&quot; helps water those seeds of love in your heart. Here one of the parts I liked the most:&quot;Look into the eyes of your beloved and ask deeply, &quot;Who are you, my love, who has come to me and taken my suffering as your suffering, my happiness as your happiness, my life and death as your life and death? Who are you whose self has become my self? Why aren't you a dewdrop, a butterfly, a bird, a pine tree? Ask with your whole body and mind. Later, you will have to ask the person who causes you the most suffering the same questions...To understand, you have to become one with your beloved, and also one with your so-called enemy. You have to worry about what they worry about, suffer their suffering, appreciate what they appreciate. You and the object of your love cannot be two. They are as much you as you are yourself...See and listen with the whole of your being. If you are fully present, the rain of the Dharma will water the deepest seeds in your store consciousness, and tomorrow, while you are washing the dishes or looking at the blue sky, that seed will spring forth, and love and understanding will appear as a beautiful flower.&quot;Beautiful isn't it?

As for the book itself, it is AMAZING, and I'm not overexaggerating. My fiancee and I are getting married soon, and we have had a tumultuous relationship to say the least due to long distance -he lives in the UK and I live in the United States, plus he has a nightmare ex-wife and he also has two children. This book has finally brought some much needed balance and peace. He listened to it on tape, while I opted for the book itself. It has mostly taught us how to revamp our arguements when we have them, and how to diffuse situations so they don't become arguements. Plus it offers practical advice on how to embrace the anger you're feeling and by recognizing it and telling yourself it's okay, you immediately start feeling better. This book taught me how to respect my partner in a new way and how to not let my emotions immediately take over. This book SAVED my relationship, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone ever in a serious relationship, planning to get married, or working on saving their marriage. Thich Nhat Hanh explains things that are so simple for us to understand, but hard to remember when your passions are involved. Amazing book."},{"Title":"Teachings on Love","review":"This talk is simple, yet deeply wise. I have listened to many, many talks and teachings about the spiritual path and this is by far the most useful and the most healing. Not only are the precepts which he outlines, practical, effective and healing, but the sound of his voice is truly a healing presence in itself. I have my own copy, I gave my son a copy (he's 21) and I also gave a copy to my partner. I have explored various spiritual paths and would not consider myself a buddhist, but can't image these teachings being foreign to anyone who believes that god is a loving and truly compassionate being. I've rated this as five stars but the truth is it's off the star chart."},{"Title":"Teachings on Love","review":"My husband bought me this book for our 10th wedding anniversary. It was one of the best gifts I've ever received. It speaks to the reader in a very personal way. It makes one believe that with love for all beings, we can achieve peace.

It never gets old, I always hear something new. I prefer to listen to him over reading, initially because listening bypasses my dyslexia. But deeply understanding Ong Thich is more easily achieved through the magic of his voice than through the written (and edited) word. He puts me in a trance and I absorb more than mere concepts. In my opinion an audio recording of his work read by anyone else, and they're out there, is a waste of time and money. When you hear his voice you know he is speaking to you."},{"Title":"Teachings on Love","review":"Great book, fast delivery, and service.

I have read many of the more recent books and lots of books for fussy eaters. This book will have just as good advice and ideas for feeding and great background material too. Some of the material is dated, of course, such as the warnings on environmental hazards, many which have since been addressed. Formula, while still an inferior choice to breastmilk is better now than it was (not being judgemental as I had to supplement with formula and then only formula, but know it is second choice!). Also, the dangers of soy, especially to children are not addressed as that research was limited at that time and is only now become widely known. Also, reasons to avoid baby foods are somewhat outdated as one can now buy healthy babyfood. however, nothing is as healthy as feeding them homemade, fresh baby food!Anyway, good book with recipes, including meat, background information, tips for fussy eaters and great advice. Would not make it the only book as more recent research and advice is available but for the most part is as good if not better than more recent books and will be a deal at the low cost! Just remember to research the dangers of soy and add that to your information when beginning to feed baby as well as the rest of the family (especially if fertility problems!)."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead: What a Long, Strange Trip: The Stories Behind Every Song 1965-1995","review":"Pete Townsend of The Who, after playing on the same bill with the Dead at a two-day festival, made an observation that partially sums up the very existence of those known as &quot;Deadheads&quot;. He said &quot;They played two 3-hour sets and didn't repeat a song; we played the same set we've been doing for the last 6 years&quot;. The Dead had a hefty catalog of songs (of course,they also performed excellent cover versions of others' tunes). This book is a fan's dream because it is a compilation of original songs with historical/anecdotal/interpretive background information on each selection. As any appreciator of the band knows, Jerry Garcia collaborated with poet/songwriter Robert Hunter on the majority of Dead originals; Hunter keeps company with the likes of Bob Dylan in anybody's list of great American rock pen-wielders.Dead guitarist Bob Weir wrote many songs performed by the band with long-time friend and cyber-genius John Barlowe. The beauty of Grateful Dead songs is their double-edged nature; yes, &quot;Casey Jones&quot; is based on a real train conductor and a real train wreck (Americana!), but the writers weave their own experience and ambiguous view of life into the song.Simply stated, the songs are deceptively DEEP - deep in meaning and deep in the soil of the American experience. Don't look for this book to explain what every song meant (that's for you to ponder, Hunter would say). However, there is invaluable and often just fun background (i.e.the Altamont tragedy and &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot;; the staccato rhythmn of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; being loosely based on the sound made by a pump on Mickey Hart's ranch). Pick this book up, even if you only have a few minutes, turn to any page, and be enlightened and entertained."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead: What a Long, Strange Trip: The Stories Behind Every Song 1965-1995","review":"I had been periodically browsing Dodds' Annotated Lyrics website, when I realized I needed more.

As a result it was turgid and difficult reading.Stephan Khinoy has made an excellent new translation. The text flows freely, and is much more understandable. Given that this is the fundamental book on epee, this is to be commended.This isn't to say that there aren't flaws in the book. Epee has moved on since the original publication, and some of the sections look a little old fashioned. This is mitigated by Khinoy's editorial interspersions which present the modern style. This slightly negative comment should not detract from the fact that this book is unrivalled in its treatement of the weapon, and should be read by all epeeists and their coaches."},{"Title":"Epee Fencing","review":"Imre Vass's book on Epee fencing is probably one of the finest books that one could read on the subject. While Vass learned and studied Epee fencing in Hungary, under the very heavy influence of Russian at times, it still shows a system of fencing that is strongly founded in modern competitive fencing and has many practical applications. So, any student of Epee can learn about this fencing system.Vass primarily lays the book out in a series of chapters on different elements of fencing. Moving from discussions on target areas and engagements of the blade, there is a wide variety of topics that are covered. The material is well laid out, and comprehensive in nature, with some talk by the author of the value of different actions and his thoughts on what an Epee fencer should be doing.However, this is not a book for the faint of heart. For the starting Epeeist, this may be a very difficult read. Especially when there are discussions of drills and the training. For the intermediate or advanced Epeeist, or a coach, this is an excellent source for practicing fencing and designing new drills to perform. Plus is helps to consider this as a way to analyze one's own fencing.This book is primarily geared to the competitive fencer, so it does mean that there is some discussion about actions that would be more present in competitive fencing and not historical fencing. So, this book may not appeal to some people. Likewise, because of Vass's Hungarian style, this may also not appeal to those in the competitive circuit if it doesn't fit with your style of fencing. That being said, as someone who appreciate Bruce Lee's views on the martial arts (taking a little bit of something from everything), one can incorporate some of the concepts and learn from them.Overall, if you can find a copy of this book (it is very difficult to find, and I had trouble finding a second copy for a friend of mine), it is an excellent resource to have on your shelf."},{"Title":"Epee Fencing","review":"I agree, generally, with the three previous reviewers of this book. However, I strongly disagree with the author's statements in the Introduction concerning foil as being the basis for epee fencing. Vass insists that the fencer should have a solid grounding in foil before beginning to fence with the epee. He goes on to state that it should take about five years before the fencer has shifted over only 50% from foil to epee. Absurd; it does not make sense first to learn foil and then to spend years unlearning it while converting to epee. There are essential differences between epee and foil: in epee fencing the entire body is fair target, while in foil it is only the torso, and while foil is governed by the right-of-way convention (fencers will know what I mean), in epee the first hit counts, with no regard for convention.Epee fencing has changed over the years. Vass concentrates on technique, and techniques have changed since he wrote his book. The classical styles and schools of the past have been replaced almost completely by a much more athletic game in which speed, strength, movement, and opportunism count as much or more than sophisticated technique. The great change began in about 1960, when the hemispherical barbed point, which would catch on the opponent's sleeve even if the attacker's blade was almost parallel to his opponent's arm, was replaced by the flat point, modified a couple of years later to have a chamfered edge. The old point made touches easier, and it was the cautious, patient, accurate fencer who often prevailed. The newer point, introduced for safety reasons, usually requires that the hit be at a greater angle. While in the past most touches were made on the arm, now a greater proportion are made on the body. Of course basic technique and point accuracy still count, but even the stance of today's epee fencers, quite different from, and looser than, the classical style is indicative of the changes in the game.Vass's treatment of the weapon is the most comprehensive that I have encountered in a book, but the best fundamental understanding of epee fencing and how it differs from foil is to be found in \\"Modern Fencing\\", by Clovis Deladrier. Even though that book was written half a century ago, Deladrier's insights still apply. Deladrier correctly understood the epee to be completely different from foil and saber, with its own action and reaction. To aspiring epee fencers, I say do not waste too much time on foil; it will be detrimental to your epee game.Vass's exhaustive explication of technique, with so many combinations and permutations, can be daunting even to the experienced epee fencer, but there is always more to learn, and so I recommend it."},{"Title":"Epee Fencing","review":"One of the first things that attracted me to this book was the fact that it was an honest-to-goodness book about epee fencing. The majority of fencing books that I have read have put more emphasis on foil. Although it can be a little tough to slog through reading-wise (I had some problems, doesn't mean everyone will), Epee Fencing: A Complete System, is extraordinary in the amount of detail presented.

It includes a lot of insightful information on what different parts of the Epic represent in terms of the Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations. For the most part, she uses Alexander Heidel's translation of the epic for her observations. The only weakness of this book as far as I am concerned, is that it was put together after the author's death, and much of it is clearly based on her lectures.

The parallels Ms. Kluger is able to draw with the Bible afford much insight into the dynamics of the religious experience and the evolution of the collective consciousness mirrored in it.The poetry of this very old text is beautiful at times. Throughout the reading I was also touched by the deep warmth and humility of the author; I would have loved to know her personally and attend her lectures. I won't fail to read her other works.

Hintlian set out more than four years ago to preserve for the ages the contribution of the workers whose daily toil would otherwise be forgotten when the last concret was poured and the Big Dig was finally finished.But Digging is far, far more than an ambitious work of documentary photography. For the more time Hintlian spent in the bowels of the earth beneath Boston, the more he seems to have realized what a surrealistic undertaking the Big Dig is, and the more surrealistic his work became. The traditional documentary photographer who initially donned workboots and warm winter gear to negotiate the mud of what was then the world's largest construction site, morphed over the years into an art photographer, a surrealist art photographer.For the images that fill the pages of digging include the workers of Boston's Big Dig, but they include them as part of compositions whose beauty has more to do with light and shadow, with the interplay of shapes and forms, and with irony and the juxtaposition of objects and formss, than it does to do with workers and their tasks.Digging: The Workers of Boston's Big Dig is a work of documentary photography, and it is a tribute to the men who dug the Big Dig. But it is also a work of photography as fine art. And as such it is not to be missed by anyone who cares about either documentary photography, or the art of photography."},{"Title":"Digging: The Workers of Boston's Big Dig","review":"The \\"Big Dig\\" in Boston is the largest construction task ever to be undertaken by mankind, surpassing that of the building of the Panama Canal. Michael Hintlian's ongoing committment to document the work of the Big Dig has yielded powerful photographs, which appear in Digging.

The only way a person can truly improve at writing is to write, not sit around and read about writing.

I had first herd of Ursula here on Amazon.com when I read through the Hugo and Nebula award listings. As her work was behind a number of those, figured reading some of it was well worth a try. I picked the planet of exile out, from the library, as it was the thinnest there. I thought it would be enough to just get the taste of Ursula's style of writing. My first impressions were not that great. As a matter of fact, I found the book to be very boring and hard to read. Of course, I had just finished Clark's &quot;The city and the stars&quot;, and my expectations from this other great SF author were pretty much down the same epic-far-in-the-future-undertakings-using-supreme-technology line of Clark's book. Ursula was far from that. Her work featured much less a gadget-full and more of a fantasy-barbaric setting. This was a major setback at first, but when I toned down on my expectations and accepted the book for what it was, and what it had to offer; I found it to be very pleasant and even delightful to read. Ursula talks about a distant future in which mankind has reached the stars and united many worlds in an organization known as the League. The League dispatches colonies onto alien planets where they judge on the option of entry of the world into the League. However, a colony of humans remains stranded on an alien world, as the spacecraft they came in leaves in haste to aid the League, in a war that has ensued far away. The planet itself is very peculiar as one Year lasts 24000 days (c. 65 years), making only one season last 15+ years! Ursula masterfully explores the impact of these awkward time patterns on the life of local hominoid species. She paints a vivid image of their culture with a remarkable wholeness, achieved through incorporating various traditions and rituals, and even such little things as formal speech patterns. The same is done with the culture of the humans left on the planet (christened the &quot;farborn&quot;). Besides delving deep in the particulars of the two cultures, Ursula also does an excellent job in exploring the interaction between them. In these hypothetical explorations is her aptness clearly noticeable and they were what I found the most intriguing and delightful in the novel. Overall a great book that I liked very much; I warmly recommend &quot;The planet of exile&quot; to anybody that is wondering whether to read it or not. You might not like it at first, but give it a chance. I did, and I can tell you for sure that the next book I'm taking out of the library is definitely going to be another work by Ursula Le Guin."},{"Title":"Planet of Exile","review":"I started reading the Three Hainish Novels on a lark, thinking I'd get some kicks out of seeing what world building here spawned \\"Left Hand of Darkness\\". If Rocannon's World was a colt finding out it had four legs, then Planet of Exile is a full grown dog unleashed bolting after a squirrel. This novel was incredibley focused. The characters, though from 3 fictional cultures, were truer than some literary fiction I've read. While I found her depictions of her male heroes be a little...well..heroic? sometimes...infused with too much NPR like soul...the male hero of this was downright arrogant and flawed. A bravura depiction for LeGuin..The world building was subtley executed, and logistically true- a nomadic people preparing their winter harvest,and an exiled group of wordly galactic citizens must defend themselves against a planet's lengthy winter and the resulting barbarian hordes. A love story between members of the two groups threads LeGuin's main sci-fi element: telepathy. I find her recurrent use of these pretty intriguing, and so would anybody else who repeatedly picks up their cell phone one second before the phone rings.I haven't read many serious reviews of LeGuin's works but a really notable factor here is that time and time again the heros are Earth descendants with black skin. Right on LeGuin. I love when an author takes a second to tweak the details like that, to twist it away from our normal ethnocentric assumptions, espescially when its science fiction.It's just shocking that this is her EARLY work. It's so spot on.Definite recommendation."},{"Title":"Planet of Exile","review":"The Planet of Exile is a masterful piece of fantasy/science fiction world building for Ursula LeGuin spins her story, worlds, cultures, and animosities in flawless fashion. The planet of Werel has 15 year winters and a 60 earth year year. The planets inhabitants are called Hilfs (Highly intelligent life forms) by the humans stranded on the planet (their ship had left in a struggle with mysterious invaders). The Hilfs, before every 15 year winter collect food and build Winter Cities on the ruins of previous cities and prepare to defend themselves from the nomadic raiders who migrate south to avoid the winter and who live by the pillaging and raiding. The humans' population, who have been on the planet for 600 years, is declining and no longer can defend themselves and because of this attempt to enter into an alliance with the Hilfs against the nomads from the north who have without precedent banded together to capture the region. Rolery, a Hilf women, falls in love with the leader of the humans, Agat, and this brings massive tension to the alliance.What I have always found so amazing about all of LeGuin's work is her world building skills. The culture of both sides can be inferred from gestures, word phrases, actions, and description. She also employs delicately the racial animosities between the groups, again to illustrates the concepts and ideals of each culture, who have remained different despite living in close proximity for 600 years. Without giving away important aspects of the story many ideas of the League (the organization humans that accidentally left the men stranded on the planet)in contacting less technologically progressed races is similar to the rules of first contact in Star Trek. This is primarily a fantasy novel with a science fiction backdrop. The reader is immediately drawn into both societies struggles and deep melancholy befalls you when tragedy strikes. LeGuin's human characters are artfully created and feel and act as humans and her created cultures fill her created worlds perfectly. I can think of no higher praise in the writing of social science fiction."},{"Title":"Planet of Exile","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.Planet of Exile is a novel in Ursula Le Guin's HAINISH CYCLE and one of the author's first published books. In this story, a colony of humans has been stranded for many years on the planet Werel, which has such a long orbit around its sun that one year is like 60 Earth years. These humans, gently led by Jakob Agat, live in a city surrounded by a stone wall. Because of the conditions on Werel, especially the effect of its sun's radiation on human genes, their colony is dwindling. The humans share the planet with two other humanoid species. They have no contact with the Gaal, a nomadic tribe, and they have a tense but sometimes cooperative relationship with the Tevarans.The planet is moving into its harsh winter phase, which will last about 15 years. Usually when this happens the nomadic Gaal pass by the human city on their way south. But this year there is a rumor that the Gaal do not plan to migrate, but rather to conquer the humans and Tevarans and take their cities for themselves. Jakob Agat hopes the humans and Tevarans can set aside their differences and suspicions and work together to defeat the Gaal. But when he falls in love with Rolery, granddaughter of the Tevaran leader, tensions flare.If you're familiar with Ursula Le Guin's work, I recommend reading Planet of Exile -- it's interesting to see how this excellent writer got her start. However, if you're new to Le Guin, don't start here. Her later work is so much better. In Planet of Exile, her world-building and character development has already improved from what we saw in Rocannon's World, the first of the HAINISH CYCLE books, but it still lacks the vividness of her later works. For example, Jakob's and Rolery's love-at-first-sight relationship has no substance to it. I never felt it and wasn't convinced that Jakob and Rolery felt it either.Perhaps this is because Le Guin's main interest in these HAINISH novels isn't to tell a love story, but to use science fiction to explore cultural anthropological themes. This is something that she also does better in later novels. Here, as in Rocannon's World, her races and cultures seem too unnaturally distinct and isolated to be living so close together on the same planet.I have to say that if Planet of Exile wasn't written by Ursula Le Guin, I probably wouldn't recommend it at all, but I love Le Guin's prose and I find it fascinating to compare her earlier and later works. I think that most of her fans will feel the same way. Planet of Exile is short and simple -- an easy read. Again, if you're not a fan yet, don't start here; I suggest starting with THE EARTHSEA CYCLE or ANNALS OF THE WESTERN SHORE.I listened to Blackstone Audio's version read by the excellent Steven Hoye and Carrington MacDuffie. This was a very nice production. All of the HAINISH CYCLE books are available on audio. Each of them can stand alone, so you don't have to read them in any particular order, but Planet of Exile acts as a prequel to City of Illusions. I'll be reading that one soon.Planet of Exile -- (1966) The Earth colony of Landin has been stranded on Werel for ten years, and ten of Werel's years are over 600 terrestrial years, and the lonely and dwindling human settlement is beginning to feel the strain. Every winter, a season that lasts for 15 years, the Earthmen have neighbors: the humanoid hilfs, a nomadic people who only settle down for the cruel cold spell. The hilfs fear the Earthmen, whom they think of as witches and call the farborns. But hilfs and farborns have common enemies: the hordes of ravaging barbarians called gaals and eerie preying snow ghouls. Will they join forces or be annihilated?"},{"Title":"Planet of Exile","review":"A group of humans is left stranded on an alien world.

Mosely's form in Impossible Object is extremely interesting because of how intertwined the stories are--characters reappear, images recur, and narrators are constantly positing on what exactly constitutes love. When you're finished reading the book you could very well wonder if it is really a short story collection or a loosely-stitched novel. You can decide. Whatever it is, I really enjoyed the book and think that Mosley is a fine writer who deserves a larger audience. Sometimes the characters are a bit on the undercharacterized side--making them a little vague and mildly uninteresting--but Mosley's prose makes up for that easily. The first line of his short story, &quot;Life After Death&quot; is a good example of the unique vision Mosley captures in his text, &quot;Walking through streets late at night I saw a crack in the sky and a red arm coming through with the fist clenched like a foetus.&quot; It's pretty hard to walk away from a line like that--not exactly your usual sunrise. Very refreshing."},{"Title":"Impossible Object","review":"I was left with a sense of confusion after reading this book.

Although advertised as a novel (and it IS a novel) it reads as a collection of short stories. Connected, yet so unique in style and substance they are initially recognizable as a narrative theme rather than a cohesive story, it is only in the end that the characters and storylines are shown to be the same throughout the work. This is a novel of multiple episodes, captured by multiple narrators, all attempting to come to terms with the impossibility of idealized, romantic love.The narrative follows the arc of romantic love experienced by someone who initially thinks he has lost it: a man envies the idealized love his older son seems to have for a village girl; a couple's marriage slides into battle and guilt as their romance evolves into routine; a couple's apathy towards one another paves the way for infidelity; an outsider gives a sympathetic view of an affair from start to apparent finish; an impromptu love/lust is quickly distilled to base elements of jealousy, control, and selfishness; a man contemplates suicide after losing both his wife and his \\"true\\" love; a man takes a coward's approach to the aftermath of his adultery; and an affair rekindled by an illegitimate birth ends tragically.This is not an easy read: multiple narrative voices are (intentionally?) confusing; some of the language is absurd and disjointed, matching the mindset of the principal actors; interconnected existentialist interludes deal with God's place in a world struggling to forget him, become increasingly unhinged, and finally close the novel with by explaining its initial intent; there are multiple references to Neitsche, what he thought, and why he went crazy. Despite its struggle in pieces, it is excellent in the whole. This is a very fine book which runs circles around current reflections on the same topic.

After much searching in the past 5 I was overjoyed at it's re-release.

The creatures created by Eckert are reminiscent of the fantasy epics &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Never Ending Story.&quot; The book is as fantastical now as it was waaaaaay back in grade school.

On board are Flavia, Nubia, Jonathan and Lupus joined by Bato, one of the magistrates of Ostia, and Marcus Valerius Flaccus (a poet and future author of a version of the Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece) and his personal slave. Of course, Captain Geminus is at the helm but is a bit reluctant to bring the children along.They are tracking a ship called the Medea (a good choice of name since Medea killed her children) and sail to Corinth, where the ship is hauled over the isthmus, and on to Rhodes without finding anyone who has heard of the ship. Along the way some accidents occur on board ship that convince the four friends that someone wants to prevent them from completing their quest. Presumably the saboteur is working for the elusive criminal behind the slave trade in kidnapped children - someone only know as the colossus. No one knows who this mastermind is but he has spies everywhere.Along the way, the Delphina passes the island of Symi where Lupus and his family lived. He is anxious to return to the island but Flavia is determined to find and free the children first. This creates some tension between the characters and not only do they have to worry about a saboteur when a storm blows up that threatens the safety of their ship. And if the ship makes it in one piece to Rhodes, how will they defeat the colossus?This is a very entertaining volume with vivid descriptions of Greece and the island of Rhodes where the ancient wonder - the Colossus of Rhodes - stood before being toppled in an earthquake. Caroline Lawrence also describes sailing in the ancient world with nice detail, and she provides a diagram of the Delphina along with a route map. This is an excellent adventure and provides a wealth of information."},{"Title":"Colossus of Rhodes","review":"Caroline Lawrence outdid herself in creating these histicly accurate, fictitious, adventures for children and youth. Both girls and boys will love finding a character they can relate to. They are wonderful read aloud books, or about 4th or 5th grade and up silent reading material. As Flavia, Nubia, Johnathan and Lupas travel through different parts of the Roman empire in about 79AD, we learn many things about Roman History and culture. This book actually takes them on a trip through the Greek Isles to break a ring of slave traders who kidnap free born children and sell them into slavery.While I highly reccomend this book, I do think it would be helpful to read the series in order. There is so much character development that takes place in the preceeding books."},{"Title":"Colossus of Rhodes","review":"We love these books in my house because they are very believable and my kids get so involved in them they don't want to put them down.

That's what makes it real to them."},{"Title":"Colossus of Rhodes","review":"The Colossus of Rhodes, is yet another great novel written by Caroline Lawrence. Lupus now owns a ship and he has given it to Flavia's father the sea captain so he can go on one of his voyages to Rhodes so he can more more money by bringing stuff back to Ostia. While on the ship, the four friends, Nubia, Lupus,Jonathan,Flavia, discover that children are being kidnapped and taken to Rhodes where they are headed. Lupus is very interested in this and when fate brings him back to his home where he thought his mother would be, he has to make a choice between two things; both depending on him.This is a thrilling adventure book and I would recommend it to anyone. It is very well done!"},{"Title":"Colossus of Rhodes","review":"The ninth book in \\"The Roman Mysteries\\" proves that this series just keeps getting better and better. Four young children living in 80 AD solve mysteries that make the most of the historical context in order to shape the plots. Caroline Lawrence's research is thorough, her prose clear and descriptive, and her protagonists imminently likeable. Long story short, this is a fantastic series of books for any young readers interested in history, adventure, or sound coming-of-age narratives.Roman Flavia, Jewish Jonathan, African Nubia and Greek Lupus are catching up with some unfinished business. A previous book dealt with the uncovering of a slave-ring in which children were kidnapped from their homes and transported to Greece. Now Flavia's father is captaining Lupus's very own vessel, sailing to Greece in the hopes of catching up with the ship suspected of transporting the missing children. Lupus - the tongueless ex-slave and his friends are also aboard, eager to help in the hunt for the slave traders.But Lupus a secret plan of his own. Secretly he longs to find his mother, from whom he was separated when slavers killed his father and cut out his own tongue before taking him to Ostia. Now Lupus prays that his mother is waiting for him on the isle of Symis. Despite the voyage beginning with a few dark omens, everyone is optimistic that their mission will be successful.Of course, it's never that easy. Nubia is terrified on board the ship, haunted by memories of her own slavery, and Jonathan is still suffering some ill-effects from his stint as a gladiator. They hear contradictory rumors of the dangerous slave-trader who is master-minding the kidnappings, and Nubia can't shake the feeling that there's a traitor on board. It all accumulates in Lupus being forced to make a terrible decision at the climax of the story, one that's sure to get your heart pounding and perhaps even call up a few tears.Lawrence captures the excitement of sea travel, particularly for four youngsters who have never experienced it before, with enough intrigue and danger at work to make it a compulsive read. At the same time, she doesn't shy away from the grim reality of the slave-trade and the horrific conditions endured by two of our heroes - yet interestedly, she also adheres to the moral values of the time. The Romans are horrified at the thought of free-born children being taken as slaves, but naturally, they do not think the existence of slavery is inherently evil. It provides a potential discussion point for young readers, especially as Lawrence points out in her afterword that the slave-trade is still alive and well in many parts of the world.There is a bit of disconnect between this book and his predecessor. At the conclusion ofThe Gladiators from Capua, Jonathan discovered that his parents were alive and reunited, but here the aftermath of that revelation is skipped in order to get straight to their latest adventure (not to mention that fact that Jonathan is leaving his mother so soon after finding her does not quite ring true). Still, this is really Lupus's book and his story is certainly a page-turner. I get the sense that this was an important book for Flavia as well: she's still rather boy-crazy, but here she begins to learn that to make judgments on first-impressions is not the wisest course.The book's namesake, the Colossus at Rhodes is used in an innovative action-sequence, and the relationship between the children and their slow-but-steady growth toward adulthood gains another level of poignancy and strength. With familiar faces from previous books, and plenty of threads left over to be picked up in the future, \\"The Colossus of Rhodes\\" is another fantastic installment in this equally fantastic series. Don't miss any of them!"},{"Title":"The freedom of life,","review":"A nearly forgotten New Thought writer, once I discovered the straight talking Annie Payson Call, I was hooked!

Instead, she advises you to keep your heart and eye on the goal of enlightenment, transcendance, being a good Christian and making it to Heaven, whatever your spiritual path, what ever you might call it.

In each geographical section, the authors describe the natural and historic draws, as well as give directions, cite a few restaurants and hotels (with prices). Very helpful for someone who is not very familiar with the area.The thing I really liked about this book was it explained wildlife and history of the Bay region well, as well as explain the delicate environmental state of the Bay in the last 100 years.

I find myself going back to it often."},{"Title":"Longstreet Highroad Guide to the Chesapeake Bay (Longstreet Highroad Coastal Guides)","review":"Getting inside the mind of Deane Winegar is like going on an expedition. In this case, in and around the Chesapeake Bay--a unique, large body of water and land mass.Let me give you a sampling of her approach throughout this handsome, well-organized book:Page 7: \\"Approximately 75 percent of organic material on earth is produced by phytoplankton [algae, for example]. If the phytoplankton should crash, the entire chain of life would crumble....\\" And what would cause the crash? It is all that residue from those farms, factories and home owners' lawns in the lands that feed the bay. All the way from Cooperstown, New York and many miles east and west.Page 14: \\"Loss of habitat, sedimentation, dredging, disease, oxygen-robbing nutrients, and over-harvesting have reduced this important bivalve [oyster] to less than one percent of its historic numbers.\\"Page 15: Did you know that the abdominal shell covering of a crab is called an \\"apron\\"--and it's one way to determine its sex; the claws are another.Winegar's CHESAPEAKE BAY is like a travel log. This book was published in 2000 and researched before that (11-12 years ago), some of the information can be found on today's computer engines and websites--and some of that will be more up-to-date. But you most likely will not learn about the interesting nooks and crannies which the author has uncovered for the simply- and more-adventurous. And all this information will not be delivered in a slick commercial-style language, but a comfortable I've-experienced-it conversational tone. In other words, she takes you there. And it's motivation that's hard to resist.Her book breaks up the Eastern and Western Shores of the Chesapeake Bay into explorable areas, going clock-wise from Virginia Beach, through northern Maryland to the two Virginia counties on the Eastern Shore. Most areas of interest have the following indispensible information: directions, activities and their dates, local eateries, fees, facilities, closest towns, lodgings, interesting and varied gardens and museums, conservancies, phone numbers, and more. In addition, here's a real plus: Most often you will discover the fascinating history of the places and events.Finally, although the personal, on-ground research for this volume was done up to 12 years ago, this is NOT a \\"dated\\" book. I know that since my family history is rooted in the Eastern Shore. After all, how much of the natural areas, flora and fauna and events have really changed in only a decade--new technology aside? Winegar's CHESAPEAKE BAY is equal to her award-winning co-written book on the Virginia Mountains; that is, this is a real winner, too, in this reader's mind."},{"Title":"Longstreet Highroad Guide to the Chesapeake Bay (Longstreet Highroad Coastal Guides)","review":"This is a gem.

I'm amazed with the thoroughness of the research that went into this \\"magnum opus.\\" It makes me want to take a month off and just explore some of the natural wonders of the Chesapeake Bay she describes. Can the real thing match the paradise she created?"},{"Title":"I'll Cry Tomorrow","review":"My mother found this book on her shelf and &quot;couldn't put it down.&quot; Although I am a little young to remember Lillian Roth's dramatic rise and fall as a Broadway then Hollywood star, her story about addiction to alcohol and drugs and men, and then her recovery through AA in its very first years is as familiar as could be written today. (The memoir was a best seller in its time and made into a movie that was highly successful). Lillian Roth has an engaging voice as a writer, although she does not seem to realize or want to realize that her prototypical &quot;stage Mom&quot; led her directly into the lion's jaws at age five, leaving the child alone to be molested on her first modeling job. But then again, early AA stressed taking responsibility for one's own actions, not blaming others, and Ms. Roth is very determined to blame no one but herself and her disease. I think that anyone interested in addiction and recovery, as well as the early days of New York theatre and Hollywood would enjoy this well-written book. It seems that not that much has changed in the world of child and teen stars."},{"Title":"I'll Cry Tomorrow","review":"Back in the early fifties celebrities did not tell much that was real about themselves in books or magazine articles. Everyone mostly told how wonderful, beautiful, talented and gifted they were. Flaws were not written about. Anything that their publicists and studio didn't want known about them was brushed under the rug.So when Lillian Roth wrote a tell all, flaws and all, it became a runaway bestseller. I recall reading the book shortly after it was published in 1954 and like so many people I found it was riveting, most revealing and seemed so very honest. Much of it, at that time, seemed shocking. Here was a lovely and very talented woman who made it to the top in New York and Hollywood. She had it all and lost it all!Lillian Roth wrote in vivid detail about the spiraling effect that alcohol had on her career and on her life. It seems so honest and poignant. She speaks of the horrors of many of her relationships and marriages. She writes of how several husbands used her and abused her and took her for as much as they could.The bestselling book was made into a very good film starring the beautiful and wonderful Susan Hayward as Miss Roth. The film was a good recreation of the book, but left out many of the details.After the success of the book and the film Miss Roth was able to revitalize her career. She once more appeared on the Broadway stage (70 Girls 70, I Can Get It for You Wholesale), did lots of nitery work, recorded albums, did TV (including Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Red Skelton and Ed Sullivan shows) and did a few more film roles. She also toured in Funny Girl as Fanny Brice's mother.This is a really heartbreaking story of a very gifted young woman who hit the heights and then plummeted all the way down to skid row, all by her own hand. And also with the help of a stage mother and some very bad marriages her tale is not a Cinderella story, but a real tragedy.Although the book was written more than 55 years ago, it is a solid read. Those interested in show business history might really get something from this very well written book."},{"Title":"I'll Cry Tomorrow","review":"This is one of the great books of all time. Maybe not to the average reader, but to us alcoholics who went thru the same hell as Lillian Roth did. This book and the movie version starring that great actress's Susan Hayward saved my life. This movie brought me to Alcoholics Anonymous. I cannot write anymore without writing my own story, so I'll close here. Thank you."},{"Title":"I'll Cry Tomorrow","review":"We view Ms. Roth as at the top of her game until tragedy struck with the untimely death of her fiance. It was with the passing of David Treadman, that Ms. Roth's life took such a fast, downward spiral to one of degradation, humiliation and torture, while she gained solace through the bottle.We see a life depicted of complete dominance by her mother, Katie. We see her running away from herself with a series of fast, ill-fated marriages with the men in her lives who took advantage of her torment.The book is inspirational as it shows Ms. Roth's climb back from this torture with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.This 1953 book was made into a 1955 film starring Susan Hayward, Jo Van Fleet, Richard Conte, Eddie Albert, Ray Danton, and others. While the factual information is different from the book to the movie, Hayward, Van Fleet, Conte, Albert and Danton totally capture the people they portrayed with vivid, memorable portrayals.-Submitted by Ed Greenspan-aka Phil Greenberg of Gentleman's Agreement (1947) fame."},{"Title":"I'll Cry Tomorrow","review":"The book shows the sruggles with alcohol.

Was she really that stupid?"},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"Unlike many other books on Chechnya, this one offers a unique ethnographic account and analysis of this war and of what preceded it. Although very academic, it offers 'direct voices' of Chechens (mostly) that either suffered the war or have escaped it and now live elsewhere. The book does not attempt to glorify or condemn either side but, on the contrary, demonstrates how hawkish parties in both Moscow and Grozny have committed acts of political shortsightedness that dragged the country into war.While this book is not going to satisfy anyone whose opinion has already been formed, especially anyone who views this conflict in terms of a small brave nation fighting against an imperial monster, it is more scientific and balanced than any other book that exists on this subject in English. It also takes a stab at Western preconcieved notions such as a failure to recognize ethnic cleansing of Chechnya in 1991-94 when the city of Grozny has been cleansed of non-Chechens who were forced to leave the republic or killed, their appartnments having been taken by the militants.In short, this book will please you if you are looking for a balanced account or if you have an open mind and are not already set in condemning the Russians. After all, these are Chechen voices too."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"Following the tide of change that resulted in the breakup of the Soviet Union, the people of Chechnya proclaimed their independence in November 1991. Inevitably, many events took place between the newly formed nation and the Russian Federation, leading to the invasion of Chechnya by Russian troops in early December of 1994. A conflict that Anatol Lieven, the author of Chechnya: Tombstone Of Russian Power, has referred to as \\"the greatest epics of colonial resistance of the past century\\". Thus, for the next ten years, one bloody war after another reduced a thriving country to rubble; the Chechens enduring unimaginable suffering with no end in sight. To date, the struggle for self-determination has somehow, develop into an \\"Islamic\\" guerrilla war. Chechnya: Life In A War-Torn Society is not an account of the war; rather it is a reflection on a Chechen society forced into a never-ending, cruel and traumatizing war. The author of this scholarly text, Valery Tishkov, is currently the director of the Institute of Ethnography and Anthropology at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Therefore, his views on the conflict can be deemed authoritative and to some extent, biased.In the first five chapters, the author seeks for the answer by explaining the historical context of events such as Stalin's atrocious deportation of the Chechens to the lifeless steppes of Kazakhstan during World War II, which the Chechens suffered in silence, undoubtedly created bitterness in their memories. Yet he asserts that it is not a reason for the unending conflict. Nor, according to Tishkov, do ethnic, tribal, or religious disparities explain the tragedy of this war. Tishkov however places the core of the problem in the early stage of Boris Yeltsin's presidency when rivalries between factions paralyzed the operations of the government in dealing with the Chechen crisis. He perceives the bloodshed as the result of unresponsiveness and puzzlements on the Russian leaders when the Chechen crisis first emerged and the reluctance to deal with General Dzhokhar Dudayev, whom the author introduces in chapter six, while the situation is still in control. All through the book, Tishkov observes the first war and its aftermath through the eyes of fifty-four Chechens whom he and his associates interviewed at length. These \\"informers\\" have infused his account of the war with an exclusive directness and subtlety. Their recollections offer a distinctive ethnographic description and analysis of the war, the outcome, and what precipitated it.According to the survivors and Tishkov, the Chechens success in the first war can be attributed to the use of \\"guerrilla warfare\\", with tactics such as ambushes and attacks on the enemy's lines of communication which the author of Resisting Rebellion, Anthony J. Joes, stated as one of the vital strategy for insurgents to succeed. Tishkov goes on to express his admiration for the Chechen fighters' ability to overcome the psychological fear and intimidation and master the techniques of guerrilla warfare. Nevertheless, in chapter seven, when they staged and recorded their attacks, Tishkov portrays the exhibitionist behavior of the Chechen fighters as acts of terrorism. The author fails to realize that it is one of the ways that terrorists can get their objectives across to a wider audience. In his book Terror In The Mind Of God: The Global Rise Of Religious Violence, Mark Juergensmeyer, the noted sociologist and the Director of Global and International Studies, explains it as a theater that terrorists use to conduct terror for their audiences whom they are trying to terrorize. Yet, Tishkov fails to mention the atrocities that Russian troops committed on the Chechens that provoked the situation in the first place. On the aspect of religious, from chapter eleven to the rest of the book, Tishkov emphasizes the negative influences of Arab outsiders in the conflict, such as the al-Qaeda terrorist's network, whom he feels is using Chechnya as a stage determined to turn it into another Islamic state similar to the Taliban of Afghanistan. Tishkov's Chechnya: Life In A War-Torn Society is a recommended book since it does not try to venerate or condemn either side of the conflict but to expose how the war-monger parties in both Moscow and Grozny have made the erroneous political decisions that brought war to the Chechens and terrors to the citizens of Russia. Last but not least, the reader of this book must approach it with an open mind and not to form their judgments prematurely. Such as, in the view of some Westerners, the conflict is being about a small brave nation fighting against an imperial monster, or, in the view of Russia, an armed coup d'etat in Chechnya led by General Dudayev, resulting in the rise of an aggressive paramilitary regime that challenged both the Russian state and its armed forces. Nevertheless, it is a conflict that for Russia, according to Joes, who ranks it as one of the most disastrous counterinsurgent experiences on record, with the full implications of which have yet to manifest themselves."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"This is a very good book about the Chechen War written from the viewpoint of the fighters. Most books on this topic are written by Liberals apologists for terrorism, who sympathise with the rebels and blame Russia for the terrorist acts committed by Chechens. Others are by extreme Conservative Christians who just hate all Muslims. Chechnya went from being a struggle for independence to a Holy Jihad. If you want to hear the real story from the voices of the Chechens, here it is!

Admittedly, I came to Tishkov's work skeptical: he is Russian, after all. For those of us perhaps a little too eager to see local resistances to 'imperial' power and statehood as liberatory struggles, Tishkov engages us in a real marvel of anthropology, teasing apart threads, and questioning assumptions. Like Baiev, albeit in a very different way, Tishkov's professionalism, his belief in the rationalism of the anthropological method, carries this book. It is certainly possible he may have carefully selected and then edited his informants' words, but to what end? Throughout the book I was successively impressed by his unwillingness to engage in \\"a debate over the truths of who did what during the Chechen war.\\" This is not to say that Tishkov avoids pointed commentaries about either Russian hubris or Chechen entrepreneurial violence, but it is to say that he does a profound job in helping his readers understand the precarious nature of war and peace, especially in a cultural climate where \\"even the slightest of differences can be used to justify violence.\\""},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Do? : A Call to Return to the Biblical Gospel","review":"If you find \\"The Way of the Master\\" to be too long, then try this book--especially if you are leading a small group interested in sharing their faith. The author details how Jesus, Paul, the apostles, and John the Baptist used the Law to bring their hearers to repentance and salvation and faith in Christ alone. Like so many of Comfort's excellent books, this one is desperately needed in the American church today where so many are trusting in a false conversion experience."},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Do? : A Call to Return to the Biblical Gospel","review":"My whole life I somewhat tried to live by this phrase, \\"What would Jesus do?\\" I'm sure you've heard it, its a pretty popular saying. But after reading this book I've realized that we don't need to ask ourselves what would He do, but just read the Bible and see what He DID DO!!!! Ray Comfort is a genius and I just bought all his books. He has opened my eyes to so many parts of the Bible. This is a quick easy great read!!! You could read it in 2-4 days and gain so much insight into the life of Jesus. The main point I think is that today most of the churches are like, Jesus Loves You, blah blah blah.. Yes of course He loves you, look what He did for you, but people need to understand why He did what He did and what you need to do to accept what He did. Its not just about living a 'good' life, or just simply being a 'good' person. Jesus said the greatest commandment was loving Him. Most people will say, well I love him. But in our English language the word 'love' is used for many different types of love. In Greek there are many different words for love and the term Jesus used was, agapae (not sure on spelling) but it means a God kind of love, unconditional love no matter what, the same kind of love He has for us. The only way we can love Him that way is if we first accept His love, then and only then could we give a God kind of love back to Him. Love is an action, not a feeling. Does your life show Jesus that you love/agapae Him? Examine yourself, ask for forgiveness, run from your sins the Bible says and transform your life around Christ. The End is near, Hell is real, but I pray that Heaven awaits you.
