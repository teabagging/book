Everyone \\"knows\\" that the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the canal - or did they?McCullough dispels this rumor quite handily - yes, Army men were involved, but they were not acting as members of the army at the time the canal was built; they were acting as civilians.The Path Between the Seas starts with the French involvement (as the title suggests, the book starts 44 years before the canal opened for public use) in the building. For many years, the French toiled and struggled to build a sea-level canal in Panama while the USA simply considered Nicaragua to be a better alternative. McCullough describes the French achievements in great detail, and shows why the French failures were so monumental. After the French decided to abandon the project, the United States purchased the assets of the French company and started the American effort to construct the canal. In my opinion, this is the most exciting part of the book - the transition to the Americans, and the work that was accomplished in such a short period of time.In this abridged version, I believe that too much attention is focused on the French effort (about 70% of the disc time was devoted to the French work and failures). If the presentation was more balanced, this abridgement would be very exciting indeed. This is not the fault of McCullough - undoubtedly the full version of the book is outstanding, as are all of his works, but the abridgment just didn't quite do it for me."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This book was a pleasure to read! Building the Panama Canal today would be a monumental undertaking, even with all of our modern technology. Building it almost a century ago was truly an incredible triumph, not only of engineering, but of political will and human spirit! McCullough weaves all these aspects together in this wonderful history. The story of the first French efforts to build the canal and how America came to acquire the land and pick up the failed French effort is a fascinating tale. This story is interwoven with the story of the perseverance of the men who actually built the canal through dense, blisteringly hot jungle, overcoming weather, terrain, and the everpresent fear of tropical diseases."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Path Between the Seas explains just about everything one could ever possibly want to know about the Panama Canal. You start off by reading about why the canal was needed and learn about the pioneers of the building of the canal. You then read about the French Era which is filled with scandal, lies, and a start to the canal. Then you read about the American Era. The America era is alot more interesting than the French. The American era starts with \\"TR\\" becoming president. The Americans start a Revolution in Panama fight off the misquitos and successfully build a canal in Panama.Thourghout the book you learn about the backround of the men who built the canal and about the life and times not just in Panama but in France and the United States. This is a must read by the award winning David McCullough that anyone interested in engineering, history or just learning new things should read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"What a tale of adventure, intrigue and danger. Engrossing in not just the global implications of actually building the canal and what it meant for the world but the fate of all who were connected to it. The story includes the French connection, the fight against Malaria and medical breakthroughs, scores of deaths from sickness, injury and mudslides, political and financial scandals and a true engineering marvel. David McCullough has done it again. Along with The Great Bridge, this is one of his best works."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is a great book for folks who love the history of technology or politics.But whoever converted this to Kindle format did a lousy job! On the Kindle, typos occur on nearly every page, formatting of quotations is weird, notes appear in-line at the end of each chapter, and captions for images appear on pages by themselves instead of on the page with the matching image (which appears with no caption at all).It seems like the most likely explanation for the problems is a combination of the fact that this book was authored in the pre-digital age, and then apparently nobody proofread it after it was converted."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough is always a fine historian and this is a very interesting book.

David McCullough has written THE definitive history on the roller coaster ride of the creation of the Path Between the Seas. No other author will ever write a better account of it's history. This is a brilliant book, interesting from the first page, right the way to the last - Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I first received the request to review \\"The Path Between the Seas\\" on August 20th. Since that time I have been wading my way through this glob of a book. I did learn how the canal came into existence, but the information was wrapped in page after page of unessential information. The read was too often boring. My guess is that Mr. McCullough wanted to write a lengthy, impressive book. This is not necessarily a lengthy book, and at times it borders on impressive, but the story is told in minute detail. I hate the part of me that won't stop reading a boring book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough's work is a great read about the history of the Panama Canal. It is basically three books rolled into one. The first being about the French effort(and failure)to build the canal. The second, how the Americans became involved after the French failed, and finally how the Americans built the canal. McCullough explains in detail why the French failed, how the Americans acquired(or stole)the land to build the canal, and how the Americans built the canal. McCullough does all of this without an agenda or bias."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I've enjoyed a number of David McCullough's books and this one did not disappoint. He manages to blend history, engineering, and human interest into an incredible epic story. I felt transported into the era and lived the challenges and progress of the making of the canal day by day and month by month. I look forward to my next McCullough book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"To this day the sheer scope of the undertaking of the Panama Canal remains simply astounding. It would be a challenging project with modern technology, which only makes you appreciate the imagination and the inventiveness of the engineers from a hundred years back. That's not to say that it all worked out smoothly, in fact, this book does a wonderful job of documenting the many false starts, failed enterprises, political schemes and machinations, and the engineering challenges along the way. If you're curious about the history, the individuals and the politics behind the project, then this is your book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"No question about it, the building of the Panama Canal was as much a political achievement as a technical one. Politics drove the decision on location of the canal as well as the funding of it, with the latter also mired in corporate scandal during the French effort.\\"The Path Between the Seas\\" is divided roughly into three parts: The French attempt to construct the canal at sea level, the American resumption of construction and change to a lock system, and the more technical aspects of the American design & construction. The last part only comprises some 15% of the narrative and is, in my opinion, insufficiently detailed even for the layman to be considered a comprehensive treatment of the subject. In addition, I echo the point expressed by some reviewers about an inadequate number of maps provided in the book. Roughly half the locations described are nowhere to be found on the two or three maps provided.I really enjoyed reading and learning from this work. Treatments of certain subjects stood out to me as outstanding: The management of tropical diseases in the region and the treatment of the sick. The successful creation by the American government of a basically utopian socialist state among the white canal company staff. The deplorable conditions of the laborers, though broadly considered acceptable at the time.In general though, I prefer history books written in a drier, less embellished style. A good example is Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". It's not a textbook either but yet is narrated in a more detached manner that I found more believable. With McCollough I'm sometimes left wondering how much of the chapter I just read is strictly true, how much was unintentionally embellished from not having sufficient source material, and how much was intentionally exaggerated for effect. I felt that the history of the French effort was somewhat too colorful to be taken at face value, but McCullough's style does improve significantly after that.Overall, it's really good but not fantastic. However, I'm not sure there's a better book for the layman regarding the history of the Panama Canal. Recommended."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I'm tempted not to review this book. I don't like long books. I don't enjoy much non-fiction, and I certainly don't seek out history texts. So The Path Between the Seas, weighing in at more than 600 dense pages, wasn't the type of book I'd pick out for myself. My wife gave me this tome before our cruise through the Panama Canal, so I felt obligated to give it a try.It seems unfair to rate and review a book I'm destined to detest, but McCullough's striking detail brought the difficult birth of this most amazing engineering achievement to life. Unfortunately, I was only a third of the way through when we departed for our cruise, but as soon as we returned, I picked it right back up again.The people in this story--de Lesseps, Gorgas, Taft, Rooseveldt, Banau-Varilla--are portrayed so vividly, it's hard to believe they aren't characters in a work of fiction. But McCullough is a real historian, and there are 40-50 pages of notes at the end of the book that leave little doubt that every detail woven into this utterly comprehensive narrative is factual.If you're used to modern fiction's lean prose, McCullough's long, winding sentences might be off-putting, but I found myself acclimated to them after just a couple pages. McCullough covers the economics and engineering of the canal with the same dexterity as the people, the events, and the historical context.If you ever plan to visit the Panama Canal, this book is a must. But even if a passage isn't on your bucket list, the book should be on your reading list."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This book, by the inimitable David McCullough, is an imperative read if one would like to understand the importance, the effort, and the effects of America's building of the Panama Canal early in the twentieth century.An opposing description, also important, from the point of view of a left-wing author is \\"The Canal Builders\\" by Julie Greene. The latter gives the racist, imperialist and capitalistic implications of the effort.Reading both is necessary for a full and balanced account."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Great feel for the personalities envolved, the times, and the technologies available. Could feel the climate, the diseases, and the obstacles."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Generally, when I have read books about major public works / major engineering projects, such as the Erie Canal, the Transcontinental Railroad, the Northern Pacific Railroad, etc., the authors spend so much time on the financial aspects and the Boardroom battles that the actual construction itself, i.e., the physical obstacles overcome, wind up playing second fiddle. Not so with Path Between the Seas. McCullough does a masterful job with the Panama Canal story.This book is divided into three parts, the French experience, the American involvement after France's failure and America's ultimate success. Although good, the French portion of the book is somewhat descriptive. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, leads French efforts directly into catastrophe. His strengths, which led to his amazing success at Suez, appear to have caused not only his down fall at Panama but also the most significant financial collapse of the French economy in that country's history.But the French engineering accomplishments are legend and with the passage of time it appears de Lesseps biggest error was his misunderstanding of the enormity of the task at Panama. As America's subsequent efforts would prove, he was not alone. Everyone would fail to appreciate the enormity of the Panamanian challenge. French efforts lasted over 10 years and cost $287,000,000, an enormous expenditure for the late 1800s. It was one of the most celebrated engineering and investment nightmares the world had yet witnessed. Roughly 20,000 people died removing 75,000,000 cubic meters of earth and rock.The second part of this book details the American intrigue required to establish the Republic of Panama as a US protectorate and it reads like a Robert Ludlum thriller. Columbian sovereignty, Panamanian rebels and the landing of US Marines make for fascinating reading. President Roosevelt and 2 separate US Navy fleets, one in the Atlantic, the other in the Pacific, frustrated Columbian efforts to quell the Panama revolution. Less than a week later the US recognized Panama's independence. It is the most outstanding example of America's expansionist drive during this period of time.The final section describes the completion of digging this ditch. The geology that frustrated the French would continue to plague the Americans and to this day these issues simply have not been resolved. But the American approach differed from the French in two significant respects. First, the Americans would build a lake and lock canal as opposed to a sea level canal, seriously reducing the amount of material needed to be excavated. Second, the Americans viewed the project as more of an enormous railroading problem as opposed to France's pure engineering play.The greatest expenditure of time and effort was at the Culebra Cut. For seven years the Cut was never silent, not even for an hour and in the end the volume removed from the Cut was 96,000,000 cubic yards. Construction of the canal would consume 61,000,000 pounds of dynamite, a greater amount of explosive energy than had been expended in all of the Nation's wars until that time. The full work force at its peak approached 50,000. Yellow fever was eradicated and malaria seriously curtailed. In the end, 23 mile Gatun Lake was filled, the massive locks installed and the Panama Canal, under construction by both the French and Americans for over forty years, opened for business in 1914. The cost had been enormous. Taken together, French and American expenditures totaled $639,000,000. But the results were equally colossal, developing the most significant maritime aid in the history of mankind.This is a remarkably fine, well researched and excellently written book. The level of detail and the degree of sophistication of the author is amazing. It is a good story well told that makes you proud of both the French and American efforts. This was the first book I have read by David McCullough; it will not be the last!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I think this book is pretty unassailable in terms of research and breadth of narrative. Instead of writing a book about a single chapter of the canal's history, David McCullough took a shot and wrote the whole thing. It worked. You walk away from this book with a great appreciation for the financial, engineering, and political gymnastics it took to build the \\"path between the seas.\\" One almost wishes there was an addendum discussing the Canal Treaty issue from the late 1970s and the Canal's recent expansion.Some other reviewers are right that with the books breadth comes a bit of weight. I had trouble keeping up with all the personalities drifting in and out of the story. But that did not stop my overall enjoyment or ability to learn something. McCullough also dug into the lives of the workers building the canal, at least in the early 1900s as it took its final form. Although not extensive, he does give treatment to some of the less well documented \\"minority\\" workers. Having always heard about the US fomenting the Panama revolution, it was also interesting to learn a bit more about how that actually played out as well as some of the other Washington related politics. The French portion of the story, especially the tale of Lesseps (who even looped Gustave Eiffel of the Eiffel Tower into his web), was really interesting. Lessep sounds like a master salesman and a large personality.I waited a long time to read this book due to its length. Just jump in."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Wow! What a story! The characters leap out at you from the pages alive and kicking. This book is the definitive work on the Panama Canal, its history, economics, politics, science and engineering. It has been read and quoted by presidents, historians and statesmen. But for a gripping narrative that informs and educates as well as entertains it can't be beat. The author has also provided extraordinary photographs from the era as well as modern charts and graphs that walk the reader through this amazing struggle. Read it during vacation or it will wreck your week."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"After reading this book I knew more detail and background aboutthe building of the canal than the lecturers on the cruise ship.Spent the day, May 7, 2005, cruising the canal and enjoyed everyminute of it. The background that the author gives the reader isin such detail that I got bug spray for the trip. The reader will want to cruise the canal and see all the areas mentionedin the book. I was not a reader of non-fiction before but wantto read Davids other books now."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Jimmy Carter - under whose administration negotiations were completed to return the Panama Canal to Panama - reportedly stayed up until 4 am reading this book. I myself competed this volume while living in Panama in 1989, and recently re-read major parts of it. It remains the singular reference for a history of what is much more than the monumental engineering feat of digging this canal between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (which itself is the focus of one chapter aptly titled QWUOTE The Incredible Task UNQUOTE). McCullough masterfully portrays the personal triumps and defeats of numerous individuals associated with this project, no less those of the Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps who ends up in bankruptcy after vigorously promoting his Panama Canal brainchild. Beyond describing individual characters, the author lays out the diplomatic maneuverings of various nations concerned with this venture which led the United States to its forceful role in shaping the history of this region, one which came to haunt it later. A truly monumental book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I have 3 French Grandsons. They asked me questions about the Suez Canal and that led us to the Panama Canal. A friend of mine lent me his book. I love the sectioning-- French, American and then the Builders. It was easy to track. Concise in explanation for a project so large, and I am not an engineer. I loved the way the author related the &quot;WHY&quot; of the canal decisions.I marvel at the handling of the mosquito problem. I better appreciate Teddy R. even more today. Yes he had a heavy hand, but he was the midwife of Panama and it was clear that we needed a path for the U.S. defense. The project took 40 years to finish.The author developed the main characters so well that I can recall what each contributed to colossal effort.Now I plan to visit Panama with the same grandsons. First I have to replace my friends book, as I made notes all through his copy."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Panama canal was an essential part of American empire and I expected to hear about that as I read this book. While the focus on empire was not found here a tale of disease and hardship was. The sheer mechanics of building this project were amazing and this is a must read for all technological historians. McCullough weaves a complex tale with ease and the reader cannot wait to find out what happens on the next page. The construction and political decisions will make the reader cringe at times but the eventual triumph will bring a smile to any reader. This is one of the great McCullough books that is often left out but deserves great acclaim. I encourage all to read!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Well written and thoroughly researched, this is a typical McCullough fascinating and informative narrative. Why the 3 stars: because the KINDLE edition is not complete. No maps, which although noted in the Table of Contents are unavailable - without a link to the text or an appendix because they are nowhere in the e-book. This is particularly aggregious because the possible geographic locations for the canal are described in great detail in chapter one (and to some extent two), leaving one with no picture of the reality of obstacles they created; very confusing. I stopped reading, will try to return the (as usual poorly formatted) Kindle version and will definitely buy the (less expensive) paperback edition."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I have yet to read a David McCullough book I didn't love. Yet, I seem to be approaching his catalogue in ascending order of weight (with the exception of the Johnstown Flood, which I have not yet read). It takes a few months of staring at a book this size and finishing up my lighter reading (avoidance) to finally tackle it, but as with The Great Bridge, I was glad I did. It took me not quite a month, I think, to finish The Path Between the Seas.The book was in three sections: the scouting and the years of the French project, the political wheeling-and-dealing and fomenting of Panamanian independence to bring the isthmus and the project into the American sphere of influence, and the years of the United States' directed work and completion of the canal.The first section was a little thick on back-room politics, but the adventure story of the scouting parties and the surveying, as well as the building of the railroad were phenomenal. The unbelievable misery, pestilence, and death during the French years were horrific but was a story very well told. The first section gets 4 stars.The second section seemed to drag on a bit for me, with lots of back-room politicking and intrigue. It was all interesting, it was all relevant, and all of it gave context to the rest of the story so that the other sections were made better by its inclusion. Still, it was a little bit of an effort to plough through. The second section gets 3 stars for pleasure, with another 1/2 added for relevance. 3.5 stars for this section.The final section was writing on par with The Great Bridge. Perhaps the absence of a language barrier, or simply that it's closer to home, made the story of the American years in the Canal Zone really come to life. The enormity of the work, the brilliance and character of the leaders (Gorgas, Stevens, Goethals, in particular) came leaping out in this section. What giants! While earlier sections had certainly portrayed T.R., Taft, DeLesseps and others as giant personalities and characters, the heroes in the final section were written in a way that truly made them read as great on a mythic scale. Though not necessarily a sign of good history to have mythic heroes as characters, this was a book of a project on a mythic scale, but its story was told through the people who were there, so it was in this section--the section where the characters came out as superhuman--that the mythic scale of the project hit hardest for me. The last section gets 5 stars +I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars over all for one simple reason--The Great Bridge was 5 stars, and it was better than this one, so I gotta give it less than that. If there was a 6 star I could give The Great Bridge, this would be a 5, but there's not, so this has got to settle for about a 4 3/4 star. . ."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"What better book to read while you are in Panama than this one. Although I \\"read\\" the abridged version and also bought the spanish unabridged version right there in Panama, the book is a fabulous account of history, engineering and determination. The building of the canal was far more difficult than the sea-level Suez Canal, beginning with the French company in 1881, finished by the United States in 1914 and curiously inaugurated the same month the first world war exploded, August 1914. The book provides some interesting insights, such as the formation of Panama with the aid of the United States, the little difference of sea level between the pacific and atlantic, difficulties in the construction of the canal and even how the people dealt with some infections like the malaria and yellow fever, typical diseases of this area. You cannot get bore with this book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I picked up David McCullough's book \\"The Path Between the Seas\\" due to a pending cruise through the Panama Canal. The book and the cruise were fantastic. Given the isolationism of American culture, many Americans are not aware of the role played by Columbia, many Caribbean nations, and particularly France in the history and development of the Panama Canal. Likewise, many are unaware of the role played by the United States in the political upheavals that made the building of the canal possible. One of the things that fascinated me the most was the dedication and suffering of thousands of ordinary laborers: French, Caribbean, and American, who struggled with heat, disease, and poor living conditions to build the canal. McCullough's book concisely captures all aspects of this fascinating story of human vision and endurance."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Panama Canal is the evidence and proof of the magic of thinking big. Everything about the project was, and remains, virtually beyond human scale. The size of the locks, the amount of earth moved, the sheer grandeur of the thing is miraculous. The numbers of lives lost (over 5600 people died!), the advances in medicine, technology, and its impact on our world view are beyond measure. The thing cost over $600 million at a time when a dollar was a lot of money. And yet, and this is the essential: it was done by very ordinary human beings.Yes, there were extraordinary personalities involved. The French effort was led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal and whose reputation was destroyed in the swamps of Panama, and of course Theodore Roosevelt stands out. The medical pioneering of William Gorgas deserves more credit than he is ever likely to receive. But the fact remains that the canal was imagined, designed and built by thousands of very ordinary people. The vast majority of them will never be named, but even the chief engineers were men (and a very few women) whose lives were totally ordinary before and after their involvement with the canal.The Panama Canal was not built by geniuses. It was built by ordinary people who got caught up in a vision of what might be possible. It was built by determination, by trial-and-error-and-learning. It was built with courage, but mostly it was built by hard work.McCullough captures the size and grandeur of ordinary people engaged in something larger than themselves. As with all his books, the writing is superb, the history is precise and the story is well-told. This is a GREAT book! But the story, and the inspiration are far greater.At over 600 pages of dense detail, this is not a small book or a quick read, but it is absolutely worth the effort. It's a book that deserves to be widely read, and a story that deserves to be understood.

It crowned JFK's eight year effort (twelve years if one starts from Sputnik).Fifty-five years earlier the onset of World War I in August 1914 muted an equally radiant exploit: the opening of the Panama Canal. It had taken 39 years (401 years if one starts from Vasco N&uacute;&ntilde;ez de Balboa's trek over the Isthmus in 1513), and involved extraordinary expense (more than the sum of all territorial purchases in US history). Nascent advances in medicine, science, and technology were instrumental, but the project still involved innumerable deaths, a racial divide, and political intrigue worthy of modern best-selling fiction.McCullough's reputation as the consummate historian/storyteller is nowhere better advanced than in this work."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough takes the incredible story behind the creation of the Panama Canal and weaves a fascinating look at what is essentially the biggest ditch digging story of all time. Not trying to belittle this amazing engineering accomplishment in the least bit just trying to reflect on a writer who can make such a story so fascinating. Granted, this is not an easy read, logging in at over 600 pages with every detail and political intrigue along the way but it sweeps the reader up in the telling of this story. McCullough captures the essence of the 'can-do' spirit of the times and the amazing talents of these people who created the path between the seas."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"In November of 1971 I was ordered to Fort Sherman, Canal Zone for jungle operations training. In the two weeks that I was there I learned many things among which are the following:1. The Jungle is the King.2. Don't mess with the Jungle.3. There are mosquitoes in the Jungle and they'll make your life miserable and even give you malaria.4. Don't ever get mad at the Jungle. The madder you get the worse off you will be.In 1977 I read Mr. McCullough's book about the creation of the Panama Canal. His chronicle on the building of this path between the seas is truly epic. He tells of the failures of Ferdinand de Lesseps in trying to build a sea level canal. He describes T R Roosevelt's desire to build this connect between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Mr. McCullough goes into great depth about the Army Corps of Engineers in the building of the Canal. His take on the excavation of the Culebra Cut is amazing. Personally being on the ground about 60 years later , I consider it a modern day engineering miracle. The density of the jungle and the incredible tropical heat was a large deterrent to any building progress. However in the end it was accomplished.Kudos to the U.S.A.. This was their finest hour!! I don't think Mr. Churchill ever realized the magnitude of this accomplishment."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Path Between The Seas by David McCullough is a must read by anyone interested in the history of man's achievements in construction. The author masterfully presents details as to every obstacle that had to be overcome to create a path between the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean by cutting through the Continental Divide at the Panama isthmus. His coverage of the human aspects of the massive excavation and construction efforts is a great piece of literature commemorating both the engineering genius of many persons and the thousands of lives sacrificed in constructing the canal and its locks system."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I fully expected to enjoy reading McCullough's historical overview because I liked his style in 1776 and other books.What was unexpected was the story's value as a business book, too.McCullough uses frequent mentions of actual companies and brands to remind us of the important contributions of the private sector in this engineering innovation.From Chapter 1Stowed below on the \\"Guard\\" was the finest array of modern instruments yet assembled for such an undertaking--engineers' transits, spirit levels, gradienters, surveyors' compasses and chains, delicate pocket aneroid barometers, mercurial mountain barometers, current meters--all \\"for prosecuting the work vigorously and scientifically.\\" (The Stackpole transits, made by the New York firm of Stackpole & Sons, had their telescope axis mounted in double cone bearings, for example, which gave the instrument greater rigidity than older models, and the introduction of a simplified horizontal graduation reading allowed for faster readings and less chance of error.)In the midst of appreciating the construction highs and lows, he also sheds revealing light on the level of ineptitude, malfeasance, and amazingly blatant lies told to early investors. Clearly, the vision was large and the leaders charismatic in selling it. But the headline from THE NEW YORK TIMES on November 22, 1892 shows the collapse to be on a scale of Enron in its day:A BIG FRENCH SCANDALAFFAIRS OF THE PANAMA CANAL COMPANY TO BE EXAMINED. --- TURBULENT SCENE IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES-- DELAHAYE'S SWEEPING CHARGES OF BRIBERY-- SENATORS, DEPUTIES, MINISTERS, FINANCIERS, AND EDITORS ACCUSED."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I've always enjoyed the books of David McCullough: Truman, The Johnstown Flood, and The Great Bridge. But none of them prepared me for this experience. McCullough has outdone himself here. Actually the topic has driven him to this higher level. The building of the Panama Canal is an extremely complex story, and McCullough includes every twist, turn, challenge, and triumph in his story telling. Sometimes it seems like way too much detail. Almost every character, and there are hundreds, are physically described in detail, from the cut of their clothes to the style of the facial hair. We're told the numbers on the door of their hotel rooms, the names of the ships they travel in, the number of bolts used, the tons of cement poured, the billions of francs and dollars expended. This long book covers it all. Sometimes it's pretty slow going. But it never bogged down to a point where I closed the book and put it away. Instead, I slogged on through the mud, the jungles, the malaria and yellow fever, the mosquitoes, and the political intrigues. And there are a host of the latter, from the initial French undertaking, to the U.S. takeover of the project, to the debates on the best spot to locate the canal, to the gunboat diplomacy of President Teddy Roosevelt which irreparably tainted America's reputation in Central and Southern America. There are some terrific photographs of the experience included, and two maps. Unfortunately, the latter could have been better with more detail. It's impossible to determine the final route of the canal from either map. Also, a map showing the relationship of Central America to the rest of the hemisphere would have been very helpful. I ended up reading this book with an Atlas at hand. Further, a list of the participants with a brief thumbnail sketch would have been helpful, because of the large cast involved. After reading this book, you will know everything you want to know about this amazing achievement, and probably a lot more, too. McCullough is a master at what he does, and in The Path Between the Seas he has achieved his historical masterpiece, although a tad short on the enjoyment factor."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is a fascinating book about the Panama Canal, an engineering/human accomplishment of monumental proportions, but one that we usually take for granted.

I have nothing to add to the overwhelmingly enthusiastic reviews on this page. But it would be a disservice to McCullough if I did not join in the chorus. In an age of increasing ignorance of, if not outright hostility towards, history, an age that is witnessing a general decline of intellectualism and critical thought in the States, it is particularly important that history (our own and others') be written, disseminated, and discussed as widely as possible. As PBS and other outstanding histories make clear, the deeds of the past have many and important lessons for our present and future.

The book will be on my coffee table for my guests to read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Most people have limited education in the building of the Panama Canal. The sum total of my knowledge, prior to reading this book, was that Theodore Roosevelt fostered a revolution in the Columbian state of Panama in order to complete the work abandoned by the French. That disease and pestilence was rife in the region and that American technology and know how carried the day. Mostly correct, but woefully simplistic.This book, written by the outstanding author, David McCollough, does an excellent job of tracking the canal project from its inception to completion, a story lasting about 35 years. The financial and political intrigue accompanying the French effort is captivating. The change of scenery (but with an equal amount of intrigue) to the American project breathes fresh life into the story. And what a story it is. It would be easy to attribute the ultimate success to superior American ingenuity and resolve, however, while this did indeed play a part, the impact of a national, government financed effort (as opposed to the privately financed French effort) coupled with huge strides in medical and mechanical technology in the intervening years probably was the most compelling reason for American success.McCollough, in the course of the book, touches on virtually all aspects of both the French and American experiences, from scandalous financial dealings, back room political deal making, the strong decisive personalities involved and the social and cultural factors which played such a huge part in the project.In reading this book, you began to develop an appreciation for the immense scope of the undertaking and the effort required to pull it off. The level of organization required in such an effort is almost mindboggling. It is difficult to imagine a project of equal magnitude (perhaps the NASA moon landings). I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history. It should be required reading in all high schools."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Most Americans are largely unaware of the whole story behind the building of the Panama Canal. With discussions of a new, wider canal through Nicaragua once again underway, it's an excellent time to pick up McCullough's excellent history. It's fascinating reading, excellently rendered, and one wonders if the French would have succeeded had they not been so stubborn about building the canal at sea level. Probably not; time allowed the Americans to bring improved technology to the effort, and the private financing the French used also had crippling implications. McCullough catches the fine details as well as the coarse, the people as well as the process, and the time spent here is both educational and enjoyable.Another winner by McCullough - highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"McCullough is always good. He doesn't dissappoint with this history of the Panama Canal.As a resident of \\"the Zone\\" for eight years in the 40s and 50s my degree of interest and knowledge might be a smidge greater than the average reader, and therefore my review slightly skewed.The primary reason the book is rated 4 instead of 5 is that I thought the balance of the book was too heavily weighted to the French effort. And too heavily weighted to the political and financial side of the French effort at that. The sections are well done, but left only a few chapters at the end of the book to discuss the actual American dig. I was hoping for more detail on the American effort. But I suspect a canal neutral reader will be satisfied.Perhaps the best chapter in the entire book was the chapter on the life style in the Zone. Not much changed from 1917 to 1956 except the amenities got better. The Canal Zone was the best spot in the world to be a low grade American civilian federal employee...or the son of one. It remained a terrible place to be a native Panamanian or descendant of the blacks who worked the canal. The gold and silver standard still existed in 1956.Written well, researched with McCulloughs normal thouroughness. Balance slightly askew."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Panama Canal is probably one of the most overlooked achievements of the last century. David McCullough who you may know as the host of the series &quot;The American Experience&quot; tells us of the toils and troubles of the men who built this masterpiece of Engineering. McCullough's style is entertaining and imformative and makes one wish that he would write a book on everything. This book will make you see things in a brand new way. Also check out &quot;Truman&quot; by McCullough as it is equally intriguing and informative."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"As with all of David McCullough's work you get a thoroughly researched piece that separates fact from unsubstantiated claims. If it's the latter he tells you so. The book provides excellent details of the early exploration and the initial French effort including profiles of Ferdinand de Lesseps and the engineers that supported. Reading McCullough's account of the meeting in Paris when the French decided to move forward with a sea-level canal makes you wish that you could have been present to enjoy the rhetoric. If you've ever wondered about the details of tropical diseases, malaria, yellow-fever, etc., this is the book that puts it the pain in perspective. But not just in terms of numbers of sick and deaths (one doctor estimated that one-third of the 19,000 work force were sick or dying in 1884) but in the physical and mental toll on specific individuals critical to the effort. The author points out how de Lessep's previous success both helped and hindered the French attempt but it's telling to learn that toward the end de Lessep acknowledged Panama was ten times harder. McCullough's effort with the US activities is just as complete including extensive details about the political intrigue of buying the isthmus from France and Panama seceding from Columbia. He also shares how the project seemed to destroy or alter some of the best leaders that this country could produce. As one reads this book they can find a photo included of almost every major character on the scene. And there's no glossing over things that are painful. For example the double standards of the color line between the unskilled West Indians who worked, lived, and died there and the whites who lived and worked almost in a paradise. Clearly the best history of the Panama Canal that I've ever read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"It takes a good author to make a subject like this interesting. McCullough accomplished it!The story behind the Canal is so much more than just the physical construction involved. The years of the French construction involved a lot of corruption and scandal that I'd never heard about!Then, after about two decades, American takes over, and within a few years the canal is open for traffic. The successful fight against the deadly mosquito was one of the turing points.McCullough talks a lot about some of the politics involved, in both the French and the American stages. The story behind the Panamanian revolution was quite interesting. . . the US more or less \\"stole\\" Panama from Columbia, I guess you could say.Definitely a good book, and worth your time to read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This book was first published 30 years age and it is a testament to its greatness that it is still in print. David McCullough is one of the finest authors of American history and this is one of his masterpieces. This book covers the building of the Panama Canal, from the failed French attempt to the trials and tribulations of the successful American project. As with all of McCullough's books, it blends scholarship with the readability of a novel. You will learn a lot and like any good novel you will not want to put it down.This book will be of interest to readers of history, to readers of political science, to those interested in medicine and sociology, and to engineers. First and foremost it is the history of a very important project, but it is much more. There is the story of political intrigue, both in the failed French attempt (there was a great scandal reaching to the heights of the French government) and intrigues of the American government that allowed Panama to secede from Columbia. This is also the story of men with great egos, who clashed with each other, nearly scuttling the project. The French failed partly because of their arrogance and a failure to understand that yellow fever was not associated with the lifestyles of the workers who lived in Panama City and Colon. The American succeeded because they recognized that it was due to a mosquito borne infection and that success depended upon controlling the mosquitoes, not the lifestyles of the workers. Engineers will enjoy the technical aspects of the story. The French failed because they did not properly determine the angle of repose of the soil and that the key to solving this problem lay in controlling the Chagres River. The Americans succeeded because they realized that the key was the Chagres River, which could be tamed and made to work for them by filling up a man-made lake that would control the locks that raised and lowered ships up and down the mountains of Panama.Building the canal was a great feat of government policy, medicine and engineering, and this is a great book, worthy of this great accomplishment."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I first read this book in 1990, and it has stayed with me as an example of how well written history provides examples of project management across the spectrum of human endeavour. McCullough is able to simultaneously describe events objectively, yet bring the events to life.Without men of vision, the Panama Canal would never have been established yet the human cost was immeasurable. McCullough provides the history, but does not whitewash the tragedies.Compelling reading."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The story of how the Panama Canal was built is a rich and epic one, and David McCullough does it justice in this extremely enjoyable book.It basically starts with the Suez Canal and the mid 19th century or so. This was a period where the world was really coming together for the first time. The Suez Canal allowed easy trade between Europe and Asia, skipping the tedious voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. Undersea cables were beginning to be laid. A Panamanian canal would allow easy trade between the East and West Coasts, skipping the terrifying voyage around Cape Horn.Fresh from victory in Egypt the French assaulted the Panamanian Isthmus with vigor, spurred on by massive private and public financing back home. However the engineering, environmental, and medical challenges of the Isthmus far outstripped those of Suez, to a degree the French were completely unprepared and unhandled to meet. Torrential rains would send mudslides into any excavations the French made, practically filling them back up as quick as they were dug. The French earth movers, and critically their cart system to take the earth away on rails, were woefully inadequate. Their knowledge of tropical infectious disease however was their largest problem. Believing such diseases as Yellow Fever were caused by ants they put water cups on the legs of their hospital beds. Mosquitoes, the true culprits, bred in this stagnant water and a visit to the hospital for any ailment was a death sentence. (As a matter of fact, how come the doctors and nurses weren't dropping left and right? I don't remember any mention of them dying in droves . . . ) The author's descriptions of the ghastly equatorial diseases is perhaps worth the entire book. As problems mounted the directors of the company established to build the French Canal kept going back to the government and the people for more money, and kept getting it. As progress measured by alteration of the Isthmian geography failed to materialize however, except for the swelling of the earth with the bodies of fallen workers, the Canal bubble finally burst. The failure of the French Canal effort was a major nail in the coffin of Imperial French power.In the interim between the French and eventual U.S. efforts, a large number of surveys, proposals, and half attempts occurred. When the U.S. took up the mantle of making a Panamanian Canal the challenges remained daunting. The story of how we met those challenges and pulled off an incredible feat of engineering is enthralling. The author goes into considerable detail of nearly everything about the operation: the dredging of channels to pave the way for the eventual freighters, the design of the canal configuration (locks vs. direct path a la Suez), the digging operations, the establishment of giant work camps, the necessary geological surveys, the feeding and medical care of the workers, the administrative organization to oversee everything, the transport of excavated soil, the building of sea walls to protect the canal entrances from storms, the design of the locks, their doors, their pumps, actually building the locks, designing a damn to create an artificial lake, figuring out how to move ships through the locks, etc., etc., etc. All of this is weaved together in a history replete with characters you can relate to. These characters draw you into the pressures, dreams, determination, and fears of those who built the Canal.For a surprisingly long time the Americans seemed to be faring no better than the French. Two breakthroughs altered the course of history though. First an American Army officer charged with medical care sided with a new and conventionally discarded theory of how plague and yellow fever spread, mosquitoes. While most of the medical establishment thought he was crazy, he bucked the trend and implemented a pest control program so successfully that even today the Panama Canal Zone remains one of the healthiest, least diseased places on Earth. The second involved a change in who was in charge of the actual digging efforts on the ground. Via a largely political process (one that actually worked!) a railroad engineer was brought in to take charge. This was a particular American strength at the time, as the nation was just coming out of the massive build up of transcontinental railroad lines. Seeing the bottleneck that killed progress this new leader used his railroad engineering skills to develop a system so that the carts which carried away the material the Bucyrus earth movers dug up ran continuously instead of in fits and starts. This allowed the earth movers to run continuously as well, and as such the Panama Canal digging was literally brute forced. The digging just barely keeping ahead of the borderline comical number of mudslides and torrential rains that conspired to try to keep the path between the seas closed forever.A highly interesting, extremely well researched, lively written book. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I had to read this for a history class, and it was such a pleasant and interesting read I recommended it to my mom and my boyfriend.

So I decided to read this book The Path Between the Seas. Big mistake. I found the book is very different from John Adams. The are tons of characters who some of which have very little to do with the whole history of the canal. The book often goes in to long descriptions of people and places which could make it hard to read for more than 10-15 minutes. You also spend alot of the book following the same things over and over again. People go to Panama and survey for the canal, they go back home, then there are a few meetings and then it all happens again. But with everything bad the book can be very interesting and every once in a while you will find your self glued to the book. So overall unless your an expert on The Panama Canal or in love whit history I wouldn't recomend this book to you. Instead read John Adams also by David McCullough."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The construction of the Panama Canal is understood to be a great American feat. This book by David McCullough shows why the preceding sentence is a great oversimplification of the actual situation. The French started building the canal and actually got more accomplished than they are given credit for. In addition, most of the manual labor was done by the people of the Caribbean. But McCullough doesn't just recite dates and facts as one would expect in a history book. He also looked at the people behind the scenes; their personalities and their lives. He explored all the political intrigue that went along with this gigantic project. He also wrote about the diseases that had to be overcome for the canal to be built; malaria and yellow fever. This is a fantastic book written in similar style as Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919. McCullough's The path between the seas is a must-read for anyone interested in history and should be required reading for anyone taking a cruise through the Panama Canal."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough is an amazing author. He does a fantastic job of researching his subject and then tells the story in a mesmerizing way.In The Path Between the Seas, Mr. McCullough breaks the story of the building of the Panama Canal into three stages. He starts with the first attempt, by the French. This ended in disaster. In the second stage of the story, America helped the Panamanians revolt against Columbia. Then McCullough concludes with the details of how the canal was finally built.Reading about the French attempt reminded me of the manager from the Dilbert comic strip. So many decisions were made by people who had little expertise or knowledge. Estimates for the cost were almost pulled out of the air. Then sometimes these estimates would be divided in half, just because.In 1879, a vote was taken to authorize the expenditures of funds to build a sea level canal, which would prove nearly impossible. Of the 74 who voted yes, only 19 were engineers and only one of them had been to Panama. It was not surprising that the French spent so much money and accomplished so little.After the French fiasco, the project was dropped for a while. Then the Americans took up the challenge. I was surprised to learn that it was backing the Panamanian revolt that turned much of Latin America against the United States. Since the founding of the United States of America in the late 1700s, people to the south had looked to the US as an example in their struggles against European powers.But President Theodore Roosevelt wanted a canal. He was upset that the Columbian government was slow to give him what he wanted. So this rough rider hinted to the Panamanians that they would be protected if they revolted. They revolted and President Roosevelt sent in the troops. Latin America came to distrust the big power to the north that would more and more would push its nose into their affairs.In 1904, the US started building their attempt at a sea level canal. The design included a canal with a series of locks and a lake in the middle. This would save a huge amount of effort. John Stevens was put in charge. As a long time railroad man, he recognized the problem wasn't so much digging a ditch problem, but a transportation problem of moving all the dirt. He spent time laying the foundation for moving the dirt. He put down heavier rails and placed orders for over a hundred locomotives with thousands of cars. Once this system was in place, the sea level canal become a reality.This is a great book to read. I was fascinated to learn more about life in Panama and the world a hundred years ago. David McCullough makes the story of the canal a real page turner."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough's voice may be one you are familiar with. He is often tapped to be PBS's warm. homespun narrator for American Masters series and other historical documentaries. But his erudite tone is secondary. He is likely chosen for his thorough examination of history and the human players; characters, heroes and villains who complete the American portrait.If you have been listening to the news lately (early 2011) there is much discussion about American innovation and infrastructure. How Americans rose to the challenge in numerous examples in our history. We can point to many examples. The NY Subway system, The Brooklyn Bridge (also the subject of a McCollough book), Eisenhower's Intestate, the transcontinental railroad, etc. When we put our collective mind to something, Americans can achieve great accomplishments- some of them which proudly stand erect against the test of time, and exist today as American monuments in stone, concrete, metal and architecture, rising and spreading in our vista as the epitome of our genius.The creation of the Panama Canal is one such example that is not in our back yard to remind us. Few Americans will personally travel through the locks or plan their summer vacations to personally witness the great engineering feat that has now passed out of United State's control. The Panama Canal's conception and ultimate completion was a marriage of ideas and countries, but it was American ingenuity and perseverance that made its completion a reality. And who could have thought that a little mosquito could vex the completion of such an enormous engineering project and propel scientific visionaries to find a cure for Yellow Fever and carve out a canal at the same time.This book reminded me of the unique character and determination of the American engineer and everyday worker. It made me proud to be an American. It took a village of American know-how and courage to complete a vision that others had given up on. We were visionaries back then. We were brave. If we had those qualities then, there is no reason why they can not be displayed and implemented today. We are the sons and daughters- the inheritors of these people and this work ethic. We carved the Path Between the Seas. We engineered and met the challenge of a jungle and foreign terrain. We can complete any goal we set upon, if we have the collective will to imagine it and exhibit the desire not to fail.McCollough's tale (and a similar one is repeated in his Brooklyn Bridge novel) chronicles a proud, challenging period of 19th century American history. They say history repeats, and if that is true, there is surely a strong foundation and hope that the lesson of this saga will be implemented into the future - and inspire our present"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough's book of the history of the Panama Canal is a well written and researched document on all aspects of the building of the canal, beginning with the French and completed by the United States. One gets a detailed understanding of the political, economic, and social conditions of France and the United States during these years and the people responsible for this engineering feat. McCullough vividly describes the jungles of Panama and the diseases and hardships endured by the workers. He gives great detail on the design and methods used to build the canal. This book offers history at its best."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"A very informative book. I did not even know of the French involvement, or the workings of the \\"liberation\\" of Panama. The descriptions of the constant dealings of all the parties involved brought them all back to life. A book that has, simply put, educated me. Just what I expected. Never got too slow, and no loose ends. Made me appreciate the canal and the men who built it."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"McCullough has penned another classic historical text with his famed situational prose. He elicits the founding problems of the Panama Canal during the 1840's soon after gold was discovered in California. A shortcut to the 3000 mile land passage from the east coast was preferable and no Indians to circumnavigate. The frenchman lesseps began the Canals journey but his fame from the Suez canal left him without enough financial resources to complete its building. Some twenty years lapse and the Americans under Teddy Roosevelt reiniciate the Panama Canals construction and labor through various tropical diseases to complete the task in 20 + years. McCullough's vivid imagery brings to the landscape of this huge undertaking. We feel ourselves emerging from the daily millions of tons of excavation to find a cohesively designed canal with perfectly designed locks which are in fll service a hundred years later. Another American technological achievement."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Not only does this history of the building of the Panama Canal thoroughly capture the events and the atmosphere of this incredible endeavor - David McCullough is able to interweave the social and political motives and implications of this incredible feat. This is a thoroughly enjoyable, captivating book which easily rivals any well-crafted novel for character development, intrigue, and plot.Also recommended: Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose, The Plan of Four, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris, American Colonies by Alan Taylor, Freedom Just Around the Corner by Walter McDougal, and The Shadow of the Wind."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I lived in Panama's Canal Zone for four years and thought I knew a lot about the canal. What I learned from this book amazed me. From the surveyor's journal entries to the politics involved, this book provides stories of tragedy and triumph that only real life could provide.

A wonderful and detailed history of the building of the Panama Canal. Will be better prepared for our cruise in a few months having read it."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I first read \\"The Path Between the Seas\\" when I purchased a paperback copy of it in the Miraflores locks visitor center in Panama. We had just completed a transit of the canal as line handlers on someone else's boat. I really wish I had read the book before we saw the canal.I'm in the process of sailing my boat around the world and on the long passages I read a lot. I purchased this book in the kindle format so that I would have it on board to read again, at least once more, before we transit the canal our own boat near the end of our circumnavigation.At 100 years old the canal was still functioning as designed and with very few modifications to the original equipment. McCullough's book provided many details behind what we saw during our transit. I can only wonder how many more details I would have noticed if I had read this wonderful book first.This book, like its subject, is a monumental work and McCullough researched the subject in depth. He provides details on all of the engineering issues and risks that the builders took as well as the very human side of the successes and abysmal failures associated with the French attempt. He provides a detailed assessment of the geopolitical situation at the time the decision was made to build the canal in Panama.In this book you will learn how the huge ego of a French entrepreneur prevented him for hearing the wisdom of the engineer who told him how to build the canal using the Chagres river to operate a system of locks. You will also learn how Teddy Roosevelt arranged for the creation of the country of Panama so that the United States could get a lease on the land the build the canal.In addition to the engineering accomplishment the success of the US canal project was dependent on medical science solving the problems of mosquito borne diseases that had killed off a large percentage of the French workforce during their attempt.One of my favorite details is the story of how the army corps of engineers realized that it would not be too difficult to make the canal a little wider than the original design but an American naval officer secured his place in history by asserting that the US navy would never have ships so large that that they would not fit through the canal as designed.Like all of McCullough's books, this one is extremely well researched and crafted. The story is compelling and, even in these days of post lunar landing technology, leaves the reader awed by the magnitude of the engineering accomplishment of the men who built the Canal."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This book was very informative about the Panama Canal. I learned a lot, and gained a lot of respect for the men who worked an built this modern marvel. There were some parts that dragged, but that is to be expected with history books. I didn't know the French started the canal, and didn't realize that the canal goes to the southeast to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific (going east to go west?). The book discusses the reasons for the locks, the politics, and all that was involved. A very good book about one of the biggest engineering marvels of the last 150 years."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is a great book about the Panama Canal. It was written in 1977 and still holds up very well. I didn't know much about the Panama Canal and learned a lot. It tells the story of all the planning (USA, France) to attempt a canal through Central America. There were three main plans---possibly through a narrow area of Mexico, an area through Nicaragua, or through Panama. The USA's main plan being through Nicaragua. The French got the jump on the USA with the guiding force of Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was already very famous as the man who got the Suez Canal built. Ferdinand wanted his French company to build 51 miles through the isthmus of Panama and he wanted a sea level canal (no locks). He got approval. To make a long story short, Ferdinand got in way over his head with his French company totally underestimating the scale of the attempted project. The jungle heat and the rainy seasons, massive amounts of deaths from malaria and yellow fever destroyed morale. The unbelievably hard attempt to excavate a 9 mile area cut through the mountains (Culebra Cut) totally frustrated them. The French struggled from approximately 1880 - 1889 before the company went bankrupt. There wasn't much progress until the USA bought out the French stake in the project and started construction in 1904. It was completed by 1914 and had to be completed with locks at both ends and an elevation of 85 feet.I really enjoyed this book. It tells the story of all the major players involved. I had no idea about all the politics involved--shady deals and backstabbing. The book brings all the people involved to life where you feel like you know them. Ferdinand de Lesseps was a very interesting man to learn about. Another extremely interesting person was Philippe Bunau-Varilla and all his behind the scenes wheeling and dealing. William Nelson Cromwell was another interesting character. When the USA took over, it was very interesting to learn about Dr William Gorgas, who struggled to get the big bosses to understand that mosquitoes were causing all the malaria and yellow fever deaths. One of my favorite chapters was the one about all the intrigue and backdoor politics that was involved with Panama's breaking away from Columbia, which Panama was a part of at the time. The book has many, many good pictures of the people involved and pictures of the excavation and construction. I can't emphasize enough what a big undertaking the Panama Canal was ... much, much harder than the Suez Canal."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Great Book, got it on DVD for my Dad before he goes to Panama and hope he shares it with my brothers after he is done."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Book was in great shape, but allot thicker than I figured.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The book and the canal! My uncle was an avid reader of history. He has probably read more than 500 books on nearly every subject. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer a year ago and I had the good fortune of spending some time together in his final days. I asked him what his favorite book was. He was hesitant to single out one but said if he had to pick one it would be this. Shortly after his passing I bought the book and have to say I couldn't put it down. Granted I'm an engineer and appreciate the magnitude of the task put I was even more amazed by the politics of the time and how a project of this size was undertaken more than 100 years ago in a land that most people knew nothing of. Most of you have probably heard about the Big Dig in Boston which is $10B over budget, still not done and doesn't have any of the challenges that are presented in the book. I'm sure that most of us still have no real appreciation for the Canal today. If only our history classes taught such things."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"As a big fan of all things related to the Panama Canal, I was happy to find such a book that would tell the story of how it was built. From the size of the book, I have to admit I was expecting a dry account of people, places and dates with some pictures, much like a history text in a way. However I was so amazingly pleasantly surprised. The history and story of the canal from the early days of explorers looking for a way across the Isthmus ever since Balboa crosed it by foot until the opening by the Americans in early 1900, reads almost like a fictional riveting tale. There are so many facinating stories and subplots behind the building of the canal, I literally finished the book in about a week or two.McCullough does an amazing job of writing that it really comes across as you are being told this amazing story as opposed to just reading dates and places and facts. The research seems amazing as McCullough givessuch details into little events it just adds to the story. It was fascinating hearing about the engineering trials and tribulations of building a canal in 100% humid conditions with the rainfall and malaria and other illnesses and how the builders, both French and American, struggled to overcome the land. It is also amazing that the Canal still uses the same tecnhology and engineering that went into building the canal.Since the book also covers the politics and business around the investors who put money into the Canal with the French company, and the American political moves to free Panama from Columbia so that the US could get access to building the canal are as good as any fictional international story of lies and deciet and greed.If you just want facts about how the canal was built you can find that out very quickly. If you want the greatest story of political, business, engineering and individual triumph and the story of the creation of a country and geographical marvel, then this book has it all.SO much was written about the turning over of the Canal back to Panama but I do not think enough people appreciate the amount of lives and years that went into building it and the type of politcal and economic power that was involved in opening a path between the seas. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the canal, loves history (since the book covers also the events of the times), and loves stories about how actual politics and power were wielded in the late 1800s, early 1900s."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Perhaps I am biased, having grown up in the Panama Canal Zone. All prejudices apart, though, this is the single best &quot;history&quot; book I have ever read. With a cast of characters worthy of a Tolstoy novel, McCullough gives the reader a thorough understanding of the magnitude and impact the little Isthmus of Panama has had on the history of the world.This is much more than history. Indeed, the common claim that it reads like a novel is not an exaggeration. The 600+ pages overflow with unrelenting drama, vividly painted larger-than-life characters, exotic vistas, bustling courtrooms, etc. This is more a story about the people who struggled to realize a dream than it is about the little canal which captured their imaginations for centuries.This book moved me to tears."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Every thinking American should read this book, then go see the Canal in operation if possible. Having lived in Panama and visited there many times, I can attest the Panama Canal is much more than just &quot;a ditch&quot;, as this book so ably points out. It was, and is, THE engineering feat of the century (it has lasted, in continuous operation, for almost a hundred years.

My grandfather was an 8 year veteran of the canal. Papa and his brother went down together in 1906 from Oklahoma. Papa left at the end of construction, his brother stayed on until his death sometime in the mid 1940's.I grew up listening to Papa's stories of Panama. Papa loved John Stevens and always said he was really the man that built the canal, and did not think much of the colonel. Papa was one of the thousands that stood on the lock, in the scene so vividly described By McCullough as the first boat, a tug boat all draped in flags was the first through. Papa was one of the men that rushed to the scene of a dynamite field that went off prematurely were 25 men died. Papas story had 80 men dead, he is allowed his inflated memory. Papa had a story about almost every person of note that was on the canal, many of his stories and experiences were repeated in the pages of this book.After Papa left the canal he went on to make his fortune several times over. He was a rich man when he died. He did a lot, but of all the things he did, he always felt that his work on the canal was the most important, the most memorable.I have read the book perhaps a dozen times from cover to cover in the thirty years that I have had it. For me this book takes me back to childhood, when I sat on my Papas knee listening to the stories he told.David McCullough could not have written a better narrative if he had been there.

He loved it. I thought that he was a little crazy. How could the Panama Canal be so riveting? How could a person stand to read nearly a thousand pages about a canal? I was engaged to his daughter, and I love to read, so when he asked me if I wanted to borrow it, I couldn't say no. But I wanted to. I knew that he would want a book report or something from me so that I could continue to see his daughter, so I started reading. At first, I thought that I would read the first few chapters and then skip around to get the timeline down and be able to have a decent conversation with the man.Then, I got hooked. This book was like crack-- I couldn't stop thinking about it. My conversations all started sounding like this, \\"Did you say, 'mosquitoes'? Well, in Panama they had a problem with mosquitoes....\\" or \\"Financial trouble? I'll tell YOU about financial trouble. At least you don't have it as bad as the French during the building of the Panama Canal...\\"I recommend this book to anyone who likes history, or anyone, like me, who didn't know that they like history and would like to read a great story. I also recommend, John Adams, by the same author, (actually, anything by this author) and The Endurance by CAROLINE ALEXANDER.I recomend this book to anyone-- as long as they have some time to spend doing quality reading... this isn't a book you can pick up for a light read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

How malaria and yellow fever were virtually eradicated is a tale worth noting.The final portion of the book describing the actual building of the canal is terrific.

My girlfriend bought me the book so that we could go sooner rather than later.It's tough reading a book about a canal. McCullough has built a reputation on writing giant books about fairly small subjects (Truman). He does a lot of research, then pieces it all together and inserts at least a little creativity (you get lines like &quot;in this picture you can tell that he commands the entire room while his companion looks weary and beaten down&quot;). Sometimes that gets annoying but for the most part I guess it keeps things moving along.This isn't so much a book of construction and achievement as it is of political intrigue (I'm an engineer and would have liked more of the construction and achievement). With today's Worldcom and Enron failures it is interesting to read a story about the (privately financed) French effort to build a canal that caused all of its stockholders (one of the most widely owned stocks of its day) to lose everything and its bondholders to get back 10 cents on the dollar. All the while the man running things was saying how great things were and hiding the truth that what he was trying to do was nearly impossible (he wanted a canal built at sea level).The failed French effort is nearly half the book. The rest is about the successful american effort, but even that is mostly about all the political manuevering and influence peddling that caused the canal to be picked up again. After that you get a portrayal of the leading people who were responsible for construction of the canal.Anyway, if any of that sound interesting, you might give the book a try. It was written in 1977 as Jimmy Carter was giving the canal back to Panama, but I don't know if there's much to tell or much more that has come to light since.It's a very heavy read, but if you have an interest in the subject it is pretty rewarding."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is another outstanding work by David McCullough. His excellent research and easy to understand narrative put you right there in the canal with first the French and later the Americans.

It covered the French involvement in great detail. The coruption invovled was frightening. It also detailed very well early attempts of the U.S. in Panama and how the U.S. didn't use the most honest methods in obtaining what they wanted. The weakenss was that it covered the years from 1909 to the opening poorly. I also felt it could have gone into more detail about the lives of the people and less detail on the technical aspects of removing dirt. On the whole, however, this should not keep people from reading the book. There is a great deal of information of which most people are unaware."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is a review of the audio CD version of book. David McCullough does an excellent job of illuminating the history of early French efforts to build the canal and the later successful effort to do so by the Americans, and the incredible loss of human life that accompanied all of these efforts. McCullough also exposes the financial and political machinations that were at work prior to and during the canal-building years. McCullough's discussion of those machinations left me bored the first time I listened to the audiobook, but I found them much more interesting on subsequent listenings. The audio recording is excellent, as it always is with David McCullough's audiobooks. The only downside of the audiobook version is that it lacks the 80 photographs and 2 maps that are in the print edition."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"My granparents, and their siblings were a Dr., nurses, a clerk, and equipment operators building the Canal. My dad, uncle and aunt were born in the Zone. I came to this book with a lot of interest due to family involvement.The story is absorbing. The history of the French attempt in the 1880's is largely lost to our knowledge of Canal history.The U.S.'s political, [military action to gain posession of the Panama Teritory from Colombia], and the financial chicanery to finance the construction is enlightening. Teddy Roosevelt's personality, drive and ambition were to a great degree responsible for getting the project completed.Obstacles such as recruiting labor, construction in the jungle environment with yellow fever rampaging, overcoming incredible management and engineering problems, and the politcal obstacles, keep your interest s as though it were a novel of unknown outcome.The resolution of the Yellow Fever issue is a story in itself."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"... well, it didn't literally take me 4 years to read it. My dad lent me this book, and it sat on the shelf for 4 years. I never enjoyed history very much in school, and this just seemed like it would be deadly-dull.How wrong I was! This story is amazing. They say truth is stranger than fiction. If this story was fictional, I'd give it a lower rating because it would have been so hard to believe. The fact that it's all true left me slack-jawed.These days, we seem to be much more cautious about risk-taking. As I write this review, our entire manned space program is on hold, and may be on hold for years go come, due to a shuttle accident. But this book shows you the bold risk-taking that made this country into a superpower.You will be in awe of the scale of the undertaking, first by the French, and later the Americans. You will be aghast at the toll in human life. But most of all, you will be engrossed and enriched by this remarkable book.This book, which I was SO sure would be deadly dull before I read it, sparked an interest in historical books and even historical fiction that has opened vast new horizons for me.The building of the Panama canal ranks up there with the buildng of the transcontinental railroad, the Great Wall of China, and the Great Pyramid as one of the most amazing examples of what can be accomplished by brilliance, hard work on a vast scale, and sheer indominable human will.Buy this book, and don't let it gather dust for years like I did!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"When I picked up this book from a stack of my wife's I was interested in neither the setting nor the subject. But from the first chapter, I was unable to put it down. Well researched and written, it told a fascinating story."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I first bought this book in the 1970's while living in the Panama Canal Zone. I remember it so fondly, as it helped me to better understand the history of the canal. I often noted the abandoned French canal site on the Atlantic side on my way to historic Ft. Sherman. I always expected John Wayne to come barreling through the palm trees for his take-off in a flying tiger aircraft. I remember the intra-canal railway, the periodic cave-ins in the Cuelebra cut since the cut was still unstable as late as the 1970's, the constant dredging it took to keep the canal open, the unbelievable precision of the canal locks, the operation of the canal which was almost entirely by gravity, and the fact that the USA never made a dime from it's operation. It was a wonderful time and I was so impressed by the unbelievable engineering it took to build this wonder and by the tremendous patroitism of the permanent canal residents. I often thought of the futility (insanity) of the French effort to dig a sea level canal, and of the thousands that died in it's construction. I remember that it was said that not a single person had died from malaria and yellow fever since the canal was opened - a wonder in itself.I was there on that terrible day when the USA signed the paperwork to give the canal back to Panama - a ridiculous idea that shocked most Panamanians more than us Americans. I will always have a hard time understanding, not to mention forgiving Jimmy Carter.I highly recommend this book to any and all. I loaned my original hardbook copy to a friend in the 1970's and it was never returned. After 25 years, I'm buying a paperback copy as a replacemnt and will undoubtedly enjoy reading it again."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The book was interesting at times, but also very labor intensive. I usually read books in about a week to ten days. This one took me 6 weeks. It just gets bogged down time and time again in facts and stories that didn't have a lot of relevancy.The writing and research is excellent, but I think if you could have chopped 150-200 pages out of the book you would have been left with the same wealth of information in a more succinct format. I loved the descriptions of both the Americans and the French influence in the Canal, but the more than 150 pages that was spent talking about the legistlative and congressional hurdles that had to be crossed in order for the Americans to take over was just too much.I didn't really care about all the facts and tidbits about the transition and at times got really confused because it is just so detailed that I lost interest.I did really enjoy the chapters on medical achievements related to the Canal building. Really, the last 200 pages was very good. I would recommend it, but only to those that can slog through the minutia in the middle Feel free to skip through a few chapters when it gets bogged down.

Part 3 is about the actual building of the canal from the early 1900s until its completion in 1914. I'm so glad I'd read this book before going through the canal recently.

I started this one a few years back but never made it beyond the first couple chapters. The story and the writing didn't grab me right away. I picked it up again about six weeks ago in an effort to force myself to finish the book, which is not always a good idea but I am glad that I did in this instance. Once the story got around the to the failed efforts of the French and resulting scandals I found myself reading a chapter or two a night. The first third of the book I felt I really had to plow through, which is unusual in a McCullough book in my opinion because he typically does a very good job at the storytelling. It's very well-researched and incredibly enlightening in bringing the stories of the people who built the canal to life."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough is well-known for his exhaustively-researched and eminently readable histories, most of which have won the National Book Award. McCullogh has written aboutThe Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge, about Theodore's Roosevelt's youthfulMornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt, about PresidentsTrumanandJohn Adams, and aboutThe Johnstown Flood. In THE PATH BETWEEN THE SEAS he turns his historian's eye toward the grandest construction project ever, the Panama Canal.Ferdinand DeLesseps is customarily credited with having built the Suez Canal. In actuality, DeLesseps had little to do with the actual engineering of that Canal. He was an impresario, not an engineer; and he was a visionary.For the 100 years between 1814 and 1914, Europe was largely at peace. Excepting such an atypical war as the Crimean and the American bloodbath of the Civil War, this era, lived predominantly under the shadow of Queen Victoria, was one of peace and technological progress. It was an era in which mankind came to believe (with some justification) that he could remake his world in his image of it. It was an era that took us from the sailing ship to the airplane. It was an era during which the price paid for human advancement seemed reasonable. Man might have developed the ability to span and cleave continents, but his footprint was still small and the rewards huge.DeLesseps was a man of his era. And if his visions were not entirely original they were daring and they were attainable. A canal connecting the Mediterranean and the Red Sea was the stuff of Pharaoh's plans. It was not until DeLesseps though that a workable canal was built in 1869. Likewise, a canal joining the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans had been the dream of the Conquistadores, an impossible dream. So when it came time to create such a canal, DeLesseps was the logical choice to lead the project.DeLesseps was able to imbue everyone around him with his own sense of belief and wonder, but like the rest of the world, DeLesseps underestimated Panama. Suez, for all its complexities and hard work, was an easy precursor, a straight-ahead mostly sea level excavation in a hot, arid but not particularly challenging environment. Panama was different. Though needing a much shorter canal, Panama was a vertical mountainous landscape of trackless steaming jungles, torrential downpours, flooding, landslides, and pestilence. Yet DeLesseps never wavered in his belief that a canal---and a sea level canal, at that---could be built across the isthmus.Related to Napoleon III, friends with the British Prime Minister, and a mentor of the King of Egypt, DeLesseps handily convinced both governments and ordinary citizens of the practicality of his plan. Such was his hautre that no one seriously challenged his decisions though they were based on incomplete information. Tens of thousands of small investors put their last francs into the private company responsible for building the canal, including DeLesseps himself. It seemed a sound investment. The canal at Suez had, in only a few years, made its own small investors wealthy.DeLesseps may have been the Pied Piper of Panama. Even in the face of staggering economic losses and endless cost overruns, even in the face of tens of thousands of deaths as tropical diseases ravaged the workmen, people believed in DeLesseps' vision. There's no evidence that he intentionally defrauded or misled anyone, but his own unshakeable faith in the realization of the canal led him to see the project through rose-colored glasses, blinding himself to the fact that the project was failing. His advertising and announcements were full of puffery. When he visited Panama he did so in the dry season, thus avoiding malaria, yellow fever, landslides, and tropical rainstorms. He marveled at the work being done, not recognizing that after years only about ten percent of the canal was dug. When the \\"French Project\\" finally imploded, DeLesseps himself avoided censure, but those around him (including his son) were jailed for misappropriation of funds.Were they guilty? Perhaps only of excessive optimism. The fact (as McCullough amply illustrates) is that the French Project could not have succeeded. The technology to build the canal---such as sufficiently heavy digging equipment and necessary sanitary precautions---simply did not exist or was nascent in the period 1870-1900. Human technology was evolving at a pace faster than any but that of our own time, and even a few months past or future made a significant difference in the \\"possible.\\" The French suffered as well from a strange myopia, failing to adjust their plans to on-site conditions or changing circumstances. A sea level canal was a practically unrealizable result, but rather than going back to the drawing board, the French engineers persisted in building the canal according to the initial vision provided by DeLesseps.In the last analysis, of course, DeLesseps was right. A canal could be built, it would be built, and it was built, though the Panama Canal is a far cry from the simple deep ditch contemplated at the outset. It became a lock canal; and it was widened far beyond what DeLesseps imagined. It became more of what a little-known French engineer, Godin de Lepinay envisioned, a series of lakes connected by a channel.The last French project manager was a DeLesseps-like dreamer, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who continued to promote a canal in Panama despite the fact that the American government (which inherited the French mantle) was in favor of a canal in Nicaragua. Bunau-Varilla hated the idea of a Nicaraguan canal, not least because if the canal was built there he faced a complete loss of his investment in Panama. He became a one-man public relations firm for Panama, courted Congressmen, met with Presidents, hyped the dangers of the Nicaraguan volcanoes, downplayed the dangers of Panamanian earthquakes, of the yellow fever, of malaria, of the physical difficulties he had seen, and promoted Panama as a politically stable place, which it was not as a province of Colombia, but Bunau-Varilla fixed that by staging a bloodless coup in Panama. In a matter of hours, Panama was independent. Scant minutes later, it was recognized by the United States.While there's no real evidence supporting the supposition that the U.S. staged the Panamanian revolution, it certainly guaranteed its success. President Theodore Roosevelt sent American warships down to Panama to \\"keep the peace.\\" The American Consul and the American owners of the Panama Railroad quickly bought off the local Colombian authorities who fired a single shot in symbolic defense (that one shot killed a sleeping civilian), and then departed. Bunau-Varilla, moving at a 21st Century pace, negotiated a treaty with the U.S. that allowed the Americans not only to build the canal, but to control it and a twenty mile-wide coast-to-coast swath of Panama into perpetuity. Before even the Panamanians knew what was happening, Roosevelt ordered work on the canal to resume, and \\"made the dirt fly.\\"But first Roosevelt how to overcome the natural and man-made difficulties which had bedeviled the French Project. He did this in his customary straight-ahead fashion:Roosevelt appointed Dr. William Gorgas as head of Panama's Sanitary Department. Gorgas did away with standing water, installed sewage and plumbing systems, cleared the jungle, and cleaned the streets of Panama. In eighteen months he had effectively ended the twin threats of malaria and yellow fever that had caused Panama to be a deathtrap since time immemorial.Roosevelt appointed Engineer John Stevens to reorganize the work; in fifteen months, Stevens had re-tracked the railroad, upgraded the digging equipment, built numerous new station towns from which an army of workmen could issue, and thoroughly modernized Panama.Roosevelt appointed Major George Washington Goethals of the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise the digging, which restarted in earnest in 1904. Goethals was indomitable. A man of single-minded determination he cold-welded the project into a virtually seamless whole that operated twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, rain or shine for seven more years. After a major landslide undid months of work, Goethals shrugged and said, \\"What the hell...dig it all out again,\\" and they did. McCullough is clearly admiring of Goethals, who was tough but fair and not constitutionally predisposed to accept \\"No\\" for an answer to anything.Very importantly for morale, Roosevelt traveled to the dig, becoming the first U.S. President to leave home during his term. The papers mused that \\"perhaps this portends that a President may someday visit Europe.\\"The Canal Zone, unified in purpose, quickly became a utopia, especially for the predominantly white American administrators of the project who numbered in the thousands. Pay was high, prices low, and anything and everything was available at the PX. Medical care was free. Housing was inexpensive or free, and comfortable, with modern conveniences. Board was a fraction of its U.S. price. Entertainment was readily available at the YMCAs and USO clubs, while the K of C, the K of P, the Elks, the Rotary, and the Shriners all had chapters. The Zone sprouted hundreds of homegrown social organizations besides ranging from book clubs to amateur theatrical groups. The death rate was lower than in the U.S., the birth rate higher. In many ways, the American middle class would not have it again as good until the 1950s. Some people, even in the Zone, called it \\"Socialism,\\" but nobody really objected.The lot of the tens of thousands of black employees was nowhere as good, though McCullough is quick to point out that they too had free healthcare, and that inexpensive board was available to them. They lived in countryside work camps or in the back streets of Colon and Panama City. The large majority of black workmen were Barbadian, and though their toil was wretched, dangerous, and poorly rewarded, it was more than most of them earned in Barbados at the time. Many died of the terrible accidents that were part and parcel of digging and blasting the canal and dragging the millions of tons of rock and soil away. Others died of the tropical maladies that white \\"Zonians\\" no longer had to face. Somewhat cynically, of course, as McCullough reports, the large majority of black workers were not United States citizens and had no advocates. The ones that were Americans were hardly better off. The Zone was a Jim Crow community.McCullough refers to the nine miles of Culebra (now Galliard) Cut as \\"the chief point of attack.\\" It was. A supremely difficult stretch that traversed the Continental Divide, the Cut was prone (even after completion) to terrible landslides that undid much of the builders' work.Unfortunately for THE PATH BETWEEN THE SEAS McCullough spends so much time on the challenges of the Culebra Cut that he overlooks, or nearly so, the immense tasks involved in damming the Chagres River, rerouting the Panama Railroad, resettling the populations displaced by the waterway, creating Gatun Lake and Lake Madden, and in building the vast hydroelectric plant that powered the locks. And although the locks themselves get good coverage, it is clear that the engineering involved in the building of the locks outstrips even McCullough's considerable storytelling skills. Given the over 400 pages of this impressive book, a chapter or two more would not have detracted from the story."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I always wanted to read more but could never get myself to do it.

Chitty, PrologueThe Desert:\\"As a frequent traveler there once told me, 'In the desert you only have to worry about three things: beating the temperature, finding food and water, and not getting lost. But when you master these few things, a whole region of the world stands before you, unopened, ready to be explored,\\" explains Dr. M. C. Steenberg, Fellow in Patristic Theology and Early Church History, University of Oxford, in his study on St. Antony of Egypt, whom Dr. Chitty considered the start point of the massive emergence of the monastic devotion, worldwide.Desert Asceticism:The word 'asceticism,' which generally indicates self-denial, derives from the Greek term askesis, originally meaning exercise, practice, or training. As practiced by the desert Fathers, and early Monastics, has sought solutions to the superficial religion of the newly Egyptian converts, mostly illiterate farmers. Based on a literal response to some of Jesus Christ's teachings (Mark 10:17-31), those novices deserted their families and gave up their possessions to live in the desert, in imitation to Christ, a life of chastity, fasting, and asceticism.Evolution of Monasticism:At the height of Christian asceticism in the Middle East, thousands of monks lived in monastic centers in Egypt, Nitria, Kellia, and Sketes in the West Delta, and Pachomian cenobitic communities in Upper Egypt. Later on the move moved into Palestine, and the Syrian deserts. Some lived in isolated caves, in real seclusion, rarely meeting other humans as did Abba Paul the first hermit. The cenobitic monks, gathered to form communities and build large fortress-like monasteries. Although they sought total isolation, most monks in sketes did not cut all ties with Christian laity. Some debated theological issues, during the early Church councils, some defended religious and administrative issues of their day, as was the case of the Tall Brothers. Other monastics focused on service, since Athanasius time, serving the sick, or burying the dead as was the case of the Philoponoi and Parabolani, which was copied by other Mediterranean cities.The desert a City:These lectures on early Christian monasticism, which Dr. Chitty claims to be no more than an introduction, has been described by Monastic scholar, and Pachomius expert Philip Rousseau, as \\"indispensable is Derwas J. Chitty, The desert a City. It is a gem, already proven a real classic. Few recent studies of this crucial period in the history of the monastic movement match it for its painstaking scholarship which combined well searched history, archeology and tradition with vivid and talented writing. This inspiring book has kept vivid in my Coptic conscience the great devotion underlying the monastic ideal in all ages. Dr. Chitty, one of the pioneer scholars of this period, deals with the golden age of Egyptian monasticism and describes the main founders of the movement Anthony, Athanasius, and Pachomius. He follows the development of monastic life in all its forms in Egypt to the end of the fourth century, when the movement migrated to Palestine. He gives a devoted accounts of St. Saba and the great ascetics of Palestine. As he mentioned in the prologue to his book, the study did not consider either Syria or Cappadocia (Asia Minor)."},{"Title":"The Desert a City: An Introduction to the Study of Egyptian and Palestian Monasticism Under the Christian Empire","review":"This is indeed a classic but it is by no means the first book you should read about early asceticism. As a true introduction I would recommend William Harmless'sDesert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism. Harmless very aptly says of Chitty's book: \\"[It is] a dense network of names and places and events -- too dense, I believe, for the real beginner. It is also full of brilliant passing insights and wonderful throwaway lines whose cogency is lost on most. And so I find Chitty's work not so much an introduction, but rather a wise road map for those who are already knee-deep in the literature.\\""},{"Title":"The Silence of the Heart: Reflections of the Christ Mind - Part II","review":"Although this book is good, and I continue to read it (almost finished), I have underlined very little in it. Compare this toLove Without Conditions: Reflections of the Christ Mind, which I read with greater speed, more underlining and with a more profound sense of satisfaction and increased awareness.I will be tryingThe Twelve Steps of Forgivenessnext, another Paul Ferrini book. I expect that I will gain much from it, since being able to love without conditions does require forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Heart: Reflections of the Christ Mind - Part II","review":"The Silence of the heart is the place we find ourselves after we get out of the cycle of victimhood and commit to honoring ourselves. It is the place where we can embrace our feelings and experiences in the moment without judgment. It is a place of pure, non-judgmental awareness.To reach this place, we must stop complaining and take responsibility for our own healing. We have the tools to extricate ourselves from our suffering, we just need to acknowledge them. We need to face the scared, unhappy, wounded, angry child inside who feels unfairly treated, and help him let go of his wounds.The Silence of the Heart walks us through a recipe for spiritual healing: 1) accept and feel the pain, 2) admit your mistakes, 3) accept your feelings, 4) bring love to the self, 5) become aware of self-violation, 6) forgive yourself, 7) bring love to the wound, 8) prevent further abuse by always honoring your self (ask for what you want, do not accept what you do not want).You must always hold onto compassion for yourself.When we succeed at fully loving and honoring ourselves, then we can apply this to others in our relationships without judging or fixing. We cannot give to others until we first learn to give to ourselves. And by extension, when we learn to give to ourselves, our compassionate natures will cause us to give to others absent judgment.This is a book that is so full of profound wisdom on such a plethora of relevant topics, you will wear your pencil out from underlining. You will refer back to it again and again, and you will find yourself sharing it and quoting it with friends. Like another reviewer said, it is not always a comfortable read in that it confronts you to take full responsibility for every aspect of your experience and shakes you free from your denial. But it is simultaneously comforting in its unending compassion for the work we all must do. If you are ready to take responsibility for your healing, growth, and ultimate happiness, you will embrace this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Heart: Reflections of the Christ Mind - Part II","review":"This book has recently be translated into Dutch; title: &quot;Stilte van het hart&quot;. I am amazed about the fact that it appears to answer all the important questions about life I have--even the ones I wasn't fully aware of until now. It may be especially helpful for people who feel confused about matters of religion or faith, but also for people who chose a spiritual path and are satisfied with their choice--just to enlighten things that are not yet fully clear to them.

I found this book to open up areas within me, where I generally gloss over. In some parts of the book I felt that I came face to face with the deepest places of my psyche and for that reason found this to be one of the most important books I have read in my spiritual journey. This is not a book where I found myself polarized or locked into a particular point of view, but one that allowed me to open up and search fearlessly for the sources of my beliefs. Where I could move beyond my judgements, see my own mind at work and feel the center of my being. This book was a journey to and through my heart and soul.

If you're not ready to take responsibility for every single one of your actions, this is not the book for you. If you're not ready to understand that judging others is simply refusing to forgive a part of yourself, this is not the book for you.

Stewart, in this book, combines the wit and sarcasm of his of his collumn with the vivd observation of his newly integrated family in, arguably, one of the funniest books ever. Few humor books are much more than amusing, whereas this one should contain a warning not to read while trying to go to sleep.

Plutarch is not an easy read, filled with dense syntax, and page long sentences, something I would more likely fault with the translation. However, it can be a very rewarding read. Plutarch chose those from the glory days of greece, who he thought best represented the ideal of heroism, wisdom, political skills, or even those he considered lucky. Plutarch's idea of the ideal man,would most likely differ from those of the modern reader, but they provide a glimpse into the unchangingness of man's complete inconsistencely. From the larger than life, mad arrogance of Alexander the great, the quiet non-conquering, communists before communists were cool Lycurgus, to the slightly naive, overly trusting Solon the law giver, or Alcibiades, the conqueror who was too good, or my favorite, the unsavory themosticles, who sold his services to greek and persian alike, or my least, Demosthenes, an excellent orator, who was all talk and never stood on principle. Plutarch does an excellent job of hitting all the high points of the golden era of greek history, but even more than that he tells the familiar story of those men who make the right decisions, who sieze the moment and who play their hand to its fullest and those who tragically fall short, or from overextending their reach fall from a high perch.I give this work a 4 instead of a 5, because the translation was staid, stolid and only relented occaisionally from its unneccessary pretentiousness, and that Plutarch actually wrote a history about Theseus, a myth, and then related every single permutation of that myth ad nauseum, so if you pick this up, avoid Theseus and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Broadway Musical Stars Paper Dolls","review":"This is another excellent paper doll book by Tom Tierney.

The book allows us to rethink our views of Sufism as a pacifist alternative to Wahhabi Islam. Not in Java. There is not much theology in the exposition but readers who care about Java will take the hints that he gives. His main source was hanging out and talking to people. He also used periodical literature to spur discussion. The two periodicals are Pos Kota and Tempo. One targets workers and the other has a more middle class style and feel."},{"Title":"A New Criminal Type in Jakarta: Counter-Revolution Today","review":"In my opinion one of the most original, provocative and successful works of anthropology to be written in the past few decades. Siegel's extremely subtle and complex lines of argumentation may be difficult to follow, however, for those unfamiliar with his interlocutors due to his avoidance (critique) of Anglo-US academic norms of citation. So familiarity with the writings and key concepts of Benjamin, Schmitt, Freud, Lacan and Derrida, to name a few, would greatly enhance the reading of this text. However, it seems that what Siegel is in fact demonstrating (and indeed in a very radical way) is that this work, and ethnography more generally, is capable of standing on its own terms; and this book may well appeal to a much wider readership because of that. A highly complex book despite its small size. And the material that is presented - the state sponsored massacres of \\"criminals\\" in the wider historical context of Indonesian nationalism - is compelling. Highly recommended to both academics and general readers."},{"Title":"A New Criminal Type in Jakarta: Counter-Revolution Today","review":"A remarkably insightful account of the relationships within Java's political state, religion, and cultural setting.

Much as I love the Fairacre and Thrush Green series, it is always difficult when a beloved character, like Dolly Clare, dies. Once you are drawn into Miss Read's universe, you never want to leave. It's such a warm, comforting, soothing place; you feel as though you know every character and their quirks after just a few books. So you feel as though Miss Clare is a much loved old friend. It's difficult not to admire and love her; the British Empire must have been built on the sturdy backs and common sense, and faith of millions of men and women like Miss Clare. She never makes a big splash in the way of the world, but she influenced, and was loved by all of her pupils and neighbors. She had rare common sense, and humor, allied to a keen intelligence, and she had courage. These books are a journey into a lost world. When I was a child, there were still neighborhoods and people like Miss Clare, and her friends. Those have all but vanished, but you can revisit them over again, in Miss Read's lovely books. Prepare to shed a few tears, or a lot of tears, over the passing of gentle Dolly Clare, but rejoice with Miss Read that Dolly has left her the cottage and it's contents, and secured her future. I have every book in the Fairacre and Thrush Green series, and I find myself rereading them every year, or every other year. No matter how many times you have read them, you can't escape their gentle spell, and kinder worlds. Despite the fact that Dora Saint sometimes switches facts in the same or subsequent books, you just smile, because it's something we all do, from time to time. For instance, in one of the first books, the Coggs twins are already in Miss Clare's class, but at the end of the book, Mrs. Coggs appears to be just registering them for school! The sex of Tibby the cat goes from female to male, and back again, without any explanation. One can assume that Tibby dies and is replaced by another Tibby, but not within the span of pages! That is the only fault I find with these books, other than the fact that there are only so many of them. Any time is right for a Fairacre fix, so sit down with a cup of tea, your very own Tibby, and prepare to be enchanted. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you enjoy Miss Read, then you have probably also discovered D.E. Stevenson and Jan Karon, who also write about small towns and villages, and recurring characters. If you haven't discovered those ladies, yet, let me suggest that you do. You are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Changes at Fairacre","review":"When I can pick up a book and instantly be removed from the real world to a world of sweeter times I know I will read the book more than once!"},{"Title":"Changes at Fairacre","review":"great story So sad miss claire died but knew it was going to happen sometime looking forward to other books!"},{"Title":"Changes at Fairacre","review":"Any of the books by Miss Read (Dora Saint) are balm for life in today's busy world.

Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take CROSSFIRE TRAIL for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed CROSSFIRE TRAIL, a tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. The fan of the movie of the same title, starring Tom Selleck, should note that there are some differences between the screenplay and the book. But all in all the story is the same and is just as enjoyable in print as the story told on the big screen. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail (The Louis L'Amour Collection)","review":"Louis L'Amour often wrote novels of men whose strength of character was their best redeeming quality although they were handy with guns and were rough and tough when it mattered. Rafe Caradec's promise to a dying man kicks off this tale that begins on a ship and plays out in Wyoming amid lawless men and unfriendly Indians. The story has touches of romance and plenty of shootouts and fistfights, and as usual, the bad guys get what's coming to them. Caradec does seem to good to be true but the tale is a good read and ranks as one of his best western yarns."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail (The Louis L'Amour Collection)","review":"Louis L'Amour may not have had the prettiest writing style but his westerns had such an easy and relatable accessability to them that readers readily snapped them up. And, actually, L'Amour's love of the wild west and the old frontier was so palpable that many passages of his novels did end up reading like poetry. I've read most of his stuff and, bar none, this guy is my favorite writer of westerns (well, okay, Zane Grey, as well). CROSSFIRE TRAIL is just one sample of L'Amour's ability to transport the reader back to the old west, when your word meant a whole lot more, when men were hardy (and probably very dusty) and a trusty horse and a well-oiled pistol determined life or death. I'm sure things weren't so black and white back then or that simple, but L'Amour drew a clear line between the dastardly and the heroic. And, always, always, he told an exciting story.L'Amour's protagonists are basically all cut from the same mold. Much like how one takes it for granted that mystery author Dick Francis's heroes are inevitably urbane, unassuming, and grittily resolute in the face of adversity, Louis L'Amour almost without exception writes his leading men as lean, tall, strong, upright and very capable. They're all heller with a gun, peerless in a brawl and savvy in the ways of the west. Rafe Caradec, the central character of CROSSFIRE TRAIL, fits all this to a T. In the parlance of his time, Caradec is a man to ride the river with.CROSSFIRE TRAIL was published in 1954, and it's a testament to L'Amour's skills and timeless appeal that this story doesn't at all read as dated. It's a fast-paced story of survival in the wilderness and a reckoning in Wyoming. Rafe Caradec, on the surface, is a rough sort, skilled with a gun and with his fists. A man of commanding presence, he escapes from forced shipboard labor, vowing to keep a promise he made to Charles Rodney, a dead friend left behind. Rafe makes his way to Wyoming, set on looking up and protecting Rodney's family and wresting back Rodney's ranch, of which ownership is currently in question. In the tiny cowtown of Painted Rock, Rafe Caradec runs into a world of trouble.He learns quickly that Painted Rock is controlled by a gang of scoundrels and stone cold killers. Worse, the gang's conniving head honcho, Bruce Barkow, is engaged to Rodney's beautiful daughter, Ann. Worse than that? Ann doesn't at all believe Rafe's story and instead suspects that Rafe is out to get the ranch for himself. But Rafe is not without unexpected facets. He's able to buffalo the thugs with mere talk (even if it's talk bolstered by the threat of imminent violence). In a courtroom scene, he smoothly acquits himself from a charge of murder. Gradually, Rafe begins to turn the tide. And, naturally, Bruce Barkow, slated initially as the book's prohibitive Big Bad, persists in resorting to underhanded means. But someone lurks in the wings and, as it turns out, this hombre is a lot worse and far more frightening than Barkow.To add more texture to the thing, the Sioux hover somewhere in the backdrop and there's the mystery of why Barkow so covets Rodney's land. CROSSFIRE TRAIL, like most of L'Amour's novels, reads like a bullet and offers plenty of Rafe Caradec bracing his enemies, resulting in blazing gunplay and a hellacious brawl or two or three. And while L'Amour never was one to get muddied too much in epic love story, he does throw in the occasional romantic spark. Let's just say, it's not too long before Ann Rodney begins to have serious misgivings about her shifty fiance.No surprises in this book, as CROSSFIRE TRAIL isn't really Louis L'Amour at his tiptop best. But nonetheless this is a pretty riveting no-frills read, and it's a lot of fun watching the dangerous Rafe Caradec outtalking, outthinking, and outfighting those what done him and his friends wrong. Reading Louis L'Amour's vivid descriptions of the lay of the land and the people inhabiting it, you can't help but soak in the old west atmosphere and the rugged culture. As usual, L'Amour tacks descriptive sobriquets onto several of his characters (Texas Brisco, Bully Borger, Gee Bonaro, Trigger Boyne), catchy nicknames being an element prevalent in the western mythos. And, as well, the occasional homespun vernacular lends one more touch of authenticity. I've said this elsewhere, there's Zane Grey and there's Louis L'Amour. In my eyes, every other western writer takes a back seat."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail (The Louis L'Amour Collection)","review":"&quot;Law was still largely a local matter&quot;. This quote is typical for this book, as the book is an action-packed, suspenseful western. L'Amour's purpose in writing this novel is to entertain the reader, and to give you a little feel of old America. He pulls this off with a depictive setting, varied characters, laid-back country accents, and lots of irony.Rafe Caradec, a rough and rowdy man, who hold his word sacred, sets out to fulfill his promise to a deadman to save his ranch and his family. Caradec is accused of being crooked himself, but finds a way to overcome.Through the setting, L'Amour is capable of putting the reader in a western, old-American frame-of-mind. &quot;There was no trail through the tall grass but he one that mind could make, or the instinct of the cattle moving toward water...&quot;. The description of the setting throughout the novel is detailed and vivid to the mind.&quot;A big man with wide shoulders sat at a scarred mess table...&quot;. Characterization plays a key-role in the novel. Rafe Caradec is a big and dangerous man. He is contrasted against Bruce Barkow throughout the novel. Barkow is the crook of the story, in who comes to be defeated.The plot in this story is really simplistic and flat. It's your common, everyday western. Being such, it's very predictable. As far as plot aspect goes, the novel is not very elaborate. But not to worry, the effectiveness of setting, characterization, and language make up for the ineffectiveness of the elements of plot.The language in this book is easy-reading. L'Amour uses simple diction throughout the novel. &quot;Me for the gold fields in Nevady&quot;. Laid-back country accents are also used. This helps pull of the western feel of the novel.In conclusion, without giving it all away, that is the basics of Louis L'Amour's Crossfire Trail.

And Louis Lamour is always a favorite. Not because of the tough and gritty &quot;Howdy Pardner&quot; kind of cowboy, but because I find him funny, his characters likeable, his books a quick read and an amazing escape from reality. Sometimes, too many of the books I read are too serious, or too dramatic, or too thought provoking, but Louis Lamour can be counted on for straight facts. There is always a bank robber, and always a person who &quot;needed killin'&quot; and always a damsel in distress or a least a damsel who catches the main character's eye. Kind of like a Harlequin for a break in serious realms, I always enjoy him."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail (The Louis L'Amour Collection)","review":"As usual it is different from the movie but is very good.

This quote is typical for this book, as the book is an action-packed, suspenseful western. L'Amour's purpose in writing this novel is to entertain the reader, and to give you a little feel of old America. He pulls this off with a depictive setting, varied characters, laid-back country accents, and lots of irony.Rafe Caradec, a rough and rowdy man, who hold his word sacred, sets out to fulfill his promise to a deadman to save his ranch and his family. Caradec is accused of being crooked himself, but finds a way to overcome.Through the setting, L'Amour is capable of putting the reader in a western, old-American frame-of-mind. &quot;There was no trail through the tall grass but he one that mind could make, or the instinct of the cattle moving toward water...&quot;. The description of the setting throughout the novel is detailed and vivid to the mind.&quot;A big man with wide shoulders sat at a scarred mess table...&quot;. Characterization plays a key-role in the novel. Rafe Caradec is a big and dangerous man. He is contrasted against Bruce Barkow throughout the novel. Barkow is the crook of the story, in who comes to be defeated.The plot in this story is really simplistic and flat. It's your common, everyday western. Being such, it's very predictable. As far as plot aspect goes, the novel is not very elaborate. But not to worry, the effectiveness of setting, characterization, and language make up for the ineffectiveness of the elements of plot.The language in this book is easy-reading. L'Amour uses simple diction throughout the novel. &quot;Me for the gold fields in Nevady&quot;. Laid-back country accents are also used. This helps pull of the western feel of the novel.In conclusion, without giving it all away, that is the basics of Louis L'Amour's Crossfire Trail. This is truly a great western...now get to reading it!"},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail (The Louis L'Amour Collection)","review":"Hollywood does not do this book justice.

Good read on a rainy day!"},{"Title":"The Doryman's Reflection: A Fisherman's Life","review":"More than just a fishing book, Molyneaux took me above and below the waves and into the halls of government where polcies were set that targeted people like the book's main character, Bernard Raynes. Molyneaux gives an intimate portrayal of the Bernard, whose English and Acadian French ancestors fished the Gulf of Maine since the 1600s, and depicts how that rich heritage has enabled Raynes to survive in the face of an antognistic political climate and resource scarcity. The book is beautifully written and contains lessons that go way beyond fishing."},{"Title":"The Doryman's Reflection: A Fisherman's Life","review":"Paul's a friend and some of this is familiar through conversations we've had and times we've lived through. We haven't seen each other for several years and just recently reconnected via email. As soon as I could I bought the book and have been reading it-it's like we are still talking and I've emailed him my first response;\\"It's like having a conversation with you-it's cool and spooky-the book is beautifully written-of course. The description of you and Bernard pulling up the fish with the seawater streaming over white knuckles was superb of course, of course.The dark water-all of it. I can't separate it from you and the line about living another man's memories you spoke to me and reading the book I'm living them too.Maureen\\"Paul's style is so accessible and everyone in Maine should read this book. We all have a brother or uncle or cousin or sister or mother or grandparent that is just like one of the Raynes or like Paul or one of his boatmates. Everyone not in Maine will see human truth in the story as well. The last chapter Poets and Warriors is immediately recongizable to me-that was the period when we were warriors and poets watching this world we knew culminate and turn into something else.This book is important from an ecological standpoint-it reaffirms the human connection to our environment. There are generations of farmers who've lost the land and builders who've lost their craft-everything seems to erode, if we let it. Paul reminds us that the vast ocean has been depleted by our policies and inattention and lack of care for the human connections we have to our world.Buy it-read it-my friend has a voice that should be heard."},{"Title":"The Doryman's Reflection: A Fisherman's Life","review":"Thanks for the quick shipment.

While the book is very serious, it is also an enjoyable book to read and not at all a strident \\"the sky is falling-scream and shout and dance about\\" type thing. Paul Molyneau writes very well and writes about what he knows. The book is in five sections, each of which is a complete story or booklet, able to stand on its own, it can be read over a number of nights or airline flights. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in and cares about the coastal environment, the sea, fishing and the fish we eat."},{"Title":"The Doryman's Reflection: A Fisherman's Life","review":"Molyneaux is a beautiful writer, and tells his story so honestly that it is a prize in my collection of books about commercial fishing. As a former commercial fisherman on the west coast, my eyes were opened to the similarity in the east coast struggles to hold onto a way of life.The fishermen themselves did not understand what they were doing to the fish stocks, and then the government(s) in the name of improving the situation, gave what was left to the corporations, are rapidly wiping out the small-scale fishermen, and the environmentalists, in their urgency to save fish, did not recognize that fishermen too are a species worth saving. That seems to be changing, that is fishermen and environmentalists are beginning to see their common interest.

I'm glad I did.This moving and disturbing story tells the tale of Owen Cassidy, an 8 year old who disappeared from his home one Halloween and was never seen again. It's about his father Nick, who has been in self-imposed exile from his wife Susan, who comes home for the 10 year anniversary of his son's disappearance.It's about Min, the rookie guard who has never forgotten her first major case, and her struggle following the unexpected death of her husband to cope with her job and her young twin sons.And it's about the other people affected by Owen's life and disappearance.I couldn't put this one down, finishing the book in the wee small hours of Sunday morning. Not a pleasant read, by any stretch of the imagination, as the subject matter is frank and disturbing. Adultery, lies, mental illness, child abuse, paedophilia and loss and sorrow.I'm busy hunting down more from this new to me author..."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I had been pretty dissapointed in Lord of The Silent; I thought that all the interesting loose ends had been tied up at the end of the book. However, the Golden One brings the focus back on our favorite heroine, Amelia Peabody. The plot was delightfully complex and kept me on the edge of my seat. Even with Ramses and Nefret married, the book still had some tension, though I liked the series better before they were married. The book also did not tie up every single problem so we can all expect that the next Amelia Peabody mystery will be as interesting or better. However, I found Sethos' turn for the good a little unrealistic and I wished there was more from the rest of the family. This series is great for anyone who likes good mysteries or has an interest in Egyptology. Elizabeth Peters is a highly competant author who knows her subject and her Amelia Peabdody series is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"This book will certainly have you turning pages through the first 350 pages. The last 100 or so seem a bit anti-climatctic, but this book is a gem anyway. In it we have two main adventures. The first part of the book is devoted to beautiful Luxor and tomb robbers, murder and mayhem. The second part puts the Emersons right in the thick of World War I intrigue between England and Turkey, and puts all of them, especially Ramses in grave danger. But as usual, through all the suspense you will laugh throughout. These characters that Ms. Peters has created are so life-like that they jump out of the pages at you and inhabit your heart. What a wonderful series this is!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I am a huge fan of the Amelia Peabody books! This one was great, but it took awhie to get into it. The mystery was not as exciting as some of the others and there weren't many twists, but that was OK. Amelia and Emerson are, as usual, very humorous and fun. Nefret and Ramses are great to read about too. And the newest addition to the Emerson's... the Great Cat of Re... is tons of fun. However, I WOULD NOT read this book as a first. I would definately start with Crocodile on the Sandbank, or, if you just can't wait, The Ape Who Guards the Balance. There are some things in The Golden One that would give away some important stuff."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I just love this series, fun, witty, intersting - they are a mystery, action, comedy, romance, historical fiction and documentary rolled into one.Golden One is mystery and spy action set with backdrop of WWI and egyptology, with the emerson family behind the scenes all for one and one for all activities.Satisfying in itself but makes more sense having read the series. I haven't felt this good about characters since Laurie R King's &quot;Mary Russel&quot;. So excited that there are more to come."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Unlike many series where you can just jump in with any book, this series should begin as the author has written it, in chronological order. You meet the characters as they meet each other, and form relationships, can create their histories which are as much a part of any book in the series as is the history of Ancien Egypt. There are constant references to past adventures, and the reader who begins other than at the beginning will be confused.Fortunately they are all delightful, and reading the first naturally leads into the second, and so on. The latest is particularly delightful, and the bargain book in the entire series. There are two separate plots in the book, and it could have ended with the resolution of the first. The second simply feels like a another book. Very generous of Ms. Peters, but just a bit odd. The characters are vividly drawn, the action exciting, and there's lots of historical/cultural information.Do read!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Oh, how I love Elizabeth Peters and her stunning cast of characters! I was afraid the series would get stale after the marriage of Ramses &amp; Nefret and the way things were &quot;resolved&quot; with Sethos, but I was wrong! The story did drag on a bit in spots, but overall it was a fun read and a welcome addition to the series. Now if only David &amp; Lia could make an appearance in the next book...."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I am a big fan of historical novels and buy a lot when they become paperbacks; however, there are three authors that are so good I will only pay their novels in hardback. They are keepers, and re-readers! The entire Amelia Peabody series by Peters is worth owning due to the following facts: the author has done her homework and knows a great deal about Egyptian archeology; every book has excellent characterization (where she actually allows her characters to evolve and grow mentally, emotionally, as well as physically); tight complex plots with a fresh humorous twist; and a sensitivity to other cultures.By the way, the other two authors who excel in this field are Anne Perry and Laurie King."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Elizabeth Peters has given us another wonderful story about our favorite characters, the Peabody's and Friends. Folks, I own the complete set of this series, and I'm hooked. As a reader, it's really the characters I love and care about. The story, as always is light, but fully paced as we really do want to know what happens next, and who was that, and how did that happen, and...and...but always with a light, delicate touch, that gives the reader pleasure, and not pain. Although the Peabody series is labeled &quot;Mystery&quot;, I would reccommend this series to anyone who enjoys a &quot;delightful&quot; read."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I am a died in the wool Amelia and Emerson fan, but this latest book did not have the 'spit and vinegar' that I have come to expect from Peters. It was slow going in many sections and the thrill and excitement were not there for me. In other words, the plot(s) were flat. I still enjoyed the book and loved meeting the old characters again but they lacked the vim and vigor they had in earlier works. Of course Amelia and Emerson are getting older so the adventures are rightfully passed to the younger generation. But I hope to see the old Amelia return."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I am astounded by this book! The Golden One is full of supprises and adventrues.

Characters get introduced and recur in a series that it can be hard for the beginning reader to get a handle on. Looking at the other reviewers of the book, it appears that my view may suffer from this entry into Peters' \\"Amelia Peabody\\" series with book 14.Saying that, the book was enjoyable. Peters has a doctorate and egyptology and it enables her to give a vivid portrait of WWI Egypt, and knowing a little about the period myself (though not to Peters' extent) an accurate one.The Peabodys -- Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret -- are an engaging group and their adventures are quite fun. I liked the descriptive nature of Peters' writing. The humor is light, but not overly slapstick. The plot, however, was weak, though again this comes from someone who has not read the earlier books of the series and thus the minor characters who moved in and out of the telling had nuances that were lost on me.The overall 3 stars is a \\"rounding down\\" as I would put it at just shy of a 3.5, but my caveat would be to start with the earlier books in the series. A theme that seems to be shared by the other reviewers."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Probably the best mystery author I have ever read. Great mix of mystery and history. The dynamics of the family are interesting to watch as well. Emilia is hilarious and Ramses is fantastic in his role but why does Emerson have nothing to say but \\"hell and damnation\\"?Overall-Good story."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Elizabeth Peters is at her best once again! I can't get enogh of this Emerson clan.This new adventure brings back Jamil, the youngest son of Yusuf and trickster of the Emerson's. He claims that he has found a new tomb. But before Amelia can interogate Jamil, he dies... but with his last words are\\"in the hand of the God\\" huh?Then \\"Mr. Smith\\" whose true name is hyphenated and unpronouncable, asks Ramses to found out if Ismail Pasha is Sethos gone traitor or Sethos just really getting involved in his role... and since Ramses is such a nice family man, he agrees.It takes him to Gaza, under cover in the labour corps. Must i say that his family also went to Gaza in disguise. Emerson as an Arab (Don't forget the beard!!) with 2 wives. Amelia his chief wife and Nefret his \\"favorite\\". Their reis also attends the lastest adventure, as a servant or something to Emerson.Once Ramses' mission is complete and i will not give away anything on that account, They return to luxor to excavate with The Vandergelt's. Bertie is showing real promise and making Cyrus 'gosh-durn proud'. Nefret has her own little secret that she reveals and it's quite a shocker...and the way Emerson behaves with the news is...cute!This is a great read... took me a day and half to read... and i've read it twice since then. I hope Ms. Peters hurrys up and writes another book in the series, i want to see how Sennia reacts to Nefrets news!!!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"The Peabody mysteries are the best series I have ever read. She makes you feel that you are right there seeing her life unfold. The mysteries of Egypt are astounding and funny. Great book."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"This is the first book in the series that I picked up. I have no need to pick up any before it, because the author starts the book by describing every plot point of the thirteen that preceded it! When the exhaustive preamble finally concludes, a plot of sorts does begin to ponderously unfold. Unfortunately, we lose a driving character halfway through, just in time for a series of events that have nothing to do with the mystery to begin. When that finally gets wrapped up, the characters return to the main story just in time to conclude the book with a rushed and unsatisfying denouemont. I do give this book three stars, merely because the descriptions did make me want to join the characters for a whiskey and soda in the middle of the Egyptian landscape."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Elizabeth Peters seems to be running out of steam with Amelia, Emerson, et. al. The series was once a really wonderful one. Now, I still follow along since I've liked the characters so much over the years, but the characters themselves seem tired at times, and the plots are predicatable and often flabby. Moreover, the humor -- once such an important part of the series -- is now much rarer. I still enjoy the books overall -- and The Golden One is no exception -- but they aren't what they once were."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I love this series but just couldn't get interested in this book; I almost had to make myself finish it. If you are a loyal fan you will get much more enjoyment out of this book than if it is the first time you have read the series. A bit predictable"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Peters is back in form with this latest entry in The Peabody Lexicon. By any means it is a great improvement over \\"Lord of the Silent\\". Lets hope that Nefret gives birth without difficulty to a fine healthy boy who takes after Ramses to the T. It will help put the spark back into this mystery series. In a sense it is a shame that Peters choose to have Nefret lose her first child, even though it was sired by that idiot she had chosen to marry. That child could easilly have provided some spunk to the series."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Elizabeth Peters has developed the familiar as our own family characters in this 14th outing of the Emersons and their kith and kin in Egypt in 1917. The plot is typical Peters - tombs to find, killers to capture, espionage adventures that showcase the son, Ramses for the true hero he is - But what has impressed me in the entire series is the character developement - from the 1st book Crocodile on the Sandbank, which brings Amelia in contact with the vibrant Emerson, to the birth of their son, Walter (Ramses), to the introduction of the beautiful Nefret in one of the best of the series, The Last Camel Died at Noon, we see the family and their servants and workers and what they mean to their lives - Their reis, Abdullah, is a strong presence that is felt even now - The best thing about this progression is we finally get to see what each character means to each other, and that is wonderful.Yes, there are great adventures, yes, there are recurring villians, and new villians to come, but the fun of these novels makes you feel you are in that time and in that place and enjoying every second of it.For those of you thinking of buying The Golden One, I suggest you start with the 1st and work your way up - You'll be delighted you did."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"One would think that reading 13 books in the Amelia Peabody Emerson series would be enough. But there can never be enough Amelia! This lastest book continues Ms. Peters' great tradition, or as she says, edification of the most astounding journals of one of the greatest(and most opinionated) women Egyptologists of the time. This book continues the narration of Mrs. Emerson's, and her husband, Radclife Emerson's adventures and their work in the field of archeology. Their equally talented and intellegent son, Ramses and his wife, Nefret, join them in their search for ancient tombs and pyramids. This book takes them back to Egypt during the war-torn days of the First World War. Again, the Emersons encounter corpses, secret agents, old nemises and danger around every corner. Amelia, Emerson and Nefret follow Ramses, who is once again called up by the British Secret Service, into the desert and encounter, once again, their old nemisis, Sethos.This book is a must=read for anyone who loves Agatha Christie mysteries, Victorian society, romance or Epyptology. As Ms. Peters holds a Ph.D. in Egyptology, she does an outstanding job describing the excavation of tombs and the archeological methods of the late 19th century, not to mention the colonial and Egyptian lifestyle in Egypt at the turn of the century.Some may find Amelia's ramblings in her &quot;journal&quot; annoying, but as this book is kept in the true Victorian writing style, this should be over looked and enjoyed. All in all I would give this lastest addition a huge Two Thumbs Up! Brava, Ms. Peters!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"As a devoted fan of Amelia Peabody, I've faithfully followed the series with each book. The earlier novels were funny, infused with Ramses' precocious exploits as a child, Amelia's musing on the inferiority of the male gender, and rich displays of romantic imagination. As Ramses grew into a teen, the novels became a little less campy and a little more serious, the tension of the novels often residing in the Ramses-Nefret relationship or the Amelia-Sethos-Emerson triangle. In this latest novel, Peter's heart just doesn't seem to be in it. The plot seems forced, the sense of what-will-happen-next is missing (Rames and Nefret are safely married, Amelia and Sethos are a &quot;has been&quot; item), and the war has erased the humor. The tension in the novel comes almost wholly from a rather mundane plot versus the characters' relationships, making it fairly dull compared with earlier Peabody novels. Amelia's character, the heart of the book, seems to lack the love of life she used to have and none of the characters around her are as interestingly as they used to be. Has Peters grown tired of the Peabody series? This book reads as if it has been churned out rather than written with Peter's former humor and warmth."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"For those who worried that there was no where for the Amelia Peabody storyline to go after Ramses and Nefret married or that the elder Emersons would be phased out for the younger generation...Don't Worry! The Golden One is Peters at her best with interwoven storylines, multiple villians and all of the Emersons thouroughly engaged in the highjinks! With the very satisfying clues dropped at the end of the book hinting at future escapades, I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I very much enjoy the entire Amelia Peabody series, and this is a fine addition. There are very few mysteries whose characters have much depth or history, which I appreciate, so I espcially enjoy the length of this series (14 so far). The 30 years of the Peabody /Emmerson adventures have kept me highly entertained. Ms. Peters is one of the few mystery authors who allows her charecters to develop significant relationships, and then builds those charecters into the story (so tierd of the cynical loner types)! Amliea &amp; co. continue to deal with archeological, world and family events which are both suspensful and amusing. The plot wanders a little, but that just gave me more to read. If you haven't read the whole series, you should. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I really enjoyed all of the &quot;Amelia&quot; stories, however, I felt as if this was two storylines stuffed into one book - the missing tomb and the adventures in Gaza. It would have been much more fun to have two books written; one on each topic instead of two unrelated storylines.Having said that, it was still a good read and I loved the development of Sethos and his daughter. Can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"of course you'll need to read the latest installment. However I'd recommend getting a library copy if possible and waiting for paperback before purchasing a copy for your own shelves.As in the last few books in the series, Ms. Peters seems to have lost focus, unsure of how to treat the affects of the Great War on Amelia and company. The archeological mystery feels trivial in comparison to the happenings in the world beyond Luxor. The adventure into espionage is perfunctory and fragmented. And the way Sethos has become a Deus Ex Machina makes me irritated with a character I formerly loved.If I were truly honest, this book probably deserves less than 3 stars. But my enduring affection for the series made it readable. I just wish I hadn't paid hard cover prices."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"The Golden OneI tend to stick with certain authors through a great deal of thick or thin before I give up totally. But I have to admit that the last few of Amelia Peabody/Emerson's adventures have been a bit trying. She and her husband Emerson have always been strong-minded to the point of obnoxiousness, but, beyond a certain point, it gets monotonous and even a little sad instead of funny. It is quite a relief to find that Elizabeth Peters is back on track, if not headed down another path entirely.Make no mistake; this is the usual heady brew of stolen antiquities, hidden tombs, Ramses' heroics and Amelia's infernal meddling. And it is the regular cast of nearly 20 very eccentric characters. But something special seems to have happened. Peters has made them all lighten up and take themselves quite a bit less seriously. Not only is the end result far less ponderous, but the tongue in cheek interplay of the characters reveals not just their faults, but many of their more endearing qualities as well.The story takes place in 1917, with the Emerson's returning to Egypt for some extended digging. They have decided to settle in for the duration of the war rather than risk being sunk by u-boats while traveling back in forth. They arrive amid rumors that thieves have found and emptied yet another tomb. The Emersons descend upon Luxor determined to unearth the culprits. Of course, they quickly find that the emptied tomb isn't quite empty. Someone seems to have left a corpse in it.There was a time when this would have provided enough plot for an entire Emersonian melodrama. But, in those days, there were four or five regular characters, not the twenty we have now. This time Ramses is again drawn into the deadly game of spies. It seems you can never have just one Emerson, though, and all four Emersons pile into a motorcar and race off to Gaza, behind enemy lines, checking up on a certain cousin Ismail.Before the Emerson's are done, they will have baffled the Turks, terrorized the thieves, embarrassed British military intelligence, chased back and forth across the desert in search of a mysterious tomb and... Well, suffice it to say, that almost everything that could happen does, repeatedly. In fact, there are more than enough loose ends to guarantee a sequel. And enough excitement to ensure that this reader will once again line up to buy it. Be warned, this series is long past the point where it is easy to dive right in and understand all the subplots. The book is enjoyable on its own, but seeking out some of the earlier novels in this series will make it even more rewarding."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Having been just [very] slightly disappointed in the last book in this series, Lord of the Silent, I was brought back to loving this series once again with this entry. There are the usual elements of an Amelia Peabody mystery: a couple of dead bodies, some threats made against the family, Emerson screaming, Peabody knowing all, Ramses being enigmatic and so forth.In this episode, Amelia and family are being led to believe that someone has found a previously undiscovered royal tomb. They waver back &amp; forth as to whether this is possible or not but continue to think about the clues pointing in that direction.Meanwhile, Ramses is convinced by the army to sneak himself into the enemy-controlled Gaza to discover if their old nemesis, Sethos, has indeed gone over to the enemy. Amelia, Emerson, and Nefret cannot allow him to do this without their help, of course, and mayhem ensues.All in all an enjoyable read and a nice cliffhanger at the end to build interest in the next book."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"From lack of use, that is! The latest installment of the Amelia Peabody mysteries doesn't fail to interest. I found myself staying up all night to finish it!The Golden One continues the adventures of the Egyptologically-inclined Emerson family: the vociferous Radcliffe, his indomitable wife Amelia, and their son Ramses with his wife Nefret. Rounding out the entourage are Gargery, the loyal butler, and the precocious child Sennia, a newer addition to the clan, along with several other familiar and not-so-familiar acquaintances.WWI still rages on, but that doesn't stop the Emersons from continuing their beloved excavations. Until, of course, the ineluctable dead body turns up. What unfolds from there will not be revealed by this reviewer, as Ms. Peters' talent is best enjoyed first-hand. Rest assured, though - this addition to the series is as brilliant as its predecessors!"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"The Golden OneIt is a form of going back in time.

If you have read any of these books you already know why you want to read this one, but if you haven't been introduced to Amelia and her wonderful family as yet, prepare to be entertained. If you enjoy reading about close knit, unconventional families you will love this book even if you haven't read the rest of the series. This story is like all the others in that it is as different, as it is the same. There are tombs to be found and archeological mysteries to be solved. There are new characters and those that have been part of the series from the beginning and there are continuing mysteries that continue to change their shape. These are the books to read when you've had enough of the complexities of modern life. There are mysteries, but they are not too complex, there is suspense, but not too much, there is humor in abundance and the bonhomie of spending time with a family that millions adore."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"On a recent trip, I entertained myself by listening to The Golden One by Elizabeth Peters. The book is a fabulous listening experience due to the talent of Barbara Rosenblat, the actress who narrates the story.The story itself is full of intrigue, greed, tomb robbing - think of the Brendan Fraser/Rachel Weisz \\"Mummy\\" movies without the supernatural element. It's a great swashbuckling kind of story, but what makes the audio book so wonderful is Barbara Rosenblat. She's simply amazing as she performs. Her voice lends itself as easily to a wily Egyptian trader as it does to a young girl or middle-aged Egyptologist Amelia Peabody or Radcliffe Emerson, the Father of Curses.Ms. Rosenblat weaves a spell with her voice and transports you to Egypt as it was in 1917. I adore Elizabeth Peters. Her writing is always superb. Barbara Rosenblat does her Amelia Peabody books justice, easily helping your imagination create mental pictures of the characters as she effortlessly goes from character to character.In short, Ms. Barbara Rosenblat has a voice that is a golden treasure."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I first met Amanda Peabody some years ago and have followed her for a long time. Elizabeth Peters draws vivid characters against the stark back ground of WWI Egypt and the vastness of the desert sands.Poor Amanda, to be a closet romantic in a family of realists is a humbling chore. The character of Nefret grows to womanhood in this title as she discovers herself as a person, not as an appendage to an over powering family of extroverts. This growth makes the acceptance of the story more enduring against theme that have previously been played out in other titles.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"even though i love cd books because of my commute. sometimes the actors' voices reading these sometimes can be annoying. to me this is the case of this series. maybe for they would be better read. i love egyptology and mysteries. but the period voice thing got to me while listening. story was good however."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Item was exactly as advertised and shipped immediately. A pleasure to work with this seller."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"As the year 1917 dawns the extended (and ever expanding) Peabody-Emerson clan has returned to their beloved Egypt to resume their archeology (and hopefully only those) pursuits. WWI is continuing to rage across Europe and the Middle East making travel quite dangerous. With that in mind Emerson and Amelia have decided to remain in Egypt indefinitely and to take as many of their extended family as possible with them. The group has certainly grown in the thirty plus years that this (AMELIA PEABODY) series has covered so far. Besides Amelia and Emerson the family now includes their son Ramses, his wife Nefret, ward Sennia, butler Gargery and Horus their most recent feline companion. They are met in Egypt by the Egyptian branch of the family and various friends. Unfortunately they soon discover that others have noticed their arrival, particularly those who are determined to recruit Ramses once again in undercover work.Despite the most determined efforts of all involved Ramses is finally persuaded to return to 'The Great Game', an enterprise that quickly turns into a family affair ranging from Luxor to Cairo to Gaza. Even when long suffering Emerson is allowed to return to his dig he is plagued by tomb robbers and bl**** tourists.As always the story is told primarily by Amelia with additional material supplied by Ramses. THE GOLDEN ONE is called a 'novel of suspense' rather than a mystery and while there is plenty of action and adventure the true attraction here is the on-going 'back' story of the various characters. Those unfamiliar with the series would do well to begin with CROCODILE ON THE SANDBANK and proceed in order. Long time fans of this series (this is the fourteenth installment), will not want to miss the latest news about this delightful group."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"She entertains me, over and over.

In this novel it is her son Ramses who faces a most dire threat during a time when the Great War shows no sign of abating.An excellent companion guide to the Amelia Peabody mysteries is Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium by Elizabeth Peters and Kristen Whitebread. The fascinating book is full of maps, old engravings, illustrations, vintage photographs and serious historical and archeological information about Egypt at the time of the mysteries."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I have read this entire series over many years.

It is great to be transported to a world so different from my own."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"The feisty Father, the parasol-loving Mother, affectionate doctor Nefret and phlegmatic Ramses. A well written novel of historical mystery and romance. I wouldn't say it's a thriller, since the the romance part is the majority of the story.Set in Egypt during the height of World War I, a husband-and-wife + son-and-daughter-in-law Egyptologists adventures were told in a very interesting way. Being my first Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody adventure, I found this lady writer has developed a romance story, while enveloping it with history and adventure quite well. There are many mundane daily things which are missed in current thriller novels which were not skipped by the author. Which, by themselves are quite interesting since the reader can try to relate how people during the early 1900s era might lived their lives.Though it was written quite excellently, I did not find the edge of plot too convincing. The author left the end dangling, which is what she had in mind to prolonged these series. The culprit in this novel, Jamil, was nowhere to be found. Waiting for the next novel to pick up the saga.Anyhow, an excellent read for anybody interested in romance, adventure and Egyptian hystory novels."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"This book was just a lot of fun to read! Of course, the plots are getting a little improbable with each novel, but hey we knew they were never meant to be fact, didn't we? The plot of this novel is fast-paced, exciting, dangerous, adventuresome, and fun -- something that has been lacking in them for awhile (with a few exceptions here and there). The Emersons are once again back in Egypt, their ever-increasing clan along for the ride, and even a new cat with a very ostentatious name. Once again, the family improbably finds itself drawn into the military intelligence escapades that nearly took the life of Ramses in He Shall Thunder in the Sky. Along the way we have some archaeological excavations, dead bodies, dangerous traps, and yes some more ruined shirts. Not everything is perfect with this novel. As stated before, the plots are getting over the top, some of the newer supporting characters are annoying (Jumana!), and Sethos just isn't as much fun as he used to be. Since Peters outed him as the long lost half-brother of Radcliffe and Walter, he's lost some of that zing. I will say that Selim has really started to grown on me. He may never be Abdullah, but he is an interesting character. Beyond that, the novel was a lot of fun and a great return to the joy of previous novels."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Like all her books featuring Amanda Peabody (archeologist and egyptologist) this was a fun-filled book that was difficult to put down.

All in all, a fun read."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I love the whole Amelia Peabody series that Elizabeth Peters has written. You get to know and love the whole huge cast of characters. They are funny, touching, suprising and filled with wonderful information about Egypt.

The British army has bogged down outside of Gaza and its intelligence community desperately wishes to get Ramese back in the fold. And somehow, Amelia has to manage all of this while hoping that she will soon become a grandmother. Naturally, Sethos--Emerson's half brother and something of a love interest for Amelia is back and in the midst of both tomb robbing and the war.Author Elizabeth Peters has created a wonderful set of characters in the extended Emerson family. Emerson's bull-headedness, Ramses's honor, Sethos's deviousness and overcompensated inferiority complex, and Amelia's proper British manipulativeness all ring true and consistent through the novel and, indeed, through the series. THE GOLDEN ONE does not integrate World War I with the archeological elements of the story as well as some of the earlier novels in the series (perhaps because the Turks have been driven further from Egypt), but is otherwise a delightful adventure.Readers new to this series may find Amelia's proper Britishisms somewhat off-putting but; for me at least, these have become familiar friends and amusing reminders of a time when the British really thought that they had a great moral lesson to share with the world.

I was afraid that things would settle down and get stale after the marriage of Ramses &amp; Nefret, and things seemed to be resolved with Sethos, but I was worried for nothing! The story did drag a little in spots, but overall it was a fun read and a terrific addition to the series."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"I read the other reviews saying the plot wandered or Ms Peters doesn't know what to do with WWI. So not true. The people who said the series got stale after Ramses and Nefret got married are also off the beam.I have enjoyed equally the different nuances the series has taken at all junctions. I loved Ramses when he was a tiny boy. The descriptions of him in his little nightshirt with toes peeking out lisping were hysterical. The description of him dumping a smelly old bone onto the lap of a snobby woman Amelia wanted to get rid of were a riot. The descriptions of Ramses as he got older lecturing ponderously as his mother would interrupt him were great. I loved it when Ramses, Nefret and David got older and got their own lives. The parts where Ramses was in complete shambles because Nefret had touched him, or made an innocent remark but his family could not see his agony were great. I enjoyed the between the lines parts of Ramses and David having adventures in the suks that was only hinted at. The book that left Nefret and Ramses hanging in mutual agony over misunderstandings was agony. I was so overjoyed at their happiness when they finally discovered each other. I am enjoying their marriage very much. The between the lines bits of marital life as their parents look on at a distance are great. In this book, the bit in which Ramses and Nefret are reunited in the harem and their mother reminds them as they totter off to bed there are peep holes she may not have found and covered up; and they had better just...sleep, was so apropos. When they finally have children, I will love that as much.Yes, I miss David and Lia. But as Ms Peters has pointed out in answer to where they have been the past couple of books, she can only manipulate so many characters in one book without it spilling into thousands of pages.This book, The Golden One, has the war intrigue, the murder ingrigue, the interworkings of characters from past books. In short, it has it all. I liked the minor characters, Lord Edward, Jumana and Jamil, and the pimp (I forget his name) pop up to become bigger characters in this book. I will not go into the ins and out of characters and plots the other reviewers have covered. I will close by saying, if you have not experienced Amelia Peabody and Elizabeth Peters, do yourself a favor and do so. Start with \\"Crocodile on the Sandbanks.\\""},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Elizabeth Peters' gets it right and The Golden One is right at the top of her best style of writing. All the usual old friends, family, and bad guys show up. The Emersons are all over the place finding villians and Egyptian treasures. Nefret is much more pleasing following her 'confused' state in the past. Marriage has done much to calm her and Ramses, but not in their adventures. By the end of the book, we know a little more of what's to come and there is the introduction of a new villian. I hope Ms. Peters continues to write more just like this one."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Few tales are as eagerly awaited as another in the addictive Amelia Peabody mystery series.

It was 1884, yet she set out for Egypt where she was to be confronted with a number of perplexing circumstances.With &quot;The Golden One&quot; it is 1917, and Amelia is married to Radcliffe, the most famous archeologist in Egypt.

However, it was still an enjoyable read, even if it did follow along on predictable formulaic lines.The Emersons and entourage have returned to Luxor for another season of 'digging,' where they learn that tomb thieves have been ransacking a newly excavated royal tomb. Of course Amelia, Emerson, Ramses and Nefret, immediately hunker down to discover who is behind these thefts and to put a stop to them, and discover that an enemy from a previous adventure (\\"The Lord of the Silent\\") may be involved in these felonious goings-on, and that he is bent on revenging himself against the Emersons... Halfway through this storyline however, the novel veers off into another direction, when officers from the British Military Intelligence ask Ramses to resume his espionage activities and to discover the fate of one of their operatives, Ismail Pasha (also known as Sethos, one time foe of Amelia's and Emerson's, and who also happens to be Emerson's half-brother), who seems to have disappeared. Normally, I'm not much of a fan of sudden plot departures that go really off tangent for no apparent reason. But I must say that I'm glad that Elizabeth Peters did introduce this subplot as it proved to be a highly entertaining one with some really humorous moments.All in all, \\"The Golden One\\" was quite an entertaining read even if the storyline was not a very original one. It was nice to visit with the incredibly adventurous and eccentric Emersons again. And I liked that Jumana (a character from \\"Lord of the Silent\\") made an appearance again, even if she seems to have lost some of her edge and been reduced to hand wringing and light histrionics. (Perhaps her character will revert to type in the next Amelia Peabody adventure?) However, I would have to agree with the previous reviewer, Kathy Farrell, either borrow this book from the library or else wait for the paperback edition. Because while I DID ENJOY reading this book very much, there really is no earth-shatteringly compelling reason to go out and buy this expensive hardcover edition."},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"By the beginning of 1917, the Great War makes travel across the Mediterranean unsafe. Still, the archeologist Peabody-Emerson family journeys from England to Egypt to begin another season digging up ancient history. However, their arrival at Luxor is accompanied by the word that thieves attacked a royal tomb with one of the criminals left behind dead.Before the matriarch Amelia Peabody Emerson can fully investigate the crime as she always does, British intelligence draft her son Ramses to work for them. They need Ramses to ascertain whether Ismail Pasha, an individual quickly rising to power in Gaza, is really Sethos his brother and a criminal. Unable to resist, the Peabody brood follows Ramses on his trek to keep him safe and to learn first hand if Sethos has surfaced.Fans of this series will enjoy this mixing of a World War I espionage tale with a who-done-it. However, historical mystery readers will feel disappointed as the intel mission intrudes on the investigation, which is left dangling while completing the espionage assignment before the family returns to solve the murder. This leaves the audience with two distinct story lines that never merge and a feeling of a novella inset inside a historical amateur sleuth mystery. Elizabeth Peters provides a wonderful look into Egyptology during the encroachment of World War I that along with the fourteenth return of the clan will delight series fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Amelia Peabody relates another thrilling adventure (with occasional entries by her son, Ramses) that starts when the war affects their beloved Egypt. Ramses is recruited as a spy by the British and Amelia and Radcliff cannot let their son face danger alone so the whole family gets in on the act. This is a great story from Ms. Peters from one of the few authors whose work I automatically buy in hardback. Elizabeth Peters has a PhD in Egyptology and her main character Amelia is based on a combination of several Victorian women explorers/archeologists. Every time I read one of these books I have to dig up one of the real Amelia's books (Amelia Ann Blanford Edwards) about Egypt to reread. The similarity in writing style and voice is uncanny.

However, Peters has come back in top form with a story that combines her classic Egyptian mystery as well as military intrigue. The story occurs the in 1917, which means thankfully WWI will be over soon, and involves every reader's favorite characters. We also get the dead body, ruined shirts, and dry humor throughout.

I made the mistake of trying to read this book before any of the others. It's important to read these books in order to see the development of the characters and the way in whichthe author moves them through this particular part of history.This book takes place during World War I. So there is a plot that centers around the excavation of various sites and a plot that has to do with the use of archeologists as spies. The plot is genuinely suspenseful and Ms. Peters takes great care to create characters that are both interesting and about whom you can care. However, the key to all of these books is the voice of their narrator, Amelia Peabody. If you don't like her you're not likely to like the books. I especially enjoy her wit. This is Amelia's husband (and fellow archeologist) Radcliffe Emerson dressing her down for a remark she's just made: \`Peabody,' he said mildy \`that is even more pompous and pedantic than your usual declarations. Do not suppose that the complexity of your syntax can conceal the inaccuracy of your conclusion.'If you are someone who likes mystery series in order of publication, be sure to visit stopyourekillingme.com"},{"Title":"The Golden One","review":"Am reading thru the series and enjoyed this one very much.

Married at last to his lifelong love, surgeon Nefret Forth, Ramses wants only to work with his parents at their archaeological dig site and make his wife happy. But when the call for another mission arrives, he cannot refuse it; because its subject is his father's illegitimate half brother, the mysterious reformed criminal known as Sethos (among other aliases), and Ramses fears that only he can keep his uncle safe from assassination. Of course his parents and his wife insist on following him to the Holy Land's gateway city of Gaza, where the spying partner assigned to Ramses by the military does something unexpected...something that results in Ramses's capture, which sets off a chain of events involving the daughter of the head of Turkish intelligence.This series allows its characters to change with time, growing and developing in ways that are the natural outcome of both their setting and the events they experience. The author knows her setting thoroughly, and that makes it easy for the reader to become immersed. This book has the feel of a middle novel in a trilogy, which seems odd to me because it's actually an installment in a long series - that may be the case due to events that are foreshadowed by this story's closing, but not fulfilled until the next book.

The definitions are clear and concise; you don't need to look up the definition since they're in layman's terms. It's also pretty complete. I hate looking something up and not being able to find it in the dictionary; that's hardly ever happened to me with this one. They also have many different reference charts in the back which have come in handy, some of which I've actually copied and taken home. It's almost like 3-in-1 rather than 2-in-1, actually--those charts give this dictionary a flavor of the Columbia Encyclopedia.The only thing they left out (which I wish they hadn't) is word origin. But if you want it all (or close to it), this is the one."},{"Title":"The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus","review":"&quot;The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus&quot; is an excellent compact sized lexicon, one which I've found to be the most useful desktop reference book in my office. Word definitions are clear, concise and easy to understand. Synonyms appear directly following each word's definition, rather than in a separate list. For me, this is probably the best overall feature of &quot;The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus,&quot; because it makes it much easier to look up a word, understand its definition, and see its synonyms without thumbing through different sections of the book. Page layout is pleasing, with two columns set reasonably large and easy to read print. There are several useful appendices in the back, including: signs and symbols; heat index and wind chill; metric/English conversion; countries of the world; and Presidents of the United States.&quot;The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus&quot; is the little brother to the 1,800 page &quot;The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus.&quot; Despite its relatively diminutive size, this desktop version, which claims to have &quot;over 150,000 entries, synonyms, and senses,&quot; has consistently proven itself comprehensive enough for the kind of reading and writing I do on a daily basis. Only on rare occasions have I found it necessary to pull out my unabridged dictionary to find a word not listed in &quot;The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus.&quot;For those needing a compact dictionary and thesaurus which offers a good degree of comprehensiveness and excellent portability, &quot;The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus&quot; is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Constant Nymph (Mainstream Series)","review":"\\"The Constant Nymph\\" is author and playwright Margaret Kennedy's best known work. Written in the early 1920s, this novel may seem a bit dated in its language and cultural references to modern readers, but it is absorbing and shrewdly observed, with well-drawn characters who will remain with the reader after they close the book. The novel was considered somewhat shocking at the time it was published for describing romantic/sexual attachments on the part of what, at the time, were considered young children, and delivers some passionate observations on the conflict between art and \\"civilization\\" through its characters.The novel focuses on the Sanger family, headed up by Albert Sanger, a womanizing, self-involved English composer of some note, who has secluded himself and his family of undisciplined children in a chalet in the Austrian Tyrol. The children are from two different marriages and one liaison, and show varying degrees of their father's artistic brilliance as well as his contempt for societal norms. The household is propped up by the two eldest children, Caryl and Kate, who are already young adults and the most stable of the menagerie. The middle four children are the product of Sanger's second marriage to Evelyn Churchill, an Englishwoman of good family who cut herself off from her family to marry him, while the youngest is the product of Sanger's liaison with his current mistress (both wives are dead).The novel opens with the almost immediate death of the seriously ill Sanger, leaving four of his five younger children parentless. The youngest child disappears from the story very soon with her mother, as do the two eldest children, who have careers of their own to follow, one as an operatic soprano and the other as a conductor.It is the fate of Evelyn Churchill's four children, ranging in age from ten to sixteen, around which the novel revolves. Their closest relatives turn out to be their uncle, the dead Evelyn's brother, Charles, and his adult daughter, Florence, their cousin. Charles, the headmaster of a highly regarded private boys' school, is notified of the now parentless state of his sister's children.Charles sends the 28-year-old Florence to the Tyrol to take charge of her unruly young cousins. Her intention is to bring them back to England with her and place them in proper boarding schools where they can acquire discipline and basic education, and become suitably civilized. As soon as she arrives, Florence sees that she has her work cut out for her. The eldest, Antonia, sixteen years old, has recently been seduced by a rich friend of Sanger's, Jacob Birnbaum, who has fallen deeply in love with the beautiful young girl and offers to marry her. At first doubtful of this plan, Florence realizes that at 16, placing Antonia in a boarding school is unlikely to prove successful, especially given Antonia's state of newly awakened sexuality, and Florence agrees that the marriage is perhaps the best solution for Antonia. That leaves Teresa, or Tessa as she is called (14), Pauline (12), and Sebastian (10). Pauline evidences serious dramatic talent, and Sebastian is a gifted pianist - it is clear that these two children, at least, already have some direction that can guide their futures. Only Tessa shows no particular sign of the family heritage of quirky brilliance - artistically, at least.Rounding out the bizarre household that Florence finds when she gets to the Tyrol is Sanger's best friend, the rebellious, charismatic, and gifted young English composer Lewis Dodd, who, like the children's dead mother, is from a fine English family from whom he has cut himself off, and whose hypocrisies and pretensions he despises. Young Tessa has loved Lewis with all her heart since she was a little girl; she feels as if she belongs to him, and her portion of the family gift is an unnatural openness and clarity of mind - she understands Lewis completely and has known from a terrifyingly young age that they belong together. Already, at 14, she knows how to handle him and sustain him in a way that is quite startling in so young a girl. Her strange maturity where he is concerned, their perfect complementariness, is something that so far, her young age has kept Lewis blind to, although her sisters and brother, with the offhanded intuition of children, are aware of it. It is this aspect of the novel, Tessa's passionate devotion to Lewis at so young an age, that shocked readers of the 1920s - the novel makes no bones about the fact that the young Tessa loves the thirty-year-old Lewis the way an adult woman loves a man. The novel does not, to its credit, condescend to Tessa's love for Lewis, or pass it off as a \\"phase\\" or \\"crush\\", but presents it as real and deep: Tessa is not the victim of a schoolgirl crush, but a girl who has seen her heart's destiny too early.To Tessa's dismay, Florence and Lewis fall immediately in love and get themselves quickly married. Tessa's dismay is part personal anguish but part dread: she knows that Florence has fallen in love with Lewis's surface, that Florence has no knowledge of Lewis's darker nature and his capacity for cruelty. After their honeymoon, Lewis moves with Florence to England, where Florence buys a house. Tessa and Pauline are sent to a boarding school with other nice English schoolgirls where they are miserable. Sebastian does better at his school because of his wit, detached nature, and undeniable musical gifts, but none of the Sanger children are happy as they move from their unfettered past to what Florence cheerfully calls \\"the shades of the prison house\\".Florence believes herself to be sophisticated and tolerant, and she is quite knowledgeable about music. But, although initially charmed by her histrionic cousins, the conflict between her fundamentally conformist views and their freewheeling natures, which reverence nothing but music, soon begins to take a toll on the relationships among the characters - especially between Florence and Lewis. Florence begins to try to \\"manage\\" Lewis's career and push it forward using her contacts in English music circles, deaf to his passionate insistence that he doesn't give a damn whether anyone hears his music or not, and to his increasing hostility as she tries to force him to embrace the very Establishment values of \\"success\\" that he fled at sixteen when he left home. As their polarized views of life and art emerge, the marriage begins to fray. These tensions escalate when Tessa and Pauline, unable to cope any longer with the mob rule that characterizes English boarding school life and that is so contrary to their individualistic upbringing, run away and arrive on the Dodd's doorstep, to Lewis's approval and Florence's fury. Florence wants to send them back, but the school will not take the Sanger sisters back, they are too disruptive. Pauline is quickly shipped off to a dramatic academy in France, but Tessa has nowhere to go and finds herself between Florence and Lewis in their home, a position that becomes ever more dangerous as the Dodd marriage deteriorates. Florence, sensing Lewis's partiality for Tessa, increasingly resents her young cousin's presence, although she still does not grasp the depth of their attachment.It is Charles, Florence's father, who first recognizes the true nature of the profound bond between Lewis and Tessa, and the looming disaster that will occur the moment Lewis himself becomes fully aware of it. Charles tries to warn Florence to be less vicious toward her cousin and less domineering toward her husband, behaviors that are driving Lewis away. Charles even offers to educate Tessa privately in his own household - he likes Tessa enormously, enchanted by her unusually broad and perceptive mind. Charles believes that if he can get Tessa out of the Dodd household, he can save her from an early involvement with Lewis that will blight her young life, and give Florence a chance to salvage her marriage.But it is too late - the novel is already building to its inevitable confrontations between the unbidden nature of art and love and the artificial boundaries of civilization. Florence's doom is that she is both the invader and the victim of the little world whose Bohemian character once so charmed her; she has wandered, unwary, into an environment that is hostile to her essential ideas of order and morality. Despite her beauty, sophistication, and good intentions, Florence remains an outsider in this world, which she despises while longing for true membership in it. She hates and envies her cousins for their natural citizenship in this world. Tessa and Lewis, on their parts, realize at last not only that they belong to each other, but that they do not belong in Florence's neatly ordered universe. No compromise is possible here, only tragedy.This beautifully written novel explores uncomfortable truths about the nature of love and genius. I stumbled upon it first as a young girl and have revisited it since with admiration as well as pleasure. It is, as mentioned earlier, acutely observed, and if you like English literature and the early 20th-century English \\"voice\\", you will likely adore this stylishly presented work. I'm delighted to see that it is available in print again."},{"Title":"Constant Nymph (Mainstream Series)","review":"What a discovery, this book by a British author little known in the US. Margaret Kennedy creates the atmosphere of a creative rather mad household in vivid detail. We love the Sanger children, not quite certain at the beginning who is our heroine from the way we are brought into their Alpine retreat. The omniscient point of view gives us insights on even the characters who are relatively stereotyped by today's sensibilities: the Russian ballet designer, the wealthy Jewish family friend. Kennedy's broad sympathies and wisdom on love and the relation of the sexes make this much more than a period romance or 'woman's book,', and her depiction of musical genius vs bourgeois society is complex. Read Anita Brookner's introduction afterwards--you want 'The Constant Nymph' to unfold with no preconceptions."},{"Title":"Constant Nymph (Mainstream Series)","review":"It took a while to get going but once it did, I could not put this book down.

Since then, books like \\"The things they carried\\"(Vietnam) and \\"The Longest Day\\" have joined this one on my shelf. Without question it is well and viscerally written, with an honesty that is almost tender at times. My first impression of the book at such an inquisitive age may influence this opintion, but it is still my favorite war book. This edition is excellent, with an introduction and photos, although I bought a used copy of the original edition just for the sake of nostalgia. Anyone who appreciates human drama will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Donald R. Burgett has produced four excellent works concerning his experiences while a member of Col. Bob Sink's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the fabled 101st Airborne Division. His details of his experiences of training and jumping into battle at Normandy put you right in the thick of his experiences. His graphic descriptions of what he saw, smelled, tasted and felt will bring you right into this environment like no other book I've read. The action comes fast and this is a book that you can't put down and will read from chapter to chapter and then be disappointed when you finish the book if you don't have his next work about Operation Market garden,The Road to Arnhem.I recommend all of Burgett's books about his experiences and the humble man who wrote them. This is a must read for WWII history fans and 101st Airborne fans."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"A must read for any hardcore D-Day history buff. A great read from the eyes of a \\"Bloody Butcher with Baggy Pants\\" as the germans referred to the 101st Paratroopers."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The only other World War II novels that can compare with this one are Burgett's 3 ohters. Very truthfull and gives the reader a real feel of what a paratrooper went through at Normandy."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The book was easy reading and interesting. I thought the book is overpriced for a paperback and the size.We have heard good reviews about this author who writes of his true experience during World War II"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This book is written in common language and easy to read. Some parts seem a little far-fetched, though. Over all it is still a good read for WWII or paratrooper buffs."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This is another one of the \\"band of brothers\\" type narratives. Burget wasn't in E company, but was in the same battallion and went through the same training.His descriptions of the training he went through were informative.Other than that, this is a great firsthand memoir of another solider in the 101st airborne."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"If I were to award stars based on the heroics contained within the pages or Currahee!, I'd have to award 5-stars. Unfortunately, I have to rate the book based on how well this personal account of the Normandy engagement was told and whether or not it was very engaging. With that in mind, I'd probably rate the book between 2 1/2 and 3 stars. My biggest problem with the book is that the author attempts to cover too much material in too small a book. The end result is I never really felt connected on a personal level and the story comes off as disjointed.Currahee has thee chapters; Training for Combat, Waiting for Combat, and Combat. While there is some interesting content in each of the chapters, the first two chapters are too long in my opinion and water down the main story by leaving only a mere 119 pages to discuss his account at Normandy. Thus the final chapter contains several very detailed accounts of the battle which end up fitting loosely together. Probably what hampered me the most while I was reading Currahee! was that I kept wishing it could have been written as well another book which I'd read, GUNS UP by Johnny M. Clark. You must read GUNS UP to really understand what a compelling, first hand account should be."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Burgett's first work Currahee is a great accomplishment of WWII writing only exceeded by his second book &quot;Seven Roads to Hell.&quot; I thought the writing was a little sloppy and it was not as intense as his second book. I did enjoy my introduction to some of the men I remembered from his second book. If read in order I bet they would flow nicely together. I would like to see Burgett revise this narrative a little to improve the writing of the book. He has become such a great writer and story teller which is evident from his second book and now as I read his third book, it becomes even more apparent. I can not wait for his fourth work to be published!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read the Readers Digest condensed version 1st and then found the full version in a local library. Once I started reading either copy, I was unable to put the book down.I've seen brief clips of the author in WWII interviews on TV. When they've shown his face you can tell Burgett can never let go of the excitment, terror, and feeling of accomplishment that being part of history has done to his life. Nothing else will ever compare. Nothing else can ever compare.His book makes some of this clear. It is definitely worth the time and effort to find a copy."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I'd meant to skip this one, thinking that \`Seven Roads' might stand as representative of all Burgett's books but then my mum found this for me at a church fete, so here it is after all. I'm glad too as this is a war account in every respect. A lot of men die and Burgett is very lucky to avoid death in training and in battle. I think of it like this. If you have a thousand men, split into groups of ten, each of whom draw straws to select a winner. Then you take all the winners, regroup them and put them through the same process and then put the new winners through again, you get a sense of how Burgett survived. Also as fantasy writer David Gemmell wrote, among all warriors there are princes (in terms of their skill/luck etc), and then amongst the princes there are kings. To me men like Burgett were a bit like this. Men who were lucky but who also made there own luck by being quicker and more deadly than their enemies. He himself is astonished at how he continued to survive when so many others died.This is Burgett's first book and it covers his training as well as his fighting in Normandy. Maybe it's partly to do with the 1960s layout but at times this seemed more like a lurid fictional work than a memoir, something like a Commando comic or an episode of \`Combat'. Again authenticity doesn't seem in question. Perhaps it's because this book was published in the 60s, it reflects the war writing styles of the day. I recall reading that Webster's book was knocked back by many publishers as they were seeking more sensational, fictional type war accounts. Perhaps these influenced Burgett. Perhaps it's also to do with the fact that Burgett simply killed a lot of Germans. He was in an especially target rich environment but no one else has written of so many specific instances. Indeed, taking into account an episode where he is temporary on a machine gun, I think he surpasses James Megallas in total \`kills'- and that's just in this one battle! He doesn't reflect too much on this though. He really is a hard man in this respect. His training and hunting experience simply makes him a very deadly soldier indeed.There are quite a few jaw-drop moments too. The one where he sought, though ultimately was dissuaded by intense machine gun fire, a unique and particularly ghoulish souvenir was almost unbelievable. There is another, where several dozen prisoners are forced to march up a road to discourage German machine gunners from firing is also very jarring. For several reasons, I'd almost be inclined not to believe it, except Burgett has seeming established his bona-fides. Aside from his ongoing naming of the others who were with him, several of his experiences have been quoted in other books on the battle, for instance, the one with the two Germans horribly injured by artillery fire. On this, there are several very graphic descriptions of battle injuries that are quite astonishing. These are the sort of things people want to forget but as Burgett himself writes - how could you? Burgett has an eye for such things and his descriptions are vivid and blunt and not for the faint hearted.This is more war book than memoir if that makes any sense. Bizarrely, having been on the hunt for an account that really lets go in terms of killing, now I've found one, it's left me a bit squeamish. I have only praise for the author's candour however. In terms of explicit combat this book is on a par with Sledge's \`With the Old Breed'. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Reading this book led me to read all of the books written by him. His details are so amazing! I tell everyone about these books and tell them to read them. His details about training camp all the way to the Battle of the Bluge are unforgetable! If your looking for an FIRST PERSON account like I do then these books are for you! I felt like i was there when he told about the battle of the bulge. Some of his stories about not taking prisoners or fighting in the snow....I dont believe making a movie and making it super-bloody would even come close to what really happen.

He talks about people being blown to pieces and mg42 machine guns almost tearin soldiers in two. He talks about a bayonet charge they did on the Germans. This is an excellent book full of intense action. You can't do a whole bunch better than this. I can't wait to read his sequals,Road to Arnhem A Screaming Eagle In Holland,Seven Roads to Hell A Screaming Eagle In Bastogne,and Beyond The Rhine A Screaming Eagle In Germany.

A must have for any library!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The author was a member of A Company of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne. While dealing to a certain extent with his training and the preparation phase for the invasion, the book deals primarily with his experiences during D-Day and the days that followed.Early on the morning of June 6, the 101st along with the 82nd Airborne and other paratroop units were dropped behind the German costal defenses to capture key pieces of infrastructure in order to facilitate a rapid inland thrust from the invasion beaches. The drops, however, were poorly done and much chaos ensued as the men tried to form up and carry out their missions. As the book Currahee! graphically describes, the bitter fighting that ensued was fluid and brutal. Often in small bands (sometimes consisting of men from both the 101st and 82nd) the paratroopers took on whatever Germans they encountered, causing much disruption behind the lines and no doubt lessening the influence of the reserve units that the Germans sent to drive the Allies off of the beaches.This book is a gripping eye-witness account to the D-Day invasion and the role that the 101st Airborne played in it. A must read for every WWII buff."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read this book in high school over twenty years ago and it made quite an impression. I've never forgotten it and reading some of the other reviews it's obvious many others share the same sentiment. Burgett's writing style gives you the feeling that you're actually there, witnessing the accounts of Normandy with an unbelievable attention to detail. Thankfully, we had people such as Burgett not only willing to fight the fight but to also give us a glimpse into what it was like to be there.

I have recommended this book to several friends who were paratroopers."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Excellent narrative of the training, waiting, and combat of a paratrooper in WWII. It could have used a few more chapter breaks to make it easier to read in discrete chunks, but it is so engrossing you won't want to put it down anyway.

The author, Donald Burgett was and 18 year old youth in A Company of that outfit.

In this, the first of his books, Burgett tells of his training and night jump on the western flank of the Normandy invasion near Ravenville on the eve of D-Day.

(a battle cry) covers a paratrooper's training and 7 days of intense combat in the Normandy invasion. The battle starts by parachuting from a plane a couple hundred feet off the ground, barely high enough for the parachute to open (many others' did not open in time). Dropped about 12 miles from the intended location, the paratroopers gathered in small groups and moved towards the sound of battle. Often with no officers present, they launched themselves at superior forces.

I still remember a part when they are running from fire dragging their friend Jamie who is quickly expiring from wounds. It is a testimony in itself that I still remember the name of his friend after having read this book so long ago.

Burgett goes into great detail about his training and combat experience in the Normandy invasion. I recomend this book to anybody young adult and above who wants to know exactly the horrors that went on in WWII. Burgett does not sugar coat anything so be prepared.

Here is the story of a conscript in the airborne forces of the USA. He is seen arriving in England - almost his first time away from his home in the USA and he meets the local population. He makes friends. We see his comrades. We see his flight to the battlefields in Normandy. We see death and destruction. We see the will to survive and fight for that which is right. The book's author returns to the barrqacks and to the billet in the UK. He is the only one left from that room. They gave that we might live and the story is there as a reminder of that. In the book is the black humour of the paratroopers song (to the tune of the Battle Hymn Of The Republic) It is this song that I want to get a copy of and what made me remember Currahee and something I read over 45 years ago.

Those who have read other accounts of the Normandy campaign (or other millitary history of the european theater) will tear through this easy and enjoyable read. Burgett was a very hard man, who killed 27 germans in one fire fight, and scores of others during the war. He proclaims to not understand the need for his colleages to mourn the loss of a buddy when there were still more nazis to kill!

Having completed a re-reading of it (actually have done it several other times) I wanted to put my review down for others.Currahee! Is Mr. Burgett's account as a paratrooper from induction thru Normandy serving in A Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. There are four sections; Training for Combat, Waiting for Combat, Combat, and Afterward. All parts give Mr. Burgett's experiences at that particular point in his career. Focus is always on what he sees and experiences, not the \\"big scene\\" around him. The Afterward was written when Currahee! was a stand alone book.My Likes:Wow, where to begin. Seldom have I read a personal account of warfare that contains the details this book has. Mr. Burgett's memory is exact and to the point. In telling his story he mixes no bones and calls what he did. If he screwed up, he tells you that he did and what the effects were from it. The descriptions are detailed, down to telling you minute details (one of my favorites from when I first read the book was his telling of breakfast in training to be a paratrooper; cornflakes and coffee, either eat the cornflakes dry or wet with coffee. Btw, that was after their morning run). The best section for these details was the Combat section. Here Mr. Burgett shines by describing is drop (in excellent detail), his experiences upon landing, and the running battles with the Germans thru his wounding. Of particular interest is his description of how Dead Man's Corner earned it's name.My Dislikes:OK, I have one; I wish Mr. Burgett would have divided the Combat section into two to make for easier reading. The only other possible dislike is that the story cuts off after Normandy and we have to buyThe Road to Arnhem: A Screaming Eagle in Holland (World War II Library). There are minor problems with him referencing non-airborne weapons (a M3/M5 Stuart is references as a M3 Lee/Grant and few problems with German equipment).The Rating:Five Stars! An Ab Fab writing with a great personal story. I'd love to have toured Normandy with Mr. Burgett. But then reading is book is almost like touring his fight with him. I highly recommend reading this book if you're interested in what the 101st Airborne did during Normandy, particularly from the individual's point of view. There are some excellent photographs, only two maps (I wanted more), the second one is nicely detailed."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This book is very good for several reasons, but mostly because Burgett keeps your attention throughout so that you almost feel as if you are his comrade in the war. He gives a great first hand account of all the action, hardships and general doings of a paratrooper during one of the most prolific and celebrated battles of WWII. I was so involved in the book that I missed my bus stop - - by 10 stops!The only downside would be that the book is focused on only Normandy, but at [this price], Burgett's the three battle books (Currahee!; Road to Arnem and Seven Roads to Hell) are well worth it!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read a copy of this book when it first came out in paperback and when I was much younger. I loved then and am very please to now have a hardback copy. The first time I read this book was before I ever heard of Stephen Ambrose or his book &#34;band of Brothers,&#34; but it was Burgett's &#34;Currahee!&#34; that really got me interested in the 101st during WWII."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Donald Burgett served as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and gifts us with this remarkable account of his experience during the Allied invasion of Normandy. The first part of the book about the formation of the paratroopers and their early training will be familiar to those who have read Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; or watched the HBO miniseries. From D-Day forward, however, the stories are very different. In comparison to &quot;Currahee!&quot;, BoB appears to be an almost sanatized version of the invasion and fighting in Normandy. In &quot;Currahee!&quot; Burgett does not hesitate to vividly describe the horrors of war - excrutiating wounds, rotting corpses, moments of incredible fear and agony. Even if you think that you are prepared to face these grim realities, you will still find Burgett's frankness disturbing. However, I encourage you not to let this put you off reading this book. Burgett's experience in Normandy was extraordinary, and he does a masterful job of conveying all the terror, exhilaration and grief he experienced. Since this is just one man's story, it necessarily captures only one perspective about a limited part of the invasion, but Burgett's skillful storytelling successfully conveys what many of the troops must have been thinking and feeling during those remarkable days."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"So we've all seen Private Ryan now and think we know something about the horrors of war, but I would suggest that there is no way that anybody who was not there can truly understand it. This great book, written by an American paratrooper about his experiences leading up to and then at D-Day, makes us realize that the visceral horror of war is something that probably can not be conveyed.It is a rather short read and is in three parts: the first is at training camp in Georgia; the second in England preparatory to the assault; and the third is the terrifying jump into France, and the grim, terrible battle which followed. To say the least, it makes for very compelling reading.The training aspect was remarkable for its undisguised brutality. The men were told in no uncertain terms that the paratroopers did not want them; they were going to try to make them quit. The first day, for example, several men collapsed during the morning's six mile run. They were left by the side of the road, to crawl back as they could, with one of them not arriving until after midnight. He quit. Treatment, as well as being harsh, was also intentionally unfair. The narrator, after his first night jump, broke his ankle. He was left out there as well, in the darkness, to crawl back to the barracks as best as he could. &quot;If I knew how to cry,&quot; he said. &quot;I would have.&quot; The men were told that their likelihood of surviving combat was very poor, and that they should expect to die. The men accepted this. Most died.Their mission was to jump behind enemy lines the morning of D-Day. Each company was given specific tasks to accomplish, but one gets the sense that all it was really hoped they would do was to create as much chaos as possible. This is exactly what happened after the chaotic, haphazard way in which they were dropped. Nobody was dropped where they should have been. Entire planeloads of men were actually dropped at sea, where they drowned. The author witnessed one cowardly pilot, fearful of anti-aircraft fire, drop the men from an altitude of 100 feet. Every one of them was killed before his chute could open.The battle scenes are horrific, almost beyond comprehension. The way one killed one's enemy was by creating situations in which there were large amounts of flying metal in the enemy's area. This was done with bombs dropped from planes or fired from cannons and mortars, tanks, bazookas, grenades, machine guns, rifles and pistols. With such firepower on both sides, one realizes that getting killed was likely not a matter of if, but when. The author, diving into a hole, finds two German soldiers apparently hit by a bomb. Their faces, hands and feet are all blasted away but incredibly, they are still alive. The author shoots them, and prays that if the same were to happen to him, the Germans would show the same mercy.After a time the Americans are able to establish some order. The author is sent behind with communications, and retreats through fields of dead. For a quarter of a mile, they litter the ground so thickly that he is literally able to step from body to body. Finally coming to the end of this, he describes the experience as of coming from some hideous darkness, back into light.Eventually the author is wounded, first surviving a grenade blast which deafens him, then a piece of shrapnel which rips away the muscle of his forearm, exposing four inches of naked bone. He is sent behind to recover only so that he can come back and fight again.The narrative is written in a candid, matter-of-fact way, remarkable for its lack of sentimentality. This, we realize, is the way he was supposed to be. This is how he was trained. Gentility, kindness, thoughtfulness, and feelings were emotions wiped clean from the consciousness of these young men, trained as they were to kill and to die. This fine book is a sobering reminder of the sacrifice made by them, most of whom met a gruesome end at an age when Americans today are graduating from high school or going to the martini bar to meet girls. They instead lie in cold graves dug hastily for them in the north of France."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This was an outstanding book! The author tells his story with almost a &quot;dry-biscuit matter of factness&quot; about his experience starting with jump school in Georgia, training in the British Isles, Combat in Normandy and finally back in England recuperating from his combat wounds.Just reading this book makes you feel like you are actually with him in combat, although of course you are not, seeing the horror of combat first hand. It goes without saying that no book or movie can ever truly describe the reality of combat but this book goes far enough to make the reader realize that combat is probably the most horrific thing a human can experience.The book is loaded with very vivid descriptions throughout and a number of them stick in my mind: In the early morning of D-Day the author had just landed in his parachute and was on his back getting himself organized when another C-47 flew over at a very low altitude and he saw every single paratrooper jump to their deaths before their chutes even had a chance to unfurl. &quot;They sounded like ripe pumpkins hitting the ground and bounced&quot; quite horrifying! Another C-47 dropped all of its troopers into the English Channel. The first man out landed in waist deep water and was the only one out of his plane that lived. All of the others drowned (the paratroopers carried around 100lbs of equipment with them which no doubt took them straight to the bottom of the sea.) In another place the author describes how they saw some Germans who had just butchered a cow and put some steaks on a makeshift grill. The author and his comrades promptly killed all of them and then finished cooking the steaks and ate them themselves.The battlefield descriptions are straight to the point and are not for the faint of heart. The author describes with brutal honesty throughout the book his entire experience.I would recommend this book to everyone. It is an excellent read and very fast paced (I read it in a few hours cover to cover). Five stars most definently!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read Currahee! for the first time as a teenager in the early 1970s then a second time just after touring Normandy in 1975. It was then and remains to this day a historical treasure. The book motivated me to go on to become a paratrooper (now a master parachutist.) Nearly a quarter of a century later I'm serving as a U.S. Diplomat and Special Forces Reserve Lieutenant Colonel. Now living in Europe, I visit the 101st's battlefields often and try to pass on the lessons of history to my children. I like to think that guys like me are carrying on in the spirit of Burgett and his band of brothers to whom mankind owes a debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"If you havn't read this book you are in for a treat!With the recent release of Ambrose' 'Band of Brothers' on HBO there has been an overdue increase of interest in the Screaming Eagles of WWII. This book is what first interested me. This is the first in a series of four books written by a regular trooper of the 101st...And what a series it is. This set is considered by most to be one of the best memoirs ever written about war. Here is exposed the fear and tradgedy of a real battlefield. Burgett has you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride from the unbearable training in the hot Southern sun to the terrors of D-Day and the battle around Carentan. This is no holds barred, exposed in all its raw detailed writing at its best!Please be sure to couple this book with the next three, including the number one WWII book (in my opinion), Seven roads to Hell. Together this set allows an unforgettable glimpse into the life of a WWII paratrooper!If you want the complete experience, read 'Rendezvous with Destiny' (see my review) for the complete unit history of the 101st, and do so before this memoir."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Just like the real thing, the author tells his story without fanfare. No Hollywood special effects, music, embellishments, etc., this reads just like you're sitting with Burgett over a cup of coffee and a game of checkers as he recounts the horrors he and his \\"buddies\\" went through to rid the world of fascism. I agree with the other positive things said about this book on his page, so let me let the author speak for himself in a few quick, unforgettable excerpts, as this book has many:After breaking his leg on his first practice jump: \\"The only way I could travel was to lie on my side, throw the chute forward, crawl to it, and repeat the procedure over and over again. Finally another jeep came up and this time a sergeant leaned over the steering wheel and said, 'That's the spirit we like around here,' and then drove off. I crawled for what seemed to be hours.\\"On the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, having just dropped behind enemy lines: \\"Another plane came in diagonally over the field....then I saw vague, shadowy figures of troopers plunging downward. Their chutes were pulling out of the pack trays and just starting to unfurl when they hit the ground. Seventeen men hit the ground before their chutes had time to open. 'That dirty SOB pilot,' I swore to myself, 'he's hedgehopping and killing a bunch of troopers just to save his own ass. I hope he gets shot down in the Channel and drowns real slow.'\\"War is hell: \\"The two German prisoners tried to climb the steep bank behind them, but just as they got to the top, Brininstool fired his tommy gun. Both of them slid down, whirled around, and were slammed back against the bank so hard by the .45 slugs that their eyes popped out of their sockets and hung down on their cheeks. What kept them standing is a mystery to me, but neither one fell. They just stood in a leaning position, side by side against the dirt wall, with arms hanging loosely at their sides. From the expressions on their faces they must have just looked through the open gates of hell.\\"Near the end of his time in Normandy: \\"Suddenly a strange smell came to our noses and wisps of a funny looking smoke crept over the hedges from our left. It clung close to the ground and moved slowly toward us. Phillips looked back at me. His eyes were round and wide. 'Gas,' he exclaimed. 'What'll we do now?' 'Nothing,' I said. 'Just stay here and die, I guess. I wish I had my gas mask now.' 'So do I,' said Phillips and Benson together. They had been the first things we had thrown away.\\"I did not preselect the above excerpts. I literally spent a very few minutes leafing through the book, finding a striking passage, and typing it for you. Burgett's experiences are all as rich as the above, about 200 pages' worth in paperback packed with such horrific stories that make one truly appreciate the sacrifices and bravery of such men in that era and, by extension, the current one.My only nitpick with the book is that the author several times mentions an event without giving the result; for example, the two paratroopers who got into a drunken knife fight and were taken to the hospital by the MPs. Their fate is never revealed beyond being taken from the bar, and surely the camp was abuzz with stories about them; for some reason, we don't know whatever became of them. This is still a five-star book, however, because of the matter-of-fact tone and unmistakeable realism with which Burgett tells his remarkable tale. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Burgett's memoir was initially published in 1967. It came out when most books on World War II were about generals, or not even about the fighting. Burgett's book was a reminder that war is essentially about young men trying to kill other young men and the hell of it all. I purchased this book when Bantam reissued it under the title \\"As Eagles Screamed.\\" I still have that copy and have read it several times.All I can say is that if you're picking up this book for the first time, you're in for a treat. If you've already read it, well then you know how good it is. Burgett's books are a fine companion piece to Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers.\\" In some ways, it's even better because we see the whole war through the eyes of one man who survived it's most horrible moments."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Horrific depictions of what it was like for the men on the ground.

One of Burgett's buddies is alternately listed as \\"Brinninstool\\" and \\"Brennenstool.\\" Not the most efficient editing job...Overall, a good piece of memoirs.

Its the realism, I felt I was right beside the author from jump school to the training in England prior D-Day. Anyone who wants to understand the life of a foot soldier in WWII this is a must read.

Within a mere 200 pagesthe author manages to bring across the harrowing ordeals the paratroopers went throughpreparing for and then invading Normandy. I have heard stories about the same war from mygrandparents, and what I found amazing is that the book feels like a transcript of such stories,and I mean this in a good way. My grandparents recounted their experiences in the form of a series ofanecdotes, observations, and remembrances of small details that may have seemed insignificant a the time,but stuck in their minds for more than 50 years.

The reader feels as though they have trained, jumped and fought right alongside with the author. As a veteran myself, I have learned that it is difficult to relate the 'detailed' war stories that people want to hear... except when talking to another veteran. A veteran never judges your thoughts and actions. Mr. Burgett treats the reader as another veteran and relates all the aspects of his war experiences. My appreciation goes to Mr. Burgett, his service and his writings. I plan to purchase his other books and read them in chronological order."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"In my opinion, Currahee! is an incredible novel. Never in my life have I read something so incredibly real. The details that Burgett puts into this to describe the deaths and other horrors that he witnesses are amazing. I had a hard time putting it down because there was non-stop action throughout. It was one attack after another, and there were many suspenseful scenes as Burgett himself became close to being a victim of the war. It was also very interesting to get an in-depth view of the constant training that goes into becoming a Paratrooper. I knew that these guys had to work hard, but never did I even think that it was so tough on them and the physical activity was so incredible."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The successful book and mini-series _Band of Brothers_ prompted a re-read of Donald R. Burgett's timeless classic: Currahee: A Screaming Eagle in Normandy (the subtitle was added to the reprint editions). First published in 1967, Burgett was ahead of his time in paving the way for a no holes barred narrative and chilling memoir. Some of the more recent World War II memoirs will attest that there are several pit-falls awaiting the well intentioned autobiographer. For example, a combat veteran's world was very small. He was rarely aware of events transpiring outside the realm of his squad or platoon. He oftentimes knew not where he was, nor was he aware of the grand strategy of which his unit was a small yet intricate part. All he knew was that he had to keep going on to victory, not so much for his country as a whole, but for his buddies who depended on him, as he relied on them for survival. Also, there is a tendency for the humorous memories to over-shadow the horrors of war in many recent accounts. The result is often a personal anecdotal approach. Although this style is significant to understanding the culture of the World War II veteran, it can also bore the reader quickly. Not so with Burgett's first effort. Burgett blends the anecdotal with the overall picture splendidly. He made a smart decision to have a military historian edit his manuscript and fill in the holes with facts Burgett could not possibly have known at the time. This collaboration is done with finesse, lending just enough factual military history to Burgett's personal experiences to make for a riveting read (This delicate ingredient will become more abundant in Burgett's subsequent installments). Burgett takes the reader from paratrooper training, overseas deployment, and eventual night drop into Normandy on the eve of the D-Day invasion. His attention to detail is remarkable. Every facet of training from the technical to the ironic is covered with crystal clear prose. If it were not for an injury suffered during Burgett's first qualifying jump, he would have crashed and burned with his original stick in an unfortunate training accident. Burgett's acclimation to combat appears to occur rapidly. He soon learns to think like an infantryman: is this ditch a safe place to spend the night, he wonders, or does the enemy have it zeroed-in? Burgett soon learned to trust no one outside his circle of squad buddies in the second squad, second platoon of A Company, 506th Parachute Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. He would make the grateful French citizens drink the wine and cider they happily offered their liberators first to insure it was not poisoned. Thinking three moves ahead in the game of survival became a way of life for Burgett. Burgett's re-telling of the sporadic fire fights among the hedgrows of Normandy are vital to a thorough understanding of the Airborne operations on D-Day. The reader may wonder whether the paratroopers preference for screaming frontal assaults directly into the mouths of German machine guns and deadly artillery is the result of elite combat training or youthful bravado (Burgett was only nineteen). Burgett makes no bones about his macabre desire to scalp the blond locks from a dead German soldier he felled with his M-1 Garrand. Only intense enemy machine gun fire prevented him from performing this gruesome deed. Burgett comments on the one topic no one likes to talk about: friendly fire. Burgett tells us that not only were his comrades killed by mishaps during Allied air and artillery support missions, but also short rounds fired from ships off-shore as well. Without a doubt, Burgett's tell-it-like-was memoir will become a timeless classic. All veterans contemplating preserving their experiences to paper should consult Burgett as a model."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"While most young men today are thinking about \\"getting a leg over\\" or what kind of car they should drive, Don Burgett went to war. This is his story.He wanted to join the army at seventeen but his mother balked at the idea. So he filled out a voluntary induction notice and on his 18th Birthday he joined the army. He promptly volunteered for an exciting and new form of combat by joining the paratroopers.This book chronicles the daily life of a man whose body and mind where forged to form one of the finest fighting men this country ever produced. He served as part of the legendary 506h PIR of the 101st Regiment.This book is a priceless gem of American history and a priceless first person account of D-Day from the perspective of a common soldier. It is outstanding in every way. It's an easy read with a gripping story first published in the 1960s.Among the more interesting aspects of this book are the harsh training in Georgia, the pre-assault preparations, and the assault. Burgett's descriptions are vivid and compete including mention of a Japanese officer's body (I'm still trying to figure this one out), bloody bayonet assaults, Germans entrenched in the hedge rows of Normandy, a charge by horseback and ghastly wounds.This book is the real deal. If you only read one first person account of the war, then this is the book to read. I've read the series three times and it never gets old.Mr. Burgett if we ever meet, dinner is on me. Including the Calvados, sir."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This, along with Mr Burgett's 3 other works are simply the best first person accounts of combat in North west Europe ever written. I notice many other reviewers here point out that this book is similar to Band of Brothers, this is misleading, because Burgett's books predate those of Ambrose by decades. This is gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, sweat inducing writing of a young man in combat - no false heroics, no overviews, no discussion of strategy and planning - just plain-talking real experiences.I cannot recommend this and Mr Burgett's other books highly enough."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"honestly its been three or more years since i read this burgett book, but it only took me two days to finish it. it just sucks you in and im a very slow reader. burgett is very matter of fact about his training and war time experiences. from training accidents to killing men so badly burned there was no alternative to relieving them of their suffering. truley powerful."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I have been a student of World War II since junior high (I am now 41). This book, and the others by Burgett, are the most spell-binding accounts of battle I have ever read. They really put you into the mind of a young paratrooper. Burgett doesn't regale you with his acts of heroics. He does hold others in awe, but describes his own actions in a matter-of-fact manner, downplaying any type of heroics on his part. What really sets this book apart from other war books, though, is Burgett's eye for detail. He tells you about the food they ate, the dead livestock, the countryside in a manner that allows the reader to actually visualize it. Burgett has the same knack for details that Tom Clancy does. The difference is that Burgett's were all too real."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I have thought about this book for years. I read it at some point in the past- probably in the early seventies when I was in middle school or HS- and to this day I remember it as one of the most captivating &quot;reads&quot; I have ever had. I have not yet re-read it, but now through the power of the net I have found one of my old friends. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"An amazing account of a paratrooper in the screaming eagles. He takes us through the grinding tedium of training to the fast paced exertion of gruelling combat. His accounts of death in battle are harrowing in the way the mind does not allow compassion under the tight grip of close quarter war for the soldier of World War II. Whether or not you agree with his apparent detachment of both pity or compassion for taking another life he portrays it as simply as it went forth. It is neither an over bearing or soul wrenching account. Just a quiet record of his war. Which makes this, in my eyes, the best account ever written by a regular soldier."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The most striking thing about this is Burgett's simple, laconic style: This is not the work of a writer, but a soldier, and as such, he never imparts a political or moralist overtone. This is simply what happened to him as he remembered it, the training and fighting and blood and humanity. Burgett tells about Paratrooper school and its rigors, about being dropped behind enemy lines, and about plowing through hailstorms of bullets into what would be one of the hottest ground firefights in military history. Thank the stars he survived, because writing like this is as hard to come by as it is historically valuable - a soldier's story, and a soldier who is unafraid to tell you what he remembers without interjecting opions about political affairs or larger morality. Just 'I did this, it felt this way, and this what I saw'. Absolutely astonishing. This is by far one of the best supplements available to anyone studying the Second World war in Europe, much as Hersey's 'Hiroshima' is to anyone studying the Pacific campaign. You will not learn about diplomacy or the reasoning of Generals here, but you will be on the ground in the firefight, astonished to get out of it in one piece. The section on boot camp is also a welcome addition to the history of this most trajic war, as it is an aspect to American soldiering very often overlooked or underplayed. All in all, a very readable, utterly compelling piece of history, unclouded by emotion or agenda, worth much more than the five or six dollars it sells for. It is worth noting, however - and Ambrose makes mention of it in the introduction as well - that as a memoir there are certain pieces which Burgett assumes as a soldier from all the excitement on the ground which are more hearsay than not. He reports seeing a dead Japanese in the fight, but as he did not know what Japanese uniforms looked like, he was probably saw the body of a Russian Mongol. In some way, though, this adds to the authenticity of the account, as we are behind the eyes of an eighteen year old boy dropped into the middle of a bloodbath, there to save the world. This is an important, valuable book."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read this book in a 4 hour layover recently. It is thrilling, it is terrifying, it is bloody, it is the invasion of Normandy through the eyes of a paratrooper. This book is as much a look into the battle as it is a glimpse into the mind of a young man superbly trained to be a remorseless killer, a soldier's soldier.Probably the most terrifying moment in the book for me was when Mr. Burgett's MG loader took a round in the head with a &quot;plock&quot; sound. The emotional distance Mr. Burgett expresses over the death of his comrade (friend) is astonishing. The general acceptance of death as an inevitable part of combat, a truly casual acceptance of it are never expressed but clearly evident. This is no coincidence since you've already read about Mr. Burgett's training to become an elite paratrooper. There are bayonet charges, paratroops dying in droves, firefights at the distance of mere yards, this book captures the unreality of what a combatant experiences and unleashes one upon the another.This book is a quick and easy read that you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I grew up listening to a friend's dad tell what it was like to be in the 101st Airborne in WWII. He even showed me the scar on his leg from an 88mm blast that happened on D-Day in Normandy. &quot;I was diving through the air into a foxhole when I got hit by an 88,&quot; he said--showing me his scar. &quot;My boot was filled with blood before I hit the ground.&quot; As I listened to this senior citizen tell me his stories, I wondered what it was like to be a young man and have to fight, get wounded and possibly die for his friends and countrymen. If by reading Currahee, I only got 10% of what it was like, it is enough to tell me that war is something that should be avoided. A fantastic book--the second of Burgett's that I've read. Being originally from Michigan (as well as the author) it was nice hearing him talk about my homestate. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This is the 2nd Donald Burgett book I have read &amp; this one is the best. Burgett just tells the story as he lived the invasion of Normandy and the fighting in the French hedgerows. I have never been in a war (thankfully), but his book really helped me understand how people felt in battle. I really recommend it - cannot wait for his book on Arnhem."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This book was ordered for my husband who enjoys WW2 history. He was very happy with the book.

If you have read \\"Band of Brothers\\", much of the story will be familiar. In fact, some of the same characters (in real life) are present in both. This book brings another perspective to the conflict, from someone who is the instrument of the Allied advance into enemy territory. The author is an unqualified hero, having endured some of the most vicious fighting of the war. I was amazed at the \\"matter of fact-ness\\" with which he recounts some of the horror. I can only imagine that this is a result of living through the madness of war. My own father is a veteran of WWII, and I am once again reminded of the debt we owe to these heroes. This book is a great first-hand account of the day-to-day fighting. The only thing I found lacking was the larger historical context in which the fighting took place. However, this is not the work of a historian, but a participant in the conflict. I commend the author for telling this story, so that those of us who weren't there can understand and appreciate what was fought for and won on the battlefields of Normandy. I look forward to his other books about WWII."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This book is a no glamor look at war from one of the men that was there.

Good guy books and WWII in Europe."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Don Burgett takes the reader on an interesting odyssey of recruiting, training and deploying paratroopers in World War II in Currahee! The \\"airborne experiment\\" was totally new and untried in the United States Army and everything had to be learned from scratch. As a result, initial standards for volunteers were extremely high and the hard training reduced the number of men even further. The first airborne regiments consisted of the absolute best-of-the-best when they finally deployed to Europe. It was a standard of such high excellence that it was never to be achieved again in the Airborne.Burgett takes us through the demanding training and the evolving culture of this new breed of warriors. Then he takes the reader to deployment in England and finally to the chaos of combat before dawn on D-Day.His prose is simple and straightforward and his descriptions of combat are riveting and revealing. He was part of a group of highly trained kids, many still just teenagers, that were dropped all over Normandy, mostly in the wrong places, who were expected to complete their missions. That they did in fact succeed was a tribute to the individuals who coalesced as small units and took action. The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment lived up to its motto, Currahee (We stand alone, together).This book has some photos and decent maps and is a must read for those interested in D-Day, paratroopers or World War II in Europe.John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"The easiest 5 star review. Some books are high on the romance of WWII and others are notable for their maps and pictures and inspired text. The book is a treasure in how it describes the training and execution of the author's Normandy experience efficiently, accurately, and without pretense. You'll be amazed at the author's ability to be alternatively ruthless and humane, and the randomness and unpredictable nature of the fighting. There will be times reading this book you will be both amazed and horrified. But after you put it down and it all sinks in you will have a deep appreciation for the heroic efforts in Normandy.Burgett doesn't attempt to resolve the outcome of every little thing he witnessed. He doesn't try and summarize overall war strategy. Instead, the book recounts the events as they transpired with only minimal additional observations. The effect for the reader is getting a real feeling for combat.This book has also stood the test of time. It was \\"Band of Brothers\\" before Band of Brothers, but without the sentimentality. It is also very accurate historically, which is amazing for a first-person account in such confusing circumstances.The only criticism I can muster is the title, \\"Curahee!\\" seems somehwat inapporpriate since Burgett did not actually train at Currahee.I've read a fair number of books in this genre. This book is the best of its kind."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Wow It's hard to believe I will be able to get my hands on this book. I have been serching for 18 years to have this book again. I let someone borrow mine in '82 and have been searching ever since. I have never read a book where I felt like I was actually there. This book changed that for me. Just like one of the other reviewers I also could only think of Curahee as I watched the scene in Saving Private Ryan where they were talking to the Pilot that flew the glider. If you have a chance this is a must read. This has always been my favorite book. EVER!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I originally read this book when I was 13 or 14 under the title &quot;As Eagles Screamed.&quot; I found the book in, of all places, a 7-11 on a rack of other WWII oriented paperbacks. I bought the book because of the cover and because it was the only one I found that was a true story. I'm dyslexic and reading was very difficult for me during those years but I absolutely couldn't stop reading this book. It took a long time for a relatively short book, but every free second I had I went to this book. I gave the book to everyone I knew but when I went to look for more copies, I couldn't find them. I'm 35 now and honestly a year hasn't gone by where I didn't at one time or another think about this book. While watching &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; my mind kept going back to this book. A week ago I was at a local bookstore when I caught the word CURRAHEE! in big red letters out of the corner of my eye. I almost dropped the books I had in my hand. I ran to the book wondering if someone else had stolen his title or could it possibly be that book I had loved so many years ago. I knew &quot;As Eagles Screamed&quot; had originally been published as &quot;CURRAHEE!&quot; but I couldn't be sure and couldn't remember the author's name. I checked the copyright dates and it didn't mention &quot;As Eagles Screamed&quot; anywhere. I scanned through the Introduction and the Forward but no mention. Finally on the inside back flap I found what I had been looking for, it was the book. It was like meeting a best friend I hadn't seen in years. I bought both copies they had. I haven't read it again yet; I'm reading another book and I won't start one until I'm finished with the previous one. I can't wait to read it again. I was afraid that maybe my youth and the years since had clouded my judgment about the book but I having read other reviews here I know I'm right. When I finish it again, I'll post another review."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This book is a great read. I have read many books written by soldiers that have been in combat, but this has to be the best. Mr. Burgett takes us from the time that he decides to join the paratroops, through the training, and finally into the night drop that takes him into the Normandy Campaign. I read this book in one sitting, I just could not put it down."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I read this book in high school 20+ years ago. I loaned it out all over the school. I moved and spent the next 20 years trying to find another copy. Burgett has captured the daily life of a combat soldier candidly, truthfully, and without glamorizing it. His matter of fact approach, and easy to follow style make this a book that once started cannot be put down. Read it. It will be re released in September and I'll be proud to get the first copy sent to Utah."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"A narrative of suspense, action, and horror set inside the mind of Donald Burgett as he struggled to become one of the members of the elite 101st Airborne Division and ultimately survive through World War II. Currahee is written such that one feels as if he is following the main character, Burgett, step by bloody step. This first person narration by the hardened war veteran, Burgett, adds a suspense and gritty realization to the horrors of war. Every chapter focuses around Burgett's adventures and deadly battles he encountered regularly. He describes in detail every action he took, and every shot he fired so that the reader can never miss a beat. He explains his training and how damn near impossible it was to become a paratrooper. The joke going around during his first day of boot camp in 1942 went, \\"If two doctors were on each side of you lookin' in your ears and could see each other, you were a new member of the 101st Airborne!\\" At only 18 years old, Burgett had the heart and mind of sure will and determination. He did whatever he had to do in order to pass the required training and receive his jump wings, qualifying him as one of the best in the army. I am convinced that Burgett and his entire generation who were tough enough to make it into the 101st became the most admirable \\"bunch of guys\\" this nation has ever had for now and generations to come. We, the people, of the United States of America owe them our solemn gratitude and utmost respect that they laid down their lives so that your children, and my children, might be able to live in freedom for years to come.I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15. Not only can the language be foul, but the amount of detail in the actual WWII fighting can become too much to endure for young teenagers. The amount of agony, blood, and gore described even left me sick to my stomach and filled with sadness over the amount of death of those brave American soldiers. These citizen soldiers were just like you and I, working part time at the grocery store and helping their parents clean the table after supper. But when the time came, they all went out to defend their country without hesitation, without remorse for the enemy. That is the beautiful part of this book, that men such as Burgett would answer the call and damn well know that they were risking their lives for the sake of their mothers, fathers, and all of people who lived in this country. That is why every time I read this book I cannot put it down because I know that Burgett was MY AGE when he was in the fields of Normandy risking his life to preserve the sacred word, freedom. With such eminent detail, I often find myself ducking my head thinking that those bullets are going to strike me. I often wondered, \\"He was killing Germans while I am still learning Math, how weak and insignificant I must be compared to him.\\" When I read the first page, I could not stop until I reached page one hundred and fifty. So please, pick up a copy of Currahee and become engulfed with a true story about how self-sacrifice and military excellence ultimately won World War II and preserved freedom to this day."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"Author Donald R. Burgett jumped into Normandy on D-Day with the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. \\"Currahee\\" is his well-written account of that experience and the training that prepared him for that day. The 506th is the regiment made famous more recently by Steven Ambrose's book \\"Band of Brothers\\" and the HBO miniseries of the same name.Burgett's account is honest, detailed, and graphic. The tough training at Fort Benning that turned a 18 year old into a young infantryman, and the even tougher training that made him into a paratrooper of the 506th is thoroughly described. The jump into Normandy and the confused small unit fighting that followed is the core of the book, and told from the hedgerow and foxhole level. Burgett's account emphasizes the extraordinary initiative and courage shown by the paratroopers, who, despite being badly scattered in their drops, proceeded to execute their missions with the troops and weapons at hand.This book is highly recommended to students of the Second World War and to the heirs of the Airborne Tradition. Currahee!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"If you enjoy \\"Band of Brothers\\" movie and book by S. Ambrose then you will enjoy this account equally! This is another \\"troopers\\" version of the life, training and the fighting in Normandy at the time of D-Day. He(Donald Burgett) gives his account of the fighting action, fear and realness of war! It also provides another reasonable historical account of the 101st Airborne D-Day Normandy battles and the weeks that followed. I recommend as a \\"Must Read\\" for the actions of the 101st Airborne in WWII. Burgett also has good books on the actions of 101st Airborne in Holland and Bastogne!"},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"This is the first book in a set of 4 books by the author, the books start with his training as a paratrooper in WWII, and follow his time in the war until he gets discharged after the war. The books in chronological order are 1)Currahee! 2) The Road to Arnhem 3) Seven Roads to Hell 4) Beyond the Rhime. By all means, read every one of them.For those who call WWII, the last \\"good war\\", this is a wake up. This war was just as full of horror and nightmare as any conflict, and the men treated as poorly. We get a view of the daily misery of the troops between the episodes of their bravery driven by the urge to kill or be killed. The author was a member of the newly formed Screaming Eagles 101st Airborne Division, and they made history and a reputation in this war.In this first book, Burgett takes us to his training as a 19 year old Paratrooper in 1944, and then on to England. The newly formed division gets the supreme test as paratoopers. Paratroops or Airbonre units are dropped behind enemy lines to shock the enemy, draw the enemy to them, diverting resources from the main line of attack so infantry and mechanized untis can move in. This may include seizing a key road or river crossing until the main units arrive. It is incredibly tough for them as they are often outmanned, outsupplied, and outgunned, facing tanks and artillery with nothing more than their own rifles, bazookas, and mortars they can fly in with. They are expected to do this for 1 to 2 days before relief arrives. But in Normandy, they were kept in action for seven harrowing days.This book series by Donald Burgett is the most graphic and honest description of being an active fighting soldier in WWII I have read and left a deep impression on me. Simple words and detailed memeories from a simple man. It is a great read, and I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"I first read Currahee! when I was maybe 10 years old. It was much different from the books on World War II that I had read, which up to then had either been from the point of view of a general or the godlike overview of the historian.It was the first book on the war my Dad had fought that gave the point of view of the common soldier, although the paratroopers of the 506th were far from common. Dad saw a great deal of combat and never talked about it. Burgett gave me a feeling for what Dad must have gone through, and for that I was grateful. It gave me an appreciation for the hardships of the front-line soldier's life unmatched by any book I've read, save possibly Mauldin's Up Front.Anyone that wants to know what that war was like on a day to day basis at the sharp end should forget about things like Saving Private Ryan and the television specials with which Stephen Ambrose was involved. This book will tell you all you need to know. It cannot be recommended too highly."},{"Title":"Currahee!","review":"War history is best told by those that lived it and not those that have only studied it. This is a point once again proven in Currahee. Donald Burgett tells his story of World War 2. His time with the 101st airborne makes for a moving and dramatic tale. The book overflows with the tales of his heroism and the courage of others. While Burgett downplays the danger he faced just by his straight forward style, the reader cant help but be amazed as he continuously dodges bullets, hides from artillery, and jumps from low flying airplanes.The book reads fast and is as entertaining today as the day it was published. It gives insight into the mind of a dedicated warrior and a glimpse into what must have faced those that fought so courageously in WWII. I highly recommend it for history buffs and for just about anyone that likes a good book."},{"Title":"The Geology of Florida","review":"Florida isn't merely a drab slab of limestone; instead, it is a surprisingly complex and interesting geological lab. For example, most of what we now call Florida was once a part of Africa! In this book, the many chapter authors (edited by Randazzo and Jones) cover the evolution of the Florida platform from the origin of its crystalline basement in paleo-Africa, through its docking with the North American plate, innumerable sea level changes, and the reef building, barrier island migration and mining impacts of the past few thousand years. This text is stuffed with information! The Keys even merit their own chapter -- a wise choice.This is a university level text; and as such, it contains some of the typically academic dryness of writing and technical terminology which probably wouldn't appeal to the mildly curious reader. But for anyone who is seriously interested in either Florida geology or in carbonate platforms in general, there can probably be no better resource. Because of its thorough coverage of the processes which have built Florida, and its rich scientific bibliography, geology students and librarians will find this book to be a solid reference."},{"Title":"The Geology of Florida","review":"I had recently moved to Florida and did not know much about the Florida geology. This book was perfect as a comprehensive guide to the geomorphology, sedimentology, paleontology, and hydrogeology of the area. There are many more interesting chapters with a wealth of information. Randazzo and Jones put together a wonderful collection with great geologists such as Bob Halley of the USGS and Sam Upchurch formerly of the University of South Florida."},{"Title":"The Geology of Florida","review":"In many ways, this is an excellent book, written by a collection of experts. If you want a good description of the geology of Florida, go ahead and buy this book. What missing is a clear explanation of the important processes driving the geology. If I had been the editor, I would have asked the contributors to write top down: Describe the processes applicable to your chapter and then show how these worked in the case of Florida; don't be afraid to mention similar cases in the rest of the world. This book -- as good as it is -- is too myopic. Geologists tend to focus on what happened when, rather than why it happened at all. Perhaps a 2nd Edition will include stand-alone chapters on (1) subsidence (due to lithospheric cooling, plate collisions, and isostasy) and eustatic sea-level change and (2) shallow water carbonate accumulation, in all its many modes, especially as affected by (1)."},{"Title":"Coastal Processes with Engineering Applications","review":"Very helpful resource for beach processes.

It is a history book and briefly surveys arms sales and manufacturing from the 1500s forward. It is unpleasantly informative. It is well researched and provides an extensive bibliography. It is very stimulating reading and has caused me to continue investigating this topic ever since my exposure to this book.If you read this book you will not forget its lessons easily. Its case is an obvious one but one that is continually overlooked and dismissed by opposing established propaganda. It was probably this very book that precipitated the Nye Committee Investigations into war profiteering in 1934-36. That no similar congressional investigation took place after World War II should be questioned by any conscientious and knowledgeable thinker. That no books of this nature are popular in our present book marketplace indicates the power and control of this industry in our world today. It also shows how far the modern mind has been anesthetized to war and its obvious wastes of life and money. That war has a commercial \\"for profit\\" nature, I don't think is debatable.That \\"the Military Industrial Complex\\" - today's pseudonym for the Merchants of Death - is in part promotional of war in our current world, in my opinion, is without doubt. Much of what we are witnessing today is certainly war for profit and this book provides an eyeopening perspective and background for today's insightful reader.The book is a plea for a world without war but this is far from a credible hope. But that controls on arms production and sales should be in place by all governments around the world, is without reasonable argument. Today the largest and most prolific Merchant of Death is the United States Of America.Books written by Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\"\\"A Summer with Charlie\\" Salisbury Beach, Lawrence YMCA\\"A Little Something: Poetry and Prose\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\" Novel - Lawrence, Ma.\\"The Eastpointer\\" Selections from award winning column.\\"Noble Notes on Famous Folks\\" Humor - satire - facts."},{"Title":"Merchants of death,: A study of the international armament industry,","review":"Richard Noble's review above is very good and accurate. My interest in this book came from reading the article by Jill Lepore in the current issue of the New Yorker regarding the rise in military spending. She describes how this book contributed to an awareness of the growth in the arms industry following World War I, specifically how this book became a best seller (and Book of the Month Club selection) and helped to inspire the Nye Committee formation in the U.S. Senate.Today this book may be of limited interest but for those prepared to spend the time necessary to read it through to the end, it will give some historical perspectives that are quite interesting and informative. The examples given in the book are of course many years out of date, nevertheless the practices of companies supplying arms to support the armies of the worlds governments are not too much different from what we live with today."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"First published in 1989, this was the first of William X. Kienzle's popular Father Koesler series. I found it a bit dated in parts, and a bit shocking in others, but on the whole, it's a good mystery, fun and easy to read.Father Frank Koesler is the editor of the Detroit Catholic, a modest but well-read periodical aimed at Detroit's large Catholic community. Koesler is a good priest and a good man, but realistic about the state of his church in the post-Vatican II era. Like priests nationwide, he and his fellow Detroit priests note with wry despair the dwindling church attendance in their respective parishes.Suddenly, everything changes. An apparent serial killer is targeting priests and nuns, murdering them with professional and cold-blooded efficiency. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the killings, and the police are helpless to stop him. Detective Sergeant Koznicki, himself raised in a rigidly conventional Catholic household, is put in charge of the task force assigned to find and stop the killer. As part of his methodical and excellent police work, he asks Father Koesler, a devotee of paperback murder mysteries, to add his own clerical expertise to the problem at hand.As interesting as the mystery is the behind-the-scenes interplay between the community of priests, who are not above a game of poker, a stiff drink, and heavy smoking when off-duty. As a non-Catholic, I found some of this private look into clerical life a bit disturbing, but interesting, nonetheless. Of special interest was the priests' ongoing and friendly debate on the havoc Vatican II wreaked upon their church, and the endless, corny, and often risque jokes of Father Joe Farmer, who cracks himself up every time upon reaching the punchline, leaving his friends annoyed and bemused.A subplot involving two young reporters at the Detroit Free Press adds real humor to this tale of a tortured murderer and his crazed and deadly mission. A good read, good enough to make the reader want to pick up another Father Koesler mystery."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"One of the finest whodunits I've ever read, and by far the best of the Father Koesler books.

Koesler right along with it."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"This Father Koestler murder is a great read! Not only does the mystery itself keep you hopping, the anecdotes about the church and its very human population provide an interesting backdrop for the action that all of Kienzle's books share. I strongly recommend it (but don't be too disappointed if you don't figure out the puzzle ahead of the famous father)!!"},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"The Rosary MurdersIn William Kienzle's The Rosary Murders the shockingly gory imagery of the novel strengthens it greatly. The diction Kienzle uses puts horrifying images in the mind of the reader. By going through every single detail of each murder there is a sense of what is soon to come. As the killer leaves rosary beads in the fingers of each victim, the imagery thickens. The diction is what brings the most imagery. If someone hears the word blood when discussing death they tend to get a little sick. Or when hearing how the victim got their throat sliced and their guts torn out, stomachs start to turn. Kienzle makes sure that you get the feeling of your stomach turning. At the begging of the novel the murders are not as bloodthirsty as those at the end. Kienzle sets the reader up to believe that they are reading a book that gives you enough feeling to get sick but not to feel vomit sick enough to turn pale. Hearing the way the victims die only makes the story even more ferocious to the point that it makes you wants to read until it is done. The individual image of each murder sets up the next vision of the next murder. This helps make the imagery even more strong. Without the strong, well-built structure of the imagery, The Rosary Murders would be just another book on the shelf."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"Ah, the seventies! It was a simpler time, when Detroit was known for its seedy underbelly of crime instead of its hungry underbelly of crushing poverty. A time when people could read about Catholic priests in the news and not automatically assume the words \\"molestation\\" or \\"pedophile\\" would be in the opening paragraph. A time when William X. Kienzle would decide to start a mystery series about a priest named Father Koesler.First published in 1978, The Rosary Murders is the first in the Father Koesler series. It's being promoted on NetGalley to coincide with its re-release, which is how I stumbled upon it. I'm so glad I did! What an intriguing series. It's certainly dated in places, but I didn't mind. It felt very much like some of my favourite horror movies from the 1970's in which Catholic priests must battle evil (mwuh-ha-ha).The story is that there is a killer on the loose and he's targeting priests and nuns. Can Father Koesler solve the case (of course he can, he's the star of the series) before it's too late (well, no, several people die first--that's what makes it a murder mystery) while still keeping his clerical vows and maintaining the secrecy of the confessional (aye, there's the rub)?Speaking of movies, there's also a movie version of The Rosary Murdersstarring Donald Sutherland which came out in 1987, but I've heard less than great things about it. I'd suggest sticking to the books.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from the publisher from NetGalley.

I wanted to see how the mystery and plot worked out and so I did. I had trouble in two areas. The first was that I kept waiting for that place in the book where you are finally so grabbed by the plot that you are compelled to finish as soon as possible. Sadly, I never found that. Secondly, I was a put off by a number of ethnic and sexual slurs that would not be acceptable if published today. The book was written over 20 years ago.

It was originally published in 1978 and there are 23 books in the series. For those of you who like reading books that were turned into movies, this book was made into a film starring Donald Sutherland in 1987.I had some trouble occasionally while reading, as I'm not Catholic. The author would use terms I'm not familiar with and he didn't explain them. But it didn't take away from the story a great deal.The book was slow to read. There were whole scenes in it that I feel could have been cut and not hurt the story. I found myself doing some \\"speed reading\\" to get through some of this.Aside from that, the main story was good. The descriptions of the murders and murder scenes were chilling, but not overly graphic. Father Koesler is a solid main character, though I would have liked to spend more time with him and learn more about him. I assume that happens in the other 22 books.All in all, The Rosary Murders was just an okay book for me. I didn't like it enough to want to read more books in the series.

Why I never heard of him before is beyond me because this book was a fantastic read. I was searching for new material (mysteries with a Catholic theme) to read because I grew tired of rereading Andrew Greeley stuff and I happened upon William Kienzle, what a great find! I couldn't put it down once I started and the characters are fantastic especially the main character Fr. Koesler. If you like Catholic mysteries I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Mr.(Fr.) Kienzle."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"I discovered this book in August, 1979, among the new books at the public library, and, as with other good reads, was immediately attracted to it. The story is a shocking one, but of benefit to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. First, it portrays the church in a human and comprehensible fashion for those who often see it only in mystical and hierarchical terms. The author, an ex-priest and ex-editor of a diocesan newspaper, seems to state that cases arise in which the sacrament of penance in itself is not enough for dealing with serious human failings. This is evident at the end of the narrative with the reaction of the anonymous penitent who, dissatisfied with the just-say-no approach of the confessor, rushes out in search of therapy. On the other hand, many non-Catholics such as I, with a deep distrust of that church will find the characters of this book, laity and clergy alike, interesting human beings and members of a religious group hardly describable as submissive, unquestioning of authority and regimented.The unfortunate thing is that after his second book, Death Wears a Red Hat, also first-class, the author becomes fairly bland and sketchy in his stories which are less interesting as a result and which seem chatty in the manner of mediocre journalism, in comparison to better writing. Father Robert Koesler appears to plug along as in the initial two books, but his complement of interesting humans, Catholic and non, suffers in comparison to his impressive start. I noticed this with Mind over Nurder which disappointed me, as with the others after it. A good book has interesting people and situations in it, but mainly people, who naturally make it good and enjoyable to the reader. Bear this in mind."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"THIS IS AN INTERESTING MYSTERY THAT WAS MADE INTO A MOVIE WITH DONALD SUTHERLAND AND CHARLES DURNING. I WISH IT WOULD BE RELEASED ON DVD, BUT NOT LIKELY. AN UNDER APPRECIATED STORY."},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"Although this was published in '89, I was riveted by the timeliness in lieu of today's headlines. In this context, the \\"moral\\" or theme of the story is brilliant. The serial killer, a man with a serious problem doesn't need a tired priest to give him a standard penance - so many \\"Hail Marys\\" and \\"Our Fathers\\". The man with the problem needs HELP. I couldn't help but ponder that the well-publicized pedophile priests of late do not need to be shuffled by the church to another congregation - they need HELP. Ok, stop me when this gets complicated . . . Maybe the Chruch should do something about helping these people?On a lighter note, the book maintains its riveting suspense. The characters are well-drawn, and as a non-Catholic, I enjoyed being a \\"fly on the wall\\" during discussions, arguments and joking sessions among priests. I certainly got a real sense of individuals, not of stoic men in clerical collars. Well done. I'm looking forward to another Kienzle read in the near future!"},{"Title":"Rosary Murders","review":"The author of this book used to be a priest and thus knows a lot about the inner workings of the Church in Detroit, but is obviously disgruntled and estranged. His hero in the book is what he would that he would be if he were still in good standing in the Church. Frankly, I found the writing amateurish, the plot silly and incredible. The book has lots of gore and everything about the book is unsubtle and heavy-handed and I suppose that is why it is published by a publisher few have ever heard of rather than a major publisher."},{"Title":"Snowblind","review":"This book was recently reviewed by two newspapers: The Richmond (IN) Palladium-Item, and the Hamilton (OH) Journal-News:\\"Very emotional; a good read.\\" -- Ercel Eaton, The Hamilton Journal-News (Nov 2004)\\"The ultimate in overcoming obstacles.\\" -- Rachel Sheeley and Millicent Martin, The Richmond Palladium-Item (Dec 12, 2004)What the book's about (from the back cover):Melissa's world was already out of control when she and her daughters were caught up in circumstances that threatened to tear them apart and even take their very lives. But through her long and dangerous journey, she learned how to reach deep inside her soul, to test the resilience of the human spirit, and to prevail.Excerpt from the Book:Then I remembered that Anna had mentioned the corruption in Roseburg. I had thought she was talking about politics, but could it be the sheriff's department and the police, too? She said not to go to them because we might be seen. Did she mean they wouldn't help us? Should I not trust him or is he really trying to help us? My mind was spinning. What if he were a threat; what if he wasn't really even an officer? We were in an unmarked car, after all!How could my daughters and I get out of this situation? Could he be one of Goya's puppets? Oh, Lord, I needed help! Just in case, I needed to alert my daughters to be ready for anything. What if he tried to harm us? Am I losing my mind or just thinking ahead? How could I warn Molly without the officer hearing? I turned around in my seat, reached for Beth and gave her a big, long hug and said, \\"We're almost there, are you happy?\\" She nodded yes. I then reached for Molly and said, \\"Come here.\\" As we hugged, I whispered in her ear, \\"If I pat my head, pull his hair ... hard.\\" Her eyes flew open wide. \\"Just do it,\\" I said. Then I looked over the seat again after turning back around. Molly nodded that she understood. This was a little insurance if I needed some help.I continued my chitchat with the deputy about the weather and the landscape. As we were coming into town, I tried to recognize some landmarks, the mainstreet or the convent, but I was so unfamiliar with the surroundings since it was dark the last time I'd seen them! The deputy turned down a side road and said, \\"I have to make a stop. I'll be just a minute.\\" I then noticed the blacktop road turn into gravel. It looked like a long lane through a field. The last time I heard gravel under a cars was when I was abducted. By now, I was more than a little nervous. Then there it was! The red brick warehouse! He was bringing us back!What could I do? The car wasn't moving fast, but if I jumped out I would be leaving my daughters. Also, I would be on foot. He was driving faster now; I had to get rid of him and get control of the car. My mind was racing. My movements would have to be swift and timed just right. If Molly can pull his hair, this would distract him and I can force him out of the car. He doesn't suspect that I know anything yet, at least I had that on my side. I'll have to grab the steering wheel, hit the brake and open the door while shoving him out.In a self-defense class I took years ago, they taught me that if you move the pelvis, the shoulders and legs will follow. In the distance, the building was getting closer. I had to act - now! With an act of cool demeanor, I slowly patted my head. Molly grabbed his hair and wrenched his head back. I punched his throat, and both of his hands let go of the steering wheel. I slammed my foot on the brake and the car slid sideways. Before he could recover from the punch to his throat, I reached across him and opened the door. I then slid back across the seat braced my back to the passenger door and with both feet kicked his waist . He went catapulting out of the car, rolling in the dust and coughing. I slid under the steering wheel, put the car in reverse, made a three point turn around and headed back out of town.My daughters were strangely silent in the back seat, but I was furious. When will they let us go? What did I do to them? After a few minutes I realized that my daughters weren't silent at all; I just hadn't noticed that they were screaming."},{"Title":"The Christian Christmas Tree: 20 Full-Size Easy-To-Use Patterns, Volume II","review":"There are two books in this series I am familar with, &quot;The Christian Christmas Tree&quot; being the first.

We used them at our church and the tree was a big hit and now a tradition. We cut our ornaments out of thin wood.

Has explanation of Biblical references and meanings of patterns."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"Fan's of Lynn Picknett's work will appreciate this book. Her main thesis is that Lucifer and Satan are not one in the same. The first half of the book illustrates this idea quite nicely and gets into the Gnostic bent of the idea of Lucifer being the \\"light bringer\\". But the back half of the book seems to go more into the history of Satanism and witch craft, which is interesting, but in my mind strays from what she is trying to prove and loses focus on the real topic of the book.The most interesting part of the book is its linkage of Gnostic belief and Luciferinism. It is suprisingly erotic and a bit sensational with some of its theories and history.There are also some facinating ideas about the alleged \\"feud\\" between Jesus and John the Babtist, that definitely paints Jesus outside of the \\"love one another\\" philosophy.As popular as Picknett is with Dan Brown virtually relying on all of her material, I'm suprised this book hasn't got more attention."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"Overall, this book is a very interesting read. However, it does require one to have an open mind and at times to suspend judgment in order to consider possibilities other than what is generally accepted in the popular culture. She does use well-documented source material throughout the book, but there are moments when Lynn Picknett makes serious leaps in logic and does not actually have anything factual to back up her claims (conspiracy church theories and assertions about Jesus's life in particular). The bias in her writing is obvious, and this leads her to make assertions that at times feel like they just came out of left field. It is not her theories that bother me I found some of them quite intriguing, especially as a person who is interested in the way mythology describes the public culture. But I am used to reading well-researched material by competent historians, and there are times when Lynn Picknett's book feels more like a sensational novel than a serious work. It would be delightful to see more hard evidence for what she asserts, but until that time, I have to take what she is saying with a grain of salt. As long as you read this book with the idea that it is largely theoretical, you'll be fine."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"I did enjoy this book at first, though by the end I was very annoyed by it. Picknett makes many assumptions which require the reader to automatically accept what she says as fact. Furthermore, rather than being objective, the author actively pursues the idea that Luciferanism is the only way to go. While this is a point of view one does not hear very often, it uses the same poor debating skills as any Christian proselytiser. The book even devolves in the final chapter into a chapter on how the age of Lucifer is upon us, which should bring enlightenment and understanding. This is fine for a religious text to do, but this book purports to be a book of history and facts.I read this book when I was still a Satanist (I'm not anymore), and most definitely did not find it useful. If you are looking for actual history written by real historians, I would highly suggest reading, \\"The Origin of Satan\\" by Helen Pagels either instead of or along with this book. That one is fact based. While it does digress into talk about early Christian and Jewish sects, the whole thing is coherent and engaging - and will help you to be a better Satanist by understanding the history of humankind's perception of Satan."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"Note that the history of Lucifer occupies only a small fraction of this book and--as should be obvious to anyone--the recently changed subtitle (originally \\"Evil Angel or the Secret of Life Itself?\\") referencing the DV Code is for marketing purposes to cash in on the mania. The book is well written, well researched and is characterised by the not-so-strict interpretation common for this field where connections between events, persons, names, and words are quickly made. It starts out fairly strong by being true to the title and going into the origin of the character we know as Lucifer. But early on we sense a political current which later on explodes in a feminist anti-church tirade. It takes the greater part of the book as the author suprisingly shifts her focus from Lucifer to Satan--whom she despises nonetheless. All the immoral acts, and she gives us an exhaustive and detailed list of them, of male oppressors and the church are connected to satanism, not to Lucifer. Even this part of the book is entertaining to read but in the end one realizes one is far away from the original intent. To her credit, she brings up a lot of curious historical characters as well her past research on Templars and Turin shroud which may or may not have anything to do with Lucifer or Satan but are interesting nevertheless. Had this book stayed on task it would probably have been half as long."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"This book is a great history lesson on the origin of Lucifer. The Roman Goddess Diana Lucifera was the illuminator or en-lightener, the Catholic church demonized this pagan Goddess and transformed her into Lucifer. Pan, the god of nature to pagans was used as a model for the devil with horns and cloven hooves. The snake was traditionally a symbol of wisdom in myths. The author does a great job explaining the mythical origins of Lucifer, Satan, and the devil and how they are different personages. Lucifer was an enlightened pagan goddess. Satan was the adversary of the old testament. The devil is the tempter of the New Testament. Read this book for the full story."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"This book is an interesting read if you are willing to sift through the authors personal opinions, a lot of which goes off on a tangent and at some places there are paragraphs that don't seem to follow on from or have relevance to previous paragraphs. The author seems to dislike men and religion in general and unfortunately she seems to have used this book as a platform to purvey that sentiment rather than telling the story that was intended."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"SATAN RULZ!!Just kidding.For some time now, Lynn Picknett has been shaking things up with some very unorthodox (but not completely unheard-of) excursions into possible hidden meanings behind (and often completely alternative interpretations of) various beliefs long established by the organized religions which rule cultures throughout the world, especially in this country.This, her latest, is yet another one of these, this time turning to the sensation-turned-being known as Lucifer. With her vast imagination and thorough research, Ms. (Mrs.?) Picknett really raises some interesting points, including further explorations of Leonardo da Vinci (and what Dan Brown already has drawn much attention towards), how Christianity has long taken the ancient Greek myth of the god Pan and made him synonymous with the devil, etc. etc.Though perhaps the subject matter of this and other books may not be unheard-of, Ms. Picknett certainly has done her proverbial homework on this and created another intriguing look into, quite simply, life."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"I like this book, but if you have read the other books by Picknett you are going to feel like you have already read this book. It is not really a story about Lucifer at all. It is the story about Gnosticism in the Enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"I picked up this book based on the title and was disappointed. I was expecting a history of Lucifer along the lines of The Pillars of Tubal Cain by Nigel Jackson and Michael Howard, and Michael Howard's prequel/sequel to Pillars, The Book of Fallen Angels, both of which do the subject justice.In Picknett's book, the history of Lucifer is found in the first chapter only, and it isn't much of a history. There isn't even an indepth look at the War in Heaven or the story of Watchers, a story that should have been central to Picknett's book since Lucifer, as Lucifer-Azazel, is equated with Shemyaza/Azazel, the leader of the Watchers. Both these stories are central to understanding who Lucifer is, why he fell, and what it meant to the development of the human race. It may be my perception of the work, but Picknett seems to treat Lucifer not as a real being, but as an abstract concept or model to be emulated; maybe this is the reason she doesn't go very deeply into his history.As other reviewers have already noted the majority of the book is devoted to Gnostic philosophy and why the Church exterminated the early Gnostics, the machinations of the RCC to marginalize the role of Mary Magdalene, the Church's subjugation of women in general, the brutality of the witchhunts in both Europe and America, the 18th and 19th century secret societies, including the Freemasons, and finally closing with a discusssion of Laveyan Satanism. I didn't see the author's point for the inclusion of Satanism in a book about Lucifer, especially, after she states in several places that they are not the same figure.While the book is well researched it also overflows with Picknett's personal opinions, conspiracy theories, and diatribes against Christianity which get incredibly tiresome. Added to this is the sense one gets of reading a piece of sensationalistic, yellow journalism throughout the book. This was so annoying that I almost didn't finish it.I gave this book 3 stars because it is well researched, but if you are looking for a book that actually focuses entirely on the history of a literal Lucifer then pick up Pillars of Tubal Cain and The Book of Fallen Angels."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"Very informational and thought provoking. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this particular subject.a great read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"ts a pity publishers felt it was necessary to add bombastic \\"Meaning of the true Da Vinci code\\" below her title because it has nothing to do with the whole Dan Brown issue. Pickett is fun and she does cover lot of \\"mysteries\\" but here also lies a biggest fault in her writing - too often she simply meanders, jumping from one subject to another without explaining how and why these chapters are connected at all. At the very beginning she connects Lucifer with ancient pagan Gods like Pan,Satyrs and such (and occasionally she got me thinking there lies a grain of truth in all this) but before going any deeper, off she would go into another century and speeding like pinball ball here, there and anywhere. Yes it is entertaining read but not very deep or should I say, serious. She crammed brazilian spiritualists, witch hunt, John the Baptist, Leonardo Da Vinci and Aleister Crowley in one big mix that somehow feels unfinished, unsorted and unedited. Picknett sounds very likable as a person and no doubt she might be very nice dinner guest, but her writing is unfocused."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"I've only read a few pages so far, but I find it to be well written and informative. Looks like a good read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"This book is a fairly good representation of a topic that is vastly misunderstood by many people. I doubt that it will be considered very highly by intensely religious people who would probably not be fair in the assessment or acceptance of the material, but such people are hindered by their own prejudices.The writing style is probably in the range of medium. Nothing particularly brilliant in the presentation, but nothing particularly objectionable. Some portions were clearly thought out well, but there were times when the material just seemed to drag on pointlessly long after the author had established a particular thesis.I particularly recommend this book to those who are interested in esoteric spirituality and the occult. But even in saying that I realize that most people totally misunderstand the idea of the occult. The author of this book gets it right by carefully laying out material that is obscure and suppressed by the mainstream of spirituality - for that is what the occult really is as compared to the convential idea that occultic means that something is demonic.I would also suggest that anyone interested in this book also consider reading \\"Lucifer's Court\\" by Otto Rahn."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"A quite mediocre read, it seemed to ramble and made references to subjects with which I was not familiar.

She failed to remain objective and I felt like she was pushing her ideas down my throat. I'm not even sure she proved her point on what this book was supposed to be about. I was too annoyed with what felt like whining for someone to believe every word she said and if she got to her point I missed it. Maybe she was being pressured to release another book too soon and just threw this together. I've enjoyed her other books but I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"Lynn Picknett's\\"The Secret History of Lucifer\\"is one of the best books of its kind..Although top-heavy with information which may,for the casual reader,require some follow-up in other works,Picknett's work uncovers the vast and often brutal machinations of the christian church,in both suppressing truth and relagating women to second class status at best,and,too often painting them as co-conspirators with the bogus christian\\"devil\\" in bringing\\"evil\\" into the world..Contrary to what the fundamentalist wing of the christian church may preach,the whole christian story has been lifted from other earlier religions,and that thier redeemer-God Christ is in fact an incarnation of various\\"pagan\\" deities..\\"Lucifer\\" the polite name for the christian\\"devil\\",far from being an\\"evil\\" influence is in fact an agent of light,of intelligence,of freedom..And it is this aspect as bringer of freedom that most disturbs the self-righteously correct fundamentalism of the christian denominations,in that in being free one hardly needs a church structure to control and dictate...Much of what is written regarding any religion must include myth and fable,and Ms.Picknett's book incorporates these elements,both christian and non-christian to create a seamless outline in which one can follow the progress of destruction,as all of the earlier religious systems are either destroyed by the new church,or incorporated into thier own theology..While certain to upset the fundamentalist types(who will no doubt shout \\"satanism\\" and dismiss the work as one more\\"new age\\" attempt to trash thier faith),\\"The Secret History of Lucifer\\" will prove a real treasure trove for those seeking truth."},{"Title":"The Secret History of Lucifer: The ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci Code","review":"This book is just great.

Unfortunately the British and the Americans were somewhat slow to learn such co-operation. Both the RAF and the US Army Air Force had a series of generals that believed that they could win the war without the rest of the military if only they got enough heavy bombers.During the preparation before Overlord it was only with great effort that Eisenhower got them to assist in the invasion. They insisted on deep penetration raids into Germany rather than helping the ground forces. When finally ordered by higher command to assist they did so reluctantly and poorly. The beaches at Normandie were supposed to be riddled with so many bomb craters that no Germans were supposed to be left alive. Basically they missed all the beaches. Finally they were ordered to assist in the breakout from Normandy with Operation Cobra. They were to fly along a road and bomb only to the east of the road. Instead they flew across the road and the backward creap of the bombs fell on American troops. The highest ranking American general killed in the war, Lt. Gen. Lesley McNair was killed by such \\"friendly fire.\\" After that Eisenhower refused to use the heavy bombers again.Instead, Eisenhower concentrated on the use of the smaller planes of the 2nd Tactical Air Force. This book is their story.This is an absolutely beautiful book, profusely illustrated with hundreds of wartime photographs, most of which I've never seen before. Of particular interest to me were the pictures of the early Allison engined Mustang with its three bladed prop and greenhouse canopy, and of the Douglas A-20 (Boston/Havoc) bomber. Both of these were soon replaced by the Merlin engined Mustang and the A-26. But this volume of the book covers the time frame from June 1943 to June 1944, that's when these planes were in use."},{"Title":"2nd Tactical Air Force, Vol. 1: Spartan to Normandy, June 1943 to June 1944","review":"Christopher Shores' books are characterized by meticulous research and surprisingly good writing, and the reworked 2nd Tactical Air Force series is no exception.

Which one should I read? Which one should I invest in with my precious time? I know one book for sure that is worth your time, your money, your commitment. It's Pat Croce's new book---'I Feel Great'.Revealing, rewarding, riviting.When you spend time with Pat through this book, you come away energized, determined, motivated and enlightened.Many people TALK a good game, Pat WALKS his.I have always been a fan of GREATNESS,trying to understand what makes each one of them so incredibly different. This book was a real education. There is so much entertainment, information, creative thinking, desire and much more. Pat is fascinating and most of all...REAL. You will not be able to STOP reading it.He combines with noted columnist Bill Lyon to present insight into and a look behind the scenes of his incredible journey from physical trainer to CEO. Bill Lyon is a five time PULITZER PRIZE NOMINEE and it shows on every page.I promise you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"This book reads with as much energy as a Power Bar. The combination of life's lessons, helpful hints and humorous anecdotes makes for an enjoyable reading experience that is non- stop. It gives hope to those who choose to chase their dreams and gives inspiration to those who have not yet dared to try. At times Croce's story seem to good to be true but then he brings you back to reality with a self-deprecating story that shows that he has his faults too and that the secret of his success is learning from those faults and moving on in a positive way. A must read if you are interested in the pathway to success. It makes you feel great and I believe that his story is not yet finished being written."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"whether or not you know the name pat croce, once you read his inspirational story you can't help but know the name. his motivation and drive launched him from the training room of sports injuries to the front office of sports ownership. an endless go-getter who went and got, pat croce reminds the reader to be hopelessly positive. his 'ten commandments of customer service' is a bible of business. and if owning the 76ers basketball team and starting the high-altitude Slamball league weren't enough, Pat Croce is also a highly motivated motivational speaker, author, television personality, and as his book says 'big scorer.' he'll tell you the secrets to being able to drain that 3-pointer, block that kick, and make that sale (though not all at the same time)! don't think of him so much as an 'entrepreneur' but more as an 'encourageneur.' he even inspired me to write this review! read this book!"},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"This an extremely interesting book on several levels. If you just read it to read it then it can come of as an egotistical sophomoric recount of Mr. Croce's life. If you did that you would be cheating yourself of an extremely motivational tale. Instead read between the lines, particularly up until the chapter on the ten commandments of customer service. By reading between the lines you realize that the things that made Mr. Croce successful are not his wild stories of college hijinks. It's not his repeated desire to tear appendages from those who disgree. It is his pursuit of simple truths. Great things start with small steps. Persistence. A belief in yourself and what you pursue. Although these are things we already know this book just reinforces them and serves as a reminder. His ten commandments of customer service are things we all realize are important. If asked each of us would probably produce a similar list. Yet when I read them it made me review my own companies handling of customers. I can see where some stories can come off as a little much for some people but they should not deter anyone from reading this book. When I had first finished the book I probably would have rated the book a 2, maybe a 3. After thinking about it and really looking into the story I realize it was much more of a motivational book than I recognized at first glance. While I don't think it would improve to a 5 start rating I do believe it is a very solid 4 star. It is particularly so for someone looking to fortify an already existing similar view of life."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"Wow...I was really impressed by the energy in this book, and I'm not a big sports fan either. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a bit of a reminder that anything in life is possible."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"There are several bloody good points in Pat Croce's book \\"I Feel Great and you will too!\\"First and foremost, it is the power of positive attitude. According to Pat, it was his permanently positive attitude that helped him score big in life. A positive attitude, in turn, comes in several dimensions. It is self-confidence and sincere believing that life is an extremely great thing to experience. It is expecting success in the future and doing the best you can to help God make you prosper (and this does not mean lighting lots of candles in churches, at least not limited by that). It is pushing other people's limits, helping them achieve more than they have even dreamed of. It is \\"doing good\\" to \\"do well\\". And this all genuinely generates your excitement and further reinforces your positive attitude.Pat also stresses the importance of balancing your passion and tolerance, the Yang and Yin, in doing things. Being an extremely choleric person himself, Pat emphaqsizes the importance of cultivating tolerance and caring, the Yin, while it is clear from the book that the lack of Yang (agression, energy and passion), or over-restraint of your Yang, can damage the optimal balance as much.You have to have enough passion and energy to quickly rush into doing what you think is good and worthwile, to \\"buy\\" the minds and souls of your pals into the idea; but you also have to sometimes calm yourself down, sit still, and listen to the emotions, concerns and advice of others. Or, more in Pat Croce's style, to restraint yourself from getting too hot and breaking the skull &amp; bones and ripping off the heart of someone who dared to say a bad word to you. And that all requires a good deal of Yin.Being a physical therapist himself, Pat shamelessly advertises the healthy lifestyle (physical therapy in particular), and does that so damn great, that I just couldn't keep myself from going to the gym the day I finished his book. So if you wish you had yet another stimulus to get yourself to a fitness center - this book will be a double benefit for you.Overall, the book is mostly a fun read, tells lots of interesting stories, and gives plenty of great advices. It also motivates you to do good things, become rich, engage in sport, and enjoy your life to the fulliest. A great book.P.S. I recently heard Pat Croce live, and it's nice to see that he learns and progresses. His motivational speech was mostly based on the facts from this book, but they were used more skillfully and also demonstrated some important points that this book does not make clear. Holla at you, Pat!"},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"This book was a great read, and a perfect inspirational blueprint for one to follow in life. Being that this was a book about Pat Croce by Pat Croce, you would expect some rambling, and there was plenty. Many passages just seemed to step right off the page and into some other place. And that place was not the story of Pat Croce--even if it was the story of Pat Croce. Pat goes into distinct detail on his secrets of success in business and in life, which after you read the book you'll relize its more like common sense.

Pat Croce is a person who always believed in himself, his purpose in life and what he needed to do to be successful. In this book, he provides a reality of what life is all about and how you need to think in order to be successful in life no matter if it is business or personal.The irony is that as you read the book you see that Pat is nothing more than a very normal (at times crazy) guy, whohad the determination to achieve success. Although Pat at times appears arrogant of his success, he appears to be very grounded in himself and who he really is in this life. The most amazing part of the Croce story is his overwhelming loyalty to his family, friends and all his assocites throughtout all his years. Not many guys have friends who remain that close with them all these years. In addition through all his success,he always included them every step of the way. That is an attribute that is more valuable than his business success when the ballots on life are conuted.The book details his struggles with his motorcycle accident which almost resulted in him losing his leg and his difficult road to recovery. It also focuses on his rise to success in the Physicial therapy business and the building of a new sixers organization. His 10 commandments for customer services can and should be applied to any business as well as a general approach to life.This is enjoyable and allows you to appreciate a simple regular guy who worked hard to achieve success but more importantly knows how to enjoy his life everyday. Pat Croce your are a business success but more importantly as a man."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"Fantastic Book!

I picked up this book expecting lots of insight, and saw many shallow, reworked quotes that have been used by other people. I got something out of his customer service commandments, but that was one chapter out of a book. He kept talking about feeling great, sustaining all kinds of energy, but he really never got into the deeper discussion on how he did it.If you pick up this book for a quick laugh and lighthearted reading, then this book is for you. It wasn't a bad book if you want to hear his life story, I just felt it didn't give a lot of in depth information. There were a lot of adolescent anecdotes and funny tales, definitely a book geared at \\"one of the boys\\", since a lot of the humor in the beginning of the book was directed at the male passage through college."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"Ok, I was pretty excited when I heard about this book.

It's simply the tale of an extraordinary man whose experiences and insights you can apply to your own life. And you don't have to be a basketball junkie or even a sports fan to enjoy the book.

I usually shy away from books like this becuase they tend to be preachy. That is not the case here. Mr. Croce has made a life for himself by thinking positivly, and there's no doubting what he has been able to accomplish. Being a Philadelphia-area native, I remember his radio show and morning spot on the news. I remember getting ready to go to high-school in the morning, and while I can barely get myself out of bed, Croce is on live TV, full of vigor and life few of us can experience on our best days. This book will no doubt motivate and inspire, all without talking down to you. This is a book for the people, by one of the biggest person in the world. We're talking about a man who gave some poor kids a lift to a sixers game when they didnt have any other way to get there. Or the man who flew down from the rafters on a harness when the sixers were in the playoffs.

Get it!"},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"I first got to know Pat Croce from that invention reality show a while back called \\"American Inventor.\\" He was on the panel of judges, and I found myself liking him and the comments he made to the competitors.So when I saw \\"I Feel Great and you will too!\\" by Pat Croce with Bill Lyon, I decided to check it out. The subtitle is \\"An Inspiring Journey Of Success With Practical Tips On How To Score Big In Life,\\" and I found the book to be just that.I have to admit, this was one of the most enjoyable \\"self-help\\" or \\"success\\" books I have read in quite a while. I found Croce's story inspiring and educational. Maybe it is the martial art connection we share, or that similar brashness and proneness to trouble, I'm not sure, I just know that I related to Croce and enjoyed his stories and found much wisdom in his advice.Croce's enthusiasm for life shines through in this text, even when he discusses his disappointments and challenges. In fact, it is his enthusiasm for life and his ultra positive outlook and attitude that helped him get past those hurdles.Throughout the book there are little bold quotes titled \\"Pat Croce Pointer.\\" Some of these are old sayings and some are modifications of things your mother may have told you. Others are unique to Croce. All of them are practical and make sense if you adhere to them.Reading Pat Croce's story was uplifting and motivational. His passion is contagious and while reading this book you can't help but feel great and motivated to get out and take action on your dreams and goals. Croce is a fascinating individual that I would thoroughly enjoy meeting for a drink and a discussion on how to conquer all obstacles in the path toward greatness.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants an uplifting life story and the encouragement to feel great! Read it and let Croce's passion for life motivate you toward greatness.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"I not only recommend this book, but also the other motivational books Pat has written.

His life is the classic American rages to riches story. He is in your face with challenges, no excuses given or taken. His books [also 110 Percent] are inspirational, thought provoking, a good dose of smelling salts in the conformity of America's lackadaisical attitude of today regarding conducting oneself in day to day activities.There are many excellent reminders throughout his book borrowed from other writers/poets.

I didn't know anything about Croce until I picked up his book and started reading portions. There's very little new in his 10 commandments but I found his message personal and personable so I took the plunge and purchased it. It's a fast and lively read. However, I perceived some troubling double standards in aspects of his behavior. For example, he seems to think it was perfectly acceptable (and manly?) for him to toss darts at a college roommate who was reluctant to move when Croce wanted him out to make room for a high school chum. The recalcitrant roomie quickly changed his mind and moved. Yet Croce assumes an heroic stance when he takes on an athlete in the locker room because the guy is bullying trainers. Plus he seems to revel in blow by blow details of physical fights he's had along the way. He and I are about the same age and I'm embarrassed to even admit I had fights as a younger man. Despite this, I finished the book liking the guy more than disliking him. On the other hand, my 22 year-old son thinks he's great and loved this book."},{"Title":"I Feel Great and You Will Too!: An Inspiring Journey of Success With Practical Tips on How to Score Big in Life","review":"I heard Pat speak and was so moved I bought and then quickly read his book.

Not in this book. The Bills were placed first in this book. Granted they had some good years but they had more lean ones in the AFL than good ones to merit top billing. For example, the \\"game of the year\\" feature that he had in here covered too many Bills games.Yes it is still an informative book and yes you will learn a lot about the AFL, but if there was less Bills talk and more coverage of the other teams this book would be even better."},{"Title":"If You Can't Join 'Em, Beat 'em: A Remembrance of the American Football League (1st Books Library)","review":"Sal Maiorana has captured the spirit(s) of the men who were shut out by the NFL as they sought to bring professional football to their cities.\\"Rebel Leagues\\" always attract a unique group of owners, players, and fans, and the American Football League was one of the few that went on to join the establishment.

It is for anyone involved in the social service field, and for anyone who works with child abuse and neglect on any level. I personally found the book to be an excellent reference tool, and solid teaching material.This book lays out the definitions, current issues, and treatments surrounding child abuse and neglect. It also presents various models and perspectives and sums up different social theories; enhancing its title of &quot;multidisciplinary approaches&quot;. Although the book discusses the need for a mutidisciplinary team approach,(and even devotes a chapter to the issue) it could have emphasized this to a greater degree and focused more upon conflict resolution among team members. Perhaps the authors could have created a uniform system for setting up a team of professionals with every suspected child abuse case from every point of entry within the group of professionals typically involved with a team. Also guidelines that could be adopted by the social service agencies involved. Maybe that will become the focus for another book."},{"Title":"The Chimney of the World: A History of Smoke Pollution in Victorian and Edwardian Manchester.

Not quite a biography, this book is a mixture of reminiscences, teachings and photographs of the author's father, Sri Krishnamacharya. One of my favorite stories describes Krishnamacharya's journey to a temple known long ago for its learned teachers. When he arrived by foot, exhausted, the gateskeeper suggested he first nap outside the grounds. Later, inside, he met a great teacher &quot;seated beneath a banyan tree granting knowledge to all his disciples&quot; and promptly memorized all his words upon recitation---only to awaken outside to the self-same gateskeeper, who slyly asked if he had found what he was looking for. The lost teachings had been transmitted in a dream. There is much more than this, of course, including many practical aspects and insights on all 8 limbs of classical yoga. There are two related shortcomings in this otherwise superb book. First, look at the fine &quot;Essence of Yoga&quot; by Desikachar's student, B. Bouanchaud. The frontispiece is a drawing by Krishnamacharya depicting Patanjali surrounded by his four students. These students represent the four books of the Yoga Sutras, the same teachings having been presented differently and with different emphases for each student. This skill-in-means is fundamental to Krishnamacharya's whole approach to yoga. While three of his students (B.K.S. Iyengar, Indra Devi, T.K.V. Desikachar) are mentioned here, I was surprised to read all 211 pages and find that A.G. Mohan, Krishnamacharya's fourth student for 18 years, was not mentioned once. (Lest there be any doubt, see Krishnamacharya's warm dedication to Mohan's fine book, &quot;Yoga for Body, Breath and Mind.&quot;) This oversight taints a full appreciation of Krishnamacharya's true living tradition. Also, I believe there is something more to yoga and healing than the &quot;We care&quot; attitude emphasisized later in the book, but that emphasis may be related to the author's caring, sociable nature. That said, this is a marvelous book about an extraordinary man, well-written by an accomplished yogi who knew him well. There is something poignant in the author's tale of his own expedition to the Himalayas, searching for the cave where his father's guru lived and taught, the plight of a modern man who, like most of us, cannot wholly comprehend Krishnamacharya's accomplishments in the Vedic tradition. There are lessons here for us all. Don't miss it for the world."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"I have just read this book. It is destined to become a classic book about yoga. It is more than just a biography of Krishnamacharya's life, it is a very straightforward account of Hindu theology and one of the best summaries of Patanjali\\"s writings I have ever read. So many things in the book are skillfully examined, such as the role of Sanskrit language in yoga, and how yoga fits in historically with eastern religious life. I have come to view Krishnamacharya as a reformer bringing yoga into the modern world, and more important to the west. I compare _Health, Healing and Beyond : The Living Tradition of Krishnamacharya_ with the yoga classic, _Autobiography of a Yogi_ and the latter is found wanting in terms of providing any real illumination about the system of yoga."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"You do not have to be a serious practitioner of Yoga to appreciate the warmth that Desichakar brings forth in this tribute to his father. This is a story told from the heart, of a sons admiration and love of one of the foremost Yogis to have lived. I found myself finishing the book in less than a day. For those not familiar with the essence of Yoga as art, philosophy and science, this book offers an easy to comprhend overview of this timeless tradition which offers an incomparable richness to anyone who begins the journey. Krishnamacharya's devotion, compassion, and uncompromising discipline are an inspiration. This is Yoga beyond the commercialization and dilution of the art that is now so prevalent in the West."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"Eloquent and accessible, Desikachar's tribute to his father not only accomplishes it's aim, but also illuminates the origins of indian philosophy and offers insight into the Hindu culture. Easily read, this is a wonderful source of information for not only practioners, but for everyone interested in this ancient science, and the man, who in all humility could be called the father of modern yoga."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"Whilst I am in awe of Sri Krishnamacharya and have been for many years, this book, written by his son, is a very difficult and dry read. At page 81, I just gave up and getting to that page took me a couple of months! It is also tiring to constantly read how great Sri K. was - I know that already!There is very little if any information on the discoveries that Sri K. made from studying Sanskrit literature sprinkled all over India. There is also very little information of his life, hardships and realtionships with his chief disciples.Interpretation of the Patanjali Sutras is also done from a very physical Hatha point of view which I have never agreed with - see &quot;Bringing the Inner God to Life&quot; by Swami Shankarananda Giri or learn Kriya Meditation to see what I mean. The book by Swami Shankarananda Giri is a translation of Patanjali's Sutras and goes much deeper and beyond Hatha Yoga and presents more logical arguments."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"Great book explaining how a yogi is called and educated. Wonderful message about the middle path of devotion. Not too much, not too little, always present as a practice in life."},{"Title":"Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya","review":"When I bought this book I expected to read about deep details of the life of the 'teacher of teachers' T.Krishnamacharya. But as his son, the author, says in the very first chapters T.K did not divulge a lot to even his own son. From that point in the book I expected to be bored with the authors ramblings, but was pleasantly surprised to find it a good read.While it would have been good to get a first account from TK, this secondhand account from his student and son is not bad. For me personally, it removes the suspicious aura of mystery that surrounds these 'yogi people'. Desikachar comes across as a completely earthy person who finds himself in close proximity to a legend. I liked his writing style. A good addition to my yoga library."},{"Title":"La Rage au Coeur","review":"Excellent book on Colombian politics. Effective as a recent historical analysis of the conflict and Colombian corruption. Though I read it in French I believe it would be even more helpful in Spanish (don't know if there is a Spanish version). Also a warm reading for those who've spent some time in France as she writes beautifully and makes several references to how French culture has shaped her as a politician and individual. It's not the most academic or intellectual thing you'll read in your life but it is quick and informative at a relatively objective level."},{"Title":"Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, and Visions (Haworth Gay and Lesbian Studies)","review":"I enjoyed the book overall, but found it lacking in someperspectives. It's wonderful from a multi-cultural standpoint, butthere is very little information about rural bisexuals, or those _not_ living out, queer lives. It's a good place to start reading on the subject, though, and the historical perspective was interesting."},{"Title":"Socrates in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"Having a great interest in philosophy,I so looked forward to what promised to be(based on the title)a wonderful experience reading this and 3 other books I purchased with similar titles by Mr. Strathern. Sadly,the experience was a terrible disappointment. One learns more about MR.Strathern's personal philosophical preferences and predjudices then about the men in question. Most good writers and teachers of philosophy I have been exposed to do their best to disengage their personal feelings and try to express the philosopher's ideas. Unfortunately,Mr. Strathern can't bring himself to bo that. These books are not worthy of anyone serious in their quest to learn about these great thinkers. I would recommend Stumpf's &quot;Socrates to sartre&quot; for anyone wanting to know more about these great men in a shorthand format."},{"Title":"Socrates in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"This book is a quite good introduction to the life of Socrates. It is less good as a description of that method of dialogue , the maieutic method of philosophical midwifery by which Socrates attempted to educe the truth about any given concept or subject. Strathern accurately portrays Socrates role as gadfly- teaching the arrogant complacent citizens of Athens that they really did not understand what they thought they understood or know what they thought they knew. He too is good describing Socrates disturbing social role in Athens. He also retells the story of Socrates trial, drinking of the hemlock and becoming the world's first martyr of philosophy. He does not however stress the important point that Socrates took this action out of his sense of loyalty to the polis,his sense of duty as a citizen of Athens. And that therefore the one who had been tried and accused as disloyal to the state, in effect gave his life in a display ( wisely or not)of loyalty to it. And this when the courage and calm in the face of death is too an essential part of the heroic image of the philosopher Socrates leaves to posterity."},{"Title":"Socrates in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"This unabridged lecture on Socrates (469-399 B.C.) covers all of the major aspects of the life of the famed Ancient Greek philosopher including his personal life, his military career (he served with distinction as a hoplite, the Athenian equivalent of a buck private), the sordid story of his execution by the government of Athens, his influences, who he influenced, his impact, both good and bad, on Western society and more. Throw in the entertaining (and surprisingly approachable considering it is about philosophy) text and the great delivery by narrator Robert Whitfield and this short little audiobook is a well worth listen."},{"Title":"Socrates in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"... and this is one of my favorites. I went to the library one day, intent on learning a little bit on philosophy, a subject I knew absolutely nothing about. One of the books I picked up was &quot;Thomas Aquinas in 90 Minutes&quot; by the same author. In the next few weeks, I read about 12 of Strathern's &quot;Philosophers in 90 Minutes&quot; books, every one the library had. I went to another library and got all the ones they had.Strathern's books changed my life; it was like going to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and seeing people like myself. I discovered that I like thinking and philosophy. &quot;Socrates in 90 Minutes&quot; is one of my favorites. I went as far as to buy it in hopes that my wife would read it. Since my introduction to Strathern's work, I have started to build a collection of it, one that I hope to have for decades to come.If you want to start anywhere in philosophy, &quot;Socrates in 90 Minutes&quot; is a great place to start, both because of the subject and the writing. Strathern is witty and well-written, and it comes out brillantly in this book, which I think is the best of his small ones.No, this book isn't for someone getting their Master's Degree in Philosophy. So what? It's fun to read and you get an idea of what Socrates was really like. Strathern does tend to focus more on the philosophers' lives than their works, but I think this is the best way to get to know them, for you can't understand an idea without its context. &quot;Cogito ergo sum,&quot; doesn't seem very impressive when you don't take into consideration a millenium of intellectual thought being stiffled.In this book, you get to realize how Socrates developed his philosophy, how people reacted to it and how people reacted to him. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read something more meaningful than a Harold Robbins paperback. It's fun and it's a book you'll want to keep forever."},{"Title":"Socrates in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"\\"Socrates in90 Minutes\\" -- another installment in Paul Strathern's \\"philosophers in 90-minutes series\\" -- delivers precisely what it was designed to. Strathern leads us in a wide-ranging discussion of everything you might want to know about Socrates - his place of birth, the issues that were salient in his day, his education, his personal life with wife Xanthippe, and his death by hemlock. You will learn how we know about Socrates, his relationship with Plato and his influence on his day and future generations. You will accompany Strathern as he takes us to the places where Socrates taught and died. You will also find out what a strange fellow he was - bald, bowlegged, bulge-eyed and irritating as all get out. Strathern does a wonderful job of blending the sources to provide a real-life glimpse of the man who gave us the Socratic dialog and inspired countless generations with his unyielding puncturing of the pretensions of his day. Beyond a few aphorisms (\\"To thine own self be true,\\" etc.) you might not hear as many of Socrates' words as you might like, but what you get in 90 minutes is the context for any future study of this fascinating man."},{"Title":"Differential Equations with Graphical and Numerical Methods","review":"I used this book for a Differential Equations class and found it to be just perfect. It does not barrage the user with needless examples. Either you get the material or not, the author is not going to give you walk throughs on absolutely everything so you plug and chug instead of learn. You can get this book for less than 10 bucks used off amazon, so forget the bookstore and their absurd prices. This book will take you from first order linear differential equations to masters degree level DE's."},{"Title":"Differential Equations with Graphical and Numerical Methods","review":"I found this book to contain all the necessary information a Differential Equations textbook should have, but it was often presented in such a way as to make it confusing to the reader, if the reader did not already know the subject matter. The main problem is that concepts are more exhibited than explained."},{"Title":"Tony Zale vs. Rocky Graziano","review":"I'm a big boxing fan and a big fan of Don Dunphy. I really looked forward to hearing these fights. However, I was very disappointed. The poor sound quality is excusable - you have to use the material that's available. What's not excusable to me is that only the highlights of the fights are presented. Instead this CD seems to be a promo for Bill Cayton. Before and after every round there is an announcement that this recording is brought to you by Bill Cayton. Someone should just put the entire recording of the fights on CD. That's what anyone really wants to hear, not constant promos."},{"Title":"Sex Signals: The Biology of Love","review":"Must read! Perper took a tax write-off for his engagement by sitting in bars with his fiancee watching the interaction between men and women. He chronicles a laundry list of mistakes the average person makes while trying to attract a mate.What is the most common signal women send but men ignore? Dancing in place. When a woman dances alone (either standing or sitting), she is saying, \\"Approach me.\\" For more hints, read the book.\\"Sex Signals\\" is written a level above casual. If you are looking for Cosmo or Maxim, this is not for you. If you have some college, it is a valuable reference and guide to making the most of your evening on the town.I also recommend \\"The Biology of Love\\" by Fisher."},{"Title":"Sex Signals: The Biology of Love","review":"I have two points. The first concerns the importance of this book. The second is on its usefulness to the average person.In my opinion, this book was as important an addition to the field as was Kinsey in its time. Perper's work was groundbreaking when it was published. When you realize that this is real research, and not some April Fool's joke, it becomes quite remarkable. He covers ground that was uncovered before him - ground that was the subject of much professional skepticism (to put it mildly). When this came out, little things like pupil expansion were new research. Today, what every successful rug merchant knew, only as passed down cultural knowledge, is now validated in science: \\"The first key is in the eyes\\".The biological signals that Perper observed can be useful to more than the professional, they can be useful to an ordinary person to understand the people around them. Perper describes for us body language that we can see in real, everyday life.The book is mostly very dry (as others have described), but the gold nuggets are not that hard to find. I read this book when it was first published. Since then, perhaps others have come out with other books covering the same ground, but in a more readable fashion. I don't know - but I do know that Perper's work changed how I interacted with people. Not in major ways, but definitely in significant ones."},{"Title":"Sex Signals: The Biology of Love","review":"it's great... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ./.. ,... ... ... ... ... ... ."},{"Title":"Sex Signals: The Biology of Love","review":"I read the first 20 pages or so, then paged through well over half the book, stopping here and there to read a bit, then threw it in the waste basket.

The novels are written for the pre-teen or teenage level, but are enjoyable for any age group.As the story opens Septimus Quinn is a nerdy 15-year-old teenager, short and slightly built. He wears glasses. He relies on brains instead of brawn. He is prone to experimenting, much to the dismay of the people around him.The novels follow his various adventures in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War following the Peace of Amiens. He is an action hero, achieving great successes, destroying enemy ships, rescuing a damsel in distress, escaping from captivity, etc. He gets knocked out a couple times, but survives and carries on.He does develop a love interest, but the book has no real sexual content.Some people are killed (this is a war), but there is no excessive violence, and no bad language.I would recommend the collection for younger readers."},{"Title":"The Midshipman Quinn Collection (Bethlehem Budget Books)","review":"Clever, well written, enjoyable.Probably a little on the juvenile side, but still valuable.

He is a resourceful and intelligent guy who will go far up the ladder in the Royal Navy. The author, Showell Styles, has an interesting writing style and a knack for creating action and suspense. Therefore, the books are interesting, easy, and a joy to read.The target audience for these books is the younger reader, although I, as an adult, enjoyed them a lot. Absent are bad language, explicit violence, and any sexual adventures--sort of a \\"Disney\\" version. Don't let that dissuade you from reading them, though. I think this must have been the view of the Royal Navy that many young men must have had before they signed up, only to be disappointed by the harsh realities later on.Nevertheless, this it a great set--perfect for your grandson.

Small in size but not in scope, it less delves into his life and work with hardly a wasted word. Short but very insightful discussions of the character and occasional shortcomings in his compositions, with very level-headed and perceptive opinions (and a more positive reception of the composer's Late Period than I would have thought from a work of that time). The discussion is not watered down, but never gets over the head of the average listener. Many pieces are quickly dealt with, but the writing is direct, the insights sharp, the points well-taken. What's most impressive is how Scott has advanced many a theory I've rarely heard since, but which make such good sense. One wonders why she wasn't take more seriously, her insights not more frequently cited by others in their works. (Was it because she was a woman in a man's world?) She speculates, for example, that the \\"central three\\" of the last five Beethoven quartets were likely culled from aborted attempts to write masses; this not only describes their spiritual quality\\" better than the modern cliche about how they initiated \\"the avant garde,\\" but it also explains Beethoven's famous cyptic note to his publisher about Op. 131: pilfered together from this and that. If indeed much of the material came from the three masses that comment would be justified. Furthermore, she claims the last quartet, Op. 135, short as it was, would have been even shorter because it was originally intended to be only three movements. But while many critics believed the slow movement to be the added section, she doubts this because that would have meant every movement in the quartet was in F Major. Rather she posits that the scherzo is actually the extraneous movement, and even claims it does little to advance the quartet. We've been so blinded by its bold audacity that we've failed to see that this is quite true. If you doublt me, try playing the work without the scherzo: in some ways it's even more interesting.I'm surprised this book isn't better-known today, and has not recently been reprinted. I got more out of this slim volume than out of many biographies or analyses that go on for 500 pages or more. Worth looking for. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beethoven (The Master musicians series)","review":"The original Beethoven study in this series dates back to 1899. However in 1934, Dent Music Masters replaced that early volume with an entirely new study by Marion M. Scott. This particular edition enjoyed great popularity and was reprinted nine times between 1934 and 1974. Scott (1877-1953), an English music critic, musicologist, violinist and composer, untook a completely new study of Beethoven's life and work. Her insightful comments on his music are based on her own interpretations and careful study of each score. She visited Beethoven's birthplace and immersed herself in his world. The result is an extraordinary classic study of the man and his music. Scott was a metaphysician who probed deeply into the spirital aspects of Beethoven's music and created a text that is both stimulating and profound. &quot;Beethoven's last quartets are not the justification of modern music,&quot; Scott observes, &quot;but modern music has reached the point at which it justifies the quartets and proves Beethoven's genius to have been transcendental.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets","review":"It wasn't until I was a few pages into the first chapter, when I realized that this is Vilar's book entitled \\"A Messsage from God in the Atomic Age\\", with a new title.

I HAVE NEVER READ ANY OTHER PUBLICATION THAT HAS SUCH A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON ONE'S LIFE...OTHER THAN THE BIBLE.The Bible describes GOD's hand in the life of mankind 2000+ years ago. This book catalogues GOD's miraculous hand in the lives of people living today. The individuals are photographed and contactable!It demonstrates that GOD is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. If we step out in faith to do his will, he will accomplish great things through us. The main character Danny Shelton did just that. He had no influential connections, not enough money in the bank to cover even his phone bill, and nothing more than a high-school education. Yet, on the prompting from God, he founded a billion dollar World-wide Christian TV Broadcasting Network, 3ABN. This was established on faith and is continued to be run on faith.This book has taught me HOW GOD SPEAKS TO US. It not necessarily is through visions or dreams. God no longer seems to talk to us from the heavens. He instead speaks to us through a 'STILL SMALL VOICE'... a 'STRONG IMPRESSION/FEELING'. All the people whose experiences are described in this book, were led by these 'strong impressions'. They knew these impressions were from God because they had dedicated their lives to Him and were closely connected with Him in earnest prayer and Bible study. On occasion they \\"threw out the fleece\\" once or twice in a row to \\"test\\" the authenticity of these directions. They asked the Lord to fulfil \\"impossible\\" requirements. These conditions being satisfied, they \\"followed Him\\", with breathtaking results.The people written about come from Charasmatic, Baptist, AOG, Seventh Day Adventist and other backgrounds ... however the 3ABN network and the leading character in the story are both Seventh Day Adventist. The demonination should not get in the way of the story nor serve to offend. The primary blessing of this book is two fold:- Seeing God in action in the lives of Christian believers TODAY- Learning how God speaks to usIf you \\"happen\\" to purchase and read this book, be assured \\"it was not by chance\\".

I was shopping for baseball titles as gifts, and clicked on Summer Game in the search results. First, I am a literature student, who loves good writing. Second, I am a huge baseball fan. Third, I'm a girl. On the basis of previous reviews, I purchased Summer Game and Five Seasons, for me AND for my step-father. From the very first page I was blown away. Angell's vocabulary is tremendous; his use of metaphor phenomenal. Baseball really is poetry. I've had several eyebrows raised in my direction on the train as I laugh out loud at his descriptions of players, fans, owners, botched plays, you name it. Nothing and nobody escapes his notice. A bonus for me is suspense: most of these essays pre-date my arrival on the planet by a good 5 years, so I'm too young to know the outcome of a particular World Series or playoff round. Within 2 days, I'd ordered the rest of Angell's baseball books on amazon. They will join the complete works section of my collection, which includes Shakespeare and Jane Austen -- to name a few! Don't hesitate to buy these books for yourself, or for a friend. You'll heartily enjoy them!"},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"The subtitle of this book tells it all: &quot;Roger Angell on baseball.&quot; The articles collected in &quot;The Summer Game&quot; first appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1962-72. Angell is not only a first-rate writer but a true fan of the game. He writes about the rise of California baseball, the wonderful world of expansion including the comical and agonizing sufferings of the Amazin' Mets, the fall of the mighty New York Yankees, baseball in French (Montreal's Expos), baseball indoors (the Houston Astrodome), baseball in the spring, baseball during the winter hot-stove league, and the Miracle Mets of 1969. Many of the articles focus on the World Series, so fans of the Dodgers, Cardinals and Orioles will enjoy their double triumphs within this period, while the Tigers and Pirates will remember their classic seven-game Series, and the Red Sox fans will have to endure with having come ever so close. There is humor in these writings, but there is also affection, so when Angell expresses his bitterness over the arrogance and greed that threatened to overwhelm the game he loves he speaks for all of us. Yes, it is insane that the writing of Roger Angell or Red Smith or any of the other great sportswriters of the last century are out of print. They do not need to be preserved on the internet, they need to be in print on paper."},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"The fact that this book (and Mr. Angell's other remarkable books about baseball) is out of print disturbs me on two levels. As a baseball fan, I have found these books to be an invaluable source of comfort during the long winter months when our game goes into hybernation. As a reader, I have found in these volumes beautiful writing and keen insight, something that is so often lacking in what passes for journalism today. Mr. Angell (longtime fiction editor at The New Yorker) writes about baseball as a fan, and he does so for fans. Real fans - those of us who recognize that a double and a single are preferable to a home run, those that marvel at a right fielder's gorgeous one-hop throw to third to nip the sliding runner, those that hurt just a little bit during rain delays. If, by some wild stretch of the imagination the publisher of the Summer Game (I don't remember who it was right off) reads this, I think a single collection of the best of Angell's baseball writings is in order - if not a re-pressing of all."},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"Maybe the best writer that I've ever read and not just about baseball...I must concur with the other reviewers that it's scandelous that this and other Roger Angell books are out of print, especially with all the sub-par writing that is on the market today. Mr. Angell's ability to craft details into a much larger story and tell it with humour and keen insight are amazing to me. Chapter after chapter of this book are combined into one long pleasing account from a fan's perspective that leaves you wishing that it would never end. More than just a season-by-season run-down, Angell provides his views with a unique perspective for each season that goes beyond mere sports reporting and seems to provide a theme that is clever, humerous and poignant. This should be read by every baseball fan to see what real sports-writing is like and I think that you'll agree that all other sports commentary pales by comparison. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"There are some great baseball writers. Roger Kahn and Pat Jordan come to mind. Roger Angell is the very best of them all. This book is as much a part of my youth as family vacations. I have read this book numerous times, often just picking up random pages and reading for hours until sleep overtook me. There is something about New York City, the 1950s, and the Brooklyn Dodgers that contributed to the axiom that the best sportswriting is baseball writing. Angell is it, in its purest form. Jaques Barzun, a French writer, visited America around the turn of the century to discover what de Toqueville had found some 70 years earlier. Barzun concluded that, &quot;In order to know America, you have to know baseball.&quot; To a current generation of young baseball enthusisasts who want to grasp what an older generation felt about this game, I recommend &quot;The Summer Game&quot; above all others. &quot;Five Seasons&quot; might be next, but &quot;The Summer Game&quot; is the best of the lot. It carries forward from Angell's 1950s experiences, and is part of his reportage for The New Yorker. Somehow he infuses the high art literacy necessary for a publication of this sort with the most lyrical, dead-on anlaysis of baseball ever. He starts with the 1962 Mets, and covers them over several Casey Stengel Polo Grounds seasons. No description ever conveys the wackiness of those lovable losers better, or the old-style devotion of New York fans of the by-gone era. This is the Brooklyn Dodger contingent transferred to Polo and Shea. Angell covers the '67 Red Sox, the '68 World Series (McClain vs Gibson overshadowed by Lolich), the Amazin' Mets, the Bay Area in their season of two division champs (1971), and other events, always including the World Series' played between '62 and '71. His writing about Dodger Stadium and Dodger fans in 1966 demonstrates the best of the &quot;new age&quot; Los Angeleno baseball enthusiasts, the modernists if you will. It describes vividly how an era has turned. He paints a picture of a beautiful new stadium bathed in Califrnia sunlight that is pure romanticism. To a young California reader, as I once was, it was the most perfect imagery.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"Incredibly lyrical, insightful, moving and thought-provoking book, and apparently becoming a forgotten gem. Kahn and Halbertsam are popular, but they aren't even in Angell's league (only Boswell is). Part baseball chronicle, part social commentary, part comedy, part tragedy, and always full of love for the game and its fans--this one should be treasured and preserved. Even though he wrongly didn't think much of the Astrodome, I forgive him."},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"Re-reading this wonderful book last year reminded me how much I miss Angell's baseball stories in the New Yorker. Every season he wrote two or three insightful (to my mind -- at least one reviewer disagrees) articles about the current season, typically appearing around spring training, midseason, and after the Series. I miss those stories!This is a collection of his first ten years, beginning in 1962. For those of you who remember Mays and Mantle, Gibson and Brock, it is a wonderful collection, and may bring back memories. Even if you're younger, great writing about an interesting era of the sport, when the real league champions (not fluke \\"playoff\\" winners, who got hot for 2-3 weeks) played in the World Series each year."},{"Title":"The Summer Game(Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","review":"A collection of baseball stories that appeared in 'The New Yorker' magaizine in the 1960's following popular teams of the day, at one point we see where a ballplayer says,\\"I was with the NAACP before it became camp.\\" Wow!

Although this book was an entertaining, quick read, it sketches out a factual scenario so implausible as to be ridiculous. (If you don't wish to know part of the ending stop reading here).In particular, it suggests that a Republican convention deadlocked between the liberal Nelson Rockerfeller, the conservative Ronald Reagan, and the in-between Richard Nixon would pick John Lindsay, who was far to the left of any of them."},{"Title":"Our next President;: The incredible story of what happened in the 1968 elections","review":"In early 2000, who would have predicted the U.S. Supreme Court would ultimately decide the upcoming presidential election?Russell Baker published this short novel in February 1968, nine months BEFORE the vote.

It covers such topics as establishing one's identity as coach, an overview of Softball's basics, planning the season, how to teach Softball's essential skills, how to conduct a practice, and dealing with parents and gender issues. It also includes a Drill Section that offers various drills for warm-ups, defensive fundamentals, and batting stations.As much as I like Jacquie Joseph as an author, I was disappointed in this book overall. There is little here that is not covered by other books, and in fact most of the topics discussed are covered better in various other books. For example, there are only three paragraphs dedicated to the difference between coaching boys and girls and they only include generalities. Also, the chapter on dealing with parents is only two written pages long!The final three chapters of the book are dedicated to basic warm up, defensive, and batting drills. Though the book is written with the beginner coach teaching beginning players as its audience, there are a sprinkling of intermediate and advanced drills that seem out of place in this book. Also, there is no Drill Finder Matrix to help a coach quickly find an appropriate drill, which is surprising to me because Jacquie Joseph has written a very good drill book that includes one of the best Drill Finders I have seen. Perhaps she did not include a Drill Finder because there are only a total of 28 warm up, 12 defensive, and 10 batting drills listed.There are some positives to draw from \\"The Baffled Parent's Guide to Coaching Youth Softball\\". The \\"Softball in a Nutshell\\" chapter is a very good primer for the coach or parent who is completely unfamiliar with the sport. Also, each chapter has a Question and Answer section that includes some good information. It has a call-out box that ranks positions in the order of the skill required to play it, something I have not seen presented elsewhere.Unfortunately, though, the information presented here is so basic and/or general overall that any coach will quickly outgrow the guidance after a couple of practices under his belt. I therefore would not recommend this book, even for a coach completely new to the game.

She is truly a \\"phenomenal woman\\". If you have not read her autobiography yet, I strongly suggest you start asap. To say this book is interesting and fascinating would be selling it short. As I begin her next volume, I'm quite certain that I will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"Gather Together in My Name, the 1974 follow-up to I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, is the shortest book in Maya's autobiographical series, but it's jam packed with the harsh realities of life.Gather, which takes its title from the Bible verse Matthew 18:19-20, opens in the optimistic atmosphere of post World War II era America. Now 17 year old Maya (or Rita as she called herself at the time) moves out her mother and stepfather's San Francisco home and tries to make a life for herself and her baby boy Guy. Her ultimate fantasy is being swept off her feet by her Prince Charming and live happily ever after, but daydreams don't pay the bills.She works several waitressing jobs until she agrees to be the \\"absentee manager\\" of a brothel with the help of two lesbian prostitutes. That's right. Maya Angelou was once a teenage madam. Fearing arrest and losing custody of her son, she returns to Momma (her grandmother) and Uncle Willie in Stamps, soon discovering you really can't go home again. Having lived up north where racism wasn't as pervasive, the more sassy Maya forgets her \\"place\\" in segregated Arkansas and a run-in with a racist store clerk forces Momma to send Maya and Guy back to California.While trying to find her place in the world, the young naive girl finds herself taken advantage of many times. She falls in love with an older man who later ditches her for another woman and a preacher boyfriend fools her into prostituting herself in order to pay off some gangsters. She stumbles, falls, and makes a fool of herself over and over again until nearly losing her baby to a deranged babysitter sets her on the right path.Maya is always honest about her life, but she really put it all on the line in this book. She's not proud of some of the things she's done, but she reveals herself as a human whose made several dumb choices, but managed to learn from them. In other words, your past doesn't have to define who you can become. \\"The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life\\". Continue to teach and preach, Dr. Angelou!"},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"I always as a little girl looked up to Maya Angelou, I always thought she was wonderful.

Her fluid and simple way of directing the reader to the core of African American hardships is just one of the many reasons why anyone interested in the scope of contemporary human experience should read this book.POSITIVES: A beautiful memoir that shows not only the amazing life of one African American, but follows a cause-and-effect format, one that impresses the need for understanding, not judging, the author's life.NEGATIVES: While it is an unbelievable read, bear in mind that it is only 192 pages long. This being the case, I found that it seemed rushed and too brief for my liking.SUMMARY: Confessing the truths of her later teen years, Maya leads us through her time spent at multiple jobs and broken relationships, all leading her towards an eventual realization and understanding of life.

On her journey she had to find jobs that could support her and her son, Guy. Through her experience as a teenager, she had to deal with racism, looking for jobs, and watching out for dangerous men. Ever since she starts working in resturants, she falls in love with couple of guys and had later dumped her and used her. Some of the men even made her became a prositute so that they can get her money out of her. After getting tricked and get fooled by \\"pimps,\\" she return to her normal life and through her obstacles and experiences, she realized that she was not just a little girl, but a woman.Important Scence:The most important scence that really captured me was when Maya met 2 white women in a store in downtown of Arkansas shopping for her clothes. One of the white woman was being rude to her as if Maya was a pet, yelling and screaming with disrespectful manners. The white woman says, \\"How do you pronoun your name, gal? Speak up!\\" Maya mentioned,\\"In that moment I became rootless, nameless, pastless.\\" So Maya decide to talked back and said, \\"is Miss Johnson. If you have occasion to use my name, which I seriously doubt, I advise you to address me as Miss Johnson. For if I need to allude to your pitiful selves, I shall call you Miss Idiot...\\"(pg. 76-77) The two white women were speechless. I thought it was a courageous thing to do because Maya stood up and say what she beleived in and nobody could take her rights away from that.Opinions:After I finished reading this book, it really helped me to understand how a teenager's life can be when you have to face many obstacles and many experiences. Also it really helped me to understand that life is not easy for teenagers. I really liked this book and how it influence me a lot.Reommendations:I would want to recommend this book to my peers, because some of my friends I know are mostly teenagers under pressure of living in a world of indenpendence. I wouldn't recommend this to adults, because I guess most of adults have already challenge obstacles and what it is like when they were teenagers. I would also recommend this book to other schools, because the book deals with racism and deals with a lot of history.Ponder This:a.) Keep in mind that during this time period, most men are \\"pimps/players.\\"b.) Watch for setting, b/c the authors travel a lot in this book.c.) Also keep in mind that the author falls in love a lot."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"\\"Gather Together in My Name\\" is a work of autobiography by Maya Angelou. It picks up the story of her life after \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" and begins when she is 17 years old and the mother of her son, Guy. Marguerite (her proper name) knows that she has to find a job so she can support herself and her son. This book covers several jobs in several cities and is an amazingly powerful look at her life.What I know of Maya Angelou is that she is a celebrated author who has written volumes of poetry and autobiography and that she seems to be a friend and favorite guest of Oprah Winfrey. The woman she is now, from all that I can tell, is a beautiful soul. What I didn't know was the experiences of her life and how she came to be the woman she is. These series of autobiographies tell of Angelou's life and the reality far surpasses anything I could have imagined.In this volume alone Maya worked as a dancer, a cook (multiple times), a Madam, a waitress, and briefly as a prostitute. The power comes in the how, the why, and in the telling of the story of these jobs and in Maya's raising of her son and interactions with her family, co-workers, false friends, and with men.Each volume of Maya Angelou's autobiography is fairly slim (this one was 181 pages), but the life she has lived is so fascinating that I would highly recommend reading it (any of them). It will not take up much of your time, but it shows the life of a young woman growing up and living a life uncommon."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"I read the first and second book in Maya Angelou biographies. &quot;Gather Together In My Name&quot; is the sequel to &quot;I know Why the Cage Bird Sings.&quot; In &quot;Gather Together In My Name,&quot; Maya Angelou is still in her teens and has given birth to her son, Guy. The time that this book takes place is at the end of World War 2. This time is a time of new beginnings, especially for black people. Maya Angelou tries to find a place in the world that will except her and her son. This is most difficult for her, because she can't find a decent job and her family won't help support her son. She becomes a short-order cook and falls in love, a brief affair that makes her want a relationship, that will bring affection and security for herself and her baby. The job doesn't last long, neither do her relationships. She moves from job to job and man to man. She feels as if nothing is working for her. And that she's not accepted in society. She tries to go to the army, but doesn't get in. She becomes a night club dancer and loves that, but her new partner drops her for another women. She then works at a house for prostitution. She makes no money prostituting but as the business manager it works out for her but only a little while. Her many challenges in life has helped succeed in life, and in her careers. Her harsh experiences helped her become a great writer, and poet. I liked this book a lot. No matter what she never gave up and that is what made her strong. She is a &quot;Phenomenal Women.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"This is the second in Maya Angelou's series of books about her life. It is as beautifully written as the first volume, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; and covers her life from the ages of sixteen to nineteen. For many of us, these years would not make for fascinating reading, but for Ms. Angelou these were years of searching and experimenting in a time when opportunities were plentiful, but usually contained hidden costs. Much of the book is about how Ms. Angelou belatedly discovered the hidden agendas of those she came to love. Indeed, hardly anything turned out the way she planned. Ms. Angelou is completely honest about her life, her naivety, her ambitions, and especially her feelings. She successfully evokes all the feelings and dreams of a young woman who is trying to make it as an adult. This is a powerful book in which the author invites you into her innermost world, and lets you share her excitement, disappointment, fear, elation, hardship, mistakes, and desires. Ms. Angelou experienced much more during these years than most of us would dream of: She worked as a cook, waitress, dancer, prostitute, clothing seller, restaurant manager and Madam. In between jobs she retreated to life with family. All of her experiences are described in vivid detail yet so straightforwardly that the book is actually quite short (181 pages). I highly recommend this book, as well as the first volume of Ms. Angelou's autobiography"},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"Too often when I have read someone's memoirs or an autobiography I have had the suspicion that the author is painting a very self-serving portrait of the events in their lives. Reading Maya's memoirs is the exception. She didn't have to tell the world that she worked for awhile as a 'pimp', as a prostitute, or as an exotic dancer. Many people wouldn't have for fear of personal embarrasment. Maya is beyond that. She owns her life and shows us her successes, her mistakes, and never tries to make excuses or blame others. Maya knows that everyone has their dark moments and when we take ourselves too seriously and only show the world our successes we rob everyone of valuable lessons. I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read. Congratulations Maya on a job well done."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"There's no question why children all over the world are advised to read this book. This is the second of Maya Angelou's books that I have read, and I really enjoyed it. It's truthful and honest, but frankly, some parts of the book disgusted me. But, although I don't agree with some of the author's choices, this book is a good read. However, because of some of the content, I would only recommended it to a mature reader. If you want to read a book which doens't hide the fact that everyone makes mistakes, give this one a try."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"There were times as I was reading this book that I cringed and thought to myself \\"How could she be so stupid.\\" But I had to remind myself of her tender age in this story. She did a lot of things at a young age that many of us may never do in our entire lifetime. Prostitution, Pimping and drugs. This book had so much purpose and that's why I call it \\"One of the best book that I read all year\\". It's written like a novel so it doesn't come off preachy or like a self help book. Maya Angelou tells a portion of her story. She uncovers layers of clothing and bares the naked truth of her young adulthood. To me this is not just a story of a black woman and a black womans struggles; this is a story about hard knocks and people of all races and nationalities experience them. \\"Rita\\" felt like she had to make her own way, she felt like she needed all of the answers at once. No one was going to take care of her and son. And at the same time, while she felt the burdens of independence, she also felt the emptieness and lonlieness that we all feel some time or another just because we are human. \\"Rita\\" made a lot of poor decisions, but that's not the reason that we know her today. We don't know her because she was once a madam on the West Coast, or a prostitute in Stockton, or a cook in Oakland. We know her because she found God's plan for her life and stuck with it."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"This beautifully descriptive story takes place some time before the 1940's. It talks about the stuggles that blacks were facing, before the time that civil rights groups were starting to develop. As an Afican American, the story she depicts makes me proud of my race and the world as the HUMAN race. Maya Angelou is an exceptional author and to write about her own life experiences enriches the story and enlightens the reader of our past. I stongly urge anyone, no matter what race you are, to read this book."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"GATHER TOGETHER IN MY NAME is a difficult book to read. Oh, not because of Angelou's syntax, vocabulary or sentence structure. On the contrary, she writes in a clear, direct style that, if anything, may be a little too unembellished for some readers' pleasure. Now and then, to convey an effect more distinctly to the reader, her words suggest the patois of the speaker whom she is quoting. But no, the difficulty does not lie in the words, but rather in the message. It is painful to experience, even vicariously, the feelings of entrapment, abandonment, and repeated failure that Angelou presents to us. It is frustrating to see her heading from one failed endeavor to another, from one jilting to another, from one desperate attempt \\"to find her niche\\" to another.How could anyone be so naive? How could anyone be so gullible? How could anyone be such a victim? The reader must remind himself, however, that, at the time of her life depicted in this book, Angelou is not the accomplished writer and poet of her later years. She is a confused, culturally lost teenager with a child and has experienced little besides rejection for her entire young life. She is very much an innocent girl with a growing resentment of the world around her but with a trusting optimism and an over-developed faith in her own worth, all of which combine to make her quite vulnerable to those who would prey upon her.She is the product of a failed marriage and was sent by her father to be raised by his mother in Stamps, Arkansas in the 1940's, a location and era in which being Black was not a positive attribute. Though GATHER TOGETHER deals with her later teenage years, we do get a few glimpses of the segregated society into which she had been born. After having sampled the bitter workaday world of menial jobs in California, she returns to her Southern childhood home without the necessary subservience required of a Black and insults the supercilious clerks in a store in the white part of town, after which she must be hurriedly sent back to California to avoid the inevitable vengeance of the \\"white boys.\\" The effect of growing up in this kind of hostile, demeaning environment must be kept in mind if the reader is to have any hope at understanding the formative influences that produced the attitudes that we witness in the Angelou of this book.One quite understandable result of her upbringing is that the young Angelou (though not yet known by that name) has no social relationship whatsoever with Caucasian society. To say that she distrusts that society is not quite accurate, for the word \\"distrust\\" suggests that she has examined the society and found it deceitful. However, at this point in her life, she has not even examined it. Black and White society and culture are so different, so mutually exclusive, that they exist on different worlds or in different dimensions, and \\"never the twain shall meet.\\" Because, perhaps, of her total alienation from Caucasian society and culture, the young Angelou seems to trust Blacks uncritically, even though other Blacks are the consistent source of her painful lessons in life--used by one while his girlfriend is elsewhere, maneuvered into prostitution by another, her baby stolen by a third--Angelou still clings to Black society. But, then, what other option had she?I worry somewhat that younger readers who cannot relate to the legally segregated United States that endured into the 1960s will not find this personal history very believable. I worry also that those who have not lived in the South (even in the 21st century!) or near a ghetto will find the cultural stigma and limitations of being Black extreme and unrealistic. There are those readers who, not understanding the very real social, cultural, economic, and even legal shackles that bound Blacks long after the physical shackles of slavery were shed, will feel that Angelou is, at the very least, exaggerating the conditions which she had to endure and will place more blame upon her for bringing about her own tribulations than is warranted. However, those readers are the very ones who should take the book to heart, for it may help them comprehend just a little bit more of America's dark underbelly than white, middle-class America normally sees. They will find the message difficult and bitter to assimilate, yet it is a part of our country's history and needs to be learned."},{"Title":"Gather Together in My Name","review":"This book was a real eye opener for me as a white woman.

That unfortunate fact helps explain the relative obscurity of most of the women who ran with, influenced and, in some cases, loved them. (You probably know that William S. Burroughs accidentally murdered his common-law wife while playing William Tell, but do you know her name?) This wonderful volume goes a long way towards correcting that oversight. Featuring previously unpublished letters, rare pictures and - best of all - a generous sampling of creative works, it's a near-perfect survey of the Beats' female contemporaries, lovers and even a few of their precursors.Although most of the women profiled here published at least one work in their own right at some point, many of those are not currently in print anywhere else. Additionally, some of the poems and stories here are previously unpublished, and in the case of many of the wives and lovers (referred to as \\"The Muses\\"), the works presented here are by far the most intimate look at their lives published thus far. In short, there's something here for everyone: a good starting point for newcomers to the Beats as well as a good supplementary piece for even the most serious students of women's literature."},{"Title":"Women of the Beat Generation: The Writers, Artists and Muses at the Heart of a Revolution","review":"This a good addition to the true beat fan's bookshelf. The histories of the women who took part in the beat movement and the excellent photos are worth the price alone. But you may find yourself surprised by the quality of some of the work. I ended up reading &quot;Door Wide Open&quot; by Joyce Johnson after finishing this book and enjoyed it immensely. The section on Denise Levertov is great as well.The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the section on Elise Cowan. Cowan represents what Beat really is. She never produced a large, lasting amount of work, but she was a street soldier on the scene, down in the dirt, living the beat dream. Cowan was a lover to Allen Ginsberg, a friend to Joyce Johnson, a fling to Jack Kerouac, and a beautifully tragic figure of the time.

Molly Doogan's mother was a doctor. Due to the many cases of the flu, Molly and her dad had to wait in the car until the last patient had left the clinic so they could all go home. To kill the boredom, Molly and her father decide to make up a story.Rairarubia (Rare - A - Ruby - Uh) was ruled by an evil man called Mammoth. Young Romey had no knowledge of her past, but was taken in as a pupil by Bovert and Herman. Sam, a boy her age, was in the same situation. The two teachers train Romey and Sam in all types of fighting, weaponry, and how to live with nature. They become a team, but had no idea what was in store for them.Each night Molly and her father continue to make up the story. However, the story was somehow leaking out of Molly's imagination and into her REAL daily life!**** Here is the beginning of what promises to be a compelling series!

As Molly and her father develop the story, unexplainable things begin happening. The story they created begins to slip into Molly's real life. The adventures they create for their characters are strong models for all kids (and adults too). This is a timeless story and one which I'm looking forward to continuing in the next book."},{"Title":"Rairarubia, Second Edition (The Rairarubia Tales)","review":"I really wanted to like this one, but as Roger Ebert would say, I'm giving it a marginal thumbs down. I feel a little like Scrooge doing this since this book does have some things that particularly 5th graders will like: A fairy tale with a kind of modern gimmick that almost worked for me, but as I said, not quite enough and I'll say why in a moment.The story begins in our time: Molly Doogan, an imaginative 11 year old girl and her father begin making up a story together about a medieval land called Rairarubia and for its main character, they invent a character that Molly names Romey, a girl the same age as herself. There is also a boy named Sam who enters the story later. Neither Romey nor Sam apparently know who they are (it's not revealed why that is) but they both have a kind of mythic adventure in Rairarubia where they are tested and trained in survival and marshall arts by some mysterious teachers. So far so good.But there is this intriguing gimmick which is that throughout the book, elements of the Rairarubia story begin to mysteriously bleed into the \\"real life\\" of Molly and her family. She finds dirt in her hands after waking up from a dream in which this dirt was depicted. Later she finds an arrowhead in her hand when she awakes which also seems to come from Rairarubia. Finally, at the end of the book she finds nine pebbles, also from the Rairarubia story.Well, it's a great conceit if it works, but the problem is, there's no payoff. The book ends and now we're supposed to buy the next one to find out what's going on. And this is not the only thing that's not resolved by the end. We still don't know who Sam and Romey are, where they're from, and what the purpose of their quest is, as well as several other loose ends I don't have space to mention. As Bob Dylan says: \\"Nothing was delivered.\\"So the upshot is that Rairarubia turns itself into an elaborate shaggy dog story with a big come on at the end to hang in for the next book. No thanks, I feel too manipulated by the first one to bother with the next.

I have a fair amount of experience in woodworking. I found this book to be very clear and readable.

You'd probably expect THE Luthiers Handbook to be a how-to, but it's nothing like that. Actually it reads more like a college-level textbook. Engineering/techies will probably love it, as will anyone seriously interested in the how & why of fine instrument architecture. There's a lot in here about the tonal properties of various woods, bracings, etc. Even if you never figure out the author's 'tuning' method (or don't have your own home physics lab) you still might find yourself tapping on soundboards and thinking about such things.

As a motivational speaker he has reached thousands with the leadership principles of Sir Winston S. Churchill in a lively and practical way. In one conference that I attended some years ago, Mr. Kryske shared the same platform with a world-renowned historian on the life of Churchill. The \\"renowned historian\\" gave a written, and read, presentation on some aspect of Churchill, which droned on for over an hour. The audience was visibly bored and fidgity. Then afterwards, Larry got up and gave a 45-minute presentation on the \\"Churchill Factors\\" employing humor while at the same time, fleshing out his presentation with an oil painting demonstration! To say the least, the audience was mesmerized and completely engaged with his presentation. Larry is also a talented artist!\\"The Churchill Factors\\" is an anthology of a lifetime of personal study and public presentations at conferences and other venues. Mr. Kryske is a recognized leading authority on the life of Churchill, but far beyond that, Larry has a rare gift of sifting through massive material in order to provide the listener -- here the reader -- with a life-changing study of practical wisdom. I keep a copy of his book handy both at work, and at home at the kitchen table, and make time to read a page here, and a page there, then contemplate the basic message to apply to my life.\\"The Churchill Factors\\" has practical information for everyone, young and old, no matter what job you do in life, no matter what position you hold. The message is clear: you are on this planet for a purpose, and your finest hour is yet to come!"},{"Title":"The Churchill Factors: Creating Your Finest Hour","review":"Churchill was, without question, a fine man and example for us to follow. Learning more about Churchill, what made him great, and how he influenced history is a worthy endeavor.Being motivated and inspired to pursue higher objectives in life, to really make a difference in the world is also a worthy endeavor. Emulating features of Churchill's life to craft your own success is also worthwhile.As I began this book, I found myself reading sections to my wife. Good stuff here! The author's own words as well as the quotes from Churchill and other luminaries were getting my attention. I began to understand why several of my friends are such devoted students of Churchill and his influence. The first 37 pages were great.Then Chapter 5 hit me like a bucket of ice water. I discovered to my astonishment that the author is also a distributor of behavioral style learning materials produced by Inscape Publishing. Most of the balance of the book is a description of the four principal behavioral styles and how various aspects of Churchill's attributes relate to the styles. I was tempted to toss the book away as a blatant commercial for Inscape products. There was nothing on the cover of the book, in the introduction, or in the title that suggested that this was the kind of book I discovered . . . unless you look closely at the category on the back cover and note that the words &quot;SELF HELP&quot; follow &quot;BUSINESS.&quot;The four behavioral styles of drivers, influencers, supporters, and conceptualizers were each presented with some explanation. Churchill's traits were related to each, apparently to validate for persons with each style that they, too, can be like Churchill. I felt some were rather force-fit. As a disclosure, I have used Inscape instruments and behavioral style knowledge for two decades and am a former national contract trainer for the company; I am quite familiar with the products and their philosophies.At the end of the book is a blatant promotion for a wide range of Inscape products. For those readers who are interested in learning more about behavioral styles, it's helpful to have this catalog available. For those who were really interested in what made Churchill great-from an author touted as a Churchill expert, it's offensive.I almost rated this book with three stars instead of four (out of five), but there is some good content. Kryske does relate some strong material, particularly in the forepart of the book before he got into the behavioral styles. The book is heavily seasoned with quotes (as call-outs); there's a quote from someone on almost every page. Many of the quotes are from Churchill, but also cited are other historical figures and present-day motivational speakers."},{"Title":"SANTA'S CHRISTMAS JOURNEY (LEGENDS AND FOLKTALES SER.)","review":"This book brings back incredible memories for me.

The main thing is that they learned how to study, how to prep for tests, how to take notes, how to research, how to plan their time - all things that schools want you to do well and none of them teach. There are lots of clever tips and tricks to help retain information or to figure out which information to focus on. The things learned using this system paid off even bigger when my daughter went off to college. She was so on top of her assignments and research that she never once had to cram or pull an all-nighter. She routinely had papers written well in advance of their due dates and was able to participate in a number of clubs and activities and still make the dean's list because she had everything under control. This is not to say she never felt stressed out, but she credits what she learned from this system in helping her keep her sanity during semesters with a heavy load.

No inter-language dictionary can contain all the words in either language, but the words it has should ideally form a closed set.

This one falls a bit short of that ideal, mostly with less common words.Transliteration is necessarily phonetic, and pronunciation of Yiddish is not uniform around the world. There is a standard transliteration (corresponding to a synthesized standard dialect), which Harduf seems to use, but which I don't find a key to. (There is a fine key for the Yiddish alphabet.) So far at least, I've easily found whatever I looked for.The English-to-Yiddish section is set in proportional fonts, while the Yiddish-to-English section uses smaller fixed-width fonts. The difference, while jarring at first, makes it immediately clear which section the book is open to.I seem to be harping on shortcomings, but they are minor.

I am not an expert on the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, so I can't really comment on the accuracy of the book, but any reader should know ahead of time that the book is a veritable bloodbath.

How have I missed this author until now? I simply couldn't put this book down. This is an unflinching and uncompromising look at the Mexican revolution and at the men who fought in it, told from the viewpoint of one of Pancho Villa's 'Generals'. It is an absolutely driving narrative that never lets up from beginning to end. It is told in a surprisingly modern tone and language, yet still seems authentic in every nuance. Early on, the first person narrator remarks that the difference between a revolutionary and a murdering bandit is the difference between war and peace...and therefore how necessary it is to have the war. There are no real heroes here, treachery is a daily occurence, prisoners are murdered as a matter of course, villages and their civilian populations are destroyed without mercy. &quot;As we pulled out of Zacatecas, the air was thick with the odors of smoltering ash, bloody dust, putrefying flesh. The rich ripe smells of triumph.&quot; This book is not for the squeamish; there is murder, cruelty and mayhem on virtually every page. But there is incredible bravery here, too. And victory in the face of overwhelming odds and hardship. After literally shooting an old-friend-turned-traitor to pieces, the General says, &quot;Like Villa, I believed that even though some men did not deserve to go on living, they still deserved to be remembered at their best.&quot; That seems an apt epitaph for all of The Friends of Pancho Villa."},{"Title":"The Friends of Pancho Villa","review":"I've never read a James Carlos Blake novel before.

The author has recreated the time of the Mexican revolution wonderfully, and the main character, and narrator, is someone you'd like to sit and have a conversation with...though not in a dark alley.Rudy Fierro is there, throughout the whole of the Mexican revolution, and Pancho Villa's fight with the various people in power in Mexico City. The various people involved are tremendously depicted, and there's a parade of minor characters, some historical, some not. Both Ambrose Bierce and George Patton, not to mention John Pershing, make appearances. The author does a marvelous job of portraying men for whom it is nothing to shoot several hundred people, and then go have dinner.Frankly, I was surprised by how good this book was.

Villa's fortunes rise and fall rapidly and Fierro has the ultimate insider access. Thirteen years later political opponents ambush and gun down Villa, by then retired, on the streets of Parral.The book is filled with historical characters including Fierro, who carries the well-earned sobriquet \\"The Butcher\\", Felipe Angeles, Villa's best poltical general, as well as Porfirio D&iacute;az, Francisco Madero, William Benton, Victoriano Huerta, Emiliano Zapata, Venustiano Carranza (whitebeard) and Alvaro Obreg&oacute;n (One-Arm). Fierro relates in the book that contrary to rumor he did not really drown when he got stuck in quick sand with gold loaded in his pockets - I have found reports that he did drown, but in 1913 and in 1917!In Blake's telling, Villa and his friends had a grand time fighting, drinking, dancing, screwing, and loving (except for Pancho who rarely drank - he seemed to get married instead). At times the book is laugh-out-loud funny, which is a bit disconcerting because the bodies are piling up quickly. The confrontation between the Scotsman William Benton and Villa is hilarious in a profane and violent way. Pancho and Rodlfo inhabit a brutally violent world that frequently turns murderous almost without warning.One paragraph captures the sense of history, the humor, and Villa's somewhat vague political identity when Pancho describes the impact of his brief invasion of New Mexico. \\"From now on their books will have to say, 'Nobody ever invaded the United States except for Francisco Villa, the magnificent Mexican patriot who tried so hard to be our friend but who we treated so shamefully because we are such stupid sons of bitches and have no honor.' \\"Highly recommended for all readers of historical fiction or with an interest in Mexico or US-Mexico relations."},{"Title":"The Friends of Pancho Villa","review":"&quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; is just plain fantastic.

The heroes of the piece, Villa &amp; Fierro, are classic examples of men who have fame thrust upon them by their willingness &amp; enjoyment in giving in to their basest desires. They, &amp; almost everyone of their &quot;compadres&quot;, &amp; indeed their enemies for that matter, are united by a sort of blind, compulsive blood-lust. Fierro even goes so far as to explain to the reader his feelings of regret &amp; disappointment, with the thought that, following Villa's victory in the taking of Mexico City, their continued life of brutality could be put in jeopardy by a possible premature end to the revolution. Fortunately for Fierro, the violence continues &amp; with it his own outrageous excesses. As jolting &amp; sickening as some of the scenes are, the author tells the tale with great dash &amp; a pacy, immediate style that someho! w goes hand in hand with the tumultous &amp; disorganized progress of the revolution. It's a rousing, rollicking read. The characters, are drawn with feeling &amp;, like them, or loathe them, you certainly want to know what will become of them.

I have done some studying of this era in Mexican history and this work affords the reader an excellent grasp of what went on at the time.

He was no detached scientific observer in a white lab coat like Masters and Johnson. He threw himself into his work with enthusiasm. He lived the life he studied and the results of his work are in this book. But this is not just one man's report from the sexual frontier. As a disciplined reporter, he conducted countless interviews, but as a participant he was able to obtain trusting relationships. This is not Sociology; he reports on the people making money from the Sexual Revolution and their customers. It is primarily a book about men using women's sexuality to make money from other men.This is not an exhaustive history but rather a look at selective people and their impact on the times. John and Barbara Williamson's Sandstone Retreat, a sexually open community in the hills near Los Angeles, is one group that Talese focuses on. Through interviews with many of the participants he explores the effects polyamory (openly maintaining multiple sexual relationships) has on the couples who belong to this group.A large portion of the book examines the publishing pioneers who, after World War II, risked fines and jail to sell erotic books and magazines in the US. The Post Office laws against sending sexual materials through the mail was the core legal restraint in the US and Anthony Comstock was the chief enforcer of this law. Some of Comstock's more famous exploits are recounted. Talese also reports on the Supreme Court, its decisions, the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, and the Nixon White House's response to the loosening sexual climate. Hugh Hefner, one of the most famous people in sexual publishing, is also studied in some detail.Feminism was another revolution developing in the 1970s, but Talese only gives it passing mention. The only feminist mentioned is Betty Dodson, whose drawings of female genitalia and visits to Sandstone are discussed.Talese also looks into the history of sexual expression and repression in the US. John Humphrey Noyes and the Oneida Community is looked at as a precursor to the open sexuality of the 70s. The community was built on Noyes' concepts of Perfectionism which included communal sharing that extended to sexual relationships.These are just the major themes. A 20 page alphabetic Index ends the book with entries from Abortion to Emile Zola. I found the history of sexually explicit publishing most interesting. The depth of the personal interviews related to the Sandstone community was excellent. So much has changed in the past 25 years in terms of sexual expression and the sex industry. This book is a wonderful study of this period and the people involved."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Gay Talese does a brilliant job of narrating the evolution of sexuality during the 20th century. By thoroughly including all the movers and shakers in the development of censorship legislation, sex shops, massage parlors, communes and sexual revolutionists in enthralling detail, Talese manages to create a riveting tale of human sexuality. By infiltrating the sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's, Talese offers first-hand accounts. He artfully balances his keen observations as a slightly removed journalist with indulgent, self-purposeful experimentation, then masterfully conveys his findings to his audience. Like &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;, Talese invests a great deal of time and risk in researching his material and the result is a page-turner. While he tends to mention numerous names of people who shaped 20th century sexuality, the result is not overwhelming but instead may inspire you to keep a list of names as you read through the book with the intention of researching these people yourself. Indeed, this masterpiece flows with gripping narrative style, introducing characters that seemingly have no relationship to one another, until you read further and find that their influence is intricately commingled. This book will fascinate you with its exploration and understanding of American sexual identity. A must read!"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Talese's history of the sexual revolution in America reads like a Jackie Collins novel or plays like a Robert Altman movie where all of a sudden, the characters stories have crossed paths and their lives after were irrevocably changed. You will read the page turning account of how Hugh Hefner came to create Playboy Magazine--a story which indeed has been often told, but not like this--interspersed with various obscenity cases of Screw Magazine publisher/editor Goldstein, the coming of the age of Larry Flynt and Bob Guccione, and the story of our gal Betty...Talese outdid E! entertainment by two decades. It is a great rendering from one of our most talented writers."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"This is the great smutty book of the baby-boom Seventies, one of the cornerstones of the mythology of the Me Decade and a major work in the canon of the New Journalism -- the exemplar of several things at once and tremendously popular and influential for many years. Coming to it thirty years later, though, the reader is struck by how diffuse it is, lacking a real through-line or conclusion. Perhaps there could never have been a conclusion to a book that was so thoroughly \\"the way we live now\\" -- we all did not stop living in 1980, and the way we lived kept changing, as it always does -- but Talese doesn't even make an attempt to sum the book up, just drags himself into the last chapter to explain what he wanted to do, or thought he was going to do, before bowing out quietly.Thy Neighbor's Wife only explains itself in that last chapter, with Talese taking the reader on a whirlwind tour of all of the books that Thy Neighbor's Wife didn't become -- a consumer guide to massage parlors, Talese's own sexual autobiography, an in-depth look at the Sandstone Retreat, an examination of the intersection of nudism and sex -- before ending suddenly. Before that, it ran through twenty-five chapters, each one on a discrete topic, only slightly connected to the chapters before and after -- though he did circle back to a few topics: Sandstone, Hugh Hefner, and the place of Chicago in America's libido. Talese begins with a photo of Diane Webber (the model immortalized on the cover of the 2009 paperback edition) to tell the story of the late adolescence of a Chicago teen, Harold Rubin, who then disappears for several hundred pages. The narrative jumps from Rubin to Webber, on to Hefner, off to the couples who will later form Sandstone, and then wanders away into describing obscenity cases for a while (with the requisite thumbnail sketches of the then-current Supreme Court justices) before bouncing back to many of those earlier subjects for a while and bounding onward.It's a scatter-shot approach, dizzying at times, and Talese's workmanlike prose moves it forward ploddingly, less leaping from topic to topic than building isolated foundations for various buildings in the same development. Talese hints at larger structures and plans, but refuses to speculate about them -- he'll only concern himself with the particular. One particular love affair of Hefner's is given in great detail, while a myriad others are left unmentioned or swiftly skimmed over -- probably because the one woman in question agreed to be interviewed by Talese, and the others didn't.Talese wants to tell a grand sweeping story -- of how all of America changed its view of sex and love over the course of the decades of the '60s and '70s -- but to tell it entirely in particulars, and to tell it while keeping himself out of the story almost entirely (until that last chapter, unveiling his part in the proceedings like the Wizard of Oz). Unfortunately, the story is too big to be told that way -- Talese, from what he tells us here, never even visited most of the country, and didn't do any general or sociological research. He wants to present his subjects as exemplars of changing Americans -- but without saying what they are exemplars of, or how the exemplify anything.And so Thy Neighbor's Wife comes across -- especially now, thirty years later -- as a collection of primary documents from the period, not a coherent single narrative. We see Hefner as he puts together the first year or so of Playboy, and then again at the height of its success in the early '70s -- but not how he got from one to the other, or what that meant (to him, or to America). We also see very little about what Playboy meant to the young men who read it -- and nothing about its place in the lives of the young women who appeared in it. In fact, if there's one single glaring flaw in Thy Neighbor's Wife, it's women -- they exist here almost entirely as objects, as beings seen from the outside. Talese is a man, and he gets into the heads of the men in this story -- from Hefner and Rubin to Al Goldstein of Screw and John Bullaro of Sandstone -- but not the women. The women here, as in the traditional American male view, control the access to sex, and are capricious and ultimately not understandable -- men can just try to figure out the rules so as to get as much sex as possible. And the problem then with this era was that the rules were changing radically and without warning -- that was good for men, since it generally meant that more sex was available, but it was also bad, since getting that sex required entirely different methods and plans.I kept wanting Thy Neighbor's Wife to either stay on one subject long enough to cover it in depth, or to zoom out to a big picture once in a while to provide some context. (Sandstone was an outlier even in the sexual revolution -- but how many couples were swapping partners, in one way or another, in those mid-'70s years? How did the loosening of sexual morality affect people in the middle of their lives? How were the teens of the '70s different from those of the '50s, in ways that can be traced back to Playboy and Lady Chatterly and Henry Miller?) But Thy Neighbor's Wife is a book of reportage, not of analysis -- Talese never makes this clear, but his aim was to show what he saw, and not presume to make judgements about anything larger. And so Thy Neighbor's Wife is a book focused primarily on Chicago and Los Angeles, and even there on the Playboy Mansion and Sandstone, because that's where Talese spent the most time on the ground, talking to people. (And, as he coyly hints at in that last chapter, screwing around with at least a couple of those newly liberated young women before going back to his marriage.)Thy Neighbor's Wife is still an important book, but all of the things that it did have been done since -- and mostly done better -- by many other books, each of them focusing on one aspect of that era and examining it in more depth. It's a decent starting point to the world of the sexual revolution, but it only leads on to other books that make more of an effort to answer the questions that Talese only raises."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Depending on your outlook, author Gay Talese's rambling social history of sex in America is either X-rated titillation or scholarly and objective reporting of a serious subject that affects virtually everyone. The author takes the reader through a maze of people and events from the triumphs and tribulations of Hugh Hefner to pornography and the courts, from free-love religious sects of the 19th century to 20th century California communes. The reader also visits massage parlors and organized mate swapping clubs. The premise is that everybody behaves sexually, regardless. Pretending otherwise is a myth perpetuated by the oppressive cycle of American Puritanism handed down by a variety of parental, religious, and legal authorities. We should just accept our sexuality and be honest with each other, and especially with ourselves. Although the author refrains from preaching a &quot;if it feels good, do it&quot; sermon, complete sexual freedom is the rather trite theme. This viewpoint is somewhat dated and reflects the so-called sexual revolution of the '60s and early '70s. The book was published in 1980 before the AIDs threat was a common concern. Some hot button issues as abortion and homosexuality are ignored. Nevertheless, it is an interesting book on a controversial subject. ;-)"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"A classic to be sure, Talese's 1980 book explores the sexual revolution that began in the 1960s. He shows it didn't really begin in the 1960s: 19th century sexual communes and 20th century censorship battles served as its prelude.This is a snapshot of the times. Older people will recognize his depiction of teenagers pursuing illicit pornography in the 1930s and 1940s; of Playboy's emergence in the 1950s; of suburban marital restlessness in the 1960s spurring experimentation with open marriage and swing clubs; massage parlor proliferation in the 1970s; and so on.The generation that wanted to \\"get rid of all that guilt\\" gets this book. The generations that grew up in the resulting guiltless world, may not.The decades since could use his treatment. I'd be real curious whether he'd come to the same conclusions. In a recent afterword he dismisses notions of a return to sexual conservatism. He's probably right; I don't see this society fitting back into Pandora's Box anytime soon. But he might ask some deeper questions.Is this revolution socially beneficial, or not?He says in the afterword men have become more tolerant of their wives' past sexual history and current infidelities. Few men today insist their brides be virgins, but few men or women are comfortable with a spouse's infidelity, sexual revolution or not. It's human nature not to be.So do people need more temptation and opportunity to stray?He quotes Camille Paglia accusing the free-love generation of causing the AIDS epidemic, which is fundamentally true. (Much of the book takes place in the 1970s, after the Pill and Roe v. Wade but before HIV, when sexual consequences were by most eras' standards few and mild.) So how does having a plethora of sex partners fit with that? \\"Safe sex\\" is only as safe as a condom you've got, remember to use, are willing to use and that doesn't break.He writes about women liberated to take the initiative. But for many women, sexual freedom means little more than giving the men a taste and a trial period before the pressure for commitment. Men given sex without commitment lose a big incentive towards it. Many women thus find themselves stuck in unmarried relationships, in a society no longer having the voice to condemn the unmarried for cohabiting or even reproducing.And it can work both ways. Friends with privileges? Dude, it means she thinks you aren't marriage material. (And many men find their lessened earnings dim their appeal as spouses to independent women ultimately more interested in their pocketbooks than their penises or personalities. This is not new news. All traditional people in decades past knew it. But more women have the means today to be as shallow and selfish as men ever were.)I digress. Talese's book may be incomprehensible to younger readers, addressing as it does the sexual revolution as a response to repression they haven't experienced. Younger readers can't conceive of pornography not being a few mouse clicks away, of facing widespread ostracism for open sexuality or of college dorms with curfews and parietal rules. They can't conceive of a world where a girl having \\"a reputation\\" faced consequences, or where a guy getting too frisky with a young lady might face her brother's fists or her daddy's shotgun.A Gen X (or Gen Y) Talese might deal with different questions:--What are the effects on children of stereotypically-Californian parents (like the Sandstone folks here) focused narcissistically on their own fulfillment and \\"personal growth\\"? Their serial divorces inflict much psychic damage on children.--What is the effect on the growing number of children born out of wedlock? In the new world, sexual freedom means a large number of adults can't settle down.--Why is marriage declining? This will include assessing the endless attacks on it by gay-marriage advocates eagerly pronouncing heterosexual marriage a failure in arguing to let gays fail at it as well.--The bizarre turned tables of a world smiling benignly on \\"wild women\\" and \\"cougars\\" like Talese's Sally Binford, while continuing to expose men who do the same, like Tiger Woods, to personal destruction.--The weird alliance of anti-male feminists, generally creatures (good word) of the secular left, with the prudish religious forces they otherwise despise. Said religious forces are the perennial foils in Talese's book and its times, frequently conflated with the FBI, the Chicago police, Nixon and the Vietnam war as constituting some vast right-wing conspiracy to keep you from getting laid.The world that the rebels in this book rebel against is long gone. Someone needs to take a long, hard look at the world they created.Because how many marriages survive swinging?"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"I recall reading a chapter of \\"Thy Neighbor's Wife\\" in a magazine (Esquire, probably) when it came out in 1980. It was interesting but not so interesting that I went on to read the book. I am pleased that I waited until now. Things have happened in the past 30 years - or at least, things have been revealed - that make Gay Talese's book more piquant than it was.In the early '70s, Talese set out to document \\"the quiet rebellion that he (writing in the third person) sensed within the middle class against the censors and the clerics that had been an inhibiting force since the founding of the Puritan republic.\\" There was, then, nothing quiet about the rebellion among wide segments of the public. The endless \\"Playboy Philosophy\\" in the biggest selling skin mag was made as loud as Hugh Hefner could make it, to take one example. But Talese had a point.The work-a-daddy middle class was chary of announcing where the gossips could hear that it endorsed the so-called Sexual Revolution. Today, of course, you can hardly get it to shut up.That behavior, as opposed to keeping up a front, changed very much is to be doubted. Even before \\"Thy Neighbor's Wife\\" came out, the historian Page Smith had published his father's letters (\\"A Letter from My Father,\\" 1976) detailing the life of a randy Republican in the era of unbridled comstockery. Talese tells, in amusing and massive detail, how pretense was riddled, shot to pieces and fell.Brave, independent but, as Talese acknowledges, socially not very attractive men did it, and some like William Hamling went to prison for long years before the prudes were squelched. What is so wonderful, now, about \\"Thy Neighbor's Wife\\" is that the principal villains, the Catholic church and Charles Keating, have subsequently been exposed for the vicious frauds they always were.If Talese had any inkling that the church was running a world-wide child-rape ring, he suppressed it. Keating's corruption took a different form and was revealed later, although it is sobering to realize that as recently as last year one of his stooges nearly got elected president of the United States. Few writers have been so lucky in their choice of villains. There were plenty of others he might have picked, and not all have been exposed.It requires some patience to deal with this tome. In form, he follows the careers of several people who were agents in what was either the sexual awakening or the sexual unwrapping of the American middle class, but with long excursions into the past. These include the career of Anthony Comstock, the utopian communes of the 19th century and other background noise. The individual stories are interrupted for long periods, but over and over, two or three strands are later knitted together in unexpected ways.Even Talese stops to remark about how many of his principals started out in Chicago. Most famously, Hefner. The only real surprise in the book was learning that it was Mrs. Hefner, not Hefner, who was the first to get a little on the side in that couple. A medievalist, conscious of feminine concupiscence (as Talese and I were taught to think of it in church), would have said, \\"But of course.\\"There are many things not in the book. Homosexuals are hardly mentioned, since this is about mostly straight people; nor are Kinsey or Masters and Johnson. It is a question whether it was Hefner or Kinsey, with the mediation of newspapers, which were given cover to talk about sex by Kinsey's supposedly scientific approach, that really did most to move Mr. and Mrs. Average American's attitude toward (some limited) frankness about sexuality.Talese spends much time on the legal fights, but I have my doubts whether these unread decisions were what changed public opinion. The judges and juries did, for sure, make it easier and easier for sellers of talk and pictures about sexuality to service the theretofore unfulfilled market for middle class porn.We have come a long, long way in openness. Today, the daily newspaper talks unconcernedly on page one about behaviors that were almost ignored by Kinsey or even the much later and purportedly totally frank \\"Hite Report.\\""},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"This book must have been a phenomenon back in the 80s. Gay Talese: conservative gentleman, respected journalists, family man, and...sex researcher. In the last twenty pages, or so, of this book, Talese opens up and recounts for the reader his personal odyssey of visiting massage parlors, sex shows, strip clubs, as well as his philandering experiences shacking up at free love communities in California -- all before the outbreak of AIDS. Talese speaks about himself in the third person, probably as a narrative technique to distance himself from the guilt he might have felt participating in such research as a married man. While the soul searching wasn't quite enough for me, the journalism really hit the mark. Talese describes the history of pornography, from the time it was banned in the U.S., up through the major Supreme Court obsenity cases of the 60's and 70's. Along the way, Talese tells the story of Playboy power-man Hugh Heffner, describing his hedonistic lifestyle in envious detail. (There is a naughty man buried inside Talese. TNW treats the voyeuristic reader to the show Talese puts on as he lets us watch this naughty man struggle to climb out.)The book also chronicles a number of \\"regular\\" folks from the 70's who happened to fall into Talese's circle of aquaintences as he was writing the book. (It did, after all, take Talese nine years to write TNW -- and, as an aside, I never did figure out why Talese chose this title; never, once, does he write about his or any neighbor's wife. He could be refering, however, to the general \\"free love\\" culture that emerged in the 60s and 70s.) These \\"regular\\" folk are supposed to represent the average 1970s American. Not once was I conviced that the people Talese followed through his narrative were actually average. But this is secondary. The journalism is first-rate.I bought this book because I am a student of the narrative non-fiction genre. Talese is a Master of the discipline. This book keep the Master's reputation secure. If you're looking to learn about writing non-fiction, and you're looking for a topic a little out of the ordinary, choose this book. Talese's most recent book from a few years ago, A WRITER'S LIFE, is said to briefly follow-up (in a few chapters) with his observations about American sexuality. I have not read this new book, but it will be interesting to see what 25 years have done to this man's perceptions."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"My, how the decades fly. During my teen years in Tulsa in the 1970's, I heard that something called \\"the sexual revolution\\" allegedly happened in the previous decade, and that it continued into the decade of my adolescence. But this revolution apparently hadn't reached Tulsa by the time I graduated from high school in 1978. I knew about Playboy and Penthouse magazines, and I furtively glanced at the drawings of naked hairy hippies in the original edition of a book called \\"The Joy of Sex.\\" But in general I still lived in a conventional, repressive bubble when it came to the open expression of sexuality. For example, I have no recollection of any of the girls in my high school getting pregnant or acquring reputations for round heels.Meanwhile, in the more civilized parts of the U.S., Talese documents how a great many Americans after the Second World War, often from rural areas or small towns like mine, decided that they wanted more out of life than mere middle class survival, so in various ways they started breaking taboos in a quest for sexual self-actualization, often by publishing photographs or literature which depicted the experiences of sex in plain language that everyone could understand. Some of these rebels even took steps to live out their dreams of sexual freedom, like the engineer turned free love cult leader John Williamson who basically sponsored orgies in his Sandstone compound in Southern California. Word of Williamson's philosophy and lifestyle, which sounds like a cross between swinging and polyamory, got around somehow in the U.S. before the internet, and many of the other sexual revolutionaries crossed paths with him eventually.I found Williamson the most interesting personality in Talese's book. How did a cracker from backwoods Alabama become a self-taught engineer with no college degree get a job with the early space program, and then reinvent himself as a real-life Michael Valentine Smith, minus Smith's woo-woo \\"Martian\\" powers, from Robert Heinlein'sStranger in a Strange Land? Williamson deserves a full length biography. I'd like to know more about which books influenced his thinking, for example. Talese says that Williamson went through a period in the early 1960's when he read stacks of science fiction paperbacks, but which ones? Apparently Williamson's discovery of Ayn Rand'sAtlas Shruggedin 1962 marked some kind of turning point in his thinking, which goes to show how Rand's influence has a way of popping up in unexpected places.But all this swinging sexual excess happened a couple generations ago now, leaving us with a dubious legacy. Williamson wanted to transform the culture so that we wouldn't feel jealous or possessive in our love lives - but I notice that people still behave that way emotionally, and for evolved reasons relating to reproductive success. I slightly knew the writer F.M. Esfandiary, who argued for a similar revolution against possessiveness & jealousy in his bookUp-wingers, so I have to wonder if he visited Williamson as well. Intellectual opinion in the 20th Century assumed environmental or behaviorist models of human nature, so given their assumptions they thought that a different social construction could transform the human condition and bring about a sexual utopia. Modern cognitive science promotes a more constrained view of the limits of human plasticity, however, and the previous sort of thinking now seems uninformed and naive.As I said, this revolution happened a couple generations ago. Many of the people Talese profiles in his book have died by now. Hugh Hefner manages to hang on to a shadow of his former lifestyle somehow, but recent Playmates complain about the dirty, shabby and dilapidated state of the Playboy Mansion. In a way the wreck which answers to the name Hugh Hefner symbolizes how the wildest expectations of the sexual revolution have turned to ashes."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"While I enjoyed \\"Unto the Sons\\", and may read Talese's other works, I only thought so-so of this endless tome on the sex industry in the USA. I like his style of writing non-fiction in an engrossing manner, like reading a novel. His section on Noyes and the Oneidan community was wonderful. Then there is Hugh Hefner, who has sexual relationships with countless women, but was hot and bothered when his wife had an affair. And Talese's nine-year commitment to the work is highly commendable. But the scope of such a work needed more/wider coverage. The selection of scenes were few, and overdone. Not much on Masters & Johnson, or Sheryl Hite (sp.?) or Alfred Kinsey. The material on judicial matters, while important was tedious. Sandstone Retreat was saturated with coverage as well. After \\"Unto the Sons\\", a wonderful work on Italo-Catholics, who, like me, have roots in southern Italy, this was a let down. Catholicism becomes a punching bag in this work. He might have set up a thesis - antithesis dialogue about the understanding behind Pope Paul VI's \\"Humanae Vitae\\", but didn't do that either. In the end he speaks of his italian Catholic background as a means to help him live in a licenteous, heathenistic manner, one that nearly rips his marriage apart. Very strange."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"This is a vital book, a work of witty and searching defiance in the face of American puritanism.

In some ways the book feels historical as it was published prior to the AIDs epidemic whose impact may have changed the openness that was increasing. Mr. Talese escorts (pun intended) his audience to famous hot spots like the Sandstone Retreat, the Playboy Mansion, and others. Much of the sexual revolution is a simple awareness led by magazines like Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler, etc.; some comes from movies. Mr. Talese looks closely at Supreme Court decisions such as the I Am Curious Yellow (a boring Swedish import) case and the Comstack Laws forbidding pornography transmitted through the mail. The reporter takes a lesser look at sexual freedom before WW II and the 1960s with the effect of the pill freeing women to have multiple partners if desired, but fails to dig deep at this major revelation. Though also brief, Mr. Talese takes a glimpse at the beginnings of coming out of the closet by homosexuals. Filled with interviews and a glossary, THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE remains a fascinating but narrow look at mostly male heterosexual preferences predominantly between the 1950s and 1970s.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"I love this book. It's romantic, sexy, and extremely detailed. I can seeeverything and feel like I'm right there. I also use it as foreplay.Thank you Gay."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"THY NEIGHBOUR\\"S WIFE isn't the most scintilatting read ever. If you want to be titilated I suggest you read novels by erotic authors, yet there are passages that are just graphic enough they pique the senses.Talese opens his book with a description of an early starlet of Playboy, then proceeds with a short biography of Hugh Hefner. In the opening chapters alone I learnt much about the struggles against vice squads and censorship groups publishers like Hefner faced as they struggled to bring entertainment to a male audience. Then Talese shifts gears a little reporting on a group of people who live a swinging/mate swapping lifestyle.Talese reports everything in a very objective sense, yet the reader can't help but feel he has some connection with his subject matter. There is a distinct sense of wonder and interest in his reporting style.I have read reviews claiming this was a dated work, which I can not debate it being published in the early eighties, BUT that doesn't take anything away with the interest this book held for me or the fascination I felt reading about Bullero and the Williamson's as they founded a commune for free love. Fact of the matter is in the 21st century every book on sexuality is going to be a little dated by the time of its publication, so if you don't focus on that but rather read THY NEIGHBOUR\\"S wife as a history and tale about a nation's sexual revolution, as a text if you will on emotional and sensual freedom and its roots I predict you may find this tome as enjoyable as I have.:)"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Talese' writing style doesn't scintillate, but the reporting is xlnt.

It's a incredible piece of journalism, with a rich research about sexuality in America and it's complex and often contraditory laws about sexual propriety. But the best parts are the description about Sandstone, a place where a group of ordinary people conducted experiments about free sexuality and open marriage"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"This book, obviously very well researched (9 years), is a bit of a strange read. It covers the spectrum of both the free love, porn industry and the business pursuits of people like Hugh Hefner. I found reference to several of the court cases which became the basis for &#34;free speech&#34; (actually the right to show the female body) very informative. It is a long book. However, if you stay with it, you will find it interesting."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Americans think that the only wheels that turn are those of their own invention. When writing in THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE of, and to, Americans, Gay Talese once says that currently \\"The contemporary husband, unlike his father and grandfather before him, is not so shocked\\" about sexual developments, he may be speaking about our reality, but for openness and maturity our reality is nowhere near that of Europe in the past, when the sexual communes of 16th Century Germany were far more progressive and numerous than any we have known, and cultures like France or Italy regularly outdistance us for sheer adulthood. (The nadir was probably reached over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.) Prior to the Nineteenth Century, Napoleon being a setback from the standpoint of sex, it was common for a man to cohabitate with several women of a given family - Casanova lived this way many times. Many married Italian women, especially wives of aged or polyamorous husbands, lived and traveled openly with a male sexual companion. Such men even had staff titles. We need to boost the morale in the sexual revolution, and our first task should, I think, be to get the populace to understand the awful truth about how Puritan manipulations savage our freedom. Gay Talese's book THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE is an important text in this effort.The book is not so much a comprehensive rendering of the mid-Twentieth Century sexual revolution, which started with such heterosexual promise and has devolved into little more than Gay Rights issues (that would be a different Gay). It is a narrative, with much back story, in which the author himself eventually figures. This is good, since it would be too much to claim that the sexual revolution has been all that successful. Among the promises of the sexual revolution, just about the only thing we can be sure of nowadays is that in America unwedded cohabitation is no longer outr&eacute;, but this sort of arrangement is more like the ancient Roman form of temporary marriage, than a really free relationship; the understanding that most people have of shacking up is that it is just a more casual form of monogamy. We have merely gone \\"two steps forward, and one step back.\\"While it has some passages that might qualify it as a \\"dirty book,\\" with some exceptions (especially the first chapter), it is not nearly even as \\"dirty\\" as, say, Lenny Bruce's comedy. Indeed, though some of the sale copy leads you to believe it is about developments across America, it is misleading to too quickly equate Talese's story with the whole of popular culture. The Atlantic Monthly, quoted on the cover, gets it right: the book is \\"A sexual pilgrim's progress:\\" Talese is one of the participants: not a major player, but more than a deer in the headlights, and in the last chapter we learn that he has been much more involved with his subject that ever we guessed. This has the effect of making the discussions of the Sandstone Retreat and other tales into personal back story, and this is really quite clever of Talese. (And, we can see, his wife agrees.) For example, by the time Talese appears at Sandstone we are well acquainted with one of its regular members, Alex Comfort, author of THE JOY OF SEX books, and others of quite varied stripes.Talese writes expansively in an often well-researched journalistic style, with a relaxed feeling for the rhythm of the mid-length sentence that makes reading the book an easy pleasure. He does eschew risks of detail in the interest of popularity. The concentration of fact is not as great as with, as a key example, Edmund Wilson, of whose TO THE FINLAND STATION I was reminded during the discussion of John Humphrey Noyes's Oneida Community. In THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE you learn more detail about Noyes and his most successful of American communisms, but this does not replace Wilson's account, which in two pages also tells you why indeed Noyes was relatively successful: he was \\"a man of real intellectual ability.\\" From Talese you would think Noyes was a somewhat staunch, perhaps overbearing, perhaps self-serving Bible and multiple partner pounder, while from Wilson you learn that Noyes wrote A HISTORY OF AMERICAN SOCIALISMS and called for \\"a prohibitory duty\\" on any theorizing that idealists do not work out, and write down, themselves (at least the law has rightly been in the hands of the scribes since the recovery from the Flood); that he is one of the better communists when he says \\"It is certainly cruel to set vast numbers of people agog with utopian projects that will cost them their all, while the inventors and promulgators do nothing but write and talk.\\"So, according to Noyes at least, because they do it themselves, Noyes and Hugh Hefner, another major figure in the book, count as the better sort of guides to openly sexual communities, and Talese too serves on the watch. Plato might say that law is both written down and lived (I am thinking of the Cratylus). Both Talese and Wilson relate that Noyes thought quite soundly about the income-earning necessities of a commune and that Oneida therefore had many businesses, some quite successful, at least one of which, Community Plate, still flourishes; and that his community's failure was due to American Puritanism, the bane and contradiction of balanced American existence. If there were one and only one thing we were allowed to eradicate from America through education, I would suggest it be Puritanism. The British were right to throw the Puritans out, and we Americans are pitilessly brainwashed in elementary school to admire them, monsters of literalness and mere utility though they have always been; now that they have become the most implacable adversaries of progress in American history, it is time to decry them absolutely. Noyes's system of \\"Complex Marriage\\" could stand to be revived. With his failure and retirement, he moved to, of all places, Niagara Falls, wedding capital of the continent. Good move, Noyes.There are some things that may reflect the beliefs of the characters in the book, whose names are real and whose deeds we are quite remarkably told \\"actually happened,\\" but they are not always convincing. One example will have to suffice. When Sandstone leader John Williamson forces newcomer John Bullaro's hand, revealing Bullaro's ordinary philandering as it morphs into the catch in his net of open marriage, his wife Barbara Bullaro thinks \\"Her husband freed her from certain indefinable fears and romantic illusions about sex and body pleasure, as distinguished from the meaning of marital love.\\" This could be understood several ways, but since there is no marital love of which sex is not a part, it sounds too much like a shallow and facile excuse to get crazy with the pleasure of sex (a later stage of development). If this were what Barbara Bullaro thought for a moment (and therefore Talese's mention of it is simply journalistic), it is not related to what she soon did, which was to militantly transfer her affections to Williamson, at the explicit expense of Bullaro, and since this is a quite recognizable form of revenge mixed with triumphalism on Barbara's part, it doesn't matter what convenient line she told herself along the way. But Talese does not pretend to the be philosopher king of the movement, rather an interested and skilled storyteller who for a time turns out to have been a fellow traveler. Maybe he is just letting us conclude on our own when the principals are being a bit superficial.Chapter Thirteen is where it gets scary, and vicariously quite exciting. The emotional danger is really that, and in fact works out to the detriment of the participants' marriage. This is where John Bullaro's casual extra-marital affairs change, through a sexy conspiracy, into a confrontation with a potential paradise of accommodating, willing female partners who are part of a community of practitioners that already knows the facts about him and his wife. Williamson acts as grand master and interrogator in a conspicuous cult with by now well-known emotional psychobabble and intimidation, but there is a palpable component of admirable truth in the obviously doomed effort toward a brave new world. It is the prescience that is most real, not least because of the idea afloat that these people exist and do these things. Anybody who has only thought or read along these lines gets perhaps the most direct confrontation with their fantasies, in a way that does not remove but, if anything, increases their consequences and responsibilities.For passages like this Talese has done us a big favor. Getting from vicarious to actual participation is still a bit of a problem. Noyes, still the most successful of his kind, understood that the master mind had to live among and have sex with his sexy people, or the project would fail. Williamson and Hefner are such leaders, but Williamson is long gone, and Hefner, though a continuing icon, has not, social and legal victories notwithstanding, in the long run achieved an image higher than popular culture allows. Playboy magazine needs to return to the days when the literary element in the magazine was much higher. Let us hope Playboy's recent clarion call sustains long enough to effect permanent change. But let us not hold our breath, for the Commander of the Faithful is 86.THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE has background about legal and social events throughout the entire period under discussion. Some of this is quite detailed and, in a journalistic way, raises the bar on the needed realism. For example, when SCREW magazine got started it was a tenant in an unappealing building that also housed a brass knuckles manufacturer and the magazines Monster Times and Peeping Tom, and you get the further back story that the building was built by Edward West Browning, who with his nymphet wife was probably the model for Daddy Warbucks and Little Orphan Annie. Some of this smut has after all made it into popular culture, though in a form the public may remain in denial about, especially in these days of pharmacologically-induced, unreflective psychology.Some of the martyrs here paid dearly. Fifty-five thousand copies of a flyer which publisher William Hamling sent out nationwide got a grand total of exactly and only twelve (12) complaints through the Post Office, and this was enough for him to serve four years in prison after a sentence appealed to the highest court in the land in a courtroom beneath an opulent gold frieze of more nude men, women and children than totaled all the complainants against him. The Supreme Court used permanent sex depiction on its walls, for all the land to see, to sell itself to the entire nation and then punish a sex publisher for a handful of copies of a one-time flier that only twelve people saw and complained about. The unanimity required to get work done in this country sometimes better resembles a Masonic Lodge than any nation. Whoever believes that when it comes to sex, America is the land of the free and the home of the brave, is smoking dope."},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"RECEIVED ON TIME AND AS EXPECTED AND IT WAS IN AN EXCELLENT SHAPE - GREAT SERVICE FROM AMAZON AS ALWAYS"},{"Title":"Thy Neighbor's Wife","review":"Mr Talese is clear about his interest in sex.Sex was reborn (as a public issue) in the late sixties.Today, sex is all over the media (and maybe, this is not good news).Sex is life.This is an interesting book if you are interested in the history of sex.If you are interested in sex, don't read this book.

Although he made a living as a college professor for much of his life, most of his diverse and voluminous publications were meant for people outside academia. Howe is perhaps best known as the author of World of Our Fathers: The Journey of the East European Jews to America and the Life They Found and Made, but he was also an editor of and contributor to the journal Dissent for many years, as well as the author of a number of books of literary criticism.Howe was a socialist. In his youth, he was a Trotskyist, and like many people, his politics became more moderate as he matured. But unlike many others from his generation of leftwing activists - some of whom were supporters of Stalin in their youth and then extreme conservatives later on - Howe remained a firm believer in democratic socialism throughout his adult life. This is not to say that his basic consistency always led him to what seem in retrospect to have been good opinions. In this regard, author Gerald Sorin gives us Irving Howe, warts and all (pardon the cliche). For example, before and even during World War II, Howe viewed that conflict as not much more than a battle between imperialist powers. Howe also fought long and hard with the New Left activists during the 60s - while some 60s radicals probably did think they were the first people to notice that there are problems in America, Howe's response to their arrogance left a lot to be desired. Howe also didn't exactly see the import of the women's movement in its early years. To his credit though, Howe eventually came around somewhat on feminism and was also an early and vocal supporter of the civil rights movement.Just ten years after his death, many of the socialist ideas and ideals that Irving Howe wrote about seem to have been inspired by convictions that are anachronistic in today's world. Gerald Sorin does a terrific job conjuring up Howe and his world in a way that makes you hopeful that democratic socialism is still something that might just work, if it were given half a chance. Irving Howe: A Life of Passionate Dissent is a fine biography of a thoughtful man who believed that the world could be a better, more just place for all people."},{"Title":"Irving Howe: A Life of Passionate Dissent","review":"The last time we heard the name of the subject of this biography, Irving Howe, in this space it was as a (well paid) cameo performer and resident literary expert in Woody Allen's comedic send up of mass culture, Zelig. If Woody Allen is regarded as the consummate New Yorker, then Irving Howe, for better or worst and I think for the worst, represented the consummate post- World War II New York intellectual. Furthermore, as detailed here Howe came to see himself, as reflected in various shifts in his literary work and his politics, as a New York Jewish intellectual. (The Jewish intellectual aspect of this biography is a little beyond the scope of what I want to review here but should be mentioned as it is a central theme of Professor Sorin's work).Moreover, as a perusal of this sympathetic, sometimes overly sympathetic, biography will reveal, as if to add insult to injury, this long time and well known editor of the social democratic journal Dissent fancied himself a New York socialist intellectual, as well. And that is the rub. As I will argue below Howe and his \`greatest generation' cohort of public intellectuals did more than their fair share of muddying the political waters as people of my generation, the generation of '68, tried to make political sense of the world. And tried to change it for the better, despite the best efforts of Howe and his crowd to make peace, for the nth time, with bourgeois society.I have mentioned in a review of Socialist Workers Party (SWP) leader James P. Cannon's The Struggle for the Proletarian Party, a book about the faction fight over defense of the Soviet Union and the organizational norms of a Bolshevik party in 1939-40, found elsewhere in this space that I have long questioned the wisdom of the entry tactic into the American Socialist Party by those forces who followed Leon Trotsky in the 1930's. Irving Howe is an individual case study that points out, in bold relief, the impetus behind that questioning.Howe, born of poor New York Jewish immigrant parents in 1920, came of political age in the 1930's as he gravitated toward the leftward moving Socialist Party in high school and later at that hotbed of 1930's radicalism, City College of New York. As a result of the Trotskyist entry (as an organization then called the Workers Party) into the Socialist party they were able to pull out a significant portion of the Socialist Party's youth group, including Howe, when they were expelled from that party in 1938. This cohort of, mainly, young New York socialists thereafter formed a key component of the anti-Soviet defensist opposition led by Max Shachtman that split from the main body of Trotskyism, The SWP, in 1940. From there on, especially in the post World War II period with the onrush of the Cold War, these \`third camp' socialists made their peace, quietly or by a warm embrace, with American imperialism.The bulk of Howe's intellectual career, as a niche magazine editor and professor at various top-notch universities, thus was spent explaining the ways of god to man, oops, American imperialism to newly minted graduate students. So, not only does Professor Howe serve here as a whipping boy for the errors of the 1930's Trotskyists but also as a prima facie case of what happens when one's theoretical baggage breaks away from a hard materialist conception of history. Therefore, by the time that my generation was ready to \`storm heaven' in the 1960's we dismissed Howe and his intellectuals in retreat out of hand.Professor Sorin does a very good and thorough job of describing the tensions between Howe's branch of the Old Left and the various components of the New Left as each group squared off against the other in the Sixties. Sorin gives, as could be expected from his sympathies, his protagonist Howe much the best of it. For our part, we of the New Left may have made every political mistake in the book due to more than our share of naivet&eacute; and overzealousness but we had a better sense than Howe and his ilk of how irrational the forces that we opposed (and still oppose) really were. But read the biography and make your own decision on that."},{"Title":"FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS","review":"Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.Here's a 1903 text, republished in 2007, that -- surprise, surprise -- illustrates the 'science-ejected status' of vitalism EVEN THEN, about ONE HUNDRED years ago, per:\\"the view of life as a substance yielded to the belief in a life principle (a kind of life energy), a view which is generally called vitalism.

If I were a CS2 instructor, I guess I would require students to read some parts of this book since it is a great means of reinforcing about all the concepts learned in C++, while building a nontrivial application; although some examples are taken from physics, physics knowledge is by no means required and the general math level called for reading this book remains comfortably low, and one can always skip the things one does not know or does not care about (such as quaternions, but hey, some people might be turned on by that stuff...).It shows how to build classes that actually perform calculations using integers of arbitrary length, rational numbers of the a/b form, vectors, matrices, quaternions, symbolic variables, differentiation, integration, etc.The system described in the book, SymbolicC++, can be used as a FREE alternative to Mathematica or Maple, less of course the graphing capabilities these great software products offer (less also zillions of functions available). SymbolicC++ may nevertheless be connected to Gnuplot to produce graphs. SymbolicC++ may also be of interest to the professional developer having to struggle with complex calculations, since its classes can be included in any C++ environment.So in short, this book is great if you have the right background and the right interests.I should also point out that Dr Steeb has written another great book that shows the system at work in problems from the physical sciences and finance (&quot;The Nonlinear Workbook&quot;)"},{"Title":"SymbolicC++: An Introduction to Computer Algebra using Object-Oriented Programming","review":"A mixture of C++, group theory, and mathematical physics.

Thank You again."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"You don't have to plow through monster works like &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; or &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; to gain an appreciation for the art of Thomas Mann. &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; is a short novel (for Mann) about the medieval legend of St. Gregory. This is a story of sin and redemption, with the horrors of the sins, incest and unbridled lust, making the redemption all the more spectacular.The style is elegant, stylishly mocking the medieval archaic German which is well-rendered into a stylized antique English by the talented Mrs. Lowe. The story is as gripping as any soap opera but the artistry with which it is told is exquisite. As usual, Mann blends his story-telling ability with his genius as a writer of ideas. I can hardly think of another writer who comes close to being able to combine a good yarn with incredible style and deep concepts (maybe Melville and Nabokov, perhaps.)This is a good preparatory book for &quot;Joseph and his Brothers&quot;--a monumental book about the biblical story of Joseph in Egypt."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"&quot;The Holy Sinner,&quot; on a literal level is a story about a multi-generational incestuous family, and their reconcilliation of their sins. Read as such, &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; is a disturbing account with a semi-satirical take on the religious rituals of redemption, incest, nepotism and penance.On a deeper level, &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; comes forth as a contemporary myth. There is a definite straining in this book for a sense of redemption, forgiveness, and the search for meaning. Ripe with symbolism, and exploring a kind of &quot;less-violent&quot; Oedipal storyline, you can feel Mann's struggle over the contemporary situation in Germany in the late 40s and early 50s.Though not what I would call a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Doctor Faustus,&quot; in the allegorical way you can catch a glimpse of Germany in the pages of &quot;The Holy Sinner,&quot; I would nevertheless point out that the theme of &quot;penance and change instead of murder and vengeance&quot; seems very contemporarily bound.However, the story itself hinges on one coincidence too many, and there are passages that nearly grind to a halt in speed and direction. I did come away from the novel with a new respect for Thomas Mann, but this was not an easy read, and, at times, not even enjoyable. The alliteration and sometimes near-poetry of the writing was in some passages immaculate, and then a few pages later almost clumsy and awkward.I would consider this book one meant more for study than outright enjoyment, though I did enjoy it more often than I didn't. It was work to finish it, however, and more work to digest and attempt to understand it. If you are in the mood for something serious and allegorical, pick up &quot;The Holy Sinner.&quot; But if you're looking for something lighter or entertaining, I'd suggest you pass this one by."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"These lines are, for me, among the most powerful I've ever read:[The pope-elect has been found on his little rock in the middle of a lake, where he exiled himself.]\\"'Ah, holy lord,\\" she sobbed, \\"I merit not your remembrance or your praise, for God knows my sin. When I protected you that day from the fisher's harsh words, he taxed me with wantonness and fleshly feeling for you and I denied the charge, falsely, as I now confess. For my eyes did really have to do with your limbs in the beggar's rags and with your noble features, and wantonness was at the bottom of the good I did you, depraved lost soul that I am!''That is a small matter,\\" answered Gregorius, \\"and not worth talking about. Seldom is one wholly wrong in pointing out the sinful in the good, but God graciously looks at the good deed even though its root is in fleshliness. Absolvo te.' These were his words. It was the first instance of the extraordinary clemency he was to display as Pope, so consoling to all men and only offensive to the draconians.\\"There's nothing more important to me, to you, to any of us, than attaining this understanding. We all get it too late.Of all the literature that I know, only Adalbert Stifter expresses this idea with more transparency, and yet, I have to admit that Mann's work has much greater scope than Stifter's. Mann's conception in this book and in others has the devil in it. (I'm not saying he's a satanist, but that his stuff is Faustian.) Stifter was much more careful. He had to be, in his careful age.In Goethe, Novalis, Stifter, others, and here in Mann, this theme is treated in various ways-- our civilization is built on a natural foundation that is beyond good and evil, and sex is natural, and likewise beyond good and evil. That our values get their initial impulse from something as dubious as sex is something we all have to come to terms with.The bible makes this point nicely too, but I don't know that book well enough to comment. German literature after Goethe seeks to reconcile the pantheistic focus on nature with Christian values. This process begins with Goethe's famous quote, \\"\\"In natural science, we are pantheists; in poetry, polytheists; morally, monotheists\\"."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"Thomas Mann (1875-1955), winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, is one of the great German writers of the 20th century. His best works rely on an exquisite sense of irony, erudition and multiple layers of meaning to explore some of the burning moral issues of our time. &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; is one of his last works and was written immediately after what many consider his masterpiece, &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;.In &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; Mann retells a medieval legend about the life of Pope Gregory in plush,tongue-in-cheek, bejewelled language reminiscent of knightly chronicles. The translator, H. T. Lowe-Porter, has done an excellent job in translating the romance-like pastiches spoken or written by the different characters --in particular if you have a smattering of French, Latin, Spanish, Catalan, Middle English or Provenzal, you will enjoy these light-hearted and occasional romps. However, as is usual with Mann, the glittering surface-story is not the most interesting one. This book is also a Christianized version of Sophocles' Oedipus tragedies and an optimistic commentary on the possibilties of European reconstruction in the aftermath of the second world war.Unfortunately I feel the three levels do not resonate with the power you find in his masterpieces (&quot;The Magical Mountain&quot;, &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;). Russell Berman, who wrote the introduction to the book does not agree: &quot;In the Holy Sinner, Thomas Mann unfolds an ornate depiction of the Middle Ages, replete with courtly love and jousting knights, illiterate peasants and papal magnificence. This fascinating setting, which the author embellishes with all his linguistic and confabulatory powers, is equally a backdrop for weighty matters of the mind: religious questions of sin and grace, psychoanalytical inquiries into incestous desire, political investigations into the distribution of power.&quot;If you have never read Thomas Mann, I would recommend you start with his novelette &quot;Death in Venice&quo;! t; and then go on to &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;. If you have read his masterpieces be warned: this is, in Graham Greene's nomenclature, more of an entertainment than a novel."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"You don't have to be able to appreciate the spoof on medieval literature and traditions and all that (I know almost nothing of the genre) to go nuts over this book. You do have to exercise a bit of patience after that ringing first chapter, to accustom yourself to the difficult diction and exotic words with bunched-up consonants, but if you do, you'll soon learn that this is very far from some stuffy intellectual's conceit; it's a rip-roaring story that makes you gasp, laugh, and fight yourself not to rush through in order to find out what happens next.Two highpoints: the first chapter not only with its exultant language, but with that wry, wise, hilarious voice, and the chapter called The Penance, an impossibly rich, word-perfect description of time passing and a sort of time-lapse description of Grigorss' physical change that beats to hell, and always will beat to hell, anything you'll see all too literally depicted at the movies."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"I have read several reviews on Amazon saying that this novel, which appears to be a simple retelling of a 12th-century verse epic about the life of Pope Gregory, is actually fraught with deep meaning and symbolism. The rationale for this argument seems to be that Thomas Mann, steeped as he was in Freud, Nietzsche, Goethe and other philosophers, was incapable of writing anything simple. Therefore, \\"The Holy Sinner\\" must be a multi-layered, allegorical commentary on post-WWII Germany and the modern concept of evil. While reading this book, I searched high and low for deep meaning, but didn't find much. There is one obvious Oedipal reference (a son sleeps with his mother), a narrator with a sardonic sense of humor, and a sinner who spends 17 years as a penitent (maybe the number 17 is symbolically significant?), but none of this adds up to \\"an optimistic commentary on the possibilities of European reconstruction in the aftermath of the second world war,\\" as one of the Amazon reviewers put it. If anything, Mann is exploring culturally unacceptable sexual urges, as he did in \\"Death in Venice,\\" and the idea that the diseased soul is sometimes capable of the greatest good. Overall, however, \\"The Holy Sinner\\" strikes me as a simple retelling of a 12th-century verse epic about the life of Pope Gregory. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."},{"Title":"THE HOLY SINNER","review":"Fantastic story of transformation and forgiveness.Mann uses the pen like a master."},{"Title":"Justice of Shattered Dreams: Samuel Freeman Miller and the Supreme Court During the Civil War Era (Conflicting Worlds)","review":"Justice of Shattered Dreams is a well-balanced blend of history, law, economics and biography. The author provides a succinct and well-written summary of such topics as popular sovereignty, the tension over the Kansas/Nebraska issue, the recalcitrance of the South during Reconstruction, and the legal battles between capitalist bondholders and small town populists. Ross, who has a J.D. from Duke, provides insightful legal summaries of Dred Scott, Ex Parte Merryman, the Prize cases, Ex parte Milligan, the Legal Tender cases, as well as the Slaughterhouse cases for which Miller is most remembered. Ross's analysis of Ex Parte Milligan resonates today vis-a-vis the legal arguments over the status of the internees at Guantanamo Bay. There is just enough legal analysis to explain the theory of the decisions without overpowering the non-lawyer reader, and just enough facts to convey the essence of the case and its background.The book is interesting because it is not a true biography of a Supreme Court justice. It blends the economic background and the societal tensions that were present during Miller's lifetime. Additionally, Ross makes some very good points on Reconstruction and reinforces why Reconstruction, in some ways, was just as decisive as slavery in fracturing the country - a legacy that continues today much to the dismay of the modern Democratic party. Ross's analysis of how railroads and railroad bridges destroyed the small western towns is very informative; again, Ross provides a good, cogent synopsis of an economic issue. Overall, this is an interesting and informative book that ties together divergent strands of history and presents a cohesive snapshot of our country between the 1850's and 1870's."},{"Title":"Justice of Shattered Dreams: Samuel Freeman Miller and the Supreme Court During the Civil War Era (Conflicting Worlds)","review":"The appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Freeman Miller by President Lincoln was perhaps his best decision before the Civil War. Miller's life story is well written by Dr. Ross and perhaps will be the definitive study of the man for generations to come.Ross provides new insights into Supreme Court cases, such as the Slaughter House rulings and other important judicial issues of the Civil War and Reconstruction. But perhaps what is Ross's finest work is his ability to articulate Miller's character. The author's background on the Justice fully prepared the reader for understanding why Miller voted on a certain issue. In doing so, the reader can clearly comprehend the various court decisions of that era.Clearly, the judicial system of the Civil War is one of the few areas of that time period with insufficient attention. Ross's book will hopefully ignite a spark to this unknown subject of American history."},{"Title":"Justice of Shattered Dreams: Samuel Freeman Miller and the Supreme Court During the Civil War Era (Conflicting Worlds)","review":"This book does a superb job of placing the legal decisions of the Civil War era within the complex and exciting times in which they took place. Samuel Freeman Miller is a fascinating and important figure."},{"Title":"Sleepwalk: and Other Stories","review":"The sixteen stories contained here are predominantly quiet angst-ridden portraits of young men and women who are experiencing some kind of loss. Several lurk in the disorienting and heartbreaking wake of breakups. &quot;Six Day Cold&quot; is perhaps the most touching of these, showing a young man with a severe cold encountering his ex-girlfriend on the street. She takes care of him, bringing him soup and whatnot-and the way Tomine captures the unseen wistful looks he gives her is shattering. It's an awkward emotional terrain he captures with equal precision in the title story.Indeed, awkward situations are Tomine's forte, from threatening teenagers on a bus in &quot;Hostage Situation,&quot; to a family vacation in &quot;Dylan &amp; Donovan&quot; to the realization of shifting friendships in &quot;Hazel Eyes&quot; or a supermarket worker encountering a blind customer out on the street in &quot;Supermarket.&quot; Tomine's ability to rapidly capture the exact right emotional tone of each situation and character is amazing. The longest story, &quot;Summer Job&quot; is pitch-perfect in showing a slacker-punk middle class kid on summer vacation from UC Berkeley (A Berkeley resident, Tomine sets many of his stories in and around Bay Area.). The kid's arrogant disdain for the Kinko's-like job he takes and his complete obliviousness to the economic realities of his co-workers is dead on and enraging.Another common theme is loneliness, from the difficulty in long-distance relationships in &quot;Long Distance&quot; and &quot;Layover&quot; to an old widow remembering better days in &quot;Lunch Break&quot; or the creepy tale of a young woman who's stalked via the personal ads in &quot;The Connecting Thread.&quot; Thus, it should come as no surprise that on the whole, the collection can be rather depressing (apparently Tomine's other collection, 32 Stories, is more upbeat). Of course it should be noted that the artistry is consistently graceful and real over the 102 pages, and the book's design and production is lovely and understated. This is the graphic novel to give people who would never consider picking one up."},{"Title":"Sleepwalk: and Other Stories","review":"&quot;Disparate&quot; is really the only word one could use to describe Tomine's writing style. His depictions of the inner pains that many of us know, especially from our late teens and early twenties, are almost painful to read with all of the insecurities that they bring flooding back. This angst ridden collection of stories is the collected works of his first eight editions of the comic book &quot;Optic Nerve&quot; which Tomine produces yearly.Sleepwalker is an excellent introduction to his work, where as his other trade paper back &quot;32 stories&quot; is a collection of his earliest work and while some of the stories are very amusing, it's also very raw, and out of the normal vein of work Tomine is known for."},{"Title":"Sleepwalk: and Other Stories","review":"there's only one word for adrian tomine-- good. he is so good. his comics are wonderful. the drawing is great, and the stories...well, the stories generally deal with relationships gone bad, in one way or another. although his comics can be very sad, they are also very very good. most of the stories in &quot;sleepwalk&quot; are pretty morose, check out &quot;32 stories&quot; for more funny, upbeat material. &quot;sleepwalk&quot; contains the first four issues of &quot;optic nerve.&quot; overall: fantastic."},{"Title":"Sleepwalk: and Other Stories","review":"Tomine captures social isolation and the pointless life so perfectly that this book is probably one of the most depressing things ever written.

The speakers offer a variety of regional accents, including Florentine, Milanese and Roman.Italia Contemporanea is populated with unforgettable characters, including a farmer, a mechanic, a neurologist, a journalist, a nurse, and a secretary. You will meet a 77 year-old woman who recounts a moving incident during WWII in which she traded her starving family's last possession, a bike, for what she was told was a sack of flour.

After rescuing some priceless artifacts stolen from Iraq (a laughable and tasteless way to get the story rolling), Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, finds herself caught up with yet another dangerous cult. It seems that someone is trying to resurrect an ancient, proto-religious following called Mene (or The Numbered) and is willing to kill any and all that get in the way of doing so. What makes the situation personal is that an old friend, Alison \\"Ajay\\" Harfleur, who wanted nothing more than to be exactly like Lara, has fallen in with the reforming Mene. The Tomb Raider and Ajay's jilted fiance, a mechanical armed behemoth nicknamed Borg, give chase. Despite the promising concept rooted in Lovecraftian lore, I found this outing a tad slow and wordy, focusing less on the action and more on the character (as opposed to The Amulet of Power, which was all action and NO character development), but it had some cool monsters and an exciting finale, with Croft facing off against a bonafide \\"Deep One.\\" Tomb Raider fans should enjoy it.

I am more of a movie fan than a games fan so I do not know whether games fans would find that odd or fitting. At any rate, that section was still well written. After it the action really starts. The action scenes are written in a clear style with lots of dramatic action. Some of them might not pass muster if they were in a more realistic book, but they are very entertaining regardless. Lara also has several companions who come across as fleshed out, interesting characters. The fighting is left to Lara, while these characters fill out very appropriate roles of their own in the story. There is even a bit of philosophy about the nature of reality versus the perception of it. One thing I did find objectionable, and I must warn that this is a bit of an ending Spoiler, was that Lara found reasons not to kill her main opponents, but the author gave them gruesome deaths anyway. That was rather unnecessary. All in all, this is a light action adventure story. I would not recommend it on its own, but I would to any people already fans of Lara Croft."},{"Title":"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Lost Cult","review":"Awful writing, terrible character development, painfully contrived plot, no substance whatsoever. In short, exactly what you're looking for in a novel of this type. It's purely fun to read. You will not find any great revelations about the Lara Croft character or studies into the heroine's psyche. It's clear that the novel was written by an American, as the more British aspects of Lara are dealt with somewhat ham handedly, but this is forgivable. It's hardly worth reading unless you have an interest in the Tomb Raider series, and it is defiantly not a good entrance point into it. All in all, read it if you're looking for a taste of that Tomb Raider thrill during a long flight or a day by the pool."},{"Title":"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Lost Cult","review":"A great addition to tie in with the Tomb Raider universe. We learn more about Lara's past and get into deep trouble while tagging along as Lara fights against a cult. This has everything Tomb Raider fans crave.

It's something that knocks the book down several pegs, in my opinion.In the move from Italian to English, there are several examples of badly-translated words and/or phrases. If this were an intermediate or advanced book, it wouldn't be such a big deal, as anyone who has worked with Polymer Clay for a while already knows the correct terminology for many of the tools and supplies needed. However, as this is a beginner's manual, it is very important that the language be correct. If a newbie reads that s/he needs to buy &quot;resin pastes&quot; to make a &quot;murrhine,&quot; or &quot;purpurin&quot; and &quot;metal lamina&quot; to achieve different surface effects, that person may spend hours scouring a craft store for supplies that don't go by that name in the U.S. These terms refer to &quot;polymer clay,&quot; &quot;canes,&quot; &quot;glitter,&quot; and &quot;metal leaf,&quot; by the way.It may seem nit-picky, but I think it's important to use the right terminology with beginners so as to reduce the frustration level.

Her Mother's, who has died but who somehow lives in her soul. The Jorenian starship Sunlace, her house clan Torin and Captain Xonea, will guarantee her and Duncan Reeve's safety during the journey. There is this one but. Cherijo must keep a promise to her former pilot Dhreen to cure his people from horrible illness.As inBook 2 Beyond Varallan, the curtains for the surrounding include the magnificent starship of Jeron once again. Only this time the Sunlace is outfitted for war. In an accident Cherijo almost kills Dhreen, her husband gets to meet their child Marel kept in secrecy, suspicious psychiatric clan cousin Qonja starts tracking her, and ship's Senior Healer Squilyp of Omorr is having trouble with his mail-order bride who almost manages to get clan kill on her. Sunlace rescues some ships disabled and floating with both League and Hsktskt survivors while the journey into horrific \\"eternity row\\" is reached. Cherijo's mother also finally reveals herself in her home world, but unlike Cherijo expected.Four (4) stars. Written in 2002 this is the book 5 in the stardoc series that follows life of female Dr Cherijo Torin, the genetic experiment and clone manufactured by his Father. The book recaptures the excitement and restores the fun of the series. The strange planets, touch of religion and worship, ship's doctor making strides and or bumps with his bad tempered fiancee, the war aspect being replaced by people and their fates are all returning to the grassroots of this series. There are irrating moments with the book: Cherijo as a protective lion mother of her child is too accentuated, Indian female bursting stereotypic behavior, the goofy baby talk of Marel, testosterone crazed macho fights between two females plus between Duncan and captain, irrelevant bartermen slave trade episode and Maggie being made a seductress of Duncan. The book's supposed climax, the encounter with Cherijo's mother, is out and done with in few last pages. Maggie's world provide a very weak revelation. Somehow the sum of the parts still make a fun book to spend time with."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"This series is hands down my favorite space opera series. I love her writing style, and the way she focuses on character to the point where we can really feel as if we know them, as if they are real. Excellent writer! I also love her books written as Lynn Viehl."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"I really enjoyed the first two Stardoc books, and the third book was OK. Unfortunately, the fourth book was a chore to finish. It's not just that it is more of the same medical emergency and melodrama as its predecessors. The new characters and new alien societies introduced in this book are not very interesting. When you get right down to it, it's the quality of the villain in a melodrama that makes it. The best Viehl comes up with for a villian in Eternity Row is a bad tempered fiancee. I'm afraid the series is loosing steam."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil, now Cherijo Torin, is a new mom, a healer on board the Jorenian ship Sunlace, and is married to a human telepath who was raised by various aliens (and has the biggest case of emotional repression seen in science fiction).I really love this series, and am always anxious when the new book comes out. &quot;Eternity Row&quot; delivered what I'm getting used to out of Viehl: a series of emotionally frustrating events that leave you growling out loud at the situation, with deadly funny situations and bon-mots tossed throughout. And, of course, a big revelation at the end that leaves you hanging and thinking, &quot;But... but... what next?&quot;Duncan Reever and Cherijo are their usual combustible selves. They have a few trillion arguments and disagreements throughout this book, and as usual I found myself ready to toss Duncan out an airlock. I have a hard time rationalizing why anyone - let alone Cherijo - would stay with this man, but I suspend my disbelief and keep reading like a good little book addict. The rest of the plot is always worth it, and this book was no exception. The other quibble was the use of &quot;babytalk&quot; when Cherijo's daughter was speaking. Sometimes I had to read them aloud with a nasally kid-voice in an attempt to translate what the child was saying into english. &quot;Pree dars&quot; is pretty stars, for example. Ouch.With Marel (Cherijo's daughter) developing a sub-plot of interest, and the return of old favourites like Dreen and Alunthri, you'll be content with this episode in the Stardoc series. I sure was. Now I just need the next one...'Nathan"},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"This is a terrible book. Terrible, just terrible. A great disappointment after her earlier books, some of which were actually quite good. This book is badly written, answers no important questions about the series, and is exceptionally unsatisfying. The ending smacks of deadlines and contractual obligations; it feels more like a sketchy half-baked outline than the big wrap up (so far) to the series.Oh, and Ms. Viehl, if you write another book about these characters, please, please skip enough years to spare us the daughter's irritating baby talk. And please don't introduce another mystery like her teleportation ability (I assume that's what was behind her appearing in mysterious places) without at least giving us a little resolution. It's irritating enough when you finally bring us to Maggie's world and then give us her weak revelation and then basically tell us it isn't true. You have to resolve something in a 400+ page book, and the ridiculous health crisis that gets solved in ten minutes at the end of the outline-style ending just doesn't cut it. Also, the Bartermen are a terrible plot device, but not nearly as bad as the aliens who (again) kidnap Cherijo to sell her into slavery. Worse is the fact that they're so tiny that she just clonks their heads together and knocks them out to rescue herself. It's like the ending of a Superfriends episode, where everyone has a laugh at the expense of Wendy and Marvin (or Zan and Jayna, if you prefer). An amazingly cheesy ending to a book that wasn't worth the cover price.I only give it two stars because of a lingering affection for some of the characters, few of whom get much chance to shine in this stinker."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"Cherijo is back to prove that you can't go home again. She and Duncan Reever have settled into a caring, but slightly uneasy relationship (trust is going to be a problem when your husband sold you as a slave to some old pals). Their daughter, Marel, makes the connection a bit stronger, as both love her unconditionally.Spring fever has overtaken the ship, as both Sqillip and Alunthri are thinking about parenthood, one with trepidation and one with longing. Dreen and his Navajo girlfriend are also expecting, with unexpected results. They have three planets to visit, Hawk's father's home world, Dreen's planet, and finally, Cherijo's \\"mother\\" Maggie's planet. All three will present danger, confusions, and the unexpected. Xonea, Cherijo's ClanBrother has some surprises for her, too.This book was much more rewarding than SHOCK BALL, with its convoluted plot and bizarre characters. The Stardoc books are really best when they are out in space, as this one is. Marel was the most delightful character!"},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"This one has to be the best book in the series. Eternity row finally shows us why Dhreen is the way he is, and why he betrayed Chejiro to her father. I don't want to give the plot away, but I will say one thing. The author really knows how to knock holes in one's preconceptions. Eternal life would surely be looked upon by us all as a blessing... well Viehl shows us the possible reality of such a thing and it is hellish. :)"},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"She called him father until the day she learned she was his clone. Dr. Cherijo Torin escaped from him and his experiments on her but the League, of which earth is a member, denied her request for sentient status and instead declared her the property of her creator. Rather than submit to that megalomaniac man, Cherijo escapes and ends up joining the Jorenian alliance.Cherijo is happy aboard the Jorenian spaceship Sunlance accompanied by her beautiful daughter and her telepathic Terran husband. She treats the sick and cares for the injured while evading the bounty hunters out to bring her back to her creator. Cherijo never expects a calm life. On this voyage, she and her shipmates are almost sacrificed to a planet's deity, she plays matchmaker to a lovesick alien, and learns why the natives of an entire planet are sterile but whose inhabitants cannot die. All in a solar moment for Cherijo.The protagonist's life is fulfilled, but ever changing and action packed; readers adore and admire Cherijo. ETERNITY ROW is space opera at its very best as the plot contains exotic alien life forms and colorfully fascinatingly strange planets. S.L. Viehl has created a character and a futuristic setting that is second to none in its readability, quality, and social mores.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"I agree that books 1 and 2 were much more interesting. I admit that, before reading Shockball, I discovered Viehl had written some romance books and that tained my opinion of her writing. Hence, the intimate scenes in Shockball read like a romance and that annoyed me. I found several plot holes and contradictions but if you don't care about such things, the book is an ok read. The fate of the main character's &quot;father&quot; seemed somewhat anti-climatic but there was lots of other plot-finishing going on to make up for it a bit."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"This is a continuing story, and I very much recommend that you start with the first book, Stardoc, and read the sequels in order: Stardoc, Beyond Vallarean, Endurance, then Shockball. If you haven't, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for the first four.Contrary to what a lot of other readers seem to think, I believe that Eternity Row has brought Cherijo back into her groove.In this Fifth installment of the StarDoc series, Cherijo Grey-Veil is back on board The Sunlace with her husband/linguist Duncan Reever, and their new child Marel. With them on the huge HouseClan Torin ship are their two tag-alongs from Shockball; Hawk Long Knife, a Terran/Taercal halfbreed, and Dhreen, an Oenrallian who is Cherijo's former-friend and recent betrayer.Eternity row starts with HouseClan Torin decreeing that they will no longer turn their backs on their enemies, and have outfitted The Sunlace for war, willing to declare ClanKill on any who attack. Being upset enough about this, Cherijo goes to visit Dhreen and accidentally shoots him, causing a grievous injury. When Dhreen wakes from his surgery, he has trauma induced global amnesia. And everywhere Cherijo goes, she is now followed by the suspicious new psychiatric resident Qonja, cousin to Clan Torin.Eternity Row is packed with more adventure than the third and fourth books, which bogged down a little on the war between the League and the Hsktskt. Although The Sunlace rescues some ships disabled and floating with both League and Hsktskt survivors, Cherijo treats them aboard the Sunlace until they can be offloaded, and thankfully does not return to this in this installment.Instead, they head for Hawk's home world of Taerca hoping that he can locate his father. What they find is an openly hostile race of dying people, living under strict religious standards. It's trouble on Taerca, and trouble after the leave the planet when Squilyp's mail order bride from Omorr arrives, a haughty little thing who immediately begins to push around the big Jorenians. Trouble waits for Cherijo still when they arrive at Dhreen's home world of Orenrall, where things are not what they seem to be. Orenrall is hiding a horrible secret from the universe, and its up to Dhreen to remember it before the Bartermen sell them all as slaves.Eternity Row is back on the 5 star list along with books 1 and 2 in the series, recapturing the excitement, bizarre worlds and species, and helter-skelter race against life and death that Cherijo always gets herself tangled into. Strange planets, purple moulds, feline deities, squishy worms, planetary drug addictions, the strange ClanCousin Qonja watching her every move, and a racial struggle for death rather than life all will plant themselves in Cherijo's path and force her to confront them.What I really liked about this installment in the series is that they put aside the war for a while to concentrate on bringing back the more sci-fi elements of the series. I like the books better when Cherijo and Duncan get along, their squabbling can get tiresome at times. And I love the places and Beings that S.L.Veihl can dream up, and was getting tired of the Hsktskt/League conflict.The worst and most annoying thing about this installment is the baby talk that Marel speaks. Okay, I know she is supposed to be a precocious child, but I dearly hope that her speech is better in the next StarDoc book. And Ms. Veihl, you had better be working on it now, because I can't wait to take off again with Cherijo on her adventures. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"Eternity Row stars the super-bio-engineered doctor Cherijo, her standoffish husband Duncan Reever, and now the latest addition, Cherijo's daughter Maril.This latest installment was by far the weakest in the series. As we found out in the last four novels, Cherijo was bio-engineered by her demented father/brother to be the perfect wife (erk). Fortunately, this book fortunately gives the demented father/brother character Joe Grey Veil a rest, and concentrates on Cherijo.Cherijo and Duncan have had a child (see Shockball) cliff hanger. The child, Maril is precocious, gifted, and as annoying as can be, talking in 'baby talk' throughout the book. She manages to be underfoot at every opportunity, taking Eternity Row into new levels of corniness. Duncan Reever, usually cool-headed, becomes a testosterone crazed fiend in this novel, slathering Cherijo with a 'romance novel' level of protectiveness and ordering her about in uncharacteristic fashion.As usual, Cherijo is impervious to harm, as she bludgeons the readers (and the rest of the galaxy) with her own version of doctoring and philosophy. (While I love these books, I think the author may have painted herself into a a corner with this character by making her all-perfect, all-powerful, and just plain TOO superhuman). As it is, there is nothing Cherijo cannot do. From discovering cures for an STD(last novel), to solving interplanetary incidents. Cherijo is not only smarter than everyone, she is tougher, stronger, and knows what's best for everyone too. Please.While I liked Eternity Row, I felt the novel ending was a tad contrived. I disliked the baby-talk which the author used as a speech device for Cherijo's child. Scratch that, I also disliked the child as a plot device. Whatever happened to Cherijo's protestations that she 'just wasn't maternal?' And who in their right mind would produce a child with a stalker like Joe Grey Veil loose? I also felt the cast of characters needs to be parred down some, and some minor plot threads should've been resolved, such as Ilona... Etc. Overall, this was a okay read, but with all the 'pairing up' that goes on in this novel, I began to feel like I was reading a Romance Novel, rather than Sci Fi.I recommend this for readers of the other books, but it definitely was the weakest in the series."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"Eternity Row is Viehl's fifth StarDoc novel, and there's no end in sight. The series has been entertaining, and Cherijo Torin's quest to discover-and perhaps alter-her destiny has taken some creative turns. Viehl's characters, medical scenes, and action sequences have always been strong. Her basic writing skills have shown slow but steady improvement. Unfortunately, her plotting remains weak in terms of both her series-long story arc and her finer touches within each book.For those who by now feel a vested interest in Cherijo's fate, Eternity Row is worth reading, but it's decidedly the least inspired effort in the series to date. There's little sense of focus throughout much of the book, as the plot takes far too long to develop. The story's climax and wrap-up are then overly rushed, with no really satisfying pay-off at the end. Too many plot elements are poorly rationalized, overly contrived, or simply irrelevant. Most disappointing of all, there's no delightful, demented, Viehl-crafted villain powering this piece.The bare-bones outline is simple enough. The Sunlace will head for the planet of Oenrall so Cherijo can investigate the mysterious plague afflicting Dhreen's people. From there, it's on to Jxinok, to finally learn why Maggie involved herself in Joe's experiments to create Cherijo. Since Hawk's father is from a planet in the same quadrant as the other two, Sunlace will stop there along the way.The story lines as they actually play out become a good deal muddier. Cherijo's ClanBrother Xonea still seems to have designs on her; they unfold in a couple of related plot elements that splutter along through the main story lines. The ongoing war between League and Hsktskt forces affects life aboard the Sunlace. Cherijo's pals Squilyp and Alunthri are both having personal problems. A belief-straining connection turns up between Hawk's people and Dhreen's, and possibly Alunthri's. The Bartermen reappear. In addition to high intelligence and rapid healing, daughter Marel shows signs of at least one ability not demonstrated by Cherijo. There are unexpected side effects to Joe's experimental surgery on Duncan's kidney. Cherijo and Duncan still haven't gotten their joint act together, for which Maggie lectures them sternly-something readers have wanted to do since Endurance.Like earlier StarDoc books, Eternity Row has its better moments, mostly limited in this case to minor details. The book probably contains information essential to the larger story arc, though it's difficult to see how most of it could possibly matter in the long run. The back cover blurb promises that Cherijo and Duncan \\"intend to find Cherijo's foster mother-and the truth behind the subliminal messages she left in Cherijo's brain.\\" Duncan does eventually spring a surprise about the nature of the messages; however, when Cherijo at last gets to hear their purpose, she rejects it out of hand as a pack of lies. After waiting through most of the book for a substantial revelation like those in past stories, this feels like a pretty cheap trick."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"Eternity Row (2002) is the fifth SF novel in the StarDoc series, followingShockball. The initial volume in this series isStarDoc.In the previous volume, Cherijo discovered that the shock ball had been tampered with to give fatal electric shocks.

She is a physician and surgeon. She had been a healer among the Navajos.Duncan Reever is a telepath and a very talented linguist. He can learn a language almost as fast as it is being spoken via a link to the mind of the speaker. He escaped from the Navajos with Cherijo.Marel is the daughter of Cherijo and Duncan. She can't be locked into any area and seems to appear out of nowhere.Squilyp is an Omorr, a four limbed alien who hops on one limb and uses the other three as arms.

He is a newcomer on the Sunlace.Dreen is an Oenrallian pilot. He had been spying for Joseph, but changed sides after the death of Cherijo's father. Now he is going home with the Sunlace.Ilona Red Faun is a Navajo girl. She had a relationship with Cherijo's brother Jericho, but latched onto Dreen after the death of Rico.Hawk Long Knife is a winged being from Taerca. He had been the shaman for the Navajo tribe. Now he is heading back to his home planet to meet his father.In this story, Cherijo is getting ready to operate on a double hernia in a Jorenian crewman. But something is bothering her. She notices that the table linens under the operating table are moving.After Cherijo removes Marel from under the table, she gets Sqyilyp to find Duncan to take Marel home and keep her out of the operating room. Then she goes back to the surgery.The next morning, she attends a meeting with the Sunlace senior staff. She learns that the ship has been equipped with more powerful weapons to fight the Terrans and mercenaries trying to capture her. She also finds herself assigned to review new personnel procedures in case of an attack.Then she has a fit when she learns that such procedures even apply to the children. Cherijo definitely doesn't like putting the children at risk. She is told that the procedures are designed to protect them from harm, but she still is not happy.Xonea insists on demonstrating the adult procedures to Cherijo. She finds herself falling down often during combat training. She also doesn't like guns and edged weapons, but she finds a telescoping rod that can be used like a quarter staff.Cherijo is having troubles with Qonja. He seems to be following her. She complains about it to Squilyp. The Senior Healer suspends the resident from medical duties, but then the Jorenian Ruling Council reinstates him.Dhreen has not appeared at staff meetings for a while, so Cherijo searches for the Oenrallian. She finds him in the maintenance bay working on a shuttle. An accident occurs and he is severely injured.Cherijo is examining his injuries when Ilona accuses her of killing him. She attacks Cherijo, but is shaken off and grabbed by crewmen. But Cherijo is charged with deliberately injuring Dhreen and locked in the brig.After Cherijo proves her innocence, the Sunlace reaches Taerca. Two shuttles take Cherijo, Reever, Hawk and others down to the planet. Hawk finds his father, but the away party runs into problems with the Taercals.This tale also takes the Sunlace to Oenrall, Dhreen's home planet. Then they go to Jxinok, the homeworld of Cherijo's surrogate mother. More problems occur on these worlds.The Sunlace overcomes all difficulties, but not without casualties. The next installment in this series isRebel Ice.Recommended for Viehl fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alien cultures, medical practice, and contentious romance. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W.

Rating: 5+Book II: Cherijo travels through space trying to escape from bountry hunters. Excitement and suspense follow. Rating: 5Book III: Cherijo is captured and lives as a slave among an ultra-frightening alien race. Personal conflict and social commentary. Rating: 4So these were the good books of the Stardoc series. Unfortunately, S. L. Viehl has managed to reduce them into a silly soap opera where the most original characters are moody fiances, the issue at hand is breeding, the technology is so ridiculous, it's not even plausible (even for a sci-fi novel) and the plot is driven by the character's hallucinations.Book IV was sort of readable, mostly due to the mutant characters presented in the novel. Otherwise, let's just say that space novels should take place in space.Book V ends up a total disappointment. Cherijo finally finds out what Maggie really has to say to her, which Cherijo finds ridiculous (which is ironic, because the readers will find it even more so) and she says she disapproves of it and people who like control are bad, right? The novel offers no unifying plot, just a series of insignificant events as in a daytime soap opera. Sure, there are new planets and new species, but they are executed so poorly, they do not take away from the mediocre effort S. L. Viehl put into this book.Overall, I recommend books 1-3 of the series, they're pretty good sci-fi fluff with strong characters and interesting plots. Book 4 and 5 are kind of lame and published only because the fans of books 1-3 will buy them."},{"Title":"Eternity Row: A Stardoc Novel","review":"While I agree with some reviwers that this is not the best of the Stardoc series, those familiar with the characters will enjoy getting more deeply into the lives of the supporting cast.

Over five hundred photographs are accompanied by very informative narratives which convey the rich and varied history of migration to this land where four in ten persons today are either born overseas or from foreign born parents.The highlights of an often chequered history of Australian immigration are vividly brought home by some very personal stories drawn from family albums, community organizations,and library archives. A group of Italian settlers from the Aeolian islands pose for the first annual picnic for Melbourne frutierrs in 1906. In another photo, six young Australians of German ancestry are photographed in a detention camp in Germany where they were held during the First World War together with British prsioners. There is the snapshot of one Australian solider from Darwin's Chinese commnity who was shot several times in New Guinea by fellow Australian soldiers during World War Two who mistook him for a Japanese. A photo from the 1960s shows the generational differences between adult members of a Spanish commnity in Whyalla singing and dancing to flamenco music and the younger Spanish girls who were kept in pants and never owned a flamenco dress. Photos of Malays and of Greeks show the diverse specialist skills which were attracted into Australia's pearling industry. The chronicle of the 1970s and 1980s reveal the changing composition of immigrants, with Asian and African faces increasingly showing up in the photos.This book is a remarkable and informative piece of historical research judiciously combined with a rich portfolio of images of a nation which has become vastly transformed in a hundred years."},{"Title":"A Penelopean Poetics, Reweaving the Feminine in Homer's Odyssey","review":"Clayton offers the most significant new interpretation of the Odyssey for the new century. Out of the shadows of maginality, Penelope emerges as a symbol of the most basic meaning of the poem. Using weaving as a metaphor, Clayton demonstrates that Penelope is no less important than Odysseus as a storyteller. Both deeply scholarly and accessible for the non-classicist, this volume will take its place alongside those of Katz and Felsin-Rubin as an indispensible account of the poetics of the Odyssey."},{"Title":"A Penelopean Poetics, Reweaving the Feminine in Homer's Odyssey","review":"As a reader who occasionally dabbles in classical literature, I decided to give Clayton's book a try after reading the other sparkling reviews. It did not disappoint. Through all of my readings, never have I read a better or more interesting analysis of Penelope. Clayton has some truly revolutionary ideas and makes this a must read for anyone interested in Homer or the Odyssey."},{"Title":"LE NOEUD DE VIPERES. ROMAN","review":"Le Noeud de Viperes is probably my favorite novel, in any language. Mauriac is a craftsman and has a firm structure and progression in this book which will most likely go unnoticed because of his artistry.Mauriac, who won the Nobel Prize for literature, has given us here a universal, timeless tale of an old, dying man who wants to leave his inheritance to someone worthy. In the process of the story, which is presented as the man's journal, the images of many memorable characters are left in our minds, as well as the awe of perhaps the most beautiful conversion in literature.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who can read French and who wants a lovely, profound read. This was the first literature I read in French, and it remains my favorite."},{"Title":"LE NOEUD DE VIPERES. ROMAN","review":"Franois Mauriac was a profoundly Catholic novelist. He didn't write pious stories of the Saints or of holy priests and nuns. He wrote stories about people who lived dark, dissolute lives; who hurt others and themselves; but who are offered redemption.He won the Nobel prize for literature, but in a modern, atheistic France is barely feted.Le noeud de vip&egrave;res is, to my mind, his greatest novel. The story of a husband who treats his wife and family with utter disdain, verging on hatred; a man with a blackened heart, but for whom his impending death brings new insights and the possibility of redemption.It remains one of the greatest books I have ever read.If you prefer to read it in English, try:Vipers' Tangle (The Loyola Classics Series)"},{"Title":"LE NOEUD DE VIPERES.

Although I\`m very interested in medieval mystery storys I found this one particularly boring. There is no ambiente in this story, I never felt anything or smelled what it would be like to be in Wales in the 12th century. Much worse are the charakters. They are very poorly made and mere onedimensional. Also, like in an early Western one is to tell good from bad in a second. The good (or noble) people are blonde, tall, muscular, intelligent, blue-eyed and strong willed. The bad ones are dark, small, fat or skinny, dumb and dark-eyed. This, pardon me if it is not so, looks to me (a concerned Austrian)like Nazi- ideology and some kind of &Uuml;bermensch- fantasy. It reminds me of the ideal Aryan: blonde, blue-eyed, tall and muscular. That is a subliminial message I couldn\`t stand.

And Ellis Peters, in her usual intriguing way, presents us with her 18th Brother Cadfael episode in \\"The Summer of the Danes.\\"The year is 1144--the civil war between King Stephen and Empress Maud still rages on--and Brother Cadfael is called upon to be an interpreter to the Welsh village of Saint Asaph. Cadfael is Welsh born and he welcomes the journey to his homeland as a pleasant break from his duties as a brother at the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury.As it turns out--and naturally, as this is an Ellis Peters mystery!--a Danish fleet is sighted along the coast of Wales, a real menace, indeed. Then a young girl goes missing. Then a body is found. And Cadfael is off and running.So is the reader! Having read all the Brother Cadfael series, I found this to be one of my favorites. Peters wastes no time in developing her story and does not hesitate to flavor her plot with plenty of Welsh history and lore. Will the Danes invade? Will the murderer be brought to justice? Cadfael's expertise, once again, proves to be essential in the resolution of the crimes.Cadfael is the former crusader now turned monk who, while not solving murder cases, works as the Abbey's herbalist and is known throughout the area for his skills in medicine. The \\"Sunday Express\\" writes: \\"Cadfael...springs to life in her books, which are novels with depth. He is a man of warmth, humanity and engaging nosiness.\\"Do not be misled by the British TV series of the Cadfael stories. While on the surface they are quite adequate (Derek Jacobi is an ideal Cadfael), the 50-minute recounting of any of Peters' books does not do justice to the novel, which is a pity, for there are great gaps of (mis)understanding that simply cannot be supplied in such short time. Stay with the books! They are well-worth the read. Cadfael is a character worth knowing!Billyjhobbs@tyler.net"},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"The first 50 pages are mostly travelogue, and the next 50 pages are mostly set-up. The story doesn't really take off until around page 115. Once it gets going, it's good, but I found myself skimming huge paragraphs of bucolic description in the beginning. It's worth reading if you're working your way through the series, but if you're looking for an introduction to the Cadfael series, don't start with this book."},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"This 18th chronicle of Brother Cadfael has less about him and more about history. In fact, he really only appears at the beginning and at the ending and doesn't have any hand at all in the solving of crimes. The story springs from the tempestuous relationship between Owain Gwynedd, Prince of Wales and Cadwaladr, his treacherous and headstrong younger brother. The brothers have had no peace between them for years as Cadwaladr is forever plotting to seize power for himself, being beaten at this game by his brother and then counting on the strong family ties that exist in all Welshmen, to be forgiven and taken back into the fold. This time, he has gone too far however, and has hired Danish mercenaries to attack Owain's troops. These Danes have been settled in Ireland for generations (a fact I did not know) and were just as much Irish as Danish and were Christian to boot! It was an interesting read for the historical contents alone, even if Cadfael scarcely appeared."},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"I found this a marvelous mystery, though, as in most of this author's mysteries, the mystery is not important. The important thing is the words, the well-developed characters, and the lack of stereotypical characters.I have a question for the person who said that all Peter's heroes were tall, blond, and muscular. I would like to ask how many he has read, as it is actually rare that the heroes are blond. Take a look at Hugh Beringar, Torold Blund and Brother Cadfael himself for some examples! And in the Hermit of Eyton Forest, the protagonist is a child with many childish characteristics.The books are very good in general, though there are one or two that are not up to par. This is not one of her best, however, so you might try A Morbid Taste for Bones or One Corpse Too Many, which are both very good. I recommend this series to anyone who likes medieval mysteries!"},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"Welsh prince Owain Gwynedd has forgiven other challenges from his younger brother, Cadwaladr, but this time the renegade royal has hired a fighting force of Danes from Dublin - just across the sea from Wales - to force Owain to return Cadwaladr's lands, which he took for good reason. When Brother Cadfael accompanies his friend and former protege, priest-in-training Brother Mark, on a diplomatic mission to help two newly appointed bishops ease the tensions between the Church and the Welsh nobility, the two monks wind up taken hostage by Cadwaladr and his Danes. Held with them is the beautiful Heledd, a girl betrothed to a man she hasn't chosen (a man she has not even met) in order to get her out of the way of her father's priestly career. For Heledd's parents married in the days when priests still commonly did that, and the changing of customs has left her father in conflict. He loves his daughter, but her existence embarrasses him and makes advancement difficult.Heledd does not intend to accept her fate dutifully. She falls into the hands of the Danes after fleeing from her father and the rest of the company taking her to meet her bridegroom, and once there she becomes interested - if Cadfael is any judge of human behavior - in a rising young leader among those Danes, the captain of their smallest and swiftest ship.This book is far more historical novel and adventure tale than mystery, and Cadfael isn't as central and active a character as usual. The story works quite well, though, and the characters introduced for this book only are well written if sometimes a bit larger than life. A good read overall, although not the best book in the long series.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"I have read all of the Brother Cadfael books and this is one of the best. His humanity, patience and brilliant sense of humor come through this tale clearly. The characters he meets along the way are very well portrayed, and the events that take place are, as in all this series, based in history. After I read this I also purchased Viking Dublin as wanted to know more about that era.This is a story of conflict, revenge, torn loyalties and, yes, love."},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"[...]I have now officially read every single Brother Cadfael mystery novel. It took me quite a time to find this one in a format I can access readily. I found it at last on &lt;a href=\\"http://www.Audible.com\\">Audible.com&lt;/a> and downloaded it to my &lt;a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&tag;=medienovel-20&link;_code=as3&camp;=211189&creative;=373489&creativeASIN;=B00154JDAI\\">Kindle2&lt;/a>.This is just barely a mystery. There is a murder. There is a call to track down the killer. The killer is, in fact, revealed. Brother Cadfael does supply the forensics, meager though they be. But that is simply not all that relevant to the story. This is an adventure and love story unlike any Brother Cadfael you have read.Brother mark, now a deacon in the Bishop of Lichfield's service, arrives at the Abbey of St. peter and St. Paul as he makes his way on a special mission. He is to travel to the two bishops in Wales to present gifts from his own bishop. One is Gilbert, a new bishop, a Norman who speaks no Welsh, and the other is a thoroughly Welsh and well-beloved bishop. The mission is to remind each of the importance of sticking together. Mark asks for and receives Brother Cadfael as companion and translator on his traversals. On the way they meet a young woman, Helleth (sorry, I can't find the spelling online), who is the daughter of a canon who wants her out of the way. The same night as a liegeman of Prince Owine's rebellious brother Cadwallader bisits the prince's court and is thereafter murdered, Helleth disapears and a horse with her.Jump to main plot. Mark, Cadfael and Helleth all wind up prisoners of the Dublin Danes that Cadwallader has hired to convince Owine to give him back his lands lost after one of his rebellions. Their captors treat them splendidly, and something seems to start up between the tall, robust, sexy Danish captain of the longship that captured Helleth and Cadfael and Helleth herself. As the struggle between Danes, Owine's Welsh and Cadwallader's Welsh goes through a series of broken oaths, sneakiness, ill-considered loyalties, and efforts by Mark at diplomacy, Helleth and the Dane are ever in the background making googoo eyes ever-so-subtly at each other. Meanwhile the man who was supposed to marry Helleth is creeping about. I know, you are rooting for the Dane. Me too. Cadfael gets a few weeks off from sleuthing and just watches it all transpire.It may be that Cadfael fans will be disappointed, and perhaps this is why the novel was so hard for me to locate. I liked Helleth a lot, she was a refreshing female role. I also liked her Danish sweetie. It's a nice story of a woman who wants to choose her own mate. I suppose Peters made it a Brother Cadfael mystery so his fans would buy the book. After all, that's why I read it, though I liked her other novels I've read that were published under the name Edith Pargeter. I would say the adventure part of the novel is something Sharon Kay Penman could have done more with, but it's fine as a backdrop for the love story."},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"I am finding as I read these novels that Peters is not consistent. This one should not be labeled a mystery. Oh there is a body and early enough that one thinks a mystery is to be solved, but Cadfael certainly has no part in it, or so little at the begining that one thinks that Peters/Pargeter wanted to indulge in the aspects of the time period that she found more fascinating.Through 17 earlier adventurers we have warmed to Brother Cadfael and seen that his keen mind and his ability to be a deep study of human nature leads him to uncover man's basest nature, that of the murderer. Here in this novel we see that Cadfael still is an observer of humanity and history, but his skill set in solving crime is unneeded. Prince Owain and his brother Cadwaladr have a falling out. Cadwaladr is banished, in order to get back to his lands, he hires Dane raiders from Dublin, hence the title.Cadfael happens to be deep in Wales and far from Shrewsbury as a translator for his old protege, Brother Mark and immediately he is caught up on the edge of events. But the body and the murder have little to do with the Danes and the two princely brothers. Indeed at the end of the book, Peters just conveniently resolves it. What happened to the smart Cadfael who allowed me to read alongside his discoveries to solve the mystery too?"},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"THE SUMMER OF THE DANES, number 18 in this charming medieval series by the late Ellis Peters was my introduction. Stories have been told and characters set and it left many questions about what went before, maybe enough to set me to reading the entire series.An older style with long descriptions of the landscape of Wales and travels, which were beautifully done. Today's reader would do well to take it on a long flight where you have time to read and nowhere else to go.The murder is almost lost in the struggle between the participants and remains a mystery until the last pages.Nash Black, HAINTS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS"},{"Title":"The Summer of the Danes (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"I am glad to learn how the series started started.

In fact, I've spent more time preparing for exams with this book than my course textbooks. There's nothing about culture, history, or Latin food -- very little vocabulary either -- just pure grammar. It's of most use to elementary and intermediate students, but it makes an excellent reference for more advanced students too. The section on the subjunctive tense (my nemesis) is outstanding.

She always has qirky characters, fun storylines, and great chemistry between the main characters. This story was no different except...this time around things are a little hotter, and a little darker. These changes only show that Ms. Berg is a whole lot more talented in weaving a story that will have the reader glued to the pages.Angel Devlin is a \\"once bitten, twice shy\\" P.I. for the wealthy Palm Beach society crowd. She drives a red Jag, and lives above a dog grooming establishment. Oh she also wears a stiletto, Jimmy Choos, and nice clothes. She also has an ex-husband named Dagger Zane who took her to the cleaners when she finally divorced him. As if this was all not enough she is planning a gala ball for an Alzheimer's fundraiser (her mother has this disease) and has talked a rather reclusive man to host it at his estate. Why is this a problem? She has to keep him happy and march to his tune. That shouldn't be a problem but it becomes on once she appears on the radarscreen of Tom Donovan. Tom is big, bad, handsome and trouble! Of course when you add Dagger, and a secret that Tom wants to solve to the mix you have the making for a great story.Tom has a dark past and a mystery he has to solve. His father was acused of stealing a statue, and attacking the wife of his best friend. Of course he was killed during the commission of these crimes. Tom is out to prove that his father had not stolen anything, or attacked anyone. This leads him to his godfather the one person Angel has to dance to. He thinks he can use Angel to get to his godfather. What he doesn't expect is falling for the sexy Angel. Now he has to make a choice. Clear his father's name and find out the truth about what took place the night his father died. Or let the past lay and find love with Angel.This was a very fast read full of great characters, humor, and great chemistry between Angel and Tom. The storyline regarding Tom's past was very entertaining and the mystery was solved at the end of the story. This was a very good ending. Ms. Berg delivers on all counts with her latest effort. I highly recommend Ms. Berg for a great entertaining read!"},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"that there was a huge character development flaw? The heroine was emotionaly abused during a previous marriage, especially when it was time for sex. As a result, she has not been with anyone since, and the few times she's tried she's panicked to the point of running off. The first time with the hero, she does the same panic routine, but he chases after her, convinces her to come back to bed. Miraculously, she's fine after that and even manages to orgasm from penetration. I have to call foul. Nearly 10 years of fear and insecurity will not disappear from one pat on the head and \\"It's okay, you're not fridgid.\\" I can believe she'd go back to bed with him; I cannot believe she'd suddenly become some amazing sex goddess. I couldn't help but think that if the heroine's first marriage was really truly that awful, she wouldn't be able to shuck it off so easily.However, the rest of the book is a quick, fairly enjoyable read. The dialogue is usually good and Ms. Berg has a pretty cute turn of phrase here and there. There's also an interesting twist to the suspense plot. I don't think this will end up on any keeper shelves, but it's a good book for a day in the sun, or in front of a fire."},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"Angel Devlin is a tough PI who wears a stiletto concealed under her skirt and a combination lock on her heart. Ever since her divorce from knife wielding, Dagger Zane, the only men she's had eyes for are the adulterous husbands she's paid to follow by Palm Beach's high society dames. That is until she notices a handsome stranger following her from millionaire recluse, Holt Hudson's house, where Angel's been planning the charity ball of the season.Growing up on an alligator farm in the Everglades, Tom Donovan is no stranger to dangerous reptiles. But nothing has prepared him for his new position as Palm Beach's most interesting piece of gossip and millionaire bachelor extraordinaire. While he may have just inherited big bucks, Tom's not interested in designer digs. The only thing he wants is to find out the truth surrounding the night, twenty six years ago, when Holt Hudson shot and murdered Tom's cat burglar father, Chase Donovan. But whether he's interested or not, when a honey-blond bombshell PI picks his pocket, she also sets in motion the tumblers on both their hearts.Patti Berg's \\"I'm No Angel\\" has all the right pieces for a suspenseful romantic comedy, unfortunately on this story they just don't fall into place. The main characters' unbelievable and unrealistically quirky backgrounds were too much for this reader, making what should have come across as humorous read more like farce. The romance, while sizzling in the bedroom, felt contrived once Tom and Angel had their clothes back on, but the mystery did take a curve at the end. I'm recommending the only other Patti Berg story I've read, \\"Stuck On You\\" - its marginally better and made me smile.

I was a little surprised at the low reviews for it. I found it to be an engaging read with good character development and a good mystery line attached to the hero.Several of the other reviewers have outlined the plot so I'll skip another plot review. I felt Angel and Tom made a good couple with believable chemistry. I liked the fact that Berg added a couple of crotchety relatives to the mix. My biggest disappointment in the book came with Berg's lack of information on Alzheimers. Since much of the book focuses on the gala to benefit the disease I thought she missed the opportunity to 'sneak' in facts about the disease to educate the reader which in turn would have made the book a deeper read than normal for a romance book."},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"I enjoyed this book. Would give it a 3 1/2. This is pure romance. Patti Berg's style of writing is very easy to read. I liked both of the strong m/f characters in this book.

This is definitely romantic fluff with very likeable characters. Very quick to read & not a lot to try & sort out. A quick entertainment when you have a little time on your hands."},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"There were major flaws in this novel, but they were counter-balanced with some interesting plot devices.Angel Devlin is a PI who spies on stray spouses for the Palm Beach elite. In her spare time, she hangs with her rich friends at the hip Jazzz nightclub and plans fundraisers for Alzheimer disease research. Her ex, a knife-throwing houligan named Dagger Zane, traumatized her in the bedroom so badly she hasn't been able to have an intimate relationship since.Tom Donovan is a gator wrestler turned multi-millionaire overnight. He's in search of answers regarding his father's death and the theft of a one-of-a-kind statue. The source of his answers is only accessible through Angel Devlin.The set-up for this novel was intriguing, and the plot line had great potential. Berg took the search for your past scenario and gave it a decent twist or two. Unfortunately, it became predicatable about two-thirds into the book.There were problems with the physical relationship between Angel and Tom. First, and greatest, was Angel's sudden reversal from cold, frightened fish to steamy temptress. One night of gentle attention cannot undo years of trauma. Secondly, even if Angel's \\"on\\" switch could be flipped like that, this couple has unrealistic amounts of sex. One point in Berg's favor was that the sex scenes themselves were enjoyable.There was a lot of missed potential in this novel. The characters, while likeable, could have been better-rounded. Angel seems savvy as a PI, but everything was a little too convenient, especially when she did anything BUT blend in to her surroundings. Everyone in Palm Beach knew her, yet she was able to do her job and get paid the big bucks for it. Tom is charming in his way, but he doesn't seem too smart at times. I kept expecting him to charge in or DO more to dig up his past, or to use Angel's PI skills, but I was left wanting.I am giving this novel TWO stars. THREE stars is average, and this novel, while a fun read, was slightly below average. If you're looking for a slightly suspenseful, steamy story, go ahead and pick it up. If you're looking for something thought-provoking and/or containing a steamy, but realistic relationship between the characters, then move on."},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"I am a fan of Patti Berg's work, but I'm No Angel just about bored me into a deep sleep.

Putting fluff on top of a dark plot doesn't lighten the plot. It's like putting whipped cream on meatloaf. That doesn't turn it into dessert, just makes it more obvious they don't fit. As for humor, there's very little.I gave it two stars instead of one for what it could have been."},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"Okay I love mysteries, suspense novels, and of course, romance books. I read a wide gamut of stuff, and I've always liked Patti Berg's books, mostly for the humor and light-heartedness of her stories. But this latest is her best work to date. It has some of the steamiest bedroom scenes, but combines it with the humor and intrigue. What Janet Evanovitch did to the mystery novel, Patti Berg has done to the romance novel. Don't miss this one! I can't wait to read more about Angel!"},{"Title":"I'm No Angel","review":"For twenty-six years he has lived in shame due to the reported actions of his dead father. When Tom Donovan was four, apparently his dad's best friend Holt Hudson shot Tom's father six times. A few days later, his dad died in Tom's arms alone in the Everglades. Holt insisted that his best friend was a cat burglar who assaulted his wife. The police believed Holt, but Tom knows that wealth can buy plenty of silence and is positive that his godfather spread the money around.Tom sees private investigator Angel Devlin meeting with Holt. Afterward he follows her, which she observes. They talk and he pleads with her to help him, but she warns him to stay away from Holt as he is sponsoring an Alzheimer's fundraiser at his home. As Tom continues to seek the truth, he and Angel begin to fall in love, but his obsession overrides his heart so any future relationship seems impossible.I'M NO ANGEL is an entertaining romantic suspense thriller that centers on the need of an adult to understand the pivotal childhood event that shaped his current needs. The story line contains several delightful support characters including Tom's grandfather Pops, Holt, and through their eyes, Tom's parents and Holt's spouse. However, the tale hinges on the relationship between the lead couple as he struggles between love and a lifetime obsession to learn what really happened when Holt shot his father.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Cruising Guide to the New England Coast","review":"While the cover for this book says 'Updated' and is labeled 12th edition, it appears to be a 2002 printing of a 1990 copyrighted texted. It describes the use of GPS briefly and refers to 'when it works, it is okay'. Obviously the comment predates the bombing raids on Bagdad. The description of harbors is little changed from a 1978 printing but having visited some of these harbors in 2004, I found the names, phone numbers and parts of the onshore facilities' descriptions totally out of date.

After her parents are killed when she is very young she is raised by Osraed Bevol (make sure you tab the pronunciation page at the back!).She is raised to seek the Meri, who is an omniscient god like being, to seek her out and worship. But she is fought at every corner because of her gender and stubbornness. After several trials she is allowed to go on Pilgrimage to seek the Meri and must complete several challenges along the way and must also learn about herself and discover that she may not be the only girl to ever follow the path the Meri.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I received this book through LibraryThing's Early Reader giveaway. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It was one that was almost impossible to put down. In fact I wouldn't let myself put it in my purse like I normally do when going to work for fear that I would pull it out and read it at my desk!I was captivated by the story from the first few pages all the way through the end, and then some (I also read the teaser chapter for the second book at the end). I will definitely purchase this title in print as well as the other 2 that are in the works.I loved that Meredydd was a very strong and independent character who kicked butt when needed and was also compassionate and everything that you wish for in a good protagonist.I would easily recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Meri","review":"I read this novel when it first came out many years ago, and I remember it to this day. It begins unusually, the voice is fresh, the context is still a new take on a classic fantasy journey. The transcendent stuff particularly pleased me. A religious book that isn't about religion."},{"Title":"The Meri","review":"The Meri involves a young woman, Meredydd, going on a religious journey. She is the only female magic student. The rest of men. She must go on a pilgrimage to find the Meri, a mythical being.The book is decent. Bohnhoff doesn't develop any of the other characters, which makes it hard to care about anyone else."},{"Title":"The Meri","review":"Meredydd is an orphan, and the only female student at the prestigious school Halig-liath. At Halig-liath, young men -- and Meredydd -- are trained to become Osraed, which are magician-priests something along the lines of Druids. Female magic is feared and distrusted in this world, and when Meredydd is falsely accused of witchcraft, the elders decide to send her on Pilgrimage to meet the Meri, a goddess-like figure who serves as a connection between humans and God. The Meri will be the final judge of whether Meredydd is fit to be an Osraed, and the elders are divided on whether they want her to succeed or fail.What follows is a quest tale and a spiritual journey in which Meredydd treks toward the Sea to meet the Meri, encountering a series of tests along the way. These are the kinds of tests that aren't what they appear on the surface; the obvious dilemma in each situation is almost never the part that's actually the test, and the goal isn't exactly what Meredydd thinks it is. Interwoven with this is the theme of men's magic being revered while women's magic is feared and reviled; it's hardly a new theme, but it works.It's clear from early on that there's a secret about the nature of the Meri herself, and it's pretty obvious to the reader exactly what that secret is. In fact, it becomes frustrating that it never even occurs to Meredydd as a possibility, though it's absolutely vital to the plot that she not realize it. Readers, however, will be trying to shout it through the pages!The Meri was slightly rough going for me at first, both because of this issue and a few smaller ones. Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff lets her narrative get bogged down in philosophical musings at times, especially at the very beginning. She also occasionally uses a \\"ye olde\\" spelling of a common word when it's not necessary, such as \\"backstere\\" for baker, \\"Cyne\\" for King, and \\"cleirach\\" for cleric. The meaning usually becomes clear shortly thereafter through context, but in the meantime the reader has been momentarily thrown out of the story and is wondering what a \\"backstere\\" is, when just using \\"baker\\" would have resulted in a smoother read and wouldn't have detracted any from the medieval feel of the book.Bohnhoff earned respect from me in the way she wrapped it up at the end, though. She takes Meredydd's self-doubt, which she had been building up throughout the novel, and rolls it into a compelling \\"dark night of the soul\\" as Meredydd finally reaches the Sea and awaits the Meri's arrival and judgment. Then, when the observant reader's guess about the Meri's nature turns out to be true, Bohnhoff doesn't belabor the revelation with a big infodump. She just briefly confirms it -- in a beautiful, touching scene -- and then moves on with the story, as if to say, \\"Yes, I already told you this, if you were paying attention.\\" And Meredydd faces one final test, one final choice: whether to act in vengeance or in mercy toward someone connected to her parents' murders.The Meri is readable but unspectacular overall, and Meredydd is a likable character who deals with a lot of insecurity but is always out to do the right thing. It's worth a try if you like the \\"priestess struggles against sexism\\" type of fantasy novel. Just be prepared for the protagonist to miss the obvious for a long time. The second book in the series is called Taminy and deals with a highly intriguing character mentioned in The Meri, and I think it's likely that I'll seek it out, as what we saw of Taminy in this book has my curiosity piqued."},{"Title":"The Meri","review":"I soooooo Identified with Meredydd, the heroine....

Then she returned to her hometown and discovered Cam Osborne--a gorgeous small town sheriff straight out of her dreams. He was everything she wanted in a man, but he'd sworn off commitment. And although she tried to steer clear of the handsome lawman, Cam was impossible to resist. Avowed loner Cam liked his bachelor lifestyle--until he butted heads with the lovely school teacher over her law-breaking grandmother. Sweet Hallie with her down home values was a lady worth chashing. Only problem was, Hallie was the kind of woman a man married, and Cam wasn't looking for a wife...was he?"},{"Title":"Sheriff Takes A Bride (Family Matters) (Silhouette Romance)","review":"Please, please ignore the summary at the back of this book. It does not do the story justice. I had had this book in my queue for over 3 years and the summary always turned me off. But I finally forced myself to read it and I'm glad that I gave it a chance.Her grandmother just gotten arrested for making moonshine and now, Hallie Cates had to go and bail out her only relative from the clink. But what kind of person would arrest a 69-year-old lady? Sheriff Cam Osborne. That's who. Disillusioned, personally and professionally, he was hoping to start over without anyone complicating his life. But when the feisty redhead came storming into his jail, he knew that his life was about to change.This is what I loved about the Silhouette Romance line. This was such a sweet, uncomplicated story that has all the elements that made this such a relaxing read. There was a nice balance of conflict, characters and romance that the plot was not overwhelmed. There was always a presence of a comedic air that helped lighten the atmosphere. All the side characters were just lovable. They were quirky and fun and had great dialogues. However, the stars of the show were obviously the main characters. Hallie was not worried about her biological clock. All she really wanted was to find the perfect guy to have children with and it didn't matter when. She was more concerned about her grandmother than hunting for a man. Cam had his own issues and it got in the way of their relationship. Luckily, he was a great guy that wasn't all hang-up on his past. He was not afraid to go and humbled himself to Callie and admit he was wrong. The chemistry between these two were obvious and hot without them going farther than steamy kisses and embraces. I enjoyed reading their scenes and they were perfect complements to each other.I would like recommend for those who like to clean, sweet romances with smidgen of humor and drama thrown in altogether. If you are looking for passion, this might not be up your alley. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would probably not read this again but it was definitely worth reading at least once. So, if you can find it for cheap and need a filler book, give \\"Sheriff Takes a Bride\\" a chance."},{"Title":"The Wright Style: Re-Creating the Spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright","review":"This book takes a look at what makes Frank Lloyd Wright's designs still so popular today. The book itself is so gorgeous, focusing not just on the houses but also on the furnishings, which can be breathtaking! The photos were excellent and conveyed the feeling of really being there.I read three books about this architect this weekend, and this one was the most complete of them all. It gave me a peek into so many of his uniquely designed buildings and the furnishings and decorative arts that he created for them.Something I had never seen before: at the end of the book there is a catalog of items that can be purchased from different vendors. These are FLW reproductions, items inspired by FLW, and those &quot;in the style of FLW&quot;. These items range from furniture to rugs to lamps to fabrics and decorative items.On my &quot;tour&quot; of over 40 houses (designed by both Wright and his followers), I saw that all of the designs were simple ones, with natural colors and finishes, the buildings seeming to spring out of the earth. I saw the open flowing floor plans that are sheltered by overhanging, gently sloping roofs. Many of the places I &quot;visited&quot; had built-in furniture and fixtures.It was interesting to view all of the things that Wright designed for his homes....besides the items mentioned above, he also designed the windows (art glass), light fixtures, skylights, wall murals, and even the landscaping!Wright changed American architecture forever, resulting in open floor plans, multi-purpose rooms, naturally-lit spaces--- and showed us a different way of living."},{"Title":"The Wright Style: Re-Creating the Spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright","review":"This is a wonderful book: gorgeous color pictures with an informative and most insightful text. Far beyond a coffee table collection, this is a real contribution to understanding Wright, and American housing. Lind discusses the design ideas of a number of Wright's most famous or typical extant buildings. You get a good idea of the exhilarating play of light and space in his houses, and the real significance of such modern cliches as ranch-style, strip and corner windows, patio doors, and built-ins. Besides real insight into Wright's aesthetic, the book is notable for its unique coverage of 12 houses by Wright disciples, and appendices on interior arts and sources of reproductions. (Wright would be appalled, since he saw furnishings as uniquely integral and scaled to particular houses!) A &quot;dangerous&quot; book, it singlehandedly reawakened my interest in Wright's architecture. It may draw you, too, into learning more of Wright, and influencing your choice of home."},{"Title":"The Wright Style: Re-Creating the Spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright","review":"The book has many photographs an does a credible job of detailing each of them.

That being said there is a great reference of things Wright in the back of the book that is worth the price of admission alone."},{"Title":"The Wright Style: Re-Creating the Spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright","review":"All of the other customer reviews were extremely positive, and I would like to concur in their respective judgments.Wright's life was filled with controversy, and his work is subject to complex interpretation. Other authors, in my opinion at least, devote way too much book space to these matters; Lind, on the other hand, has done a masterful job in organizing the key elements of Wright's style (furnishings, usonians, etc&gt;) and gathering stunning, modern photographs that illustrate each.If you buy one book on Wright, this should be the one. Better than anything else I've seen, it will demonstrate why the man's work lives on -- 45 years after his death."},{"Title":"The Wright Style: Re-Creating the Spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright","review":"This is a beautiful coffee table book, and for this price, it's well worth it.

The whole book is filled with actual recorded question-and-answer conversations between one of India's greatest saints and various people who came to him seeking spiritual insights. The conversations are recorded so vividly that you feel like you are actually there in the room with the people in the story, listening to the words of a great saint.Sri Ramakrishna emphasized that the goal of life is to realize the truth, and that all religions can lead to the same God. He also explained that the only thing separating us from God, whom he defines as the very essence of knowledge, love, and selflessnes, is our own ignorance. Using beautiful stories and parables, he explains how to go beyond this ignorance to realize our true unity with God and with all living beings.For non-Indians, such as myself, the extensive glossary in the back is very helpful in explaining the meanings of Hindu terminology.

An all time spiritual classic!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"With Ramakrishna, the custom started, that disciples write down every word of a guru and publish it in a book. However troublesome that usually is, in the case of Ramakrishna it was a great blessing to mankind. Ramakrishna was a god-man with deepest spirtual insights, and an enormous richness of spritual diversity. At the same time, in this book, human ascpects are shown as well. The book does not pretend a perfect world or a perfect Ramakrishna. The time one invests into spiritual development is obvously lost from investing into other things, like presentig oneself in an optimized way. I'm sure, Ramakrishna wore no tie and would fail in a modern management school. This is no joke, because many people do not beleive certain enlightend people, because they behave not quite propperly according to social standards. A reader of this Gospel has to be prepared to be confronted with a strange, but extremely spritual, environment."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"This is truly the best spiritual book I have ever read.

Yet the simplicity of Sri Ramakrishna's teachings are ever more relevant for the new Millenium. They span the full range of human religious and spiritual thought and philosophy."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"This book is a diary of the author's experience in the presence of Sri Ramakrishna 125 years ago. To the modern mind, Ramakrishna would seem like a schizophrenic or epileptic but after reading this book and hearing his explanations of Hindu concepts you realize that although he had no formal education he was a very knowledgeable and loving man. I love that he always says - do not follow anything I say blindly, work it out for yourself, take what's useful to you and leave the rest. He says a lot of people forget to do this where religion is concerned. They don't assimilate the information - they just repeat the pretty words.His relationship to Narendra, who later was known as Vivekananda, is an awesome love story. Very beautiful. My favorite part was when Ramakrishna asked Narendra a significant question about God and Narendra says, &quot;I'm currently studying the views of the atheists.&quot; He was completely able to be himself with Ramakrishna and Ramakrishna loved him for it. He didn't have to put on a &quot;holy-holy&quot; act with Ramakrishna. They didn't have any of that you'd better obey and agree with everything I say attitude going on.Something that struck me as interesting is I think the author added some comments in the 1940's while translating the book to English. The events took place near Calcutta, India in 1885 but there are statements describing the connection to God as being like having the gas company hooked up to your house. Did they have a gas company in Calcutta, India in 1885? There are other statements relating peoples beliefs in the righteousness of their religion to everyone thinking his watch has the correct time. Were watches a widespread item in India in 1885? I don't particularly think so... But the allegories work.I don't agree with everything Ramakrishna says. For instance, I don't believe bhakti or devotional religion is the key for this day and age. I think you should keep your bhakti a personal thing tucked away in your heart otherwise you'll wind up looking like a nut. I don't agree with worshipping the divine as a parental figure. I think it adds to the emotional immaturity that we already experience - but I'm glad Ramakrishna mentions other modes of relating to God and acknowledges their validity. I also don't believe that bliss is an important factor in anyone's relationship to God. Hell with the availability of street drugs today - bliss is just down the alley. But joy - joy is something different. You can't find real joy in a pill or in a drink.Towards the end of his life things get a little weird. It's almost as if someone else has taken over his body or something. He starts emphasizing being a paramahansa (incarnation of God) and expounding on how paramahansas and ishvarakotis (pure souls) are different from everyone else. It really doesn't seem to follow how he used to talk before that. Plus he starts letting yes-men, like that Ghirish Ghosh guy, hang around. I didn't like that part but it happened so what can you do?So, whether you agree with what Ramakrishna says or not, you can't help but love and respect him after reading this book. It's a very intimate encounter with a man totally devoted to God and you gotta respect his honesty and willingness to be himself no matter what anyone else thought."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"This book is very popular with spiritual people and is beyond words.

Ramakrishna in concert with this said, &quot;Man is born to no purpose having been given the rare privilege of being born a man, is unable to realize (become one with) God in this lifetime.&quot;.The Gospel of Ramakrishna, written by his devotee &quot;M&quot;, is one of the most wonderful spiritual books ever written.

Written by one of his closest disciples, this book gives account of Ramakrishna's beginning; his path to Self-Realization; his way of living in the highest states of consciousness while relating to the world. This book may be the most comprehensive offering on the life of Sri Ramakrishna."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is truly one of the spiritual treasures of the ages. It contains over 1,000 pages of dialogue capturing the words and essence of a man beloved not only in India but around the world as a pure expression of the divine. While the comparison may seen blasphemous to some, imagine the Gospels of Jesus recorded in faithful and impeccable detail with conversations enlarged upon ten times over, this will give the reader an idea of the content of this wonderful book. My own experience of reading this work is that it has immeasurably enriched my own spiritual quest. The mere act of reading the book has taken me many times to beautifully deep meditative states but each reader will have his own experience. I can only encourage the serious student to open her or his heart to its pages it could be the beginning of the most wonderful journey."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is simply a great work. Based on a journal maintained by one of Ramakrishna's ardent disciples, this is truly a jewel. Credit must also go to Swami Nikhilananda for masterful translation. This 1000 page classic with densely packed text would have been a challenge to read if not for the wisdom and the way the wisdom is presented.It's been so well journaled that it's like getting into a time machine and going back in time to around 1870s to Bengal and meeting spiritual giants such as Ramakrishna, Vivekananda. This book has so much reference to Narendra who went on to become Swami Vivekananda. Here we get to see how Narendra evolved and what challenges he faced.All in all a great classic and readable anytime.

It encourages the reader to be steadfast in his spiritual quest and gives the reader hope and guidance in the spiritual path.This book is based on a journal maintained by one of Ramakrishna's close disciple, M. The clarity of explanations and the allegory used by this great master to teach simple spiritual truths is indeed outstanding, to say the least. It gives the uninitiated reader a simple understanding of complex spiritual philosophy. The parables told by Ramakrishna in this book can also be compared to the usage of parables by Jesus as well.Finally, I wish to state that this book is highly recommended to all sincere seekers of Truth, whether he/she is a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or belonging to any different sects or religious groups. This book unites ALL faiths!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"This book is a masterpiece of Truth and Light. You cannot put a price on it!

He realized that he was divine. Not many people are able to do this at any one time. Yet they are available to all who seek such a one. You can do it too. Never see him as just another person. He is special, He is divine, He is the Holy One. If you read this book with a sincere heart, and a pure mind, you too will realize these and other truths. This book is not for none- believers. It is a rare blessing to read such a book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"Ramakrishna is / was a spiritual superman, as the book clearly illustrates, through this biographical account by one of his disciples who knew him personally.Anyone interested in spirituality, in deepening their own direct experience of God, unbelievers, skeptics and scientists, should all read this book, because it proves that the limit of any one person's experience is not the limit of the Universe. Every person is capable of such unique and different experiences and perspectives that it defies belief.The most important message which I take from this biography of a spiritual superhero, is that every one of us experience exactly according to our convictions. If you are a scientific materialist, that is all you will ever experience, unless and until you change your convictions, of course. If you are an atheist, you cannot know God. You will only experience the dry, barren grounds of your atheism. If you believe in good and evil, you will personally encounter both. If you have a personal conviction in the existence of God, then you cannot fail to encounter Him in all things.So, if all of us are capable of such divine, ecstatic experiences and incomparable happiness, why would we confine ourselves only to dry scientific \\"facts\\"? Or to materialism? Doing so is like living the life of a maggot. Each of us is capable of so much more: each of us can soar like an eagle. If you don't want to experience the life of a maggot, all you need to do is to change your convictions: your belief system. And all of this comes from a documentary video known as \\"The Secret\\", which illustrates very clearly that each person can only know according to his or her personal convictions. I encourage you to find and watch that video. Then read Ramakrishna's biography, showing you what is possible for you too.God is to be regarded as nearer and dearer to you than your own self: that, combined with your own conviction that He really exists, will lead you to experience Him directly. This is Ramakrishna's message. Why would you want to do that? Because of the incomparable, indescribably meaningful life that this will bestow on you. Be an eagle, not a scientific maggot. Why would any sane person confine himself to the latter?There are at least two biographies of Ramakrishna available from the Amazon Kindle Store. The other one is the Western perspective created by Christopher Isherwood, in \\"Ramakrishna and his disciples\\". For the absolute newbie to Eastern mysticism, this may be a better book to start off with, than the current account which assumes a lot of background understanding from the reader, as if though you are a Hindu. After all, the current account was written by an Indian, steeped from birth in the Hindu scriptures. Isherwood, a westerner who lived for many years in California, on the other hand, provides a sufficiently detailed background to make perfect sense of it all. The result is not at all boring, but actually totally absorbing.The other very important message of the Ramakrishna books, including the one under review, is that all religious approaches are equally valid. God can be experienced in the form of Father, Mother, friend, child, animal, a seemingly inanimate stone object (which can bring forth the living Form residing in it), or as the formless Source of the Universe. All these different experiences are equally valid. Christianity is not more, or less valid, than Hinduism, and ditto for Buddhism, Islam, and any other religious path the human mind is capable of encountering. It is a question of personal temperament, where you are in your own life's path right now, preference and personal capacity. In God's world there is a place for every sentient being, and His name is not only Jesus.How does Ramakrishna illustrate that all religious approaches are equally valid? Through his own direct experiences, which defy belief, logic, science and head knowledge of all kinds. That is what makes the current book so incredible, and Isherwood's account too: The pages burn with direct supernormal spiritual experiences and deep conviction, which cannot easily be found in most other books on the subject."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"Amazingly detailed account of daily life of the Master and each moment is pure wisdom.

Nikhilananda. This book is filled with the life, bhakti, and jnana of Ramakrishna. It has hundreds of parables and discourses which the Master gave to his disciples and visitors. Ramakrishna explains the abtruse aspects of Vedanta with great lucidity and such simplicity that even a child will be able to understand it. Yet, after each reading, as the reader grows more in Vedanta, a deeper meaning emerges within his words. Unlike the more technical language of the Upanishads, and more like that of the Bhagavad Gita, the Gospel of Ramakrishna is Vedanta in flesh."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna","review":"Sri Ramakrisna was the 9th incarnation of Vishnu. He praticed many religious paths because in the end he saw God (not to be confused with just the male aspect) He was also a Tantric and he was a very open minded annd ecclectic man. He served as a priest in the Dakashineswar Kali temple in Calcutta India. He was a priest of Kali. He died of lung cancer. In this gospel there is history about the man-god Sri Ramakrishna and his teachings. Although I personally dont agree 100 percent on everything he said, not because he was wrong or right, its because I have my own beliefs. But his teachings are very much alive today as they were back then. His teachings are spiritually uplifting. Im attracted to him because I had some of his experiences and if he were alive today in the flesh he would totally understand where Im comming from. This is a book I wont ever give away. Ever."},{"Title":"Habits of Hope: A Pragmatic Theory (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"Dr. Shade has written an engaging book about the importance of hope that is itself hopeful, an extended meditation on the practical side of a phenomenon that offers the promise of what he calls &quot;conditioned transcendence.&quot; Transcendence can be an intimidating thing to ponder, not easily pinned by a definition. But Peter Ackroyd helpfully reconstructed it in &quot;The Plato Papers&quot; as &quot;trans-end-dance: the ability to move beyond the end, otherwise called the dance of death.&quot; Shade's approach moves beyond the hypothetical end of unredeemed despair and mortality by offering real insight into the conditions of effective hopefulness. But he invites us to join a dance that has more to do with the processes of living, and of fashioning the total human environment to meet life's ongoing dynamic of adaptation, perseverance, and hard-won growth, than with any slow or ritual reconciliation to finality. The quest for transcendence is ultimately a dance of life, and the perpetually renewable resolve to remake a world not yet entirely hospitable to our aspirations. &quot;The more hopeful are those whose habit of hopefulness is more deeply rooted, forming a more stable part of their characters such that it is less likely to wax and wane with changing circumstances.&quot; Shade draws astutely here on the American philosophical tradition of pragmatism, the tradition of Peirce, Dewey, William James, and (more recently) Cornel West. If there is anything we humans know well, it is the precarious nature of our circumstances; and if there is a practical emphasis in philosophy more instrumental than the pragmatists' emphasis on habit, it would be a difficult case to make. &quot;The enormous fly-wheel of society,&quot; James called the mechanism by which we store (and thus cease having to think constantly and consciously about) those patterns and routines that carry us securely through our days. But a mechanism that can sustain constructive and even transcendent hopefulness in the fact of ignorance, poverty, fear, cruelty, disaffection, and all their attendant social and personal ills requires patient, concerted, trans-generational efforts at amelioration; Shade says it requires habits of persistence, courage, and resourcefulness. &quot;A pragmatic hope . . . provide[s] us a resource for facing complicated problems whose solutions are not obvious or within immediate reach. A pragmatic hope is thus itself a source of hope.&quot; With his innovative account of the life of hope, gathering insight not only from the usual suspects familiar to students of pragmatic philosophy but from figures as diverse as Victor Frankl, John Steinbeck, Sherwin Nuland, and Stephen King as well, Shade has indeed created a rich philosophical resource that deserves our most thoughtful attention."},{"Title":"The Methods and Materials of Demography, Second Edition","review":"Another review displayed here refers to the 1st edition, which was published in 1976.

Generally sound and providing the high quality expected, with several new topics covered very well. Special mention should be made of the very useful additional material on health issues. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the chapter on race and ethnicity which is already well out of date, focuses on US material on race and provides very little by way of useful or factual information on ethnicity. The information about international practices seriously thin and is badly flawed, despite some valuable comments which seem to have sneaked in. Why on earth for such a central reference work did the editorial board not find an ethnicist to co-author this chapter at the very least - this chapter is a sad and jumbled disappointment with little understanding of the topic and it misses entirely key issues and concepts such as ethnic mobility and the role of paternity effects. A quick look through the reference list for the chapter reveals the source of this lack of depth and lack of discussion of key issues - the primary research is nowhere to be seen and it depends far too heavily and uncritically on official US census publications. The appendix on GIS is welcome but is already also starting to date, as would be expected for such a fast moving area. Despite these short-comings, still a most welcome book and tremendous value for the price. Well bound and well printed, and the editors need to be complimented on a very high quality publication."},{"Title":"The Methods and Materials of Demography, Second Edition","review":"The other review displayed here for the Methods and Material of Demography refers to the 1st edition, published in 1976.

The authors calculate a growth rate of 1.99% per annum but it should be closer to 2.01% per annum (rounded to two decimal places).The authors assume a starting population of 118,002,706, with a predicted target population of 146,825,475 after 11 years of growth at the given rate of 1.99% (this was in fact 0.019867 rounded to two decimal places).Using a 1.99% per annum growth rate The Methods and Materials of Demography prediction fails. Their calculation results in a population of 146,563,381 people, not 146,825,475 people - this is a huge difference of 262,094 people.Using a 2.01% per annum growth rate my prediction succeeds. My calculation results in a population of 146,825,457 people, not 146,825,475 people - this is a difference of only 18 people, which is entirely due to rounding of the growth rate.So what is the cause of their error?The authors formula is r = ln [ P(t+n) / P(t) ] / nIt should be ln (r) = ln [ P(t+n) / P(t) ] / nFor older readers, remember at school when you used log tables or slide rules to multiply two numbers together? First you convert the two numbers to logarithms. Then you add the two logarithms together. Or for a division such as this you would subtract one logarithm from the other. Then you need to convert the resulting logarithm back into a real number. Essentially, the authors forgot the last step. The right hand side of the equation here only gives you the natural logarithm of the annual growth ratio, and not the annual growth rate at all.The actual annual growth ratio is found by expressing the number e to the power of 0.019867 = 1.020066The growth rate itself is then 1.020066 - 1 = 0.02006 which gets rounded to 2.01%I know it's picky, but it is important as this book was used as an authoratitive source by organisations such as the US Census Bureau.I did enjoy the authors' speculation on the nature of exponential growth:\\"In this sense the term 'exponential growth' is a redundancy; all growth is exponential by our measure of growth as a proportionate rate of change in population size. When people use the term 'exponential growth' they are often (but not invariably) referring to a sequence produced by a constant positive growth rate within some interval.\\"Right on."},{"Title":"The Methods and Materials of Demography, Second Edition","review":"An old edition.

It would probably be something along the lines of Ellen Wright's beautiful book. Photographer Tom Eckerle's gorgeous pictures show off the natural beauty of The Hamptons as well as the artful arrangement of Wright's mostly casual home-style food. Many of the seasonally arranged menus feature old-fashioned dishes and none of the recipes could be mistaken for haute cuisine. Wright unabashedly uses baking mix and iceberg lettuce and wouldn't dream of asking you to make mayonnaise from scratch. Her philosophy is that inviting someone into your home for a meal is not about impressing them with your 4-star cuisine, but about making them feel comfortable and appreciated and well-fed. She reminds us that good food, lovingly prepared, an attractive setting and pleasant company are the hallmarks of gracious entertaining. She obviously is doing something right as James Beard and Tom Brokaw are but two of the luminaries who have graced her table and sung her praises. In an era of knock-your-socks-off culinary one-upmanship, Ellen Wright is a voice of gracious good sense. Relax, drop the pretense and enjoy entertaining again.

Though the menus were rather homely for what I would expect, I rarely give complicated artsy-fartsy gourmet affairs more than a second glance; so in all fairness, this cookbook was just the thing for me, simple and practical, yet elegant--something I might cook from if I could bear to get it dirty. The photography is delightful; half the pictures contain hidden messages, half again of which you probably imagined after catching the first. I might sound like a paranoid schizophrenic doing book reviews for a psychotherapy assignment, but hey, the author and her husband once worked in the white House, be smart! Is that a \\"yankee pumpkin\\" far left in the Halloween spread? Native New Englanders know what the frustrated redcoats, far away from their ladies, did with THOSE during the revolutionary war. Towards the end of the book is a bizarre photo with a scrabble board center stage. The facing plaque spells: \\"THERFBI.\\" WHO?!? Pretty spicy stuff here. The pictures could use some captions, though...er. Back to the recipes themselves, I would say they are about average quality-Wise. I should warn you I must have UpWards of seven hundred cookbooks, am a fairly accomplished cook myself, and can often tell a good recipe at glance without making it, so my assessment of \\"Bridgehampton Weekends\\" cookability might be a bit Off. There were a few off-beat offerings like \\"white House Saltines\\" I appreciated. But I couldn't give it my best thumbz up with things like angel food cakes calling for all-purpose flour and stock made with bouillon, not even as substitute ingredients. Not in the Hamptons--well, perhaps; maybe they always eat out there! (Or maybe there's something more than meets the eye here, too; gotta remember the Hamptons are a place of intrigue, murder, and mayhem!)

Not really a disappointment, since I expected this crap from other such accounts I have suffered through."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"The stark realities of World War II need no embellishment, but do require explanation to be more than numbing accounts of dramatic events in an increasingly remote and unfamiliar era. In \\"The Good Soldier,\\" Alfred Novotny focuses on the sometimes brutal, often sad, but always revealing events of his wartime experiences, wrapped meaningfully and engrossingly within the context of the rest of his life.Growing up in a working class Austrian Socialist family during the depression era, at 14, Novotny learned something of the brighter side of life in his work as an apprentice server in an exclusive Vienna restaurant. Before long, Novotny found himself drafted into the German Labor Service and ultimately, the German Army's most elite division.Novotny's images of military life and war are at once haunting and full of vitality. He describes the fiercely demanding training he received in the recruit depot of the \\"Grossdeutschland\\" Panzer-Grenadier Division during which two of his fellow trainees committed suicide. In his foxhole at the front, he is joined by a brand-new replacement who has barely uttered his name in greeting before he is immediately blown to pieces by a Soviet artillery shell. Sent home on leave after being wounded, the author is reunited with some old friends from the restaurant, one of whom has lost a hand in combat, another an arm, and another both legs. Novotny tastefully and humorously recounts the intense drive of the life force in fleeting moments of lovemaking that occur amidst the desperation and deprivation of war. That same will to survive despite bloodthirsty lice and other parasites (including the tapeworm he unknowingly hosted through two years of combat) carried him through years of hard labor amid the squalor, disease, and lethal environment of a Soviet prison camp after the war.Those seeking a professionally rendered treatise on tactics or strategy will not find it here, although in my opinion, the Aberjona Press has recently produced some of the finest of that genre that are currently in print. However, what makes \\"The Good Soldier\\" unusually valuable is not only its depth of life-perspective and unusual personal detail, but its exceptional and perhaps unintentional portrayal of how an especially elite formation was forged and sustained from average draftees. This is not another story about daring airborne volunteers, or highly-motivated rangers, or carefully selected commandos. Neither is it the story of an average unit with typical experiences. All of those are interesting and useful, but none are as fascinating as this story about a young Viennese waiter becoming a good soldier in an exceptional and world-renowned military unit. This unique outcome was the result of a process that is little understood and often ignored. Yet is was exactly this process, and not the extremist politics or lunatic racism of the Third Reich, that made the Wehrmacht so formidable. As only a product of that process can, Fred Novotny honestly, forthrightly, and authentically provides an unsurpassed glimpse into that transformation that produced so many \\"good soldiers.\\""},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"I am fortunate to know Fred...or so I thought. His soft Austrian accent adds so much to his saga. His ever present awkward gait that has been with him like so many memories I now understand. Always sincere, pensive and with an instrospective intensity he writes as he speaks.It's not history retold from the 'other side's' perspective that redefines ones attitude. It's that one is reading what amounts to the diary of an Austrian German boy soldier in Hitler's army whose purpose was the exact opposite of every Allied soldier who told their story. Thousands of 'good soldiers' spent horrible periods of time in battle, in hospitals, as prisoners in war camps, or sadly prisoners of their own minds and memories. Novotny's only bitterness is aimed not at his military foes and blended with purposeful stealth into the late stage of his book.The unabashed honesty of Fred's story is compelling and civilian as well as military. As a young waiter before being drafted he describes how he and several coworkers essentially steal some famous salami. They get found out, each slapped in the face and Novotny gets three weeks in the potato cellar. Like the rest of his story there is no faux remorse. He relates the salami saga because it says something about him; what that means he leaves to the reader.In a 'dacha' in Russia they find an American Gramophone and one 78rpm record. Schockingly it happens to be one of his favorites, \\"Stormy Weather\\". This eventual American Austrian loved Harry James and Louis Armstrong.Describing how that left leg was wounded he mentions that there were 8 other bullets hitting his equipment including his helmet he didn't get far enough into the hole he was digging. Many a 'hero'have conjured up details of great bravery. Fred says, \\"Someone was looking out after me.\\" Honesty and heroism make strange bedfellows.Speaking of strange bedfellows perhaps the most revealing tale in the book is Novotny's remembrance of his encounter with a young woman which he pleads as \\"another incident of love in war\\". It cannot be retold with any more seriousness or hilariousness than what you read in the book. This example of sheer determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles may be the best description of Fred's will and he did it almost all by himself.Toward post war Germany he levels this paraphraed pointed observation: to those who fought your war you gave two free street car tickets to take us to officials, two 15 cent cigarette packages, find your own job, help yourself, and your mental problems are your own. A troubling and revealing view.What Fred says is crystal clear and what he means is craftily expressed. It would be difficult for any reader to close this book with the same mindset with which it was opened."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is the memoirs of Austrian WWII soldier Fred Novotny. The book's introduction starts off with the proverbial Chinese curse &quot;May you live in interesting times!&quot; Novotny certainly had his share of &quot;interesting times&quot; and it is a tribute to his resilience and fundamental goodness of character that he manages to come out all right in the end with his dignity, humanity and sense of humor intact. This is a story of overcoming great adversary with a happy ending.Unlike most WWII memoirs, which begin suddenly in 1939 and end abruptly in 1945, &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; spans practically Novotny's entire lifetime. It begins with his childhood in Socialist Vienna, and continues without respite through the Anschluss, his service in the German Labor Service (RAD) and as a machine gunner with the elite&quot;GrossDeutschland&quot; armored infantry division, his postwar years in a Soviet prison camp, his return to freedom and eventual emigration to the USA, where he ultimately finds peace and personal success.The book isn't full of &quot;combat erotica&quot; but there are enough anecdotes to get a good sense of what life in the Third Reich was like and how terrible war and the postwar peace could be. The RAD experiences in particular are very interesting, since there is little information published in English about this German paramilitary organization.Novotny's descriptions of life as a &quot;GrossDeutschland&quot; soldier and the Soviet penal system are fascinating as well. The reader will doubtless be amazed at Novotny's good fortune through some pretty grim situations - as he was himself!Although only 150-odd pages, &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is packed with photos, drawings and editor's notes that help the reader get a real sense of Novotny's experiences in the context of the general sweep of WWII history.It's a fast but satisfying read.

Despite this, his memoire is refreshingly candid and written with surprising humor, given the ordeals he suffered as a \\"good soldier\\"in WWII and the subsequent imprisonment by the Soviets for 2 1/2 years after the wars end.His emigirant experiences in the US again reveal the resiliency that sustained his survival of war and prison, and led, I was happy to read, to success as a restauranteur in the American mid-west. It is however, the cautionary message in the very last pages of his book that set this survivor's tale apart for me. He warns the reader against being seduced by militaristic patriotic propaganda in our own times. He muses, \\"I still wonder how it all happened...this orgy of killing\\" and wonders if the world has learned from the experience, and answers his own question with a chilling \\"No.\\""},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"A very brief bio, but some amazing insights, and even a rare photo or two of a Knight's Cross winner whom the author served with.

Alfred Novotny's readable and engaging biography takes the reader on a journey with an ordinary man who, like tens of millions of others, had their lives changed beyond recognition and endured profound traumas from 1939 to 1945.Novotny's detailed description of his training with the Grossdeutschland Division and his stark, intense picture of battle on the Eastern Front make &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; a useful reference from a military-scholarship viewpoint. However, as a personal narrative, the book will also be a fascinating read for the general reader, because Novotny successfully blends into his narrative the story of his life from his working-class childhood home in politically unstable 1930s Vienna, and his early and hopeful employment in a famous Vienna hotel -- all of which was interrupted by the call to arms. (&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; will appeal to readers interested in English-language material about Austrians' experiences in the Wehrmacht.)Millions of defeated German and German-allied soldiers were marched to Soviet prison camps in 1945; many never returned. Novotny's description of how they interacted with their captors and fellow prisoners from day to day -- in cruelty and, sometimes, with friendship -- illustrates this chapter of history without undue political polemic or judgement.This book is as much about the love of friends and family as the calamities of nations at war. I would recommend it for the general reader of history; it would also fit well into a high-school honors or college course on twentieth-century history."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"5 StarsFirst, this book is published by Aberjona Press. I will be totally honest with you. I've never read a bad WWII book published by this business. I highly encourage amazon.com readers to read other books published by this firm. WWII is their bread and butter in the publishing business. So, I had high hopes for this book and it delivers.The Good Soldier\\" is about memoirs of Germany Army WWII soldier Fred Novotny. The book's introduction starts off with the proverbial Chinese curse \\"May you live in interesting times!\\" (this reviewer hopes this does not happen to himself) Novotny certainly had his share of \\"interesting times\\". This is a story of overcoming great adversary with a happy ending.Unlike most WWII stories, which begin in 1939 and end in 1945, \\"The Good Soldier\\" is across Novotny's entire lifetime.

The reader will doubtless be amazed at Novotny's good fortune through some pretty grim situations - as he was himself!When you read about any German soldier who survived the war they all credited their military training but cursed it a the same time. The German military training made their average soldier equal to US Marines or Army Rangers.After the war Novoty's sent to work in a Soviet mine. He meets a woman and they have a brief encounter. The conditions in the mine are just as terrible as an prison. Novoty is released because the Soviets are trying to influence Austria political elections in the early cold war period.The book is about 150-odd pages but is full of photos, drawings and notes that help the reader get a sense of the writer's experiences in the general sweep of WWII history.I really enjoyed \\"The Good Soldier\\" and would recommend it to anyone interested in personal accounts of German soldiers in the Second World War.

In a concise and highly readable way the author thinks back six decades to see what he remembers after a long and dynamic life most of which has been spent in a very successful career in the hospitality industry. The central feature of this book however is his service in the elite Grossdeutschland Division in WW II. For two and one-half years he fought on the Eastern Front and although he provides an understanding of the basic savagery of this environment, he sees no healthy need for the endless repetition of the lurid details of exposed entrails. In fact, Novotny provides us with a broad picture of his military service including his training and various non-combat events. Once the war ended Novotny's unit was handed to the Soviets for imprisonment. Here he faced another challenge to his survival as he was delivered into forced labor in a coal mine in the Caucasus.By the end of the book Alfred Novotny has taught us not only what some German soldiers experienced but also how war affects all soldiers a lifetime later. He writes that the worst memories of the war, \\"leap to the forefront\\" of his mind \\"on occasions that are sometimes too many for my comfort, and too few for my conscience.\\" In his succinctness, Novotny has said a great deal about a big topic."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"Besides upgrading my knowledge of the WWII German \\"Landser\\" (the German equiv. of a GI) \\"The Good Soldier\\" gave me a better grasp of the pre-war life of Austrians and how simple it was for the Nazi regime to manipulate minds in the primitive media situation of the 1930's.Alfred Novotny ably describes his, and presumably many German soldiers' relationship to the enemy, to leadership and courage.There are some fantastic scenes like the one where the author enters a Ukranian hut with mud floor to find a gramophone with one of his favorite records: \\"Stormy Weather\\"! The details on equipment should be of particular interest to anyone into militaria and reenacting.Like the author I am amazed by his incredibly good fortune. One must be deeply affected when a bullet penetrates one's steel helmet, tearing off the helmet's rim but doesn't cause even a scratch on your scalp and later brand-new replacements are literally blown apart in front of you, again leaving you completely unscathed...at least physically...Although this book is basically on the platoon-level the author makes it clear in which ways his division, \\"Grossdeutschland\\", differed from others.I found Novotny's recollections of the effect of Soviet front-line propagaganda units particularly valuable.Novotny is equally convincing when he recounts his years as a slave-miner in Soviet Georgia. What does surprise me is that he is not turned into a hateful person by this experience.It is nice to find not only photographs of the author and mentioned equipment but also well-reproduced documents like the author's badge certificates."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"Not only does this book offer many fascinating details as a personal narrative, it sets up each chapter of Novotny's experiences with background information about what was going on during the war and with Germany's war effort in particular, setting the context and putting each phase of his story into better focus."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"If you really want to know what life was like for the German soldier on the Eastern Front then you have to read The Good Soldier.

This book is definately a must read."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"The very large number of typos and grammatical errors is unacceptable and irritating.That being said, this (very short) book is a collection of memories by a veteran of the \\"Grossdeutschland Division\\" (GD) that spans his youth in Austria, his duty in the Reichsarbeitsdienst, his fighting with the GD on the eastern Front from 1943 to 1945, his four years of internment in a Soviet POW camp and finally his immigration to and life in the USA. Each chapter of memories is preceded by valuable introductions which put Novotny's recollections in the larger context (Austria annexation, battles, GD regimental and divisional history, etc). That architecture, as well as the time period covered, are interesting and make this book very different fromThe Forgotten Soldierby Guy Sajer (another GD veteran). Also different from Sajer's is the large number of photos from the author as well as Novotny's military papers (\\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" does not have a single picture or military paper of Sajer).However, I found some statements seemingly contradictory. On the one hand, Novotny corroborates Sajer's accounts that the soldiers of even the elite GD division were frequently (1943 and later) starving and wearing ragged uniforms:-\\"we were always hungry\\" (p39)-\\"...food was becoming scarce. We were all starved\\" (p65)-\\"our uniform became rags' (p62)But on the other hand he praises the GD's logistics:-\\"There was no doubt about it: we were very well equipped and supplied. I found the supply system within the GD always to be trustworthy\\" (p42)-\\"...excellent equipment and supplies... We were part of something special indeed\\" (p76).Maybe it's just me, but I'm confused.On page 112 Novotny mentions \\"2 million who had fought under General Vlasov\\". That is absurd: Vlasov's \\"Russian Army of Liberation\\" had only one active unit, the 600th Infantry division, so around 20,000 men, and others in formation (Himmler's idea, grudgingly accepted by Hitler who despised Slavs). Vlasov's soldiers fought with the Germans on the Oder in April 1945 and against the Germans near Pilsen in early May 1945 (see p 182-183 and p 401 of Anthony Beevor'sThe Fall of Berlin 1945). Novotny, not unlike old Soviet official history, must have equated the numerous Russian Hiwis (\\"Hilfwillinge\\" or voluntary support workers) with \\"Vlasovtsy\\".Novotny's memoirs lack the pathos of \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" and are rather dry. Neither negative or positive: a question of taste."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"Reading Alfred Novotny's \\"The Good Soldier\\" brought back memories of my days living in Austria's economic depression in the 1930's, followed by seven years of Nazism and finally, nearly ten years of Soviet Communist occupation. Mr. Novotny's book drove home a realism that was all around me then. After such a long time we tend to forget the bad experiences of life, which is probably good. And yet, there is a danger in becoming complacent instead of assuring that for all of human kind they must not recur. I wish to thank Mr. Novotny for his brilliant account of what pain war inflicts and how only a few have the strength to survive it. Excellent reading to teach all of us that war is not an alternative."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"Personal accounts of the events leading up to WWII and of the suffering of those who took part in it as front line combat troops abound. This one, however, stands out for the sheer modesty of the author who, far from trying to over-dramatise things, in the hope of improving his sales chances, hands down a measured but, at the same time, very emotive account of his rich experiences from his childhood in Vienna, in the early thirties, until his release from Soviet captivity in the late forties and beyond, as an immigrant in the US. A genuine page-turner from an everyday hero who 'tells it like it was' and who comes through as somebody who managed to preserve his humanity, despite unimaginable adversities."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"This book is an outstanding recollection of an Austrian soldier's experiences as a member of the German Army's renowned Grossdeutschland division in World War II. It is a rewrite of this soldier's originally privately published memoirs and is replete with interesting vignettes on the author's life, from his growing up in a family of Social Democrats in pre-war Austria, to his induction into the elite Grossdeutchland division, to his many and varied battlefield experiences, to his life as a post-war prisoner of the Soviets, to his coming to America.The combat experiences he describes are mischeviously short (as is the book itself). Unfortunately, this sometimes leaves the impression that the author is holding back information, i.e., information that would not make him look good. Nonetheless, it contains many fascinating anecdotes about life under German control and in the German army during this period. For example, while undergoing his mandatory labor service (\\"Reichsarbeitsdienst\\") in late 1941 he is shipped with his unit to build runways near some German U-boat pens on the North Atlantic coast. They are all awakened one morning, provided steel helmets, given rifles and hand grenades with five minutes of instruction on their use, and sent out to fight some British commandos who were attacking the facility because they knew the regular military garrison was 25 miles away on manuevers. Somehow, these teenage conscripts held off the commandos, who were taken by surprise, believing that the facility would be undefended.Especially interesting are the author's several near experiences with death, including, a bullet going through one side of his helmet but then traveling around the rim, leaving him without a scratch; a comrade entering the author's foxhole and moments later being blown up by an artillery shell, again leaving the author without a scratch; and hitting a heavy Stalin tank at close range with a \\"Panzerfaust\\" at the same time it fired its main gun at him, knocking the author unconscious, as the round hit a wall right above him, but otherwise laving him unharmed.The entire book is strengthened by excellent introductory and transitional comments by Marc Rikmenspoel. Also making the book a very worthwhile purchase are the inclusion of a dozen or so wartime photographs of the author (some posed, some more candid in the field) as well as pictures of his two wound tags and the certificate awarding him the Iron Cross.Beware, however, that there are grammatical and typographical errors on about every other page of the book. (Only in the parts written by Mr. Novotny and not, however, by Mr. Rikmenspoel.) These mistakes disrupt the flow and makes one wonder if there really was any editing done at all from the original edition.

Like Guy Sajer, Alfred served in Gross Deutschland. Also like Guy, he served as a grenadier on a machine gun team.Alfred starts his story by telling us about pre-war Austria, the environment, and the events leading up to Germanys taking over of Austria. This was interesting because I didn't know that much about Austria between the wars. The political environment was interesting to say the least.During the early part of WWII, Alfred was a member of the RAD (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Interestingly, he was working around St. Nazaire when the commando raid happened (yes, he did gain some combat experience there). Upon completing his duty in the RAD, Alfred was brought into the German army, rather unusually for an Austrian, into Gross Deutschland (Alfred states that most Austrians were brought into the Mountain Infantry Regiments, the 44th ID, the 2nd PzD, or the 9th PzD).Alfred gives a basic description of his time serving in Gross Deutschland. Throughout his chapters, Alfred has a little lead in paragraph that describes the situation he's going to describe in the following paragraphs. In his military service part, Alfred describes his training, his time on the front, Gross Deutschland, and the end of the war.Like most German veterans who served on the eastern front, Alfred has section on the being a Russian prisoner of war. There's some interesting things, however, most of it has been covered by other Germans as well or better.Alfred closes the book out with his post war activities. This includes his coming to America.The Good Soldier is a good basic book. Not nearly as strong as most other personal histories. For this reason, I can only give it 3 stars. There are some very good pieces in here, but unfortnetly, Alfred doesn't deliver the goods nearly as well as Guy Sager, Hans von Luck, and others.

By that I mean that the human elements of Novotny's upbringing, friendships,intimacy and decisions to &quot;do the right thing&quot; are all things that every person faces in his or her life.The details in the book allow the reader to grasp the context of situations; and yet, they do not become so fine-grained as to lose the focus of the story: a man immersed in humanity who lives with integrity doing his duty and &quot;the right thing&quot; as the good soldier."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"I bought this book and thought &quot;okay, I'll probably go through it quick&quot;.

This memoir deals with the complete life of Alfred Novotny from childhood to the War and imprisonment onto his life and times in America.The author is very introspective of the politics of the Nazis and has a forgiving attitude to the Russians after his captivity of two years.His insights into the operations and loyalties of the elite Grossdeutschland division shows us a premiere fighting force which was utilized to stop the Russians advances by the OKW. Novotny was a true and competent NCO by war's end. He was awarded the Iron Cross second class and the Wound Badge. He was as the title of the book says a good soldier.The story Novotny writes is significant and riveting. However at times the writing was awkward and was not properly edited or proofed. I found sentences missing words and some grammatical errors that had me scratching my head. Doesn't Aberjona Press edit and proof these manuscripts. Surely just reading the book as I had done would show the mistakes to the publisher. I rate the story and its sources four stars as this work is but a mere outline which has no depth. However the writing and grammar are not of professional quality. With this in mind it deserves a three star rating. With the much needed corrections I would rate it four stars."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"I just finished listening to the audio version of this book. The author himself, is the narrator which in itself is powerful. He speaks in a very slow, sincere, sometimes emotionally strained voice through which you can hear his struggling memories being conveyed. He tells of happy times, of funny boyhood pranks, of his daily life, of his participation in times and events that only hindsight fully showed him the magnitude of. No this is not a book for historians looking for detailed information full of dates and strategic manuevers and military actions. This is not a book for people wanting a documentary of factual processes by which Germany very nearly took over the entire of Europe. This is a story of Alfred Novatny... written solely for his daughter and her children so they would know him, and know where they came from. It can be overwhelmingly touching. By the end of the book, you feel you know this man. My husband, who is from Germany, listened to the most of it with me and when the book was finished, he turned to me and said \\"I want to find this man\\". We had no idea how old the book was and I warned that he was likely no longer living. But we did look him up and found him. My husband talked to him on the phone for quite some time. And he is a very kind man with such a good heart. He said there is so very much more that is not in the book... that couldn't be.. because it was just too harsh. It is a very good book that \\"connects\\" a modern world with a life and time that is now long gone and dying with the generation of those who lived it. It is a precious thing for him to have given to his children... and to the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Novotny's story.

His life before the war, during the war, and after the war could easily have been broken up into three interesting volumes, or made into one very long book. What the reader gets, however, is a long magazine article disguised as a book. Filled with large print and pictures this undersized book falls short because of what it should have been and is not. His battle with a Russian tank is just one of many examples. The encounter is told in a sentence or two, leaving the reader wanting and disappointed. It is not an exaggeration to say that most readers could finish this \\"book\\" while waiting at the doctor's or dentist's office. That makes the price a little too high."},{"Title":"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\"","review":"This is not the first book to read about the war in the East, but if you've read a lot of them it has its place. The author is modest about his experiences on the Eastern front. He skips over Memel, for example, in a few pages. He participated in some of the most difficult parts of the war for the Wehrmacht yet deals with it in a matter of fact way. He does throw in some facts and anecdotes which are interesting. For a historian of this conflict the book is most interesting when describing life as a prisoner of war in Soviet Georgia. And also the events leading up to the GrossDeutschland's cessation of hostilities. Descriptions of his life after emigrating to America are interesting from the psychological point of view. It's difficult to imagine the manager of a motel in Peoria who'd experienced the horror of the eastern front, the terror of captivity in the USSR. But he was hardly the only one. If you are a student of the war on the Eastern front or of war in general this book is worth a read. It is straight forward and free of the \\"we were the real victims\\" whining which plagues certain books of this genre."},{"Title":"How to Improve Mgb, Mgc & Mgb V8 (Speedpro)","review":"Having over thirty years of experience owning, driving, racing and working on MGs, I had hoped to find this book a gold mine of information. It is--fool's gold. The standard MGB engine, required in forms of racing and used by thousands of owners in their cars, is not even covered. Williams makes a vague comment about the 1800 engine not being large enought and states that his book is only concerned with the larger 1950 and 2100 cc modifications. Immediately, he has made this section of the book usless to the vast majority of MGB owners. Additionally, these two engine modifications have some serious problems, well known to the MG community, which the author does not bother to discuss (cylinder bore flex and excessive oil consumption). In a similar vein, the author mentions the MGC automobile, but only in passing. When discussing suspension modifications, he does not mention that the MGC has a completely different form of front suspension than the MGB and his recommendations will not work on the MGC. For the most part, this book would be useless to the owner of this very rare model car. Most of his &quot;improvements&quot; in the suspension area would cost more than the value of a good car (L 2,000 for the rear end modifications, or about $3,600, plus the cost of modifying the body and installation). Throughout the book, Williams makes use of the phrases, &quot;This should be possible&quot; or &quot;I was told by&quot;. He offers no supporting documentation (as in personal knowledge based on his experiments) for these broad statements, no results of anyone's experiments, nor does he relate the actual steps involved in most of these modifications. Very poor technical research for an engineer. He does, however, maintain a very consistant quality as his poor research is combined with poor technical writing and some of the worst technical photographs I have seen. (One illustration is of a brake caliper. He does makes a vague comment about a brake line which is barely distinguishable and does not even bother to insert an arrow into the photograph to point out which line.) This book is of very little value to most owners and should not be purchased. It is unfortunate that the SPEEDPRO Series has published this book as it detracts from the overall quality of their line, many of which are excellent and a few of which are truly outstanding. This book is neither."},{"Title":"How to Improve Mgb, Mgc & Mgb V8 (Speedpro)","review":"I found this book to be of little practical use. The author speaks mostly in generalities, with little in the way of specific recommendations as to &quot;How To&quot; actually go about doing anything. Few of the modifications recommended involve the easier, simpler improvements that the average owner can do himself at reasonable cost which conribute so much to improving an MGB. Instead, most of the improvements the author recommends involve the purchase of expensive and often elaborate conversion kits more appropriate to a race track than on a street-going car, all of which are accompanied by photographs obviously supplied by their manufacturers. The text refers to such items as a &quot;Brown &amp; Gammons head gasket&quot; which Brown &amp; Gammons do not themselves make and is commonly known amongst MGB aficionados to be manufactured made by Fel Pro. All this, plus an absence of in-depth technical knowledge, tends to leave the reader with the impression that the author has never laid a wrench on an MGB and gleaned all of his information by reading magazines and sales catalogues. This is not a &quot;How To&quot; book. It is instead a collection of advertisements masquerading as one. I consider my purchase of this book to truly be a waste of money."},{"Title":"How to Improve Mgb, Mgc & Mgb V8 (Speedpro)","review":"I have owned and worked on MG's of one sort or another for more than fifteen years, with my 65 MGB being my longest lasting car (outlasted my marriage). I bought this book hoping that it may give me some ideas as to improve my old friend. Well, I was deluged with vague references as to what would work, how to do things and many bad photographs. I was impressed with the amount of upgrades that are available in the U.K., but very disappointed to the amount of material that was devoted to outlandish and totally inappropriate modifications to the classic MGB. These modifications are well out of the scope of the average owner to accomplish and probably out of the price range of most vintage racers. If you are looking for a book that will help you get the most out of your MGB get a good service manual such as the Bentley manuals, or the Guide to DIY restoration of the MGB. Both of these books more clearly demonstrate proven examples of modifications that can be carried out by the novice to intermediate skilled owner.

It is my favorite Rick Bass book by far, and it has a permanent place on my book shelf. Don't make the mistake that I almost did...buy it, borrow it or whatever...Just don't miss out on this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Oddly enough, I was far from home doing field work in North Georgia when I found Oil Notes in a little bookstore. I am a geologist. However, unlike Rick Bass my job was to look for fresh drinking water, not oil. I found time to read his book between logging boreholes and setting wells. By the time I was finished I (with the book) I had a renewed interest and spirit in my profession and in the environment around me. Rick Bass found a way to express in words, the excitement and passions associated with being a field geologist, environmentalist and a man in love.Oil Notes is a fantastic book, and Rick Bass is an equally outstanding author. I have since read everyone of his books. He vividly defines his feelings and passions in everything he writes about, be it drilling for oil or studing wolves."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Rick Bass, a petroleum geologist and environmental activist is known for his knowledge of the earth and oil. The book, Oil Notes, written by Bass, gives the readers the feeling that they are petroleum geologists. Bass allows the reader to understand what he is referring to and how everything on an oil rig works. At first glance or first read, the reader might think that the book is solely about oil. But as the reading goes on, the reader finds out differently. Oil Notes is not only about oil; it is an analogy for life. Bass also uses searching for the number one oil field, the one that will make someone rich, as an analogy for a man trying to find his place on earth.Throughout the book, many facts that are in oil exploration also coexist in life. For example, Bass claims that \\"Nothing lasts. Old seas are buried\\" (42). Not only is Bass talking about the soon to be scarcity of oil, he is talking about life. No matter how much you try, you will not live forever. Rocks do not last forever; eventually they become stones, pebbles, and eventually sand. That is the same with life. Life does not last forever. Unfortunately, death is inevitable. Everything that is thought to last forever...love, hatred, and friendship...will cease to exist when the person dies.Another example of life being told in terms of oil is when Bass talks about leadership in the field of geology: \\"A leader-in a profession of men and women who cannot be led, and will not\\" (135). Bass says that those are the type of geologists that everyone needs to stay away from. They are the geologists with the egos that are bigger than their head. In life, staying away from people like that would help a lot. People with big egos refuse to help people and also refuse to be helped. They are solely dependent on themselves. Unfortunately, they will not learn in life until they drastically fail at something. Only then will they hopefully realize that there are sources other than themselves.Time and change coexist and have a big effect on the oil business and life. Everything revolves around time. Bass is amazed that in a lifetime \\"you will see a picture more different than could ever be imagined\\" (134). Things can change drastically in a lifetime. Just look around a city. Remember what it was like 10 years ago or 20 years ago. No matter what duration of time, change always occurs. In the oil business, drilling can go smooth for fifteen hours, and then it becomes tough due to different rock. The flow of oil can trickle and then it can spew out one-thousand barrels per day. It can change that drastically in a short period of time. In life, the health of a person can drastically change as the person ages.In the oil business assumption can make or break your career as an oil person. In life assumption can do the same. Bass says, in reaction to not knowing about your oil well, \\"You've got to be careful not to judge it too quickly or too harshly\\" (145). If a person assumes an oil well is in shale, and uses a bit that only goes through shale, it will ruin their day to find out that the $10,000 bit is useless because they are actually drilling through granite. The oil well can be lost and the geologist can be out of a job. In life, the same can occur. If a person judges another person before getting to know them, that can prove to be a big mistake. Maybe that person could have been a good friend or something more.Finding the perfect oil field is similar to one's efforts to try to find out where they belong in the world. Bass claims that \\"Someday I am going to drill my own well. There is no geologist who does not dream of this. It is what you are after\\" (89). In any profession, a goal is set. A pilot might want to fly a certain plane or so many hours. In oil, the goal is to own a big money making petroleum company, owning a well. Life provides goals similar to those and with a similar pay off. The fact that Bass says \\"someday\\" means he is going to try. That is an analogy for life. A person may look all of their life to find out who they are, where they belong. Once the person \\"knows himself\\" then the world is his. They know what they are capable of and what they are made of.Not only is Oil Notes about oil, it is about life in general, about one person's effort to find their place in the world."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"I both read the book and listened to the audiotape. I think the cadence of Bass' voice (he reads his own material) really enhances Oil Notes. This is a wonderful book for those who have enjoyed his later works."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Geologist and writer Rick Bass muses about time and natural processes, both human and geological, creating a metaphorical experience for the reader. In his journal, he tells each anecdote with lyrical descriptions, but then goes one step beyond with some illumination about love, living, human beings, even existence itself. At this point, the body of the text becomes a secondary experience as the reader begins to feel the truth in his 'illuminations.' Many entries make the reader laugh out loud while others will instill the deep impulse to go hug a loved one. This book will make anybody remember how lovely life really is."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Oil notes struck me not so much as a description of a mans first job and all it entails, but rather a young man beginning his adult life who was open to any and evry new expieriene life through at him. His optimism shown through in that he loved his work and he always felt something better was just around the corner. Underneath it all was also a man coming to grips with how to handle relationships, both personal and professional. He showed his failings as well as his triumhs. To me it is an adult version of a seperate peace. This is a writer that I will read for a long time because as he ages he will describe lifes changes with the same brilliance he has described his lifes beginning."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Rick Bass does an excellent job of using short, usually off topic notes, that when put in chapter and book form are most enjoyable. He intertwines his geological skills with his philisophical view on humanity and also his personal life-well done. He has some very unique analogies, such as a geologist drawing a surface map thousands of feet below the earth's surface by using basically what he sees through a hole the diameter of a fire hydrant. Mr. Bass is also very ecologically concerned with our planet, his views on this subject are quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"You can almost feel Rick Bass' concentration as he considers each and every word before adding it to this sparkling little journal. The resulting prose is lean and crisp, fresh as the air after rain. I savored the writing in these little essays almost as much as I enjoyed the bits of life-wisdom found a dash here and a pinch there.No matter how intriguing, these elements are relegated to the status of sub-currents within the framework. On the surface, Bass treats the reader to a large helping of fascinating details about the oil business, and it was this that first attracted me.Of course, as I read the author began to make contact on a second level, and my interests shifted. Years later, original motive no longer relevant, I enjoyed Oil Notes again. There is much to be learned here. Bass seemes to be that rare creature; the sensitive male. I'm not sure, but now that I've read it several times, I think maybe some of it might be about to rub off.Art Tirrell - author of The Secret Ever Keeps - Mar 2007 from Kunati Book Publishers."},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Hard to describe the author's ability to relate the passion felt by many in the oil patch to the ordinary person's understanding. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Oil Notes","review":"Rick Bass's little oil book, originally published in 1989, is a good read for those who know something about oil production. But it is dated, very badly, by recent developments in the energy sector. One of his &quot;notes&quot; -- page 19 of the SMU edition -- states &quot;I hate coal.&quot; This goes to two pages of nonsense written by someone years ago, like me, that could not have anticipated the significance of coalbed methane.If you read this book, realise it is from a well-head mentality. This oil genius probably has never spent a day underground or a minute to understand why we must mine coal. Perhaps he could run his word processor off the crude pumped into a generator adjacent to his office. That's a patent I'd like to see."},{"Title":"America's Original GI Town: Park Forest, Illinois (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This is a planner's history of this unique American village, located about thirty miles South of Chicago. Gregory Randall has the advantage of growing up in Park Forest, which gives him some insight into the community that an outside observer might miss. He also has the training and experience as an urban planner to understand and appreciate the complexities of creating a new town.Randall places Park Forest in the contex of planned communities in England and the United States. His discussion of Riverside, Illinois, is good; but he ignores Pullman, Illinois, and Marktown, Indiana, as earlier planned communities in the Chicago area. His treatment of Harvey, Illinois, includes the minor error of listing the Chicago lumberman, Turlington W. Harvey, as an evangelist, although he was associated with the evangelist, Dwight Moody.He also does not deal with the demogragrahic changes that been pronounced on the South Side of Chicago and the South Suburbs. This racial and ethic movement has affected the developments that the planners did not anticipate. Perhaps, this is beyond the scope Randall's book, and deserves a monograph of its own.As a resident of Park Forest for twenty-six years I learned much about the origins and development of my town. I was especially interested in the how the lack of cooperation from the Illinois Central Railroad, forced the planners to drop their first chice for the location of the Park Forest Plaza. Thus, many of Park Forest's problems with a declining downtown area can be understood.

As a human being facing what we all face this ending is truly awful.But what is Hudson telling us in this novel? Is it a Victorian approach to telling things that are otherwise inexpressible - that affection is not enough? That real love with all its manifestations must be honoured, because without it there is only death?Here I find a challenge to psychoanalysis and all the techniques of psychology: 'I only discovered, what others have discovered before me, that the practice of introspection has a corrosive effect on the mind, which only serves to aggravate the malady it is intended to cure.' (If only I could stop introspection ......!) ) [page 279 Dutton edition of 1917]But here the common man, Smith, plunged into this affectionate pastoral society, bemoans what he has just learned - that the young woman he loves can never love him as he wishes - 'I wish that I had never made that fatal discovery, that I might have continued still hoping and dreaming, and wearing out my heart with striving after the impossible, since any fate would have been preferable to the blank desolation which now confronted me.' [page 303-304 of the same edition]I wonder what woman of Hudson's acquaintance he had to put aside with such enormous regret that he expressed these words!Search this book out. Absorb its gentle fantasy and hold tight for a rough ending.Other recommendations:The Separation - Christopher PriestThe Trial - Franz KafkaThe Shepherd's Life - W H HudsonGreen Mansions - W H Hudson"},{"Title":"A Crystal Age.","review":"JB Priestly wrote a book about time ('Man and Time') and in it he referred to a WH Hudson novel called 'A Crystal Age'. His couple of paragraphs about 'A Crystal Age' stimulated my interest but nowhere could I find the novel he referred to. However, I did find 'Green Mansions' and I have read it several times. It is a beautiful novel with an undertone of darkness (is death the darkness that we all live with during the beauty of life?). Perhaps 'Green Mansions' disappointed me a little after triggering my romantic nerve. I did, however, keep exploring the writings of WH Hudson - 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'The Purple Land', 'Idle Days in Patagonia' and the wonderful 'A Shepherd's Life'.I have just finished reading 'A Crystal Age' at last. I concur with JB Priestley's assessment. 'A Crystal Age' is worth the effort of pursuing - it is a surprising first-person utopian novel in which Hudson's love of nature does not render him oblivious to the fact that there are downsides in all worlds - all imaginable worlds. Just like the dark shadows in 'Green Mansions'. The end of 'A Crystal Age' is so surprising - I believe very few readers would see what is coming - I certainly didn't as I rushed on towards it. There is a certain illogic to the ending, but there is also something that haunts me continuously.'A Crystal Age' is a stronger less romantic novel than 'Green Mansions', but it is also exceptional for many reasons. I don't hesitate in recommending 'Green Mansions' but I also urge readers to pursue 'A Crystal Age'."},{"Title":"A Crystal Age.","review":"This gets off to a very familiar start.

Fields of Dreams definitely has entertainment value and is fun to look through, but hardly a ground-breaking or thought-provoking publication. Most dissapointing was a disturbing number of flaws and factual errors in the book. I counted four errors alone in the section on the history of Toronto's SkyDome, including an incorrect year on when the stadium opened and the mention that Joe Carter's series-winning homer in game six of the 1993 World Series &quot;prevented the Series from returning to Philadelphia for a seventh game.&quot; Every baseball fan should know that when you're in one town for game six, you stay there for game seven--- this isn't the NHL playoffs.

The concepts and systemization of our company have significantly changed our practices in the last year. After looking at some of the other reviews I noticed a common theme, people either love the book or hate it. Those who were not pleased with the book all have another common theme in that they did not feel it offered any &quot;practical&quot; solutions to their problems. That point of view absolutely supports Gerber's idea of the &quot;technition&quot; working in the business and not working on the business. I would not recommend this book for people looking for quick solutions to daily problems in their practice, but if you want to change your practice and the way you look at your business it is an excellent addition to the E-Myth series."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"I agree with Dan who posted a review 2 posts before me. I am a physician and have read a few of Gerbers books. His Emyth revisited is a good book. However, his other books such as this one which is supposed to be geared towards specific profession. He only gives you some very basic concepts that offer really no solutions to these problems. I think most of us who understand our problems wish to have some questions answered and get help solving them not just simply reiterate what we already know. He does an absolute poor job on the money section of the book even though he implies that it is one of the most important aspects of the business. It is a terrible book on application to problem solving. Emyth even though does not necessarily cover application all the way either but it gives more useful hints than this one.Organization: C-Application: FUsefulness: FRe-read: FOverall: D-"},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"Mr. Gerber has very interesting ideas about systematic management of a medical practice. He uses the franchise example of McDonald's to help the physician to think of his or own practice as a system, that is easy to repeat. Repetitive systems are a definite way to provide better patient care and make more money. Mr. Gerber also speaks about how the physician must constantly look to change to improve these systems. This also makes sense with the constant changing horizon of health care.The problem, is that Mr. Gerber gives very little insight on how to put these concepts into practice. For example, he believes all physicians should have systems to see patients on time. Yet, he has no solutions on how to deal with the problems that put physicians behind in the schedule. He brings up the &quot;By the way doc,...,&quot; patient with multiple unannounced problems, but no solutions on how to deal with him. Another concept he suggests, is when a customer is angry, doing whatever the customer wants to satisfy them. This is a good concept with most patients, but there are several where this would not work, drug-seekers, etc.This is a great book to help you conceptualize what you want your practice to be. It will help you to break it down into individual concepts and systems to address and fine tune to make your practice profitable and enjoyable. It will not give you much practical advice on how to solve these problems. You will have to look elsewhere for this."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"The following is my opinion: As a physician myself about to start my own private practice, I came across this book and thought \\"well, it's only ~$13 and I'm sure it is worth at least that much and I'm sure I'll get at least one or two pointers.\\" I was wrong on all accounts. Let me save you some time by giving you the answers he offers to his two questions: 1)why most medical practices don't work, 2)what to do about it. Answers: 1)because physicians don't have a system, 2)create a system. Makes promises and keep them. That's it. If at this point you are saying to yourself \\"that's it? You have to be kidding!\\", then you know exactly how I felt after reading the book. Through most of the book, he would bring up provacative questions and I kept thinking to myself \\"here it comes, I wonder what his answer/solution to that question is,I can't wait, that is such a good questions.\\" And time after time and for the entire book, it left me disappointed. He provided no real answers, or answers that only a child or a moderately mentally challenged adult may take as plausible. It is like being promised a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and then finding it filled with a pot of manure. He often makes very strange comments. The one that comes to mind right now is: doctors don't understand time with a capital T, they understand time with a lower case t. When I came across comments like this, I was waiting for something profound to be said, which of course left me disappointed and wondering \\"what the heck was he talking about?\\" He would tell stories of how patients hated waiting for long periods and that resulted in patients feeling frustrated. Duh! He speaks as if doctors like their patients to be irritated and as if doctors enjoy running late for appointments. His solution to this problem? Stop it, stop being late! and promise patients you will see them on time and keep your promise. You heard me, that is his real solution! He tells a story of a doctor he knows who adopted this philosophy and promised his patients that they will be seen on time or else they do not pay!! I would love to meet this doctor, wouldn't you? He didn't comment on this particular doctor any further. Why do I get the feeling there was much more to that story that is being left out? What made me realize he has no idea about the medical profession is the following: he feels and states that physicians can predict how much time is needed with each patient and that if doctors apply this, that they would never run late. He states that physician don't have to estimate how much time each patient needs but that they can exactly predict how much time is needed. Too bad he didn't share his secret of how to do that, I would paid him big bucks to learn that secret. He would give extremely unpractical advice for physician how to make sure patients do not become dissatified, for example: to always listen to the patient and never interrupt them and always let them say what they need to say. For those of you who are doctors, I'm sure you got a big chuckle reading that just as I did when I read it in his book. In summary, his books has many intriquing questions, no answers which are practical. In my opinion, when I read the negative evaluations of this book on amazon, I thought \\"well, cheap book, sure I'll get something out of it, maybe those negative ratings are exaggerated.\\" In my opinion, book is less than mediocre and the negative ratings are exactly on target. I rec if you have to check out the book, go to the bookstore and skim it for 10minutes, trust me, you won't buy it."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"After reading this book I was a bit conflicted over what rating to give it. Yes, there is insightful information in the book, but it only takes up two pages. The rest of the text is the typical motivational style found in other business books. It's the &quot;You can succeed&quot; attitude that I find obnoxious. For what it's worth, the premise of &quot;E-Myth&quot; is that doctors should have a set form for the practice -- that the office should run more like McDonald's than the traditional idea that everything revolves around the physician's meeting with the patient. Practices should divide tasks among the staff -- such as letting the techs take care of the initial physical -- while the doctors worry about only matters which actually require an M.D."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"The author seems to partly grasp the challenges (i.e. managed care, cash flow, office staff, family life, etc.) of a being a physician.

Michael Gerber does not give a canned strategy for success because there is no such thing. Instead he teaches you to reinvent your practice according to your desires.

It talks a lot about cloning yourself and selling your practice eventually, which is something I'm not interested in - at least not now - it's been 3 years since I graduated. There is nothing substantial about doctor-patient communication or patient acquisition, which I believe has a lot to do with why practices fail. The reason I would pay $0.02 and rate it a 1 star is because it has some decent philosophical concepts, but you can get those just about anywhere with all \\"self-help\\" manifestation-type books that are out now. The author probably had a good 1st book (haven't read it) and then just figured he could use the same template to clone a dozen others on a different topic.

Yes, Gerber makes a valid point about the E-myth concept (read other reviews if you don't know the concept) but it's really for beginners (newbs). All his books are really just advertisements,for his E-Myth Academy consulting business in the back of all his books. There is nearly no practical information. He makes his point about the E-Myth, then masterbates it endlesly, re-making that point six ways to Sunday, add nausium and leaves you wondering, well, but what should I do? Well, little lost lamb (newb), go to E-Myth web site or call the 800 number where they have a fast talking sales crew and sign up for 2 years of 700 plus a month (I haven't checked lately) consultation/classes.After you get the point that to make your technical skill pay/function as a business you need to have business skills/know how. You can sign up for the 700 plus per month for 2 years advertised in the back of his books. Start looking elsewhere for actual practical information. Because there are no E-myth books or tapes that have that information. You can do a lot for your business with that kind of money. I'm always shocked at how newbs starting businesses throw money around. Something to buy and a place to buy it, no matter how pretty it all is, doesn't make a successful business, In my observations, it's the major reason new businesses fail. I'm sure some of you with deep pockets or You corperate types who have never had to find the guts or earn the money to build a small business without Sugar Daddy Warbucks help will think I'm wrong. This E-Myth stuff is valid but it it's grade school lessons made to look like some kind of super-profound truth/solution. Well, it is, grade school true, now what Mr. Gerber, where's the solutions, spend, what, nearly 17,000 Sign up for what I thought I was getting when I bought the Books and tapes? What a greedy little tight wad! When are you going to write a book with substance? Hey Newbs!

I recommend it because it pegs so many doctors and health care professionals and why they often lead unfulfilling careers and lives.I started incorporating what I've learned from E-Myth last February 2001 when I enrolled in The E-Myth Mastery Program. I can relate to Keith and Susan very well because like me, my father is also a veterinarian and I have experienced many of the same things they related in their story. Even though I recognize the same pattern because I have lived it, I often have difficulty not falling into the same unfulfilling trap. That is why I am working daily on E-Myth Mastery to help my family and myself have a life outside of my career.Chapter 12 on the subject of work has had a big impact on the way I think about my business. &quot;Work is the cause of obsessive-compulsive behaviors by doctors. Work. You've got to do it every single day. Work. If you fall behind you'll pay for it. Work. There is either too much or not enough.&quot; -from page 97 of The E-Myth Physician.The E-Myth philosophy stresses the importance of the need of working on your practice and not just working in it to achieve equity and something that lives without me. It gives me a visual way to realize my goals and a way to build each level on a solid foundation and systems that work in my business.It is excellent because by managing the process in a medical business is the only way I can find peace in my life and prevent career burnout as I mature in my profession."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"I thought that the first couple of chapters were enticing at first. Then I realized that this book was really all fluff. Basically, a pep talk to get you to do what you want. He fails to address so many issues and has a very simplistic attitude towards them.He starts off saying that doctors who want to go off on their own do, so that they can rid themselves of a boss who is controlling and runs everything. However, he then explains how later on, you have to hire doctors and basically train them to be a replica of yourself. I see a problem there. Because unless you hire followers, doctors want to have their own autonomy. How does he address this problem that made the doctor go off on his own in the first place?Basically a fluff book. read it in the book store."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"The author has a couple of good ideas: management is about building processes not about managing people, and the value of a practice is it's process.

This is nothing like a practical guide on how to rework a medical practice."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"Anyone who is currently in practice or is considering doing medicine should read this book. Unfortunately one is never taught at medical school the fundamentals of running a medical practice profitably. Doctors erroneously believe that because they are good at medicine or surgery or paediatrics, they will necessarily believe that they are able to run a practice well. This couldn't be further from the truth. Gerber, in an insightful work, manages to expose many of the pitfalls in running a medical practice. I can only say from personal experience that initially, one gets validation from medicine because you are working at the coalface - doing the work of a doctor. Eventually, it dawns on you that you don't in fact have a life - you have effectively bought yourself a job. Every chapter has nuggets that have resulted in a multitude of paradigm shifts in my strategic thinking towards my practice. If you are happy doing the work of a technician and working 80 hour weeks for 50 weeks of the year, don't read this book. If you are seeking something better from practicing medicine, I would suggest reading this book in conjunction with The E-Myth Revisited - Why most small businesses don't work and what to do about it. I would also suggest reading the Robert Kiyosaki books, which will give you another lucid perspective on the pitfalls of being in a profession."},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"I have read many of Mr. Gerber's books and have applied his insights to my own practice (not medicine, but financial planning).I work exclusively with physicians and his commentary is right on.

He identified numerous types of plans and management techniques that are very valuable to physicians.Gerber states that a physician should adopt the roles of entrepreneur and manager (what I call \\"business owner\\"). Business owners must become quite astute in dealing with money, managing people and planning and operating a business. Gerber's main point is that either a business owner runs a business or it runs the business owner. Your choice.PlanningGerber states that the following types of detailed written plans are essential to operate a physician's practice intelligently and successfully. These plans must be based on the clear understanding of such terms as income, profit, cash flow, equity, turn-key standard operating procedures. These terms are explained in the summary below and well documented in the book itself and include a) Business Plan, b) Practice Plan, and c) Completion (poorly named, as this is an Implementation) Plan.ManagementGerber assumes correctly that each practice will have a full time manager who is not the physician. The book provides insightful, basic management principles and practices including the physician must always be somewhat involved in the management of the practice and never abdicate total responsibility for the management of the practice to another person. Second, the job of the manager is to create robust, standardized systems for everything that is repeated or repeatable in the practice and insure these systems work and are used by everyone employed in the practice. Third, the best and only way to manage people effectively is to make sure they have standardized systems to run and manage. Fourth, Gerber states that the physician who started the practice will need eventually to hire a doctor to help with either the expansion or the continuation of the practice.The \\"new\\" doctor must be trained by the founder on the standards, values and skills the founder believes are essential elements of the practice and the \\"new doctor\\" must accept and reach these standards or this will not ever be a good fit and the new doctor's role in the organization must be terminated. Fifth, systems require that all key elements be \\"estimated\\" including the time, money, and other types of resources necessary to accomplish the tasks that come under that system. Failing to estimate accurately these key items dooms the system from the start and since all systems in a physician's practice are/will be integrated, the failure of one system will cascade and disrupt other systems or necessary activities that need to be done well for the practice to be successful.The Patient Is the CustomerGerber views patients as customers and provides insights into how to serve patients well and them happy. When the practice does all of these things, it will grow and the only to promote proper growth is to promote change in the practice. Growth = Change and therefore, change must be embraced (I would say \\"welcomed\\") and done well, not feared or resisted.Gerber gives physicians excellent time management advice, plus makes the critical distinction between undertaking tactical vs. strategic actions and urges physicians to focus their time and energy on strategic matters more than tactical matters. The book provides marketing advice, advice that will assist the physician in taking action more effectively, become a better decision maker, become a better team leader, and assist the physician in creating over time a practice that meets or exceeds the physician's long term vision for the practice and the life the doctor wants to lead. Gerber knows that physicians deserve to have life balance and time for activities other than their practice/business.ConclusionThe goal of the book is the goal of every physician - create a sustainable, enjoyable, profitable, efficient, effective, and overall excellent practice that meets or even exceeds patients' needs and expectations. His book will help your practice be a better place to work and fills an important need in our profession. His business guidance is wisdom from which our profession can benefit.About the AuthorsDr. Jim Hoven is Director of Franchise Development, HealthSource Chiropractic and Progressive Rehab.Herb Rubenstein is the President of Sustainable Business Group a consulting firm to businesses.

An in-house billing operation and a naive outsourced billing office owner are both helpless against insurance companies armed with significant resources devoted to denying reimbursement and including professionally managed processes and leading-edge technology.Read Gerber's book before deciding to manage your billing inhouse or to outsource it to professionals.Yuval Lirov, Practicing Profitability - Billing Network Effect for Revenue Cycle Control in Healthcare Clinics and Chiropractic Offices: Collections, Audit Risk, SOAP Notes, Scheduling, Care Plans, and Coding"},{"Title":"The E-Myth Physician : Why Most Medical Practices Don't Work and What to Do About It","review":"Mr. Gerber looks at business differently than any other business help writer I have read. He looks at the business on a strategic level, and not down at the day to day operations level. His philosophy is not only amazing, it really works. Unlike most &quot;help&quot; books, Mr. Gerber points out that the business owner has to figure out where the business is going and what it needs to accomplish, before figuring out how to do that. This is a fundamental shift in thinking, but once the shift is understood, it makes a tremendous amount of sense! The book is easily understandable, exciting, and really gets your attention if you are frustrated with how your company operates. Don't get bogged down in the examples Mr. Gerber gives - I am sure you could insert many other examples, but look at the point he makes.

Contained within you will find the funny and frank commentary of the young Rachel Sa.Determined to have a writing career, this young teen (now young woman) worked her way onto the pages of The Toronto Sun. This is a collection of some of those columns written in her clear and refreshing voice. Nothing is taboo, so the topics range from family, friends, sex, work and more. I especially loved the letters and commentary that were included.If you want to glimpse the teen perspective, open a window to understanding or to dialoging with a younger person, than be sure to give this book a gander."},{"Title":"What Rachel Sa: A Field Guide for Parents","review":"A regular reader of Rachel Sa's weekly newspaper column recommended her book to me and I'm so glad she did! I'm not a parent - so I was skeptical at first, but after only a few pages I was hooked. Sa's writing is witty, funny and insightful - it's quite amazing for someone so young (she's 21!). This collection of her columns from The Toronto Sun touches on many topics - school, family, pop culture, sex, drugs, body art etc.- that would be of interest to anyone - be they parents, kids or otherwise. The book also features new items written specifically for this publication, as well as letters from readers (some of which are just hysterical! It's amazing what some people will write...) and Sa's responses to them. Finally, this book is also inspirational. In her introduction, Sa writes about how she came to be a regular newspaper columnist at the age of 17 and how she eventually had this, her first book, published. It's refreshing to read that dreams can and do come true."},{"Title":"What Rachel Sa: A Field Guide for Parents","review":"A regular reader of Rachel Sa's weekly newspaper column recommended her book to me and I'm so glad she did!

I've read it and so have my kids (aged 17 and 20). I am a disabled father and this is a big help. We all agree that Sa has captured some very strong emotions and feelings. It truly is common sense for a parent of today's youth. I recommend parents pick this one up, or kids pick this up for their parents. I know my brother Kenny is half way done and relating better to his kids already. For some insight, humour, and great writing, get 'What Rachel Sa'."},{"Title":"What Rachel Sa: A Field Guide for Parents","review":"The theme of WHAT RACHEL SA: A FIELD GUIDE FOR PARENTS is perspective. A youthful perspective may be different from that of an older, more experienced person, but it is not any less relevant. This book serves as a bridge between people with different perspectives by providing a glimpse of one young person's ideas and observations about the world. It is a compilation of my columns that have been previously published in The Toronto Sun newspaper, beginning three years ago when I was a 17 year-old high school student. The columns deal with a wide array of topics, from school and work, family and violence, to popular culture and sexuality. To compliment the unedited columns, I have included new commentary as well as letters from parents and teens - both positive and negative - and my responses. As a young person, I wrote WHAT RACHEL SA not with the intention of providing any easy answers, but to give both adults and other young people a sounding board, a starting point for their own discussions. With three or more years of schooling and living behind me since some of these columns were originally written, I may cringe at the words and phrases I once used to convey my thoughts, but I resisted the urge to edit them. Altering the words would alter the voice and that would change the most important aspect of this collection - the perspective."},{"Title":"What Rachel Sa: A Field Guide for Parents","review":"Anyone who wants to know their kids, or even themselves a little bit better should give a look to &quot;What Rachel Sa&quot; It's truly the literary equivalent to an angry old man, shaking a reprimanding fist at the world as if to say &quot;GET THE HELL OFF MY LAWN!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Animated Stories From the Book of Mormon - Mormon and Moroni","review":"I absolutely love these videos.

It describes the obsessive love-hate realtionship between two very different men, Leonard Radcliffe and Victor Tolson - a relationship at the same time cruelly brutal and painfully tender. Its description of passion as destruction is one that will haunt the reader for a very long time. A great book."},{"Title":"After the Storm (Percy the Park Keeper)","review":"The title says it all. Percy the park keeper wakes up one day in the aftermath of a heavy storm. His animal friends are displaced. He helps them find a new one. The story is simple and pretty straight-forward. Its execution however is heart-warming and well-paced. Living in the Philippines, you do see the damage and destruction caused by typhoons. This book will certainly help children understand the effects of natural disasters. Furthermore, it presents the young readers of what to do in these cases as an individual and as a community.This book is recommended to all."},{"Title":"Your College Course at a Glance - Dictionary of Word Origins (New Students Outline Series, No.121)","review":"This is everything an etymology dictionary should be. It's concise, but fun, has interesting stories peppered in, and is very comprehensible. I spent hours going from word to word, and I'm still not anywhere close to being done.Something I liked, although I can imagine others wouldn't enjoy it so much, was the innumerable references and redirections in the explanations.A brief example:Looking up the word dentist, we are asked to \\"see East.\\"We flip to East.East: This word has been linked with yeast*, that which makes rise, as meaning the rising-place; Easter* is the season when the Lord ariseth. It seems rather to be from the Aryan root us*, to burn, whence Sansk. vas, shine. West*, similarly, has been called the place where the sun wasteth*; it is probably rather the place where the sun abides at night, from Sansk. vasta, house; vasati, night. South* is the sunned* quarter, from OHG. sunth, the n dropping as tooth*, from tanth, from Sanks. danta, whence L. dens, dent, whence dentist*. North* is where the sun's course narroweth*, and that's the only guess. All these words are very old.Here we can see that somehow, South and Dentist are related, and as with every other asterisked word, when we flip to our original word (in this case dentist), we must go to another word (such as south) and search for the one we were looking for in the first place. And South is by far one of the shortest explanations in the book.I really enjoy this wandering, as I'm not looking up specific words, but rather I'm interested in reading whatever I flip to.Besides this oddity, this is an interesting, involving, overall excellent book.

This is a &quot;kiss and tell&quot; without the nastiness that one expects of the genre. Korda comes across as a guy who truly likes just about everyone he meets. He recounts his friends and clients pecadillos without animosity. Thank you Brian Lamb for interviewing Korda. I would have missed one of the better reads of the last 2 years otherwise."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Another Life.This is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who loves books. The stories behind the illustrious books,personalities, authors, and celebrities Korda edited are fascinating and entertaining. And an author myself, I paid close attention to his savvy perspective on the publishing industry. This was my vacation pick and didn't disappoint on a single page."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Ever wonder what happens in the making of a book before it gets to the local B&amp;N? Get Korda's memoir and you'll enjoy his recollections of his years at Simon &amp; Schuster, where he acquired and wet-nursed some interesting authors whose books have stood the test of time (they still sell in &quot;backlist,&quot; or years after original publication). His anecdotes, memory and smooth writing style will entertain while he recalls some significant moments with Reagan, Jackie Susann, Will and Ariel Durant, Carlos Caste-eda and, famously, Irving Wallace. In a business where it's easy to get burned out and even cynical at times, his sense of humor and diplomacy has served Korda well through his career."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"My first reaction upon reading the first 100 or so pages of this book was that Korda thinks he is really great and wants to tell us all about it!! Korda mocks his readers with his self-congratulatory tone throughout the entire book. Korda has talent as a writer, but wastes them here in a high class, status conscious, name-dropping book (who cares if he lived for 2 years as a child in Beverly Hills? Isn't the title &quot;A Memoir of OTHER People&quot;??). A well-written memoir engages the reader by adding creative flavor and story-telling to its non-fiction nature. Korda fails to do that here."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I really enjoyed this pleasant and often humorous insight into the world of publishing. Korda supplies his readers with interesting and often poignant anecdotes about the many famous celebrities with whom he's worked over his long career, including Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Susann and Claus von Bulow, to name just a few."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I read this book for a graduate-level course in publishing. I learned many things about the publishing industry's history and publishing's changing role in American and international economy through 1998. The parts of the book that dealt directly with the publishing process were the most interesting to me. The last few chapters are the best. The gossipy bits about the author's colleagues did not interest me.Another Life reveals an elitism that prevents me from enjoying the book as much as I want to. There is a persistent focus on accents, class, status, physical appearance, ethnic identity which alienates me slightly. Stereotypes such as the shoe-shining Black man, the inscrutable Chinese man, the Hispanic maid, the beer-drinking Irish man, the overbearing Jewish woman, the Mafia Italians, etc. are just too much. In this way, the reader could correctly assume that the publishing industry and the Hollywood entertainment industry have much in common.One of publishing's latest trends is ignored - Oprah Winfrey. Oprah's Book Club has consistently influenced book sales since her book club began in 1996. In this way, several gems (Song of Solomon, A Lesson Before Dying, etc.) that were overlooked in the past came to the notice of the general public. On p.448 there is fleeting mention of the fact that her show is in Chicago.I would have rated this book five stars except that Korda's editor should have cut the length by eliminating useless information and repetition of facts."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Another Life is well written, stylish, and a lot of fun. But for those who are interested in Jackie Susann's amazing publishing feats, it's just a drop in the bucket compared to the huge amount of dish in 'Lovely Me' by Barbara Seaman. I'm noting this because the new Bette Middler movie 'Isn't She Great,' supposedly based on a chapter of Another Life, actually seems to derive much more material from Seaman's definitive bio, which Vanity Fair credits with sparking the recent revival of interest in Jackie. True Jackie Susann aficionados should be sure to check out the real deal. Also fans of the Korda article in the New Yorker (and the chapter on Jackie in Another Life which is derived from it) know that Korda was the editor of Jackie's second best selling book, The Love Machine. They will be confused by the fact that the movie script written by Paul Rudnick depicts the earlier events surrounding the publication of Valley of the Dolls, Jackie's first novel which Korda was not involved with and about which he has not written. The real editor who converted Jackie's powerful yet disorganized manuscript into the number 1 bestselling novel of the 20th century is Don Preston of the Bernard Geis Publishing House."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an &quot;f&quot;. Instead of &quot;Another Life&quot;, it should more appropriately be titled &quot;Another Lie.&quot; Although it is a well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any non-fiction library. Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book must be viewed very skeptically. Korda not only takes credit for himself but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and the mastermind. After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of Korda's &quot;memory&quot; when he always appeared as the brilliant, all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in. When I came to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of Korda's stories. But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and check what Korda was relating about his publshing career. Alas, he has created more fiction than fact in relating these tales. I could write half a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in point. His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch. On pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as &quot;some unknown woman in New Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote&quot; the book which HE discovered and became the best seller &quot;Penmarric&quot;. This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to determine that she, indeed, has written a great book. ACTUALLY, Susan Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected author of three novels published by Stein &amp; Day by the time Korda caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the subtle parallel between &quot;Penmarric&quot;'s plot and the lives of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else might also notice. Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance, assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor similarities. HOW CURIOUS. Especially since Howatch's book states in passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and how it applies to the following chapter. She plainly wrote the parallel right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel. And every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times, who thought it added greatly to the book's success. What is Korda talking about! I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's sense of self-importance. The real crime here is how Korda gets away with these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get publish. It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes, book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken it another giant leap."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"This book drags and is repetitive. Korda constantly reminds the reader of his &quot;accomplishments&quot; such as being the only publisher who rides daily in NYC. Yawn. He's very busy talking about how wonderful he is to the detriment of the book."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"At times Korda rambles on and on about tortured publishing executives that none of us care about, but when he describes authors and celebrity-authors it gets good.Korda explains how famous writers like Harold Robbins, for example, struggle to finish novels. And when Robbins finally delivers the manuscript, the characters in the second half of the story have different names and descriptions from the characters in the first half. And the book goes on to become a best-seller anway!Just goes to show that nobody reads but everyone wants to write -- even famous editors like Korda."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Another Life is an interesting book. It contains many gossipy, juicy facts that are fun to read, but some of them surprised me. Korda says he was responsible for making Jackie Susann a best selling author with Valley of the Dolls, but in fact he edited her second book, The love Machine (which is not even mentioned in Another Life). I read Barbara Seaman's Lovely Me, The Life of Jacqueline Susann, and found far more information than in the article. Seaman has used great sources, Jackie's friends and family memebers, for her biography. It seems like Korda skipped and changed some parts in order to make a story. If you want the true story of Jackie, check out Lovely Me."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I enjoyed reading Michael Korda's memoir very much. As with several books I've been reading lately on the history of the publishing industry, Korda's recollections and stories about his career were very illuminating about the structure and subculture that existed in the old publishing houses. It was fascinating to be read about the players in the business, the publishers, editors, and, yes, the writers that made it such a unique business. It was also eyeopening to see the way things changed as the publishers were bought up by the conglomerates over time. Thanks Mr. Korda for giving us a glimpse into your life and into the life of publishing. As an indie author and publisher, I appreciate your insights and experiences."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Found this in the city library, read, enjoyed, returned. Couple of years later decided to re-read and couldn't find again. Bought it. Loved it even more the second time. I'm not partial to the publishing world or gossip about Joan Collins or half the topics, and although I always prefer biographies, this book just stands out. It's one of those rare books so well written it could be about changing tires and it'd still be fun to read. I think I could count on one, maybe two hands, the number of books I've read in 50 years that were this well written. I guess it should be if the author was the top editor at Simon and Schuster. Having said all that, get this book if only to read about Korda's meeting with Ronald Reagan."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Korda chronicles his thirty-year career in trade-book publishing at Simon and Schuster at breakneck speed and with great enthusiasm. He's met a bazillion celebrities, both distinguished and tawdry. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this page-turner.A previous reviewer, Peachaggi, says Korda never mentioned THE LOVE MACHINE. Pea must have skipped Chapter 19 in Part 4, where THE LOVE MACHINE is mentioned at least thirteen times. I counted.I have just three complaints: Korda seems ignorant of the subjunctive mood, neglects to make his pronouns agree with their antecedents, and splits his infinitives unnecessarily throughout. Of course, there's more to trade publishing than grammar and usage, subjects about which few people seem to know very much and care even less."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"ENJOYED THE CHAPTER &quot;ISN'T SHE GREAT&quot; ABOUT JACKIE SUSANN.

He might as well have have been in the underwear game or in scrap metal for all the passion he shows about the busienss of the written word.Korda sees writers as one small element in the creation of a brand-name product, a game he learned at Simon &amp; Schuster. Every person he brings on stage,from Presidents Nixon and Reagan to his boss, Paramount Chairman and CEO Martin Davis,from S&amp;S authors to agent-salesman Swifty Lazar,is presented as an inferior walk-on character in central casting compared with The Great Korda.&quot; If it sells, its good,&quot; is the motto of the characters in the garment industry . That should have been the title of Korda's cynical book."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"This dreadful piece of pap should be pulped. It is rife is factual errors so embarrassing one wonders if Mr. Korda has become senile, yet is still so hungry to publish that he is willing to lie ruefully in order to sell a book. Fact-checking will bear out appalling errors. Mr. Korda's memory requires a make-over, and his style is unbearable. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Two television shows -- Brian Lamb's Booknotes, and Kitty Kelley's reception honoring Michael Korda (her editor and the author of this book)-- convinced me to read Another Life, and the decision was most rewarding. Korda had told Lamb that the common trait shared by best-selling authors -- regardless of style or genre -- is the ability to tell stories. Who would know better than someone who has been an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster for 41 years? A voracious reader who has worked with hundreds of writers (one wonders just how many manuscripts he has absorbed during his career), Korda is a clever writer himself. Another Life is basically a string of hilarious anecdotes involving authors (not all of them household names) whose work he has edited. Excerpts from this book have appeared in The New Yorker (Korda's memories of legendary playwright Tennessee Williams and his ventures into other forms of writing ran in the magazine just this year), and Another Life can be enjoyed as a collection of magazine-length pieces. Writers as diverse as Jacqueline Susann, Richard Nixon, Joan Crawford, Truman Capote, Harold Robbins and Graham Greene (among dozens and dozens of others) are discussed, and Korda also intermixes am ample sprinkling of stories about his co-workers at S&amp;S and his competitors at other publishing houses. Another Life not only lived up to my lofty expectations, it exceeded them. Highly recommended to anyone interested in how books come to fruition."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"What a wonderful tour guide Korda turns out to be in this ultimate insider's look at trade publishing in the last half of the American Century. He's smart, self-deprecating, generous and altogether enthusiastic about his life's work and times. Almost every page of this book features an anecdote about a publishing legend. The publishing behind-the-scenes stuff is fascinating. If you've wondered where the more romantic notions people have about authors and their editors come from, this book will explain much. Korda is like a very entertaining teacher, and beneath the fun lies an inspiring, dedicated, hard-working, dues-paying professional. I would think this is a must read for anybody interested in publishing today."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Those who love the story of writing and how stories are made will love this book. Those who work closely with authors to help them develop their work will appreciate it even more.Korda gives us a rare inside look at how publishers publish. He shares with us how he got into the business, how he climbed the S&amp;S ladder, and how he came to run the editorial department of one of the most successful houses in publishing history. He tells us hilarious and eye-opening stories of Tennessee Williams and Jacqueline Susann and Harold Robbins. We learn just how much work editors put into creating bestsellers. We find out who the authors are and who the writers are. If you're like me, you'll read these stories as you would a bowl of candy. You'll eat and eat until you're scratching at the bottom of the bowl for more.I don't recommend this book without reservation, however. Michael Korda, the famous editor, could have used even a junior editor to help him dig out his story. At times, the book thuds along, caught up in Korda's telling of the history of publishing in the United States. His asides into the money side of the business -- how publishing developed from a cottage industry into a mere cog in larger multinational entertainment companies -- is numbing. Still, I soaked in these parts of his story to get to the good parts.Korda is not a great writer, though he worked with many, and has a wonderful story to tell. Skip past the dull moments if you like, but most definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Michael Korda's family biography, Charmed Lives, remains one of my all time favorite reads. This book, Another Life: A Memoir of Other People, came to my attention while doing research on the web regarding the meaning of memoir/biography. There has been some recent controversy over whether a memoir is based on facts or simply on subjective opinion. I will take Michael Korda's facts, and subjective opinion, anytime. He has a balanced point of view, and the gift of seeing us all as people. He also understands the nature and the nuturing of creative talent.Another Life is a memoir of the publishing industry; it presents a view of how publishing used to be in the old days, the Golden Age of the famous name publishing houses. Though I think we are in another and very different Golden Age at present. I am entering the publishing business myself, and it gave me insights into truly how the business operates on a personal level.I am now reading his biography of Ulysses S Grant, and am very much interested in his assessment of Grant. It stays with me. I hope Mr. Korda continues to write historical biographies. He has a lot to share with the world."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Michael Korda has written some interesting, gossipy books so I looked forward to more of the same. However, writing about the book publishing business is a let down for the reader expecting the same spice as in &quot;Charmed Lives&quot; or the semi-fictional &quot;Queenie&quot;. Korda is at his best writing about his family and the famous and/or notorious people he has met. His style in &quot;Another Life&quot; is ponderous, over-explanatory, S L O W. He's trying to educate the reader about the publishing business AND do his name dropping tricks at the same time and it's a bad fit. After the first half, when I realized there was to be more exposition on book publishing, I started to skip parts and was relieved when I finished the book. And despite the protestations of humility, the author comes across as a snob and elitist. In his elliptical way, we he lets us know all about his positive attributes, but we are left to wonder about what he omits about his private life, mentioning such a minimum. For a book about other people, there was too much about the author, too much about HIS business career and too little about other lives."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I was surprised to find such varied reviews of this book which I consider one of the most enjoyable I've read in years, as gripping in its way as the best novel particularly for those interested in how publishing changed in past decades. I believe this book would be valuable for any author struggling to understand publishing today. I find puzzling some reviewer's comments condemning its writing which I considered (as an author) professional indeed (just goes to show....). Possibly they sought what the book isn't. Certainly it's not a tell all autobiography, comments on his personal (family) life being restrained. But obviously he wrote the book he intended: a narrative of his life in publishing and for this we should be grateful."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Michael Korda is like a garrulous relative at a family gathering who just won't shut up. There are a few (a very few) amusing anecdotes in this overly long tome, but oddly enough, I can't think of any just now. The one about Harold Robbins was sort of interesting, but then again, why would I be interested in Harold Robbins? It was surprising to learn just how much an editor contributes to an author's manuscript (if this is indeed true. Given the apparent size of Korda's ego, I wonder if he places a bit too much importance on his worth.), but after a while the book just gets tiresome and repetitive. Korda seems to have led an interesting (and very privileged) life, and has known a lot of people--too bad he can't convey it in a more interesting manner. And I got a little tired of hearing about what a phenomenally best-selling author he is--although none of his previous books are in print! Given the quality of the writing in this one, I'm not surprised. And the &quot;I'm just a humble editor at heart&quot; schtick at the end of the book just didn't ring true. Korda might be editor-to-the-stars, but humble he is not."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"I loved this book! The stories are hilarious at times -- especially about Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Harold Robbins, and his first boss at Simon and Schuster. I'm an editor myself, so I'm completely biased, but his insight into the editing process and the publishing business is exceptional, and the book was a joy to read. I've been telling people stories from the book, and highly recommend it to anyone who's in the publishing business or who is (or wants to be) a writer or editor.

I bought this book with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised to find myself entertained, informed and completely engaged.

Simon and Schuster editor, Michael Korda, entertains and informs us with his many stories of his early years in the business, and his later years of editing such luminaries as Joan Crawford, Will and Ariel Durant, Jacqueline Sussan (a movie is being made from this chapter), and Tennessee Williams. My only beef with the book, if there is one, is that one wonders how much the editor told &quot;out of school,&quot; and whether or not writers of today who read this will confide in their editors as much as in the past, for fear THEY might be told on later."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"An entertaining, personal and meaty discussion of the high-end world of book publishing in America."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Michael Korda has written a page-turner that offers marvelous insights about people--rich and poor, famous and not-so-famous--in a way that not only entertains the reader but also educates.

It's a great slice of (one-sided) history and a wonderful series of portraits. A definite must read for anyone in the publishing business, or for anyone who just loves books."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"Editors know what grabs people. That's why I'm perplexed that Michael Korda's new tell-all book about his life at Simon &amp; Schuster didn't spend more time on its strong points--the dishy-dish on famous authors and stars. Rather, Korda opted for long, boring analysis on the publishing industry, it's quarter-century of peaks and valleys and ran me through a grammatical blender of too-heady commentary. I enjoyed &quot;Another Life&quot; because of its great, behind-the-scenes snapshots of Jackie Susann, Joan Crawford, Tennessee Williams, Nixon, a Mafia don and others. But Korda destroyed the tempo by reverting back to way-to-long diatribes of inter-office politics and industry lore. My biggest problem was Korda's horrible, infinity-like sentences--don't they teach journalists that it's better to use two short sentences rather than one long one. Korda and his editor drowned us with mega-sentences that were so long--I had to keep going back to re-read what was said just to make sure I understood it. One other thing really got me. An error. Can't believe it got by Korda, who states he's quite the military buff. Where was your editor and fact-checker, Mike? He refers to a &quot;Missouri-class battleship&quot; when writing about a pile of papers on a desk. Mike, you mean &quot;Iowa-class.&quot; The USS Missouri, Iowa, New Jersey and Wisconsin are all &quot;Iowa-class&quot; battleships. How could you dear boy? Finally, there's no chronology here. Korda jumps through the book with some inattention to detail. He never sets a year on many of the happenings so you're never really sure whether he's still talking about the 1960s, 1970s or 80s. At other times he offers cute, heady Mensa-like postures that are not explained. We're all not Euro-heads, Mike. I enjoyed the book but it got rough toward the end, languishing with too much business and not enough gusto. Skipped most of the last 25 pages by the way. This book was tops with character portraits and gossip. Why didn't Korda stay with that positive side?"},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"The editors of Publishers Weekly were right on target in choosing &quot;Another Life&quot; for inclusion in their &quot;100 Best Books for 1999.&quot; In a series of vignettes Korda gives readers a rare glimpse into the vicissitudes of the publishing industry. While the stories will undoubtedly grab the interests of publihers, editors, agents, and writers, their universal appeal will capture book lovers everywhere. Given the never ending game of musical chairs played by editors jumping from house to house, Korda is unique in that he began his career at Simon &amp; Schuster, and like a cork bobbing on a turbulent sea, has remained there for an entire career to become corporate V.P. and editor in chief! Reading the story of Korda's career is enriching because his life touched the lives of so many creative, productive people. His encounters with such personalities as &quot;Swifty&quot; Lazar, Jaqueline Susann, Carlos Casteneda, and Tennessee Williams, to name a few, are described sometimes poignantly, sometimes comically, but always with insight, compassion and a joie de vivre that all add up to a scintillating read. This work is a must for anyone who loves books and is passionate about biography, autobiography, and memoirs."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"As a writer who has published short stories in national magazines and been paid well for some of them, but who in the process of attaining these successes has experienced many rejecton slips from arrogant editors who knocked my abilities as a fiction writer, it's sweet revenge to see a notable and often arrogant editor, who has certainly rejected many capable writers' manuscripts, write badly. I was appalled at how mediocre the writing was in this book, with no life to it at all. One of the most successful literary agents ever once said that he found that charismatic people tend to WRITE with charisma. Well, to judge from Korda's writing, he must have had a charsimadectody, and had all his charisma removed as a child. And what's worse, the substance of what he writes about is uninteresting. You can write well about something interesting, the best thing to do. You can write very well about something boring, and make it interesting. You can write boringly about something very interesting (and make it interesting THAT way). Or you can write boringly about something boring, and be boring, which is what Korda does in this book. I'm amazed how few unique experiences he has had. I haven't been this disappointed since reading Kenneth Tynan's (the legendary English Theater critic) collected letters. There were, astonishingly, no letters in that book worth collecting (save for the one he wrote to Paul McCartney). Same with this book: there were no memories worthy of a memoir."},{"Title":"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People","review":"This book is a fascinating read and hard to put down. The reader gets a whirlwind tour through the editing side of publishing and a multitude of witty and entertaining brief caricatures of people famous in the world of books. But the only person, of the multitude vignetted in the book, who comes through even vaguely like a real human being, is Dick Snyder, one of Korda's bosses. Korda goes through paternity, divorce and prostate cancer with nary a whisper of an emotion.

Not many quality books have been written on life in the army during this time period it is usually the Civil War or way before that. It is easy to understand and tons of details are at your fingertips. It is a researchers dream come true! Packed with 320 pages of solid information that would take a long time to find some place else. The lengthy bibliography alone helped me. I was especially interested in learning about the forts along the Oregon Trail.It talks about many events including Bleeding Kansas, famous commanders, various Indian attacks and campaigns as well as the boring life of isolation and the tedium of routine. The book is from the eyes of civilians', officers, and enlisted men as well as many nationalities. It gives you a variety and large view of life during that time period. It destroys the Hollywood version of typical &quot;pony soldiers&quot; to pieces as it explains the harsh reality. They had a hard life out there in the wilderness.I had one disappointment in reading this book it said that it went to 1861 so I was expecting to read of what happened to the regulars with the coming of the Civil War but not much of this was explained.Also with so much information it was at times to sort it out to what I wanted being sometimes jumbled together. But it's worth reading- every minute of it!"},{"Title":"Army Regulars on the Western Frontier","review":"Unlike previous historical authors, Ball argued that the politics of slavery overwhelmingly predisposed the western mission of the regular army--affecting the hearts and minds of officers and enlisted men both as the nation plunged toward civil war.By adapting the Indian style, the American military was able to eliminate their own casualties and conquer tribes one by one.

Brandon is anxious to win a second chance with Kim, but although the attraction still simmers between them, she seems determined to play it cool.

That's the catch, and the delightful twist to the story: SHE doesn't know that the child HE'S been raising is actually THEIR baby! Confused? Good, because the mystery will keep you turning pages until you fall in love with Brandon and Kim and start cheering them on as they rediscover each other. The story is well written and well paced, with an intriguing, original plot. The hero is warm, endearing and just clumsy enough to keep him from being too perfect.

I enjoy reading books about Mormonism, whether fiction or non-fiction. Because I grew up steeped in Mormonism and Mormon culture, it is an integral part of who I am. But balance is important, and when I read about Mormonism, I try to ensure that I get a good dose of material favorable to the Church in addition to things that might not necessarily be so favorable.This book is far from great literature. Lots of the dialogue is just too cutesy to be real. And many of the situations are as contrived as the many \\"faith-promoting\\" rumors that abound in this culture. Still, it's entertaining and, at 214 pages, it doesn't require a large investment of time. If you decide to read it, you will find yourself rooting for the characters and smiling inwardly when things go their way.This novel could be described as feel-good literature. I like the way the protagonist (Bishop Bishop) easily navigates both his own Mormon culture and that of the non-Mormons who live around him. I know people like this, and I admire their ability to be at ease in such different circles. One thing that disappointed me, though, was that the author chose to make a couple of completely unfair and unnecessary political jabs toward the end of the book. One of these involves a character who accidentally shoots and kills a California condor, which is a protected species. In an effort to trivialize the importance of what has happened, he makes the following outrageous statements, which came close to ruining the mood of the whole book for me:\\"In truth, there were many well meaning people who actually believed that the death of a bird was equal in importance to that of a human being, and even more who believed that the loss of a rare bird was an infinitely greater tragedy than aborting an unborn child. California was a state where politicians pandered to that morally crippled way of thinking.\\"I'm not sure where Davis came up with this connection between the desire to preserve endangered species and support for abortion. In his effort to paint non-religious people as blood-thirsty abortion fiends, he has only managed to make himself look insensitive to the modern plight of mass-extinction, a phenomenon that will detract from the quality of life of human beings in the future by diminishing, little by little, the vast diversity of life with which God has blessed us. Christianity, including Mormonism, places a lot of importance on responsible stewardship of the earth and its living creatures. Indeed, God admonished Adam and Eve and their posterity to \\"replenish the earth\\" in the very first book of the Bible. If Davis is looking to attract people to Mormonism, he should eliminate such ugly and unfair rhetoric from his thought and his writing.PS If you enjoyed this book and want to read something else along similar lines, I highly recommend Kathryn Kidd's Paradise Vue.

So, Price Hal becomes King Henry V and this leads to the next play of that name.The wonderful Falstaff is also on glorious display. This is also the play with the famous tavern scene (Act II, Scene IV) that can be read endlessly with new enjoyment.Everyone has his or her own take on Falstaff and his treatment at the hands of Henry V, but I dislike it even though I understand it. Prince Hal and his transformation into Henry V is not someone I admire a lot. Nor is Falstaff's manner of living, but his wit is so sharp and his intelligence so vast that it is easy to still delight in him.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the &quot;Complete Plays&quot; you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"First off, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Part I and absolutely adored Henry V. Having said that, I found Part II to be enjoyable, yet perhaps leaving something to be desired - like more action. Falstaff and Prince Hal both come off as somewhat disingenuous and calculating Machiavellian individuals. Disappointingly, Falstaff speaks poorly of Prince Hal while unwittingly in his midst. Conversely, The Prince of Wales prematurely takes the crown before his King Henry IV's death as well as disassociating himself with Falstaff after he is crowned King. These instances, along with others throughout the play, show the self-serving tendencies of both characters.However, we can proudly witness the maturation of the young King from wild & dissolute young Prince Hal into one of the most revered monarchs in English history, King Henry V. Part II remains an intriguing play due to its paradoxical nature, yet unfortunately rarely acted out today. Now that I have read Henry IV(I&II;) for the first time, I gladly move on to one of my personal favorites, Henry V. I recommend both parts(Folger editions) for all Shakespeare enthusiasts - they have given me greater insight into the young Henry V - when he was more concerned with downing a pint of ale rather than downing the French at Agincourt.2 Magnificent Quotes from Henry IV Part II -\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" - King Henry IV\\"He hath eaten me out of house and home.\\" - Mistress Quickly"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Believe it or not, Shakespeare's funniest play will be found in the Histories section of your Complete Works. That's not to say this is a comedy, but the group of characters gathering at the tavern represent the Bard's supreme comic achievement. Falstaff and the future King Henry V will have you laughing out loud. However, in the serious main plot, which picks up from the previous play, Richard II, the Percys are leading a rebellion against the usurping King Henry IV. The rebellion continues into the next play, but the Battle of Shrewbury marks an important point in Henry's reign, and serves as a fitting end to Henry IV Part 1. The play is a complete unity unto itself, but I recommend you read the complete series (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V) in order to get the most out a very exciting and entertaining cycle. I usually recommend the Arden editions, but in this case the Oxford is superior. David Bevington is clearly one of the top editors in the field, and his notes help smooth over the rough spots in the text, especially the comic scenes which really need to be seen or heard to be fully appreciated. In that respect the Arkangel Audio version of the play is excellent."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"One of the more influential Shakespearean histories. Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like \\"The Lion King\\") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M.

I want (and will pay for) Folger's typesetting, editing, front matter and text notes - none of which are included here. In addition the typography of this electronic version is the worst I've ever seen. Every Kindle owner is used to occasional layout and typograhic quirks but this is literally unreadable. The font switches between Times Roman and Courier seemingly at random. Anyone who *is* looking for an ebook of Henry IV.2 would be better served with one of the many free versions on the web. Please fix this, Amazon. Do not serve this up as a \\"Kindle edition\\" of a book that is not. Better yet, drop this piece of ill-formated trash from you store entirely."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"In Part One of Shakespeare's \\"Henry IV,\\" the titular king tries to defend his throne from a rebel army led by the hotheaded Hotspur, who has a long list of grievances about the king's treatment of his family, the Percys. Hotspur has allied himself with several principal figures including his uncle the Earl of Worcester, his brother-in-law Mortimer the Earl of March, Lord Douglas the Scot, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh chieftain with a vivid mystical imagination -- he is so egotistical that he insists an earthquake that occurred the day of his birth was a divine proclamation of his importance -- and a desire to usurp all of Wales from the king.While he is preparing for war against the rebels, Henry IV laments that his own son Henry (Hal), the Prince of Wales, is a shameful libertine living the high life in London and consorting with a gang of scurrilous miscreants. Indeed, Prince Hal's idea of fun is robbing people, and his best friend and accomplice in this activity is Sir John Falstaff, who turns out to be not Hal's peer but a middle-aged man. In a character transformation of an abruptness that can only be described as magical, Hal becomes a serious young man determined loyally to defend his father's kingship from Hotspur's assault after he receives an earnest lecture from his father about the dangers of acting irresponsibly as a public figure.Not enough can be said about Falstaff, who is undoubtedly one of the most richly realized characters in literature. He is fat, lazy, cowardly, yet boastful, but not in the same way Owen Glendower is -- Owen really believes what he says; Falstaff is just trying to make himself look better than he actually is, but fools nobody because he prevaricates and embellishes without bothering to remember his previous lies for the sake of consistency. You probably know somebody like this in real life -- especially if you're ten years old. Falstaff's piquancy, in fact, so outweighs the stature of the other characters that his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry. In their confrontation on the battlefield, it seems unlikely that Hal, who wasted many of his best days living as a rake, could conquer a seasoned warrior like Hotspur in a swordfight. But there wouldn't be much of a tale to tell if not to show Hal triumphing after his resolution to change his weak habits, and the play ends with the conviction that, despite his past mistakes, he would make a noble king himself."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"This is about Folger Shakespeare Library. I read Hamlet, Tempest and Henry IV Part I and Part II in their editions, as well as Antony and Cleopatra, and Merchant of Venice.Folger Library editions provide almost line by line commentary, as well as longer commentaries to certain more obscure places in the text; also there are articles about Shakespeare's language and historical context for each play.I read \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" in \\"The Annotated Shakespeare\\" edition as well, so I can compare: Folger Library editions provide much more commentaries and other material, including even some pictures from medieval and Renaissance books which are relevant to the text of a particular play."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"The young Hal and his instructor in the art of living the good life , Falstaff cavort through the first half of Henry IV as if life were going to be one long , irresponsible entertainment.

I wish I had seen all three plays, in sequence, but would I have appreciated them at that stage in life?"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare hated war but he loved victory. There's no question that Shakespeare fully appreciates military valor. The last play in the four part cycle, Henry V, testifies to this, not least with the famous \\"Once more into the breach\\" and \\"Band of brothers\\" speeches.But Shakespeare's greatest literary creation is perhaps the lovable rogue Falstaff. Falstaff is a Shakespearean fool, an anti-hero, a lovable villain. He voices opinions that no one would dare tell others. He can do this because he is a fool and isn't taken seriously by the king and princes above him. But audiences listen approvingly to his wisdom, and Falstaff thinks honor is for losers.\\"Thou owest God a death\\" says his friend Prince Hal as he leaves.\\"'Tis not due yet\\" says Falstaff left alone with the audience. \\"I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is honor? A word. What is that word honor? Air - a trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died on Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No.\\"King Henry IV faces a revolution led by Henry Percy known as Hotspur. There's no question that Hotspur is noble, valorous, courageous and of course honorable. Henry IV wishes that this Henry in fact were is own son, rather then the rakish prince also called Henry. This Henry Hotspur is full of fire and verve. Yet as honorable as he is, he fights on the wrong side and dies. There lies honor, vindicating Falstaff.Certainly Hotspur fights for a cause: he believes Henry IV to have usurped the crown, but he values martial honor above all, even above the deep love he feels for his wife. If a war serves a greater purpose, then the men who fight deserve our esteem, gratitude and respect. Honor is honorable. But if a man fights only for honor as an end in itself, he is a fool and in a just ordered world, he will lose.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"This edition offers a strongly theatrical perspective on the origins of The First Part of King Henry IV and the history of its interpretation. In their introduction the editors clarify the play's surprising, decentralized dramatic structure, questioning the recent assumption that the drama focuses on the education of Prince Hal. They call attention to the effects of civil war on a broad range of relationships. Falstaff's unpredictable vitality is explored, together with important contemporary values of honor, friendship, festivity and reformation. (by Abe)Oxford World Classics are sturdy and beautifully laid out. I love my hard copy of this classic. Kbooks says: \\"During Shakespeare's lifetime, Henry IV was his most popular play. Today, Sir John Falstaff still towers above Shakespeare's other comic inventions. This edition considers the play in the context of various critical approaches, offers a history of the play in performance from Shakespeare's time to ours, and provides useful information on its historical background. Readers will also find detailed commentary on individual words and phrases, and selections from Shakespeare's sources."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"In the previous installment of Shakespeare's \\"Henriad\\", \\"Henry IV Part 1\\", we waited to see if Prince Hal would shake the corrupting influence of Falstaff and prove worthy of the throne. In \\"Part 2\\" we get to chew our spinach twice. Hal still stands at the same crossroads, Falstaff still tugging at his ankles.For me, that's the weakest element of \\"Henry IV Part 2\\", the warmed-over central plot. What makes \\"Part 2\\" terrific anyway is just about everything else. Structurally, \\"Part 2\\" is shambolic compared to \\"Part 1,\\" almost two stories entirely with Hal and Falstaff brought together only once, briefly, before the end. But individual scenes of the play shine with first-class Shakespearean luster, and \\"Part 2\\"'s thematic quality is singularly complicated in a way that confuses initially but rewards a second reading.Hal is still the prince, and still in poor odor with his father despite his heroics in \\"Part 1.\\" He must find his own way to glory while a civil war rages. Meanwhile, Falstaff schemes to take advantage of both the war and his friends for the sake of filling his gut.In the idiosyncratic way of this play, we begin with neither player onstage, but rather \\"Rumor, painted full of tongues\\", who sets up an opening scene featuring the rebel Earl of Northumberland, who as it turns out will play no major role in the proceedings and will leave in Act 2. It's like Shakespeare is playing with our expectations. Then he does the same to the characters. Time and again, we will see them tripped up by \\"smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.\\"Only Hal seems immune with his simple maxim: \\"Let the end try the man.\\"While Shakespeare worked hard to keep Hal at the center of things in \\"Part 1,\\" the character doesn't seem as well-integrated into the story here. The rebellion is dealt with this time without Hal taking an active part, or even being on stage. Falstaff carries the narrative bulk of the play almost entirely on his wide shoulders, his mischief providing amusing counterpoint to the cold-blooded realpolitik around him.Falstaff is helped this time by a supporting cast all his own, including slatternly Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly, the latter of whom introduces the phrase: \\"Do me, do me, do me\\" to the lexicon of Shakespearean quotation. The humor is more ribald here than it was in \\"Part 1\\", and more morbid, too. The first Falstaff joke is that he had his urine tested and the urine is found to be in better shape than its owner.These episodes, and another where King Henry IV soliloquizes about his lack of sleep (\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown\\"), are wonderful enough when read in isolation, enough to not mind that these story pieces never quite come together. The play's two masterstrokes both involve sharp reverses from what we have been led to expect, and though I feel the first is set up much better, they both leave an imprint on you while reading and line up with the message of \\"smooth comforts false\\" we were given at the start.A bridge between two better plays, \\"Henry IV Part 2\\" has its own special qualities and is very much worth reading - so long as you don't read it out of order."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" was one of Shakespeare's greatest successes in his lifetime, and has remained pre-eminently popular to this day. But each century has had its own version of what it is about.For Elizabethans, it was Falstaff and his merry pranks. For the 18th century, it was Hotspur and his proud nobility. More recently, the pendulum swung back to Falstaff, but this time as a tragic exponent of relativistic realism, a clown who understands his place as cosmic punchline.But as David Bevington points out in his introduction to my Bantam edition, the real central figure is the guy who encapsulates the best of both Falstaff and Hotspur, young Prince Hal. In \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\", he is the dissolute heir to the throne, living the fast life of drink and crime (petty and otherwise) with the dubious aid of his pal Falstaff, a fat coward who lives only to fill his purse and gut. Can Hal break out of his seeming tailspin and aid his father, the title character Henry IV, before the king loses his throne in a civil war?Bevington's point is Hal represents the true center of this play, the character for whom Hotspur and Falstaff represent opposite ends of an ideal monarch. Not for Hal the opportunistic legacy of his grasping father, \\"this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke\\" as Hotspur calls him, not without cause, early in the play. Hal must be his own self-made man, pulled from disparate parts, and \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" shows him at the start of his rather Machiavellian journey.\\"So when this loose behavior I throw off/And pay the debt I never promised/...By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,\\" he declares, less as a cunning rogue a la Shakespeare's Richard III and more as a cagey modern-day spin-doctor aware of how unsteadily his father's kingdom rests.Philosophy aside, \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is a worthwhile reading experience because it is packed with so much fun. You have low comedy, battles, court intrigue, and fast-flowing dialogue with sharp twists and turns. \\"I can call spirits from the vasty deep!\\" brags the mystical Welsh rebel Glendower, to which Hotspur replies: \\"Why, so can I, or so can any man. But will they come when you do call for them?\\"Others seem more inclined these days to gravitate to Falstaff. I enjoy Falstaff's comedy, and his undeniable relativism sets him up as an Elizabethan figure more grounded in the 21st century than the 16th (\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is set in the early 1400s, but was first produced around 1597), but as a personality he's about as callous as they come, at one point collecting a bunch of wretches to die in war so he can collect money from others who would have gone in their stead. Hal actually seems more attracted to Hotspur, the figure I find more compelling. Hotspur's an idealist, but entirely too mule-headed for serious statescraft. He's undone not so much by his enemies but his allies, including his shifting uncle and irresolute father.Hal here combines Hotspur's sense of a higher mission with Falstaff's pragmatic commonness to launch himself as a political man. \\"I'll so offend to make offense a skill/Redeeming time when men least think I will\\", he says early on. It's ironic how much more at ease Prince Hal would be in our era, running for office, than in his own, where the crown, if not attendant legitimacy, could be inherited. This is one of many things that makes \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" such a timeless pleasure."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing.

Royalty is allowed moments of glory: Henry IV in his berating of Hal and Hal in his response and in his speech banishing Falstaff. Hal is given to some complex emotions when he picks up the crown lying next to his dying father. Northumberland surprises with a sudden spark, punning \\"Hotspur, Coldspur?\\" at the news that his son may be dead.Falstaff continues to be a magician creating reality from words. (This may be the main reason he is so fun to be around). Enigmatically, this corrupt liar, coward and a thief through and through manages to remain appealing. By contrast, our opinion of John of Lancaster is immediately sunk with the singular unseemly scene in which he cons the rebels.Of course, Falstaff is not as much a black magician as Richard III, who in a course of one speech, convinced Lady Ann, whose husband he killed, to be romantically interested in him. Falstaff's magic is not as sinister, but in it he is similarly effective, as when in a course of a short conversation, he convinces the Hostess, who is asking him to repay what he owes her, to lend him more.His prose does not make him as elegantly spoken as some better versed Shakespearean characters, but it is nicely of a piece with his remarkable internal freedom.Falstaff is fascinating: deeply flawed, he is appealing well beyond his deserves. Maybe by admiring Falstaff, we learn to be a bit more forgiving of human imperfections in us and others..."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"The copy is very nice.

In 1 \\"Henry IV,\\" King Henry IV stopped the rebellion by Hotspur, Worcestor, and Vernon. But his enemy Northumberland remained a threat. This brings us to the 2 \\"Henry IV.\\"Despite the title, the real star of this play is Falstaff. One minor complaint I have is that while Falstaff could probably handle the play, some of his scenes do get too drawn out. Moving on, Northumberland reappears, and he is of course sad over the death of his son Hotspur. (Slain by Prince Henry in 1 \\"Henry IV.\\") We also meet the Arch Bishop of York who becomes an enemy of Henry IV. The Arch Bishop delivers a striking passage that emphasizes that the past and the future always seem better than the present.In Act 2, we quickly learn that Falstaff has built up some debts and he is neglecting his duties to the king. (Big surprise!) Prince Henry is a back stage player for the early part of the play, but rather than being close to Falstaff (as he was in Part 1), he bitterly rebukes Falstaff for his lifestyle. Also, Prince Henry does express concern over his father's failing health. But he is afraid he will be thought of as a hypocrite if he shows it.Interestingly, a woman named Doll begins to find Falstaff attractive. King Henry IV does not enter until 3.1, and we can see that the rebellions have taken their toll on him. He can only talk of the tribulations of royalty. It is even possible that he feels he deserves these sorrow and afflictions for stealing the crown from Richard II. (Richard II's consolation prize.)Later, Falstaff gathers his men together in a well drawn comical scene. Westmoreland and Henry IV's son Lancaster defeat the rebellion of the Arch Bishop of York, Mowbray, and Hastings in a less than honorable way. But this is not an invention of Shakespeare's. It did happen.In 4.3, Coleville surrenders to our favorite rogue Falstaff. It is comical when Falstaff comments that Lancaster is so uptight because he doesn't drink. But the sad part of the play returns soon enough.Henry IV's health fails, and he can not enjoy his victory. (This does constitute a small consolation prize for Richard II.) Some people dislike Henry V for banishing Falstaff, but Henry V had little choice. The actions of Falstaff (as comical and lovable as he is) are downright criminal. Though, Shakespeare promises us that he will return in another play.

This play is clearly the dramatization of a struggle for a kingdom, but it is equally the story of Hal's wild and reckless youthful adventures with Falstaff and other disreputable companions.Shakespeare did not write his plays about English kings in chronological order, but these plays do have a historical unity. It is helpful (but not essential) to read the tetralogy Richard II, Henry IV Part 1 and 2, and Henry V in chronological order. Whatever route you take, I highly recommend buying a companion copy of Peter Saccio's &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;, an engaging look at how Shakespeare revised history to achieve dramatic effect.A wide selection of Henry IV editions are available, including older editions in used bookstores. I am familiar with a few and have personal favorites:The New Folger Library Shakespeare is my first choice among the inexpensive editions of Henry IV. &quot;New&quot; replaces the prior version in use for 35 years. It uses &quot;facing page&quot; format with scene summaries, explanations for rare and archaic words and expressions, and Elizabethan drawings located on the left page; the Henry IV text is on the right. I particularly liked the section on &quot;Reading Shakespeare's Language in Henry IV&quot; and Alexander Legget's literary analysis (save this until you have read the play). The fascinating article &quot;Historical Background: Sir John Falstaff and Sir John Oldcastle&quot; adds a religious dimension to the play that I had not previously noted.The Bedford Shakespeare Series provides an excellent study text (edited by Barbara Hodgdon) titled &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;. It is a little more expensive, is about 400 pages, and provides a broad range of source and context documentation. It would be excellent for an upper level course in Shakespeare. The context documentation is fascinating and informative; it ranges from the Holinshed Chronicles to Elizabethan writing on Civic Order to detailed cultural studies of London's diverse populous. Other chapters address the OldCastle controversy and the &quot;Education of a Prince&quot;.I also like the Norton Critical edition (edited by James Sanderson), &quot;Henry the Fourth, Part 1&quot;, particularly for its extensive collection of literary criticism. The essays are divided into two parts: 1) the theme, characters, structure, and style of the play and 2) a wide variety of interpretation directed toward that roguish character, Sir John Falstaff."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am comparing it to other Shakespeare. Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this book five stars, I'm saying it's one of the best of the best.As a matter of fact, it isn't unusual for Shakespeare's \\"histories\\" to be more interesting to the modern reader than either his comedies or his tragedies; they fit the modern style that doesn't insist that comedies must have everything work out well in the end, or that tragedies must be deadly serious with everyone dying at the end, as was the convention in Shakespeare's time. Thus, this book has a serious plot, real drama, and blood and destruction, yet still has many extremely funny scenes. And as Shakespearean plays go, it's a fairly easy read, although in places the footnotes are still neccessary. The only caveat I will make is that one needs to remember not to consider Shakespeare's histories particularly historical; they have about as much historical accuracy as the Disney version of Pocahontas. Treat them as excellent stories based (very) loosely on history, and you'll do fine.It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare was writing that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for. Granted, there is enough seriousness to satisfy the intelligensia, but there is generally enough action and bawdy humor to satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they could understand it, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. I don't think I'll hold my breath waiting."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; shows King Henry IV dealing with complex problems: England is in the midst of civil unrest, as the Percy family, angered by their treatment after unwittingly helping Henry IV ascend to the throne, threatens to depose the monarch. At home, Henry IV is despairing over the development of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Prince Henry consorts with thieves, rogues, and scoundrels - his scandalous personal relationships seem to threaten the King's peace of mind more than the state of his kingdom.Aside from these larger concerns that frame the play, &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; deals more with Prince Henry than it does with the monarch of the title. Throughout the play, Prince Henry is seen more amongst the rabble commoners than attending to matters of state. He is guided in his licentiousness by the enormously funny (pun intended) Sir John Falstaff, whose schemes and drunkenness are more innocent and endearing in Part I than they become in Part II.Falstaff's reckless and conceited behaviour casts a shadow over the entire play, symbolic as it is of Prince Henry's moral dilemma and of the precarious state of the nation. Falstaff instantly calls to mind Kenneth Grahame's magnificent Mr. Toad from &quot;The Wind in the Willows,&quot; and is Toad's direct literary forefather. Falstaff is the most interesting and dynamic figure in &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; and certainly the most memorable character in the play.Prince Henry discovers that his responsibilities outweigh his fondness for Spanish wine, and is called to lead the King's army against that of the arrogant 'Hotspur' Percy, himself a rising political force. Their confrontation, brilliantly scripted and enacted, is central to Shakespeare's entire Lancaster-York saga, and should be read closely and with special attention.Of the two parts of &quot;Henry IV,&quot; Part I is by far the best and most flawlessly executed. The King's problems provide an adequate backdrop for the development of Prince Henry; 'Hotspur' is an excellent antagonist (with the whole Percy family offering a great contrast with that of the King); and Falstaff performs his role without dominating the play, as he tends to in Part II. Shakespeare does not need my praise or endorsement, but his &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; blows me away. It is absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"To get as much as you can out of this play, you MUST read &quot;Richard II&quot; first. Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in &quot;Richard II&quot; (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and comical touches. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Of all Shakespeare's histories, Henry IV, part I is the best. It is the first of three plays that examines the ascension of the great King Henry V. Here, we see a young Prince Hal as a troublemaker and a &quot;royal pain&quot; (pun intended), who hangs out in taverns with drunkards and derelicts. But we also see a young man who realizes his destiny and knows that the time will come when he will have to be a strong king for England's sake. The play is more than just one person's rise. It examines English society in atime of great instability and civil strife. It examines the role of family (fathers and sons, brothers, and uncles and nephews). This play is a reflection of Shakespeare at his finest and everyone should read at least this play, whether or not they love Shakespeare or not. It is worth the read. (and it is a rather simple read, too.)"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them. He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character. These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories. There are more comedic parts in them for one thing. The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V). We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development. He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible. King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler. He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II. In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death. The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry. The play leads us to \\"King Henry V\\". Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader. Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V. It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Having just completed Henry IV Part I, I must say that I came away delighted and impressed with Shakespeare's genius once again. Shakespeare's ability to intertwine the arduous dichotomy of the impcomparable comedy of Falstaff and the meaningful history of Henry IV, Prince Hal, & Hotspur is impressive to say the least. It comes as no surprise that this was one of Shakespeare's most popularly staged plays during his day and enjoyed an unusually long stage run.Falstaff is undoubtedly the most infamously famous literary comic character in the history of English literature. The scenes of him being robbed by Prince Hal, feigning his death, stabbing the already deceased Hotspur in the leg while claiming victory, and his employment of beggars as his foot soldiers galvanize the comic aspect of the play and make for a hilarious & farcical sublot. Interestingly, in the bar in Eastcheap, Prince Hal alludes to his future persecution of Falstaff when he is crowned king.I strongly recommend Henry IV Part I to all Shakespeare aficionados seeing as I deem it in the top five of all Shakespeare's works along with Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, & Henry V. Now on to Part II. Adieu.\\"The better part of valor is discretion.\\" - Falstaff"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot; concerns the triumphant decline of King Henry IV, and the ascension of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to the throne as King Henry V. As in &quot;Henry IV Part I,&quot; Part II's main action concerns the attempts of the King to suppress civil strife, which is manifested once again in threatened rebellion. In &quot;Henry IV Part II,&quot; the rebels are led by Scroop, the Archbishop of York, the most powerful religious figure in England. The Archbishop's involvement &quot;turns insurrection to religion,&quot; thereby hoping to gain popular support and enlistment in the army against Henry IV.Henry, Prince of Wales, as the next in line to the throne, is expected to take a hard line against these threats, and lead the charge against the rebel forces. However, as in Part I, Prince Henry is nervous, as a young man will be, about accepting responsibility for himself, much less for an entire nation. A frivolous youth, he associates with the common folk in bars and taverns, led in his debaucheries by the notoriously comic Sir John Falstaff. The dichotomy between Prince Henry's father figures, the frail, but courageous King Henry IV and the robust, but cowardly Falstaff sets up the scope of the choice Prince Henry must make. His choice, he comes to realize, will affect the course of his country.The forces mount as the play moves forward - the King's army is ordered, well-equipped, and led by formidable generals - the Archbishop's army is made up largely of untrained citizens. The meeting of the armies' leaders in the Gaultree Forest of Yorkshire is the emotional and tactical climax of the play, and handled with dramatic precision by Shakespeare.The growth of Prince Henry, the shaping of his mind, his relationships with his noble father and brothers, as well as those with his low, vulgar drinking buddies, forms the focus of &quot;Henry IV Part II.&quot; Through five deceptively simple acts, Shakespeare illustrates the birth of a man and a king, and points the way to domestic peace. This is a play I enjoyed very much indeed, and would recommend reading alongside &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; for maximum effect."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"This is the play where the Percy rebellion begins and centers around the Achilles-like Hotspur. Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character. King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur. Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten. Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff. His wit and gut are featured in full. When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the \\"Complete Plays\\" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"My only complaint about &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; is that Shakespeare draws the scenes with Falstaff out too much (in my opinion). Falstaff is funnier than ever. King Henry IV's younger son Lancaster is a very striking figure. While his father is ill, he commands the forces against his father's enemies. 3.1 where King Henry IV contemplates the consequences of the crown he usurped from Richard II is quite moving. The scene where Lancaster crushes the last of his father's opposition is quite chilling. I can not overestimate Shakespeare's genious in how he handles Henry IV in this play. In &quot;Richard II&quot; his ambition and cruelty for the most part never ceased. In &quot;1 Henry IV,&quot; he showed himself to be a competent (and even likeable) king. In this play, he clearly regrets and suffers for his actions against Richard II. (Even if we remember his cruelty in &quot;Richard II,&quot; it is hard not to feel sorry for him at this point.) The scene where King Henry IV has his final talk with the eventual Henry V is one of the most moving passages in literature. King Henry V's complete reform is not only well drawn, but it helps prepare us for the next play, &quot;Henry V.&quot; But if you want to see more of Falstaff, remember he has the lead role in the later play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot;"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's play King Henry includes comedy, history, and passion. You may find yourself to side with the rebels and cheer on Lord Percy. The only downside to reading Henry IV part one, is that you might have to do your homework to understand what is going on in this era. After reading this play, go see it in the theater if you can!"},{"Title":"Henry IV, Part 2 (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"i liked it that hal killed hotspur because in the movie hotspur was ugly and disgusting. everytime i looked at him i felt like i wanted to puke."},{"Title":"AAA 1999 Mexico Travel Book","review":"Places to go, and places to visit in diferents cities (museums, parks, restaurants, etc).The book is a very good guide to find hotels, car rent, bus stations, and the best, all prices typed.This is ideal for adventure people who like meet unknown and fantastic places in this country.Sorry, my english is really not good."},{"Title":"Clymer Mercruiser: Stern Drive Shop Manual : 1995-1997 Alpha One, Bravo One, Bravo Two & Bravo Three","review":"I opened the book on my kitchen table. Looks good, with lots of details. For example, when replacing the impeller in an Alpha outdrive, there are lots of careful photos and line drawings to guide you through the process.I took the book outside to start working; within 15 minutes, the pages started coming out. Soon entire sections were falling out. The binding is worthless. Once I drilled holes in the book and put it in a 3-ring binder, it worked fine.Details can be a bit more sketchy when performing more complex maintenance (e.g. &quot;remove any accessories that will be in the way of removing the valve cover, then remove the bolts). I suppose that if you are going to work on rockers or remove heads, they assume you have some skills and confidence! However, the instructions are clear and lead you through the process.Overall, the book is good, and similar to the Haynes or Chiltons auto repair manuals. Although the book covers several engines and outdrives, it does a good job of keeping them straight. I would recommend this book to the &quot;shade tree&quot; mechanic who wants to work on the engine and outdrive with confidence (or at least be able to speak knowledgably to the mechanic)."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages Audio CD: The Secret to Love That Lasts","review":"This is the most helpful book on relationships EVER written!

Cavafy: Collected Poems","review":"As with any poems translated from a language I have never learned, I am left wondering just how close Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard have come to the original style and substance of C.P. Cavafy, the great Alexandrian Greek poet of the early 20th century. (Keeley and Sherrard are scrupulous in their end notes, noting untranslatable words and the original rhyme schemes of poems translated into free verse.) Even in translation, these poems are exquisite, haunting both my dreams and my waking thoughts. Cavafy essentially had only a few subjects, but they were great ones--the lost glory of antiquity, the inevitable decline of the mighty, the death of love and beauty, the folly of human striving, the crucial importance of memory and history. In language of deceptive simplicity, he limned the ephemeral nature of beautiful things and the empty spaces their loss leaves in the soul. (Cavafy, openly gay at a time when homosexuality was truly the love that dare not speak its name, wrote only of lost, passing or unrequited love.) Most of these poems are very short, but they insinuate themselves inextricably into memory, such as \\"The Mirror in the Front Hall,\\" depicting a handsome young man who stops to straighten his tie: \\"the old mirror was all joy now,/proud to have embraced/total beauty for a few moments.\\" My own favorite in the book is one of the longer poems, \\"Orophernis,\\" about a wastrel king of the 2nd Century B.C. who came to grief trying to be a real king for once. The final five lines of this poems are Cavafy in a nutshell;The figure on this four drachma coin,a trace of whose young charm can still be seen,a ray of his poetic beauty--this sensuous commemoration of an Ionian boy,this is Orophernis, son of Ariarathis."},{"Title":"C.

Visita de la Presentacion, too is marked on the books map far from the given longitude and latitude. This of course makes me wonder how many other coordinates are faulty. Minor errors may be undetectable on the map, but can be quite aggravating on site I suppose.Still I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Missions of Baja California. Just don't rely on it when you want to go there."},{"Title":"Las Misiones Antiguas: The Spanish Missions of Baja California","review":"A very good guide to the missions of Baja.

Belgium. Everything else was suitable to the subject matter and entertaining."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"In Mark Macy's books, the author encourages us to stretch the \\"mental model\\" which we use to view the world(s) --- both our physical world and the spiritual world as well.His previous book, Conversations Beyond The Light, documents the early miracles of Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC) ---contact between the two worlds made possible by using technical equipment.Macy's latest release, Miracles In The Storm, provides further examples of spiritual contacts from the afterlife (\\"the other side\\".) Macy also details the frustrating inability to maintain a harmonic group of ITC researchers on THIS side.I was fascinated by both books. Macy's insights into human nature combine with historical reporting of significant breakthroughs to provide a most enlightening experience.If you are not familiar with the miracles of ITC, I recommend strongly that you read both Conversations Beyond The Light and Miracles in the Storm, and suggest you first read Conversations, to introduce you to ITC. The latest release, Miracles, deals more with the human failure to work harmoniously toward the common goal of ITC, despite good intentions, tireless efforts, and Macy's positive attitude.If you spend any time thinking about what comes after death, you owe it to yourself to learn about ITC. These books have totally changed my outlook on what happens after the physical body dies.It is entirely possible that ITC research can bridge the divide that Macy refers to as \\"the centuries-old chasm between science and spirit, between doubt and faith.\\" Contacts with the spirit world are now recorded on tape, film, and in computer files. The gap is narrowing, thanks to the work of Mark Macy and his colleagues."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"It takes a lot to boggle my mind, but this book did. I have read hundreds of accounts of paranormal activity, but the activity summarized in this book is really amazing.I was aware of EVP (electronic voice phenomena) and assumed that ITC (Instrumental Transcommunication) was just another name for it. It isn't, however. ITC involves much more detailed, more direct, and more profound information coming from the spirit world. We're talking spirit messages via computer (not attached to the internet), by phone calls (which the phone company has no record of), and by faxes from nowhere.As I read the book, I constantly viewed it with a skeptical eye. However, author Macy comes across as very sincere, dedicated,discerning, and credible in his observations and reporting of them. I find it difficult to believe that he and the number of reputable scientists involved in ITC research could have been duped over and over again for years on end.Over many years of reading and personal research, I am convinced of the reality of a spirit world. I believe in spirit materialization and spirit communication. If all of the other things I have encountered, e.g., materializations, apports, levitations, direct-voice mediumship, trance mediumship, etc., are real, I see no reason to draw the line and say that ITC is beyond belief.The pseudo-skeptics will certainly smirk, scoff, and snicker in their usual closed-minded,arrogant, vainglorious, and pompous manner, but that is their problem. For the open-minded person who believes that there is more to this world than the material, this book has much to offer."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"When a publisher's copy of Miracles in the Storm arrived in the post for review, I wasn't expecting much from it. I couldn't quite see the relevance. Until I read the book, that is.I became totally engrossed in the fascinating account Mark Macy gives of how the ITC team here on earth have struggled to find the right balance between the trust and teamwork required of them by the group they are working with on the other side, called 'Timestream', and their desire for hard scientific 'proof' to wow the world. I should add that the Timestream group includes departed souls who worked as empirical scientists on earth; however, these former scientists now have a clearer understanding of science as 'knowing' in the sense of embracing a truth,rather than trying to capture it.Acceptable 'proof' of inter-dimensional communication has been the spin-off of experimenters like Macy having their hearts and minds open to Timestream. As Mark Macy writes in the preface: \\"We humans come to trust the opinions of people on Earth who exhibit those qualities consistently over a long period of time, and it is natural, then, for us to extend the same trust to our spirit friends.\\"ITC traces its history back to the 'spiricon' voice on tape experiments made by George Meek and Bill O'Neil in the United States in the 1970s. The contact centre then shifted to the home of Maggy Harsch-Fischbach and her husband Jules in Luxembourg. They had been inspired by the work of Meek and a German experimenter Hans-Otto Koenig to set up tape recorders in theirhome in 1985 and it was not long before they were recording communications from a group of departed souls from Earth, working under the guidance and protection of a delightfully wise and knowledgeable ethereal being.Maggie Harsch-Fischbach has often asked the brilliant being who guides the Timestream project about himself, or herself. Here is an excerpt from the information she received:\\"Our existence is beyond your comprehension. It's easier for us to explain to you what we are not. Not human, nor animal, nor male, nor female, nor light being, nor, of course, God. There are seven of us, and although we are individual beings with individual natures, we are fused together. Many beings such as we live together in small groups, or clusters, as we exist in subtle realms where such boundaries as skin and ego, which separate physical beings in your world, do not exist. We are in ethereal realms of spacelessness and timelessness where beings who resonate with one another can join together in common existence, if they so choose. Many of the great beings who have walked your planet, such as Jesus Christ, Mohammed and Gautama Buddha, return home to live in ethereal clusters in our realm,which, from your perspective, is very close to God.\\"Names are of no importance to us. As they are important to you, you may call me Technician, as my role in this project is that of a technician to facilitate contact between worlds.\\"Do I accept this? In trying to answer that, I am drawn to ask, \\"What does it mean to be true to oneself?\\" And the answer for me is to be loyal to the relationships and path in life that one has chosen voluntarily, at the right time for choosing, around the age of 28 to 35. My chosen relationship is with the party surrounding Jesus - Peter particularly. It is a relationship that I have found to be open to all possibilities, including that of Jesus having come out of and returningto an ethereal diffusion that is as much home to Gautama the Buddha and Mohammed and the being who is known as Technician by the Timestream and ITC groups. They take etheric, astral and physical form when on assignment, with Jesus' assignment as the Christ Messiah having been particularly difficult, because of its centrality in history, to draw history to a close, by allowing himself to be imaged on a cross, as a brother andfriend. An image that is branded on all our souls, reaching deep into every nook and cranny of our all too human, compromised hearts. To awaken demons and enlighten hope.Quite some sentences there. Never mind. I let them stand in the spirit of Christmas sharing. And balance them out with this insight into the new impulse that has been seeded in the human heart. It is drawn from an exchange between the German physicist Ernst Senkowski and a member of the audience during apresentation of ITC organised by Mark Macy:\\"Matter and energy are not basic components of reality, as we have been taught,\\" said Ernst Senkowsky: \\"They only exist in our minds, or call it spirit or consciousness. The modern term would be 'information'. Matter, energy and everything else are special forms of 'information.\\" A young woman stood up, \\"You mean reality is all in our head?\\" she asked, to get a laugh. \\"Obviously the world is not in our head,\\" replied Ernst. \\"It is part of the nonlocal mind. On the other hand, if we learned to 'play' with our minds, we could be wizards, creating and changing the things around us.\\"That is what the new world order could be about. However, it requires cleared hearts and enlightened minds, which is what the now past age under the cross of terror and liberation has opened the way for, for peacemakers,not warmongers.I want you to know that when reading Miracles in the Storm, at times it felt like I was holding light in my hands. Thank you Mark Macy, I was struck by the sincerity of your witness. And I read what you and your small ITC group were doing as tentatively branching out in an unfolding spiritual science, by which we will yet come to live in a resurrected world of love, truth and purity of heart.(...)"},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"\\"It can only work when the vibrations of those present are in complete harmony, and when their aims and intentions are pure\\". This is the message of &quot;Miracles in the Storm&quot;, by Mark Macy, and it is unquestionably a book that will wake the sleeping mind.Miracles in the Storm is about the miracle of Instrumental TransCommunication (ITC) and the ensuing conflicts within a global Instrumental Transcommunication structure consisting of several people from various ethnic groups and backgrounds. This is an attempt to reveal how ITC \\"requires an opening of the heart on the part of the folks at both ends of the line - an acknowledgment of each other's being and a sincere concern for each other\\". It is also a book of how one quite extraordinary man found his way to God, after remaining an agnostic for most of his life and developing life-threatening cancer.This book is literally a Who's Who of ITC, containing countless personal antidotes from Juliet Hollister, George Meek, Willis Harmon, Jules and Maggy Harsh-Fischbach, Sonia Rinaldi, and others.This book is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in an alternative view of the afterlife. It offers a hope of survival and contact with a loved one which is so often missed in present day religions.I believe that in his journey Mark realized that what's important in life is not so much the things that we do, but why we do them. His book states that it is the motivation and the heart of man that determines the outcome of all things, and this is very apparent in the work by this truthful author.Read this book. It might possible change your life."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"Macy's book focuses mainly on the personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when he casually declares that the history of the human race can be understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be persuaded by von Daniken's pop-culture writings, he will probably believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who spread their message. You'll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince no one who isn't already a believer."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"I found this gossipy tome fascinating only because I'm already well-read concerning the EVP/ITC phenomena themselves. I agree with the reviewers who say it doesn't tell you a whole lot about EVP or ITC - indeed, some of the contacts the author reports (which were received primarily by a married couple in Luxembourg rather than himself) are definitely in the \\"too good to be true\\" vein and may have you rolling your eyes if you aren't already quite familiar with EVP and ITC. Some of the reports (and the Luxembourg couple's insistence upon absolute control) virtually scream \\"Fraud!\\" and had me rolling my eyes even though I am familiar with reputable EVP and ITC reports that are flat-out amazing. These are very weird phenomena that demand attention even if you aren't yet willing to concede they are communications from those who have passed on. Anyway, I don't doubt the author's sincerity, and he does give an insider's view of the fussin' and feudin' within the EVP/ITC research community (primarily the European ITC community). You certainly won't come away from this book convinced of the reality of EVP and ITC - in fact, it may have the opposite of the author's intended effect in this regard - but it will entertain you if you have an interest in the phenomena (or the equally interesting phenomenon as to how paranormal research always disintegrates into the same sort of petty schisms you might find among the deacons at your local Baptist church)."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"Reading Miracles in the Storm gave me a tremendous sense of relief, to say the least.I read most of the near-death experience books published over the last decade and I was convinced that something very special was being offered by these people's interpretation of their near death experience.In short, their reports offered a win-win situation, with two choices for interpretation: One, there is a sublime life beyond the pain of physical material life, or, two, our brains are capable of 'naturally' experiencing enlightenment and release from stress and pain, that makes us feel that we are already in paradise. Which ever one it is, it offers a win-win opportunity. If it is the latter, we can start to direct our thinking and feeling life to consciously experience this pure bliss in our every-day lives. That is what I aim to do.Miracles in the Storm is a new approach to the same subject. When I read it, I felt such a great release of tension. I felt blissful at the thought that, when we pass from this material plane, we reclaim our most perfect sense of being and energy.This is a very excitement thought! I began to see everyone around me differently. I could see anyone as a perfect beings in spirit, regardless of their station in life or their physical condition. This way of seeing people is beautiful.These researchers into ITC, like the author of Miracles in the Storm, open the way for us to be convinced that our spirit lives on, and we can also have a glorious life, here and now, when we appreciate the miracle of life on the larger scale and on many dimensions. If Physicists have difficulty explaining the many dimensions of life they have discovered, how difficult must it be for the rest of us? This book is my first contact with ITC and I am so thankful for the renewal of spirit and energy that these revelations have given to me directly. This book would be a great help to anyone who is facing death, their own or their loved ones.

Any real discussion of contact and technologies is mired in the conflicts between individuals and organizations.

The insistent of the author to protray a few of the characters, namely Maggy and Jules, as credible experimenters was more than I could stomach. The author has attempted to show their contacts with the after life as genuine. To most people, these contacts are incredibly fraudulent and for this reason it puts this author in a bad light as the subject matter can not be believed.Many people will read this book for evidence of afterlife survival and it won't meet the criteria because of the author's insistence that contacts can be made similar to Maggy and Jules F. I can't recommend this book for this reason. I do heartily believe in contact from the dead but the author's insistence of credible contacts from Maggy and Jules has thrown a deeply suspect nature upon this field, and it is apparent why there were arguments within the ITC group that composed this book. In my humble opinion, the field of ITC has been greatly damaged by this couple, and for this reason, I can't recommend this book to anyone although I do not doubt the author's sincerity."},{"Title":"Miracles in the Storm: Talking to the Other Side with the New Technology of Spiritual Contact","review":"If you're buying this book to read about spiritual contact from the other side, FORGET ABOUT IT!

The Church of Christ needs a renewal of Bible Exposition; passage upon passage and through entire books of the written Word of God. The Dr. masterfully builds upon the great truths contained in this letter. 2. Truth transforms as a person begins with their mind being taught these Great Truths. These truths (as all truth) set free and transform the total person as it is applied by the Spirit. Truth changes ones character, ones social context, and arms him/her for spiritual conflict. 3. The postional truths of who we are in Christ(as individuals and as a church),develop \\"Spirit-Filled\\" churches. I know that this term has been hijacked by certain segments of the Evangelical Church. But this Exposition of Ephesians demonstrates that being Spirit-Filled has to do with transformation not only in worship but in those places where everyone sees our Christianity. (our marriages, family relationships, and work) Being Spirit-Filled means that you really are different and these vitally areas are changed. Those are the evidences of being \\"Spirit-Filled.\\" 4. The Church is where the wisdom of God is demonstrated to the Spiritual forces of this world System. (3:10-12) Christ has conquered these forces through His death and resurrection (1:20-22) Now we can stand (individually and as the Church) against those forces and move steadily to the victory He has won. (6:10-20) Lloyd Jones warns us against seeing our spiritual warfare in merely human terms (a reak problem with those influenced by liberal theology) but in spiritual ones. He also warns against taking on God's enemy, the Devil, in a Cavalier manner (a problem all too prevelant among many extremeist in Charismatic movement)But to stand and learn what it means to arm oneself for conflict.These volumns are not for those who want quick,easy, pleasing to the ears messages. These are faithful, thourough expositions of the passages. He takes on the tough passages and concepts of this epistle. This reading speaks to todays consumer oriented, and consumer pleasing \\"Bible Lite\\" mentality that is destroying Western Evangelicalism.

Since so little is known about Ignatius outside his own writings, there is little that can be stated definitively about his life and unfortunately this book is limited by such real-world constraints. Conversely, Richardson does not attempt specious speculation where the reader would desire something more concrete than the evidence gives and this adds to the overall merit of the book.Disappointed that so little can be found on Ignatius, I enjoyed this book nonetheless as an overview of early 2nd century Christianity through the eyes of this bishop from Antioch. It simply convers Ignatius' theology and thought on various subjects by analyzing his use of words and phrases. The last two chapters attempt to identify traces of dependence and influence from Paul and John respectively and it is appended concerning the heresies against which Ignatius battles.The lay reader (like myself) may be a bit befuddled by the constant use of untranslated foreign phrases in German, Latin and Greek (only my elementary knowledge of college Greek saved me from complete frustration) and references to other scholars with whom Richardson assumes the reader is familiar (Lightfoot who?)

He's probably read this book. The publishers advertise this as \\"History with the dull parts left out,\\" and that's exactly what it is. A compendium from three prior \\"People's Almanacs\\" published in the mid-70s, this book takes all the material that deals with the 20th century, in many cases updating it since the 1970s. Topics are both mainstream and offbeat: everything from infamous assassinations to famous people in literature, U.S. presidents to notorious kidnappings. The book is filled with off-beat quotes and surprising facts and figures--it's akin to a Ripley's Believe It Or Not combined with a world almanac, only better than both. And for the price, it's a steal. If you want a fun page turner that will also make you a little better-informed every time you read it, a light \\"popular\\" history of the 20th century that's most substantive than most other books of its type, this is for you.

This book stands alone. I will warn you, the prose is a little clunky, and it can sometimes get confusing who the non-main characters are when they pop back up. But the prose gets increasingly better throughout, and it's rather an engaging mystery overall. As a nerd, myself, who goes to conventions and may even own up to bringing her own sword on occasion, I found his setting engaging and generally true to life. This is a cozy-style mystery, so don't expect deep thinking or character progression. But, if you're looking for a quick read and a fun romp, this is a safe bet. Also, the homosexual angle is extremely minimal. So, whether you are looking for or to avoid that kind of wrinkle, it is barely even noticeable."},{"Title":"Nerds Who Kill: A Paul Turner Mystery (Paul Turner Mysteries)","review":"This was the first Zubro story that I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed this book - all in one day! My main criteria for a book: does it take me away from my dull and boring everyday life as a legal secretary? This story did that for me. Another reason for my enjoyment of this story was that I have attended DragonCon in Atlanta, and a couple of smaller writer conventions. The convention events in this story, along with the convention attendees (in costume or not), replicated the things that I have seen at 'real' conventions. There were a couple of minor characters brought into the interrogations that I found a tad tedious - but the repartee between Paul Turner and his fellow detective/partner Buck Fenwick entertained me during those particular interrogations. I look forward to reading more of Mister Zubro's mystery stories."},{"Title":"Nerds Who Kill: A Paul Turner Mystery (Paul Turner Mysteries)","review":"This is a slapped together, rambling, superficial mystery, one of the worst I've read. There's little character development (some glittery details and some dispicable people, but no character developement). Each chapter focuses on a new character, more or less, most of whom have no functionality inthe forward draggy motion of the plot.

Lately Jeff, who is wheelchair bound, has become quite independent, which is driving poor Paul to distraction, but he admits only to himself that life has been good of late though he frets over Jeff constantly.Paul takes his two teenage sons wearing costumes to the World's Ultimate Science Fiction Convention at the Greater Chicago Hotel and Convention Center. The cop figures he will survive even if Brian is a butt and Jeff is a pain until his official job intercedes. Someone murders renowned popular fantasy author Muriam Devers using a broadsword, a not so common weapon except at a sci fi convention where almost every teen including Paul's son has one. Soon other attendees are murdered with an assortment of convention weaponry. Paul and his partner Buck Fenwick seek a serial killer attendee who knows his or her armaments, a wolf amongst geeky sheep.This is a terrific police procedural that is humanized by Mark Richard Zubro's making a strong argument on what constitutes a loving family. The cleverly crafted who-done-it hooks the audience as the two detectives make inquires at the gala. However, it is the personal side of Paul that grips the tale as he is openly gay yet is a nurturing father and a solid cop who shows how inane \\"Don't tell\\" is and how ridiculous using sexual preference as a values barometer truly is. NERDS WHO KILL is a fabulous murder mystery in a fine series that reminds the audience that individual behavior and respect are what counts not sexual preference.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nerds Who Kill: A Paul Turner Mystery (Paul Turner Mysteries)","review":"I bought the book to be entertained and that is what I was. If you are looking for great literature then I would advise sticking with something else.The same can be said for anyone looking for a police procedural. Afterall when Paul Turners son's sword turns out to be the murder weapon his boss should have pulled him from the investigation because of conflict of interest.This is just an entertaining read. I basically read it in two settings and got some chuckles out of it.The one word of criticism I have is that I had to pay a hardback price for it. Paperback would have been a better format as well as price for this."},{"Title":"Nerds Who Kill: A Paul Turner Mystery (Paul Turner Mysteries)","review":"In this eighth book in the \\"Paul Turner\\" series, we join that Chicago police detective widower at home as his family (consisting of 16 year old son Brian, his 11 year old brother Jeff, who used a wheelchair due to spina bifida, and Paul's lover Ben, who owned a garage) prepared to attend a science fiction writers and media convention. Costumes were the rule at such affairs, with Jeff having worked on his own alien costume for weeks, while Brian went as the Beastmaster, complete with leather loincloth and jewel studded broadsword.The next time that Turner saw a similar broadsword, it was sticking out of a popular but controversial science fiction writer who had been murdered in her room. Nearby was a red ostrich feather, that writer's trademark-like reference in her books, broken in half. That scenario would replay itself several times during the next 24 hrs, as Turner and his police partner, Buck Fenwick, found additional victims, most attendees at the convention, but including one police officer on the scene. Amid over a thousand eccentric convention attendees, most in costumes, Turner and Fenwick learn of the behind-the-scenes cliques and posturing that caused friction between many of them, and try to gauge if the arguments could have led to murder. An additional concern for Turner is the fact that Jeff's broadsword comes up missing, and might have been used in one of the murders, but this is soon overshadowed by a suspicion that his own children may be targeted by the elusive killer.Another first-rate mystery from Zubro, one that should be especially interesting to anyone who ever attended a sci fi or Star Trek convention, since he seems to capture the different types of personalities one would find at such a gathering. Plot and characters were excellent, and kept me guessing till the end."},{"Title":"Just being at the piano","review":"This is my absolute favorite book about the piano and playing.

It may be a worshipful biography, but the man deserves the praise. My favorite passage is from page 39 as follows: \\"In every field of knowledge that he had set his mind to -- Biblical Criticism, History, Theology, Philosophy, Literature, Languages; Music, both in theory and technique; Organ-building, both in its science and its craft -- Schweitzer had been a serious explorer, no mere visitor in any of those realms There is no need to specify the particular branches which the study of each of these general subjects must involve. But it may be as well to set beside them the several branches of the science which he now set himself to master with equal thoroughness and zest. The subjects of his pre-clinical course were as follows: Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Botany. And in his clinical course these: Medicine, Surgery, Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Bacteriology, Pathological Anatomy, Pharmacology. Taken in conjunction with his former studies, it may be said that this represents a mental and moral achievement that can scarcely be paralleled.\\" Of course, Schweitzer states all of his accomplishments in a matter-of-fact way in his Autobiography (one of the best in the form) but here Seaver opens our eyes to the magnitude of his intellectual life. And what a life! What the world needs now (and can always use) is a man of such ability and reverence for all of the manifectations of life on this planet. Seaver goes into great depth with all of Schweitzers theological and philosophical works.

These three people come together in a wonderful love story. I truly wish the author had written more books, this one only made me want more of her writing style, made me remember what it felt like to be young and so full of life.

I played it through junior-high and high school, but eventually, after playing lots of other games with simpler, more streamlined rule systems that made it easier to &quot;role-play&quot; instead of &quot;roll-play,&quot; I left D&amp;D behind. For nearly 20 years I played other games, but when I heard the hype about d20, my interest was piqued. Since the books were so cheap, I gave them a try, and they looked very good at first, but when I joined a group to play, I found that things were as bogged-down in myriad minute rules as ever. Things would be fine until we had to fight something, then everything came to a screeching halt as we spent the next half hour simulating thirty seconds of combat with dozens of dice rolls. And these days, I just don't have the time or patience to study a set of game books as if they were a textbook.Recently, I was looking for a rule system to use in a fantasy campaign, but with a very different flavor--imagine my surprise when the one I chose turned out to be d20! In Mutants &amp; Masterminds, all the non-essentials have been tossed out, and the game is much improved by it. And while it is a supers game, with a little tinkering, superpowers can easily become magic.&quot;A 1-year-old child&quot; gave the game 1 star--interestingly, all the things he complained about were things I liked. In addition, he had little reason to complain, as for every rule he complained about, there was a box nearby with an alternate rule for people who didn't like M&amp;M's new rule. For example, I'm going to use good old-fashioned hit points for now. Though perfect for a superhero game, the M&amp;M damage system is too comic-book-style for my campaign.All in all, it's the first d20 game that is as good as some of the better games out there."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"I've tried Marvel's FASERIP system, Palladium, Champions, GURPS, d20 as D&amp;D, Modern, Star Wars, Cthulu, and M&amp;M remains my favourite system to deal with superpowers.Why?Flexibility, and simplicity. Make the power you want. The book gives you a bunch of common powers, and you can easily add and subtract to get what you want. Want to personalize your energy blast? Is it pure force? Fire? A handful of ball-bearings? Whatever you want.Want to use your powers in an unusual or clever way? You don't have to buy a whole new power. Hero Points and Extra Effort are simple game mechanics that allow you to play smart, or give 110% in those critical moments!No hit points. Damage, from being hit by a granny with an umbrella, to getting a battleship dropped on your head, is the same system, using the same number of dice, just one. Combat don't take longer at higher levels. The collateral damage just increases ;).Visuals. The book is beautiful with great art throughout. It give an excellent comic book feeling.Options. The base rules make it pretty hard to kill someone accidentally. Don't agree with that? The plethora of sidebar options give you choices in lethality, power restrictions, even put hit points back in, if you want.Support. The supplemants aren't necessary, but they are all good. The Annual gives a wealth of campaign and rule options. Freedom City is an excellent city sourcebook with heroes, villains, and important and interesting people and places. Crooks! contains a wealth of insane, diabolical, greedy, or just plain miscevous opponents for your players. And the forums are a great place to ask questions, put out ideas, and generally get a bunch of friendly useful feedback. We want to help you!One important warning to players and GM's: CONCEPT. Don't try to squeeze the most damage and defense out of every last point. That leads to less fun. Make heroes. Don't make wacking machines.My gaming circle, some nine people, started with one copy of this book. Within two years, over half had their own copy, and I own two! We've had three M&amp;M campaigns since the book came out, and they've never fizzled. They ended, and people had a good time along the way.M&amp;M. Less math. More fun."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"As a professional adventure game designer and reviewer, and a long-time fan of superhero roleplaying, I've been waiting for a game to come along which featured full implementation of the concepts in the d20 System engine while still engaging superhero play in a fair and balanced way. Steve Kenson has done a marvelous job of that in Mutants &amp; Masterminds, bringing the best of the Open Source rules, losing the worst, and adding new rules that are at once rational, playable, simple and fun. The book design by Super Unicorn is easy on the eye and enhanced by art provided by a dozen current comic book professionals. The book feels small and intimate for all of its 288 pages, and the value received is exceptional, certainly better than those heavyweight core books from Wizards of the Coast. If you love superhero gaming, or if you love D&amp;D but are thinking of a change and yet don't want to learn a whole new game... BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"I've been having a blast with this game system, and I'm going to go over a few reasons why I think you might also.1. No Hit PointsHit Points have long been a sort of thorn in my side. I never could figure out what they represented. Why can Cure Light Wounds bring a first level mage back from the brink of death, but barely mends a paper cut on a high level fighter? Not a problem in M&M.; Whenever you are damaged, you make a save. Fail, and your saves get a litte harder to make next time. Fail by a lot and you might be stunned or knocked out. Sounds harsh, but it isn't when you take into account point number 22. Hero PointsRandomness, doesn't it suck? You're all set up to do something cool, and here pops that 1. Now that's not so big a problem. Hero points let you control that die to a degree by allowing you to reroll any result you don't like. It also guarantees you at least an avarage result. If that isn't cool enough for you, you can use Hero Points for other things as well. Increasing your powers' effects, giving them new effects for a short while, reviving from knock out status, recover from stun...3. Flexable character creationLuck won't bamboozle you here, either. Everything is point driven, and everything is an option. Believe me, no matter how many points you get, you'll wish you had more. The game sets only what limits it must to preserve game balance. If there aren't enough options for you, there is a fairly decent power creation system explained.4. Professional HelpNo, I don't need a psychiatrist. What I mean here is that the mutants and masterminds website has a forum where you can ask the author to clear up your rule questions. He answers whatever is posted about once or twice a week. It's not like having him in a bottle at the gaming table, but it's better than I ever got from anyplace else.5. Ease of Play.For this game, all you gotta bring is one d20, a pencil, and your character sheet. Buy a copy of this book if you can't borrow one from time to time, but you won't need it often. For GMs, there's the \\"mook\\" rule to make your life easier. All those little minions hanging around the bad guy don't have HP. One hit and they're gone, freeing you up to concentrate on your real villans instead of keeping 15 HP totals straight. Quick and easy rules for battle keeps tension high, and keeps a single battle from eating up all your role play time. It's much easier to role play when your roll play goes smoothly and quickly. If rough and tumble is your game, hey, just fight more stuff in a night. ^^5. VarietyWe've built 12 characters out of our imaginations, and no two of them play the same. Fighters are fighters, clerics are clerics, mages are mages. Your role is decided when you picked which of those you wanted to be. In M&M;, You're free to do what you want more often without rules getting in your way.In closing, I know some people are put off by this system because it is different, but I think it deserves a chance to stand on its own as something new and exciting. Some people may never warm up to the changes, and that's just fine, but it would be worth your while to at least give this a try."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Forget Hero, forget GURPS Supers, heck, forget Silver Age Sentinels: Mutants and Masterminds is THE superhero RPG to get. Not only does it use the innovative d20 system, but since it doesn't have the d20 logo on it (which would place further restrictions on what they can or can't publish), it's d20 done right! All of the familiar game mechanics are there, along with excellent character creation, letting you create any hero or superhero you can possibly think of! But don't take it from me; get the book and find out for yourself why it's the best d20-based superhero RPG out there."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Green Ronin Publishing has done something remarkable with this game. The book just looks fantastic, and Mutants & Masterminds manages to use the d20 rules to create a genuine comic book feel. The lack of classes and hit points may seem strange at first, but it opens the game to almost limitless superhero combinations. And if you don't like the rules that are provided, the book is literally filled with tips and optional rules to tailor the game to the gamemaster's specific tastes. Think attacking should be a skill? A power? It can be done, and M&M; tells you how.It's hard to find a Superhero RPG that is flexible yet streamlined. Mutants & Masterminds really pulls it off. A single d20 is the only die you need to play the game from start to finish. The writing is often very clever and appropriate to the genre. It was especially refreshing (I myself being an experienced gamemaster) to see them deliver constant reminders that the key to the game is enjoying yourself. The rules are simplistic and versatile enough to let the players' imaginations run wild while allowing the gamemaster to deliver some good, old-fashioned, four-color fun."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Mutants and Masterminds is a game which applies the d20 system to the superhero genre. In creating M&amp;M the publishers have taken the system and improved it by eliminating the antiquated elements which were keeping the d20 system in the dark ages. That's right, M&amp;M has no stifeling character classes, no meaningless alignments and, best of all, NO HIT POINTS! That fact alone makes it worth at least 4 stars in my opinion.I have played most of the superhero games which have been published, including the Marvel and DC games, Villians and Vigillantes, Underground and Champions. The streamlined but playable rules of M&amp;M beat all of them. The rules for powers are highly customizable, allowing players to design the character they want to play. In addition, the rules for gadgets, skills and feats can make a character who doesn't have powers (like, The Punisher from the comics) fun and worth playing. The fact that &quot;supernormals&quot; don't have muich of a chnace was one of my biggest gripes against some other systems, and a big point in M&amp;M's favor for me.Overall M&amp;M gets my highest recommendations."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Simplicity. Its what makes the d20 system so user-friendly and adaptable and the super-simplified Mutants and Masterminds system is what I find appealing about Green Ronin's handling of the super-hero/comic book genre. Super heros don't have hit points, they don't min-max for the wickedest weapon damage dice, they don't have a rule for everything. I'm not knocking d20, I really like it and I really like the rich, detailed characters you can create with it, I just prefer a more simplistic approach to superheros. M&amp;M is a quick, fun game where the emphasis is on action rather than rules and that is so much more reflective of the comicbook world than regular d20 and certainly better suited to simple &quot;4-color&quot; comics than GURPS, etc.The plethora of powers and the open-endedness of the system makes it possible to create whatever you want and still allow for limitations that make characters balanced in comparison to other characters and villians. The lack of classes makes the possibility of characters with diverse talents feasable (like a character that can heal others with their touch and release damaging blasts of holy fire, etc.).This book is only one star away from being outstanding because of a lack of editing. When you buy this book you'll need to go to the M&amp;M website and download the errata that goes with the book.Overall, this is a great system if you're looking for comicbook style roleplay, combat-lite, and versatility. If you want to figure out how many dice of damage Wolverine could do, pick something else."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"This book is one of Green Ronin's crowning achievements, no doubt about it. The system is one of the easiest and streamlined d20 games that I have ever played, and teaching my new players the ropes was a cinch.One of the reviewers below expressed his biased opinion about both the damage save system and the use of a single d20. M&amp;M's strength is that it is both simplistic and in-depth at the same time. The game's damage save system does an excellent job of simulating the sometimes day-long combats and one-hit-KO knockouts found in comics. (Note to previous reviewers: If you don't like save system, go use the Hit Point variant in the book or buy some ranks in Amazing Save (Damage)/Armor/Protection!)The combats in the game are fast paced, with minimal dice rolling due to the single d20. But possibly the thing I like about the book is the power system. Characters are rated in &quot;Power Levels&quot;, with the starting level being 10, to represent the average skill of a new superhero.You have 15 &quot;power points&quot; each level to purchase skills, feats, BAB, defense, and super-powers with. The dozens upon dozens of super-powers that the game presents can be customized to such an extent that it's not even funny. If have a power concept that you don't find in the book, there is an entire section in the book dedicated to creating new powers.The main site is www.mutantsandmasterminds.com, complete with free adventures and an intensely dedicated fanbase that scours the forums. Other supplements to the Mutants and Masterminds Core Rulebook include Freedom City (which has been hailed as one of the best supers' RPG supplements of all time), Nocturnals: A Midnight Companion (which chronicles Dan Brereton's Nocturnals's comic series, highly recommended), Crooks! (Full of fleshed out criminals from the Meta-4 campaign setting), and the upcoming Annual #1, full of more variant rules and help for settings set in the far future and in WWII.I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to try a unique spin on the Supers' RPG genre or who just wants a decent gaming system (ignore the naysayers!)."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"M&amp;M has very high production values and a slick system (that while taking some departures from strict-D20 mechanics) still manages to retain enough elements that those familiar with other D20 games (i.e. DND) will be able to get up and running with the system quickly. The rules capture the heroic flavor of four-color superhero combat well, and combat manages not to get bogged down although there are lots of tactical options for players who enjoy that sort of thing. The powers and character creation are well balanced, the system is varied and and flexible enough to allow you to develop literally any type of hero. The Power Level system scales well for a variety of game types, from lower level &quot;gritty&quot; supers to higher-level four color save-the-world type games. The sample material and included character archetypes offer a good mix of of beginning campaign material, certainly adequate as a jumping off point for new M&amp;M GMs. One criticism I have is that the sections on equipment and vehicles are very skimpy, and because of the different rules for combat damage, you cannot easily use equipment from books like D20 Modern without some conversion. Hopefully this lack will be addressed in upcoming supplements. At the very least, the book does provide a generic system for modeling any peice of equipment or vehicle desired; but more examples would be nice."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"The book seems to start out strongly. In it, you have a point-based character creation system, and a superhero power system based around the d20 level mechanic, so that power level scales naturally.However, the failing of the book is that it is based on a 'damage save'. Basically, instead of skill or effectiveness of your abilities, the roll of 2d20 (damage + 1d20, save + 1d20) is the biggest influence on whether or not you succeed. Ever have a first level character have a chance to kill 25% of the time? You will now -- and in Mutants & Masterminds, you start at level 10. This mechanic sinks Mutants & Mastermind from an excellent game to the level of mediocrity."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Where the hell are the rest of the bloody dice?

Sure, neither of them are &quot;pure&quot; d20, but I spent quite a bit of time deciding which of the d20 superhero games that I'd be interested in, and after borrowing this book from a friend, and reading it entirely, I bought SAS. Then, I bought the Tri-Stat version, then the Stingy Gamer Edition for the rest of the players to share, and three of the other great sourcebooks for the game.

Green Ronin had to put out a second printing due to the success of the game. Needless to say, I managed to get a hold of a copy, and I have very much enjoyed the game.What about the game have I enjoyed? First off, it is a d20 game, and as such, it has some familiarity of the d20 engine. However, it is very off from the rest of the d20 games like Dungeons & Dragons or d20 Modern. The game does not use hit points. It does not have classes or racial packages. Instead, you have 15 points per level to build your character with. The system is very flexible and is meant to be rather cinematic.The game goes on to use the Feats system of the d20 system and expand upon them. Additionally, you have Powers, which can be adjusted with Extras & Limitations. There is a lot there, but once you have it all in front of you, it runs fairly smoothly.The game is designed to be a superhero game, but it has a lot of flexibility. You can put together a four-color game, a western-style, suspense/horror or any number of things. Yeah, GURPS and Hero System did this a long time ago, but this version is not nearly as math intensive and allows for more cinematics, not letting the rules overpower the story.On the other end of things, if you like a very visceral game, this is not the game for you. Yes, it can be violent, but it is not designed to be about killing orcs.Overall, I really enjoy the game. I have both played and ran the system, and I plan to run more games in the future. Green Ronin produced a quality product that I would recommend to any gamer or comic-enthusiast looking at trying role-playing."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"My friends and I play 3 or 4 different RPG systems on a regular basis, and this by far is the best. Since everything is going D20, as long as it is closer to Mutants than D&D 3ed. I'm happy. This blows all other systems out of the water. It combines the current accepted system (D20) with the variable character designs that open ended (non class based) system allow for. My friends and I aren't great fans of D20, but play it since it is whats available now, but we love Mutants. Plus, we only found a few loop holes and ambiguities, and those were all fixed in the errata. Green Ronin, We salute you! PS, can you publish a few more copies. After my roommates read through my copy(which i got from amazon), we decided to play a game and needed more books pronto for everyone else, we had to try 5 different stores before we found a place that wasn't sold out, and they only had 1 copy left."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"This game is the best of the newest Superhero roleplaying games that has been released as of late.

It provides all customization capabilities that other HEROic games may have but is light on the complexity in order to create an imaginative, detailed yet easy game to play."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"A friend got this and forced it down our throats.

Far easier to use than Hero System, and far more inclusive than Champions.A word of warning, this is 1st edition. Most additional materials are written for 2nd edition."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS is an exciting new take on d20 roleplaying, reinvisioning which mechanics are necessary for an enjoyable experience. By dropping classes, hit points, and alignments, MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS focuses more cleanly on roleplaying aspects while abstracting the war-gaming inheritance of d20. I am reviewing the 1st edition of MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS; although it is now 5 years old with a newer edition out, the original still retains decent value on auction sites, implying that people are still buying and playing the older book.MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS opens with 10 sample superheroes, to showcase what the game is capable of (and to serve as signature characters throughout the book). The colors are bright and bold, with a variety of styles from Anime to realism to 4-color. I think my favorite has to be The Pugilist - no superpowers, he just fights. Hard. There's also Protonik, a decent version of Superman, who hails from the former Soviet Union. There's a little bio that goes with each sample hero as well.Most of the rest of the book is devoted to crunchy stuff, which is unfortunate in my opinion. It is necessary, of course, to provide all the rules, but the atmosphere of MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS is so evocative that it is painful to have to return to the world of ability modifiers and spending points. These sections cover abilities, skills, superpowers, gadgets, and flaws. Basically, the things you spend your points on to build a character. I was intrigued that the standard point of entry for a new PC is 10th level - you have a lot of points to distribute. Throughout these sections, there are little superhero comics, usually 3 panels, that illustrate some point. These add a lot of flavor to otherwise dry sections.The skills and abilities are pretty standard. Superhero powers encompass super-strength, speed, agility, transmuting self and others, flight, immunity to (drowning, suffocation, poisons, etc.), telepathy, regeneration, magic (!), and gadgets. Gadgets are represent superhero equipment, like the Bat Utility Belt, a mechanized suit, or Adamantium claws. There are power stunts that can be added to each power for a small cost, or flaws that reduce the cost. There's also a substantial section on combat, superheroes do a lot of that.There's a DM section and a sample game, neither of which is terribly inspiring, but at least it's there. The final section has 6 supervillains and their histories, ready to lead plots for world domination, or just local mayhem. These are even more fun than the superheroes (The Atomic Brain !!!), and I was looking forward to reading CROOKS! afterwards.MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS has a lot going for it - an original take on d20, exciting sample characters, good artwork in a variety of styles (Dan Breton, of Nocturnals fame, is one), and a good presentation. The superpowers as listed cover everything I can think of, and should allow just about any superhero to be created.On the downside, MUTANTS AND MASTERMINDS reprints a great deal of standard d20 stuff. Once you own 4-5 corebooks, this stuff gets really repetitive (and you're paying for all those pages). I like White Wolf's strategy of a core guide for their line, with all basic rules, skills, etc. in one book. It is nice to have all of the rules in one place, but I already have them in Cthulhu D20, D&D; 3e, and Star Wars; reading it again is a waste of time and money. For all I know, it could be a legal thing to republish all of it. It's a small thing, though, in comparison to enjoyment of the whole book."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"This RPG is still d20, but a little different. No hitpoints, with a new damage save system and wound conditions.Art in the book is great, and gives a good feel for the comic book RPG style."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"Indeed, this game can prove fun for people into the super-hero roleplaying world.However, there are some key points that many skilled gamers need to realize about this book. I found many things which I found to be \\"over simplified\\" and instead of adding freedom to gameplay and design, it ultimately limited the variety and fun you experience while playing.First off, the hit point thing gets most people down. Hit points arent realistic, but on the other hand, the system they implement in 2nd edition is WAY too simplified. If you have a party of Powerlevel 10 heroes, all of them pick a generic attack (usually a blast or superstrength) and they all do equal damage... no variation...nothing. It's always 15+ rank 10 (because 10 is the max, and why not go with the max for a damage character?).So all you do for combat is roll to hit a relatively easy value (opponent's defense, which has nothing to do with dex even though dex is what is supposed to give your character mobility) and compare it to 25. Every turn. Same thing. It doesnt matter if you have a Rank 10 Fireblast, or a Bolt of water splash the target at rank 10, it all does the same exact damage value.This is something I have a serious problem with. Not to mention, given the toughness values of a PL10 vs PL10 character, against +10 toughness, you can never really blast away an opponent to pieces in just a few hits. Maybe I want a character to be just as easy to damage, but has a more durable body structure (for roleplaying flavor) such as a relentles robot having chunks of it blown off as it advances. Yet, perhaps the boss, a giant super robot , i want to have the same damage resistance and mobility, but more durability than the smaller ones, yet keep it on the same level of damage output for weapons and whatnot.When you get damaged, it's not something that you can't really describe accurately as a GM. If the target is hit, he just loses a toughness and keeps going. For a GM , this is so vague that you end up saying things like \\"um.. he looks a little damaged, but not bad\\" (or something similar) over and over because you never really know if the next hit will drop the character to dying status or if it'll be just another flesh wound.Powers are diminished down to nothing but the same effects, but with different names, for the most part (for combative ones, anyway). The distribution of ranks of powers is also unbalanced. It costs only 2 points to be immune to critical hits but 12 points to be a large character (which is usually a bad thing, since your defense and attack drop). You can go completely invisible, whenever you want, as a free action, for only 8 points.Im disappointed in the fact that Ive made 7 villains so far for my campaign to try to defeat, and yet they all seem to crank out the same damage. Players get bored just wittling down toughness modifiers. The names of the villains and their sub-powers vary, but the general combat just seems to be so generic and bland. Then there are moves like \\"Corrosion\\" which is just entirely broken as a power (aka overpowered).At least with the old system of hit points, things like regeneration and healing could be represented in a numeral form so you can judge how effective your skill will be in that field. All it seems to do in 2nd edition is increase the probability to help a target regain toughness.I know I'm ranting now about the same things over and over. But honestly, I'm not a fan of these static values for defense and toughness. They should implement something more along the lines of what GURPS has into M&M.; That would make it a great game.Also, lastly, i dont think they should limit powers as much. That's the GM's area of control. Much of the fun of playing D&D; was learning how to get modifiers and whatnot to stack with eachother and create an effective character, while not being too over-powered."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"It's an interesting example of how far you can take a system, it's a well-done RPG on its own merits, and having played it now I can say it's easy to run. I enjoyed it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Mutants and Masterminds","review":"If you can get past all the typos and mistakes in the book it's a great system. The power level approach to the d20 class problem(for supers games) is just great. The system is one of the most versatile I've ever seen, I've yet to see a character that couldn't be created using these rules. Unfortunately the game appears to not have been proofread. Most of the sample characters are wrong(they don't add up to how much they should cost, don't have prerequisites for certains feats, etc), many of the power descriptions are incomplete and entire sections of the rules are missing(such as whether or not your super strength bonus applies to grapples). If someone had actually taken the time to look the book over before shipping it to the printers I bet it would have easily been a 5 star system. As it is, however, it'll take a healthy dosage of errata to make this game playable."},{"Title":"Start 'Em Sailing!","review":"I learrned to sail from an earlier copy of this book, nearly seventy years ago, when I had no realistic expectations of ever actually sailing. The \\"book learning\\" from this book got me through a writtne exam and demonstration sail that qualified me to sail the US Navy recreational sailboats at Pensacola and started me along a lifelong path that has included participation in two Olympic qualification trials. I've passed along quite a few copies to aspiring beginners along the way. Aymar has a real knack for showing and telling the basic essentials.Start 'em sailingStart 'Em Sailing!Start'em Sailing"},{"Title":"Start 'Em Sailing!","review":"How should one learn to sail?As Aymar says, a good way is to get an experienced sailor to take you out and show you how. But to make better progress, you ought to read at least one book about it.I learned how to sail by getting an experienced sailor to take me out and show me how. But I did have one book about it back then, and this was the one.This book takes you right through a sailor's day, from getting to your boat until stowing your sails away. And I still remember some of the advice, such as:\\"When running close-hauled with a lot of main sheet in the cockpit, see that it doesn't get in a snarl and that your feet don't get tangled up in it.\\"\\"Never make quick motions with the tiller.\\"\\"Luff up occasionally to the point at which the sails begin to soften up, then head down to the proper point for most efficient sailing.\\"\\"Tie tell-tales - narrow pieces of ribbon six or seven inches long - at different heights on the shrouds.\\"\\"Never sit to windward in light airs so that the mast is straight up and down or leaning to windward.\\"\\"Don't jump around in a boat, particularly when underway.\\"\\"Don't get up forward too far to put out a whiskerpole.\\"\\"Avoid sailing too close in the lee of large vessels.\\"What do you do if you are on a starboard tack and are trying to come about to port tack but get stuck halfway, right in the eye of the wind? As Aymar says, back the jib at once, before you lose headway, by hauling in on the port jib sheet.What should you do if you were trying to jibe but didn't trim your main sheet quick enough and hard enough, so your boom went across but the upper part of your sail did not? By the way, this picturesque error is called a \\"goose wing jibe.\\" Anyway, the answer is to jibe back to the original position; heading up just makes it worse.And what should you do when you are, um, around the buoys? Aymar says that \\"beginners in racing are haunted by the times they have fouled buoys.\\" Yes, you get disqualified for doing so. And one way to get in trouble is to tack around a buoy in light air and get borne down on the buoy by the current while you flounder around in stays. Aymar suggests giving the buoys wide berths when there is a risk of this. But if I'm permitted to go around a buoy in either direction, I prefer to head directly at it until the last minute, so I can pick the direction I'm being pushed into.Anyway, it's not a bad book, and I learned quite a bit from it, but that was several decades ago and I think there are much better books out there these days. In addition, I think that once you are going to read about how to sail a small boat, you ought to get a book that covers a little more than this one does, especially about modern racing boats."},{"Title":"Sacraments: A New Understanding for a New Generation w/CD","review":"This introduction to contemporary sacramental theology is solid, but easy to read.

He goes on to say it was not until the 13th Century the Church even claimed it to be a Sacrament.Simply put, this work is heretical.Stay away at all costs!If you want to learn about theology read the Catechism of the Catholic Church (the Roman Catechism -the Catechism of the Council of Trent is still the official and primary catechism of the Church, if you read the newer CCC make sure it is the 2nd Edition as the first had over 20,000 errors corrected) and then follow it up with the referenced documents.There is a reason a &#34;book&#34; like this will not (cannot!) cite references.Make sure there is an Imprimatur if you buy a book claiming to be Catholic."},{"Title":"Sacraments: A New Understanding for a New Generation w/CD","review":"The author, Noll, argues that sacramentality is not totally limited to the seven formal sacraments of the Catholic Church; consequently, how painful and how exciting it is to be in the transition period we are in today with the old sacramental system gradually passing away and new dimensions, new intimations, new systems just beginning to show themselves.

Erle Stanley Gardner used his own experiences as a trial lawyer plus his legal knowledge to create fast-paced stories in this series. The dialogue carries the interest of the reader. There is a minimum of characterization or description of surroundings. Gardner did not put dates in his novels, but the backgrounds and dollar figures tell about the times prior to 1971. His stories often involved some new technical development or some obscure law. Some of the legal issues (like habeas corpus) became obsolete due to Supreme Court rulings since the 1950s. Municipal corruption or shady business dealings occur in these stories as a warning for readers.Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). \\"Perry Mason\\" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements. Sacco & Vanzetti were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis and the lack of guilty evidence. Most believe they were innocent and were convicted as part of the political repression of the 1920s.* The Case of the Singing Skirt.

It is a stunning story and one that the author tells quite well. The book is now thirty years old, so you can't expect anything after the 1960s. From my point of view, the book is stronger in dealing with the larger and more mainstream religious viewpoints than the minority sects and religions. While smaller, they are often not marginal and have had an impact on our culture beyond their size and yet the tone used in discussing them treats them, too often for my taste, as marginal. The point being that if you are already in the religious mainstream faiths, this book will seem more objective to you than if you are one of the faiths outside those traditions. However, I don't think this is so much a weakness in the book as an atmospheric you might or might not notice as your read it - depending on where you are in the religious tradition of the US.This point becomes even smaller when compared to the many strengths of this book. It is amazingly comprehensive for a single volume. And though it is over 1,000 pages it reads easily.

This is a graduate level book that can also be read in advanced undergraduate course work and I recommend this book for all Americans, regardless of your faith.

Through the years, whenever I have preached or taught classes on church history, I have always included one lesson or session on the history of religion in the United States. One of the volumes was the second printing in 1973 of the first edition of this book, which was winner of the 1973 National Book Award in Philosophy and Religion and Christian Century's choice as the Religious Book of the Decade in 1979. It is the first full-scale history of American religion in one volume, dealing not only with the major Western religions but also with Eastern religions, cultic phenomena, and secular religious movements. Author Sydney E. Ahlstrom, who was professor of American history and modern church history at Yale University and spent ten years of wide-ranging research, places religious history within the context of the social, political, and intellectual development of America.The book is made up of 63 chapters, which, after an opening introductory chapter, are grouped together into nine parts: the \\"European Prologue,\\" how the churches came to the New World, the period of the first Great Awakening and the American Revolution, \\"The Golden Age of Democratic Evangelicalism\\" followed by \\"Countervailing Religion,\\" the period of the Civil War, \\"The Ordeals of Transition\\" with the development of liberal theology and the social gospel during the late nineteenth century, the early twentieth century including World Wars I and II, and finally \\"Toward Post-Puritan America.\\" One would not expect something coming from Yale to approach the subject from a conservative standpoint, but I will have to say that Ahlstrom, whatever his religious beliefs may be, did a good job of being the neutral observer and just reporting the facts. Though probably written for use as a college textbook, it is not difficult to read and has a lot of fascinating information. Anyone interested in American religious history will find it extremely useful. A second, updated edition with new information by David Hall was published in 2004."},{"Title":"A Religious History of the American People","review":"This is a great religious history of America that I havehad on my list for a long time. It is big and a littleheavy but well written and readable.Can't beat the price -$2 + shipping!"},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"This is a bittersweet story of a woman who is slowing losing her memory while she resides in a nursing home. Born French, she departed for France as a teenager, sent by her parents during the Holocaust. She worked as an au pair in England ultimately to find that she had lost her family to the concentration camps. She had married an Englishman, lost him to the war and left to come to America with her young baby.The first person narrative allows us insight into how Hannah's memory of present day events fades while resurrecting past experiences very vividly. We learn of the frustrations of her daughter and grandchildren to hold on to Hannah and keep her in the present. She has flashes of memory that within minutes fails her once again.The characters are well developed and the story interesting. What I found interesting is that Hannah in the end is not depressed because of her situation but rather feels \\"does it matter if I don't know the right words?\\" Her grandchild struggles onto her bed and whispers a new word he has learned into her ear. She holds him close and smells his sweet child smell and is satisfied and reflecting on her life she states, \\"To love that went well\\".I would recommend this book for book clubs; in the end it is not a depressing tale but a window into an elderly mind."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"I buy books for my wife because she can never make up her mind from the thousands available. Generally I buy only those books that received good customer reviews. But this one I bought on a whim since there weren't yet any customer reviews available. Well she really liked it. And since I am so big on customer reviews I will tell you about a few others I bought that she just loved. She loved A YEAR SINCE YESTERDAY by George Edward Zintel. That book came in soft-cover (not paperback even though it is listed as such) and was one of the best books she has ever read. Another is NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS by Maeve Bichney. BOTH of those books she has read several times. I also give books as Christmas presents, and I would recommend any of those I mentioned as gifts."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"If you've ever driven past narrowly spaced trees with bright sun sharply angled, you will understand Hannah Pearl's condition: light/darkness, light/dark, wending so fast that one becomes dizzy after 30 seconds. Hannah, too, is in/out all day, from the time she spends at Tikkun, a nursing home, to her brief jaunts with Miranda, the daughter whom she refers to as \\"maman\\" halfway through this short novel. Sometimes Hannah can recall reality: her daughter Mir, her 20somethings granddaughters. Mostly, though, she lives on the periphery of reality, where her own mind creates the most vivid and understandable scenarios.Chessman's style, as in \\"Lydia Cassat,\\" a previous novel, reminds one a bit of Virginia Woolf: the writing flows lyrically, at times like poetry. There are numerous references to color, flowers, and other inhabitants of nature. I love how she weaves Hannah's French language into her thoughts and utterances, and how confused the other characters are by her native language. The scene in which Hannah is lost in a drugstore is particularly moving, as is the final scene with Hannah and her great-grandson.I want to send a copy of this to a young woman who was in the same writing class as I was this summer. She was writing a lovely, heartbreaking memoir of her grandmother's gradual decline into Alzheimer's. Although Chessman's book is not a memoir, technically, it reads much like one--a very good one."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"Yes, Harriet Chessman is a wonderful writer. And yes, Someone Not Really Her Mother has deserved all of the critical acclaim it has received. What I love about this book, though, is the delicacy with which it illuminates the relationship between middle-aged women and their mothers. Book groups will find much to discuss here about their own lives. You may buy this book because of Chessman's elegant prose and her storytelling, but you will remember it long after for its insights into the changing bond between mothers and daughters as they both age."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"This is a story about Hannah. She is in an old age home.She has flashbacks to her life as a young fifteen year old girl who lived during the war in France during the Holocaust. She was sent to England by her parents during the war for safety. She left behind her little sister, Emmma who is frequently in her flashbacks.Hannah has a daughter who is very loving to her, and two grandaughter who are also very loving and try to help her, but sometimes to no avail. The become the \\"family\\" that Hannah has left behind, in one of her delusional flashbacks.She has dementia and one day finds herself in a drug store with slippers, her walker and her sweater and is very confused. The workers in the store try to help her. She becomes very upset and only talks in french to the attendants. In her mind she is reliving a terrible night that happened to her.The book is good, not great, it does give you some insight into a person who has a altzheimer's disease. It is very sad that she thinks the reason why her parents sent her away is because they didn't love her.It is a fast read, and emotional also."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"This is a short but fulfilling story, heart-breaking at times. Hannah Pearl is living in a nursing home in Connecticut and no longer is able to keep in mind in the present. She drifts back to France, where she lived before WWII, when her parents sent her to England to be safe.Hannah married a RAF pilot who was killed and then moved to America. Hannah's daughter, Miranda does not understand why her mother is speaking French and keeps trying to bring her mother back to the present. Her two grand-daughter's Fiona and Ida also deal with Hannah in different ways. Fiona ignores and Ida tries to find out what they never knew about their grandmother.my review: This was a beautifully written book, lyrical and touching. I liked how the author was able to show how all the characters deal with Hannah's illness, but also how Hannah herself feels. I felt she captured the frustration and confusion one must feel when dealing with Alzheimer's. We get bits and pieces of Hannah's life as if putting together a puzzle. The novel is only 160 pages but she accomplishes what it takes others 400.my rating 5/5"},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"As I read this, I was thinking of my relationship with my mom--how taking her to buy something as simple as lunch is a long journey fraught with all kinds of potholes. How I often find myself in the role of \\"mother\\" rather than \\"daughter.\\" Chessman does an amazing job with the world of her characters, and especially that of the elderly mother. She does what no one else has done--creating sympathy and understanding out of the confusing world of Alzheimer's. I was riveted."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"The difference between the many very good works on a topic and a masterpiece on that topic is that the masterpiece penetrates so deeply that it awakens questions the topic itself, more narrowly or less profoundly addressed, does not inherently raise. Ms. Chessman's book makes us wonder not just what it's like to care for or even to be an Alzheimer's sufferer, but what the relationship is between memory and human connectedness, between consciousness and reality, even between mind and soul. In this case, it's also an efficient masterpiece -- a short book, almost a prose poem -- in which, literally, even the punctuation can be devastatingly touching and intellectually provocative."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"Hannah Pearl resides in a nursing home in Connecticut because Hannah drifts from this time to others as her battle with memory loss slowly wins.Hannah's life has not been easy; first she loses her family in the Holocaust, then her husband in the war, but Hannah was a fighter and made a life for herself and her daughter; a daughter whose heart aches at the emotional loss of her mother.This book is Hannah's story. Told through her memory flashbacks, and seen through her daughter and granddaughters eyes as they struggle to understand not just what is happening to Hannah, but what she wants to leave with them before she departs this life.It is an emotional read but one that will touch your heart with truths as past and present become one and you realize that life is precious for those who know love."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"fantastic book; a real insight into the world of Alzheimers; a very devastating disease which clearly needs some understanding from those who are caretakers and this book certainly helps you understand this disease better"},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"I got bored.

It certainly is presented as fiction, but there is SO MUCH from her own life thinly disguised, that this is certainly, definitely a view into Moon's own story. Either way, forget the relatives, the real or fictional aspects, the book is REALLY well-written and the story reads like real life (finally one that does - stories never do, really. This one almost seems too personal).YOUR life is probably in here; The stupid things you do (when you know you shouldn't) and feelings everyone has had are covered in a REALLY funny way; I'd almost say the book is a comedy, but it's also painfully tragic and real. You can just tell by the tone that this girl (likely Moon herself) is a great person, but just not seeing it.I won't give away the story, but it develops and ends without a hard \\"Ta-Da!!\\" ending - as reality never does either... But it leaves you VERY satisfied - and wishing there was more good stuff. This is NOT my kind of book on the surface - kinda girlish (not too much) and very relationship oriented, but it is so well-done, I do put it in my 'personal Top Ten'. Get it - you will love it."},{"Title":"My Daughter Wants to be a Chef!: Everything You Should Know About Becoming a Chef!","review":"If you have ever worked in a resteraunt before, then most of the first half or so of this book will be a little boring. There were some helpful hints here and there, but a lot of the broad concepts I already knew. For example, dating co-workers can lead to problems, work fast but don't get careless, etc.The part of this work that was really useful for me was the job descriptions. I did some searching on the Internet and could find a list that is as good as this book. There are listings for every position that I have heard of and there are descriptions of the job conditions and skills required for the job and (most important to me) standard pay."},{"Title":"My Daughter Wants to be a Chef!: Everything You Should Know About Becoming a Chef!","review":"The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the fact, that my daughter read it after I did. She thought the book was too thin and was negative and the author made it sound like being a chef wasn't a good thing. I told her that in my opinion this was the right thing to do, so many people think that being a chef is all glamour, you see these food chefs on tv, and say I want to do that!! Being a chef is extremely hard work, long hours etc. Many people go into a job, whether chef or something else, with absolutely no idea about the cons as well as the pros. The author spells it right out for you. Especially when you remember he wrote this for his daughter, don't we all want to protect our kids?!

I think the story sticks with us all because we could all have been brother at some point in our lives and we could all have been Doddle. To live a life on borrowed time but still put effort into bettering yourself is brave. To love someone so much that you would do what ever they want is love. To try to change someone to prevent your own shame is tragic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"When I first read this story as I child I so identified with Doodle it frightened me. I adored my older sister, but even at that age I knew I was different, not as strong in many ways. It was only later in life, when I was diagnosed with a mental illness, that I realized why I felt so like Doodle. Since that time, my neck's been broken and repaired. I'm finally back at work after six years, but I still think that sister doesn't understand how much I still love and admire her, yet how tired I am and how often I just want to give up. Or better, have her come back for me. This story has always broken my heart and will do so until my death.

Like the many others on this page, I've searched for this story since high school. I wanted my little sister to read it now that she is older. I identified with the older brothers lack of patience and frustration with his little brother. I could recognize the same misplaced anger in myself toward my sister, 7 years younger than I. She is not handicapped but my impatience with her 'immaturity' (and mine, I might add) made me treat her cruelly.

I was struck not only by the main character's treatment of his brother in the beginning, but also by the sweet, unspoiled nature of his younger brother. Never once during this book could I become angry at either the &quot;normal&quot; boy or the &quot;challenged&quot; boy for either of their shortcomings. I feel that this book should be a must read for any family with handicapped children so that the point of view of the siblings and their relationships can be amplified. I know that I am going to read the book to my children, and grandchildren, and hope to pass it down even further knowing that it will make a lasting impression on all that read it as it did me. Kudos James Hurst, wherever you are."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"There goes a saying that \\"pride is a wonderful, terrible thing.\\" This was certainly made clear throughout The Scarlet Ibis. James Hurst's character Doodle had to suffer much because the narrator, his older brother, had too much pride. But even through all the hard times, Doodle was determined and still loved his brother.All Doodle had wanted was for the narrator to show a sign of pity and that he really loved him. And no matter now many times the narrator was cruel to Doodle, Doodle had still clung to him, waiting for that mask of pride to fade away, and loving him until the end. Not only was Doodle loving, but he was also determined. Although he was physically incapable and weak from birth, he was mentally very strong. When Doodle was 2 years old, and at the weakest point in his life, he'd try to move, straining terribly. He was determined to learn how to crawl despite the unbearable pain.\\"When the deafening peal of thunder had died, and in the moment before the rain arrived, I heard Doodle, who had fallen behind, cry out, \`Brother, Brother, don't leave me! Don't leave me!'\\" This quote from the story shows that Doodle truly loves his brother. The narrator had left him behind in the storm, but Doodle did not get angry. What did he do, but cry out, \\"Brother, Brother, don't leave me. Don't leave me.\\" In that same scene, Doodle also showed determination:\\"The lightning was near now, and from fear he walked so close behind me he kept stepping on my heels. The faster I walked, the faster he walked, so I began to run.\\" This piece from the story shows both determination and lovingness. Because Doodle loved his brother, he walked closely behind him when he was afraid. To be with his brother he had pushed himself to walk faster. Doodle had been blinded by his love for the narrator.Many people are often blinded by their love for someone or something. They only look at the good aspects and forget that there might be bad aspects, too. This is what Doodle experienced. He was blindly loved and trusted the narrator thinking he was extraordinary, and the best brother one could have. Yet, the narrator hadn't shown his real feelings about Doodle. He was too proud, too confident about himself, and this mistake later led to his brother's fall. To not be too blinded by love and trust is one of the many messages Hurst had tried to convey in The Scarlet Ibis."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I'm a freshman student that attends an honors class in California.

The story has a good moral, which I think is to help others out without getting something in return.

My teacher questioned whether the young brother would have been better off not being pushed by his brother. It is a complex question of quality of life vs. quantity (or longevity. She also raised the question of what it meant to live, and quite possibly could the constant urging, and pushing by the older brother - who refused to &quot;give up&quot;, lower his standards and allow his brother to be treated as an invalid ACTUALLY be the motivation that kept the younger brother alive all the while.

Since reading this in eighth grade I have yet to read another with the same impact; that is to say for a short story to make a totally self-involved teenager turn and look outward at his own brother, his own family with a new set of eyes, to appreciate their value in his life is quite simply ..powerfull. A classic in every sense of the word.

But what keeps you reading is the author's wonderful ability to write about such a hard subject. The writer writes with such passion that you wonder if this story has been based on true experience.We just read this story for Honors English, and when I was finished I found myself crying. The symbolism in this book is a bit heavy for children, but it's a deeply moving story. The story is about a little boy who has been wishing for a younger brother. But when he comes, he's not what he expected. The unnamed author's younger brother is nicknamed Doodle and he is physically handicapped.The incredible life force this story carries is just amazing. This is the sort of story that makes you feel everything ten times more. When I set down the story, I thought about it for another hour, seriously. It is such an amazing story and you cannot go through life without reading this book!I propose they make it into a movie, a good one hopefully, because I kept invisioning cutie pie Frankie Muniz as Doodle.

I also read it in high school and it has stayed with me through the years. When we were children, my younger brother was infuriating and vulnerable, and I remember how instinctively cruel I could be--protective as well, but that never seems to kick in when you need it. I could relate to Doodle's brother and his desire to push and punish his younger sibling. When I read The Scarlet Ibis, I bawled, I had to hide my face so my classmates wouldn't see. It was traumatizing. But I think it was the type of trauma that helps you grow. A heartrending lesson. It's one of the most beautiful and profound short stories ever written. I've never known a story to touch so many people.In addition to having a memorable plot and characters, the setting is worth noticing. North Carolinan swamp, something that NC native James Hurst would be very familiar with. And the ibis itself is a shy and rare bird.If you are looking for more thought-provoking reading, I would recommend (if you haven't read these already) The Red Pony and To Kill a Mockingbird. These also teach about love, loss, and what it is to be human. Books like these seem to make us more empathetic. Maybe these should be required reading for our elected politicians..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I too am one of the many that this story impressed many many years ago. It has always stuck with me and I'd promised myself that someday I'd find the book and re-read it. Well, I found it a few years ago and read it from time to time. What it taught me as an 8th grader and continues to teach me today is how my expectations of a person can hinder my understanding of who they really are as an individual and what they have to offer. If a young reader of this story finds it too sad or predictable to enjoy, its understandable and okay. Let them move forward with experiencing the highs, lows and humbling circumstances that life brings with age, and maybe someday down the road they'll find themselves thinking of the lessons this little gem of a book teaches.

It was the first story that i read that mademe cry. Why? Cause i could relate to it. Iw as like Doodle brother. Very proud and never wanted anything to make me feel inferior. My brother were not handicappeed but they were younger than i am and I felt that i was better than they were and that they couldn't be around me cause they werent able to \\"keep up\\". After i read that book i changed my whole perspective. Imagine. i couldn't be no more than 7 or 8 years old but I understood I needed to be different towards those that I love before it was too late to do that. Doodle's older brother realizes this too late. He realized too late that it is more important to love his brother no matter what others thought about him. I think that this is a good book for all youngsters to read. It will develope that sense of what is wrong and right in them."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I have read many wonderful books since 1976, but The Scarlet Ibis stands out in my memory like no other. As a tenth grader at Iroquois Central High School, my main focus was on fun. Reading this story in my English class caused me to see how fragile life is, and to realize that the worst weaknesses of humanity are not the physical ones which can be seen, but rather the pride and selfishness that destroy others. A personal note: Like one of your reviewers, I am the mother of a handicapped child.I marvel daily at her incredible spirit, as well as those of her disabled friends. The character &quot;Doodle&quot; is a great representation of that spirit and the truth that often the least among us are the greatest! I've searched for years to find this story again, and was amazed to see similar comments. The mere fact that so many have remembered this story for so long is reason enough for everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I'm a freshman student and I find this story extremely depressing, yet very well written at the same time. As a guy, yeah I should be tough enough not to cry. But this just overwhelmed me with emotion because I have a little brother with Diabetes and it just makes me feel ashamed for all the times I've pushed him just because I am embarassed of his disease.If you are considering to buy/read this, I highly recommend this amazing story to people of any age. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I, like many of my fellow reviewers, read this book in high school literature class. Unlike them; however, I do have a partially handicapped brother whom I treated just like Doodle was treated in this story. For this reason the story touched me so deeply as I included a poem about it and my brother in my poetry book. Growing up I constantly pushed my brother to try harder, run faster, and so on in hope that her would better himself. As I came to figure out upon looking back...I was embarrassed by him. I too, thought I could &quot;cure&quot; him and make him somewhat &quot;normal&quot; in appearance and function. Somehow though my brother inspired me to help those who need it and now I am going to do just that for a living. The Scarlet Ibis made me realize that I wasn't alone in my thinking as a little girl, and that I am so very thankful to have my brother, whom I dearly love."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I remember reading this story the first time in my eighth grade class, I'm surprised that many nineth graders that reviewed here couldn't get this, but an eighth grader like myself could. This story had, and still do, has a hold on me. Here I was, just talking to a few friends over the internet, and out of no where I remember this story. Haunting me and pulling at my heart yet again.In my english class, when we were beginning to read this story, I didn't expect much from it. It was a short story, and I wasn't really interested into short stories.The more we got close to the ending, I wanted to find out more. I had been engrossed within this story, it had then sparked more of my interest than in the start. And when it was time to go, I didn't want to get up from seat and stop reading. I then found myself reading ahead of my class. I wanted to know, was Doodle ever going to have a normal and sucessful lifestyle with the help of the narrator, his brother? I thought all stories had happy endings, but once I finished read the ending to The Scarlet Ibis, I now know how truely wrong I was. I cried in my english class once we finished this story, and I coudn't stop crying. Everyone was telling me, \\"Come on, it's just a book!\\" But they didn't know how /real/ this story was. This story gave me a new perspective in life, and it gave a new meaning to the saying, \\"You don't know what you have untill it's gone.\\" I knew back then, how this story will stay with me as I continue to grow. And I don't ever want to forget this story, I don't want to let go. Therefor, I'm buying this book one day and recommending it to everyone I know.James Hurst weaved a beautiful, bitterweet, and memorable story, he did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I remember reading this in grade school and still remember it today. I have searched for this title and you can imagine my surpise when I found it on this site listing. I had a younger brother, though not handicapped, who I greatly disliked. If I remember, this story has a part in it where the family was so certian that the young brother would not live that they built a coffin for him in his infancy. If I also remember this story correctly, the young boy does die in the end though the details of it I can't now recall. I remember being so stunned by this ending that I began to look on my younger brother as a treasure rather than a liability. You might say that this book changed our relationship. Treasures come in many forms one of them is brothers, even handicapped ones. If you don't want to cry, don't read this book. If you want to look at life a bit differently, buy it and don't put it down."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Ibis: The Collection of Wonder (Creative Short Stories)","review":"I read this short story approximately 25 years ago and have searched for it from time to time.

Children play and go to school with forest animals. The animals and children speak to each other. There are several morals taught in the course of the story. Follows the family from one season through the next. The children help the parents work, harvest food for winter, etc. It is nice to see the children happily working with the family rather than just existing to be entertained. The children have several adventures and lots of different fun activities playing with the animals in the forest. The book is formatted with text on the left page with one or more black and white illustrations above and/or below it, and the right side of the book is one big full color illustration. The book is a large format. The illustrations are gorgeous and offer much to look at, many details, rather than just mimicking the exact words of the text. I wish there were more books of this high quality available today. If there are more 100 year old books like this, I wish they would be republished. The story is lovely and the adult will enjoy reading it over and over."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"Elsa Beskow is classic! What a wonderful book deeply explorative of the Earth. Elsa is accurate with her botanical drawings. She has such a beautiful mind! She places fairy children and elf children as the helping hands to Earth's changes. As the insects and bugs are preparing for Spring's entrance, the children paint and polish them. Perfect book for ages 2-6. Innocent, perfect for homeschooled children."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"I purchased this book as I have read two other books by Elsa Beskow to my daughter.The concept of seasons is one that takes time for young children to become aware of - my two-year old daughter is just experiencing her second winter, and Beskow's previous books slowly bring that awareness about. This book, again, does a good job describing the concept of seasons and children engaging with it. It does, however, describe other not so innocent concepts - killing and descrimination.The father of the children decides for whatever reason, to go and exterminate bad snakes in the forest, also labeled monsters and enemies, as the children look on.Having seen their 'heroic' father kill the snake and realizing that they are too small to kill such a large animal, they practice by trying to kill ants in the forest - after all ants are smaller than they are!Maybe I'm being a bit sensitive, but I found myself changing the story at these points, rather than have my daughter be confronted with the idea that these 'good people' go about killing animals that they percieve to be bad or evil.As a father, I have the sensational pleasure of watching my daughter become aware of the glorious natural world we live in, especially so during our walks in the forest. I would rather have her continue to see me as someone who respects and admires, than someone who has negative preconceptions about the creatures with which we share our planetI will be returning this book."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"This is a wonderful book which has been in my family for generations.

It is the tale of a family of tiny people who live in the forest, with a description of their daily lives and interactions with critters of the woods. A very charming story. But the illustrations are also marvelous, of an almost \\"art-nouveau\\" style of the early 20th century. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"This is a wonderful children's book by a phenomenal children's author, who writes from the perspective of an old-fashioned down to earth storyteller drawing on children's imagination about nature. The books and illustrations (she's done many many books) are wonderful.Unfortunately, Amazon sells it in miniature without informing you - do not buy the $12 version unless you want a mini. Plus when it arrived, the cover was on upside down.BOO AMAZON!!!"},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"In an age of pop up books and over stimulating books, Elsa Beskow books were a wonderful find for us. The illustrations are amazing- I think I will buy duplicate copies of some of the books and frame the pictures! Most of her books have one full page as a picture and the page opposite is the words. This particular book is longer then say.. the Little Old Woman but sometimes we just read 1/2 at bedtime if we are really tired. The story is very \\"real\\" in that there is a mom, dad and 4 kids (tom, harriet, sam and daisy. The kids play at the pond with the frogs like Boffo and Renata the bat, then their dad kills Vara the viper snake (we skip past that part as my son is not ready for that yet), then the boys learn never to harm forest creatures unless they mean them harm when they poke an ants nest and get stung. While they are picking berries the troll in the cave laughs at them and scares them away. They harvest berries and mushrooms and cotton grass and learn that everyone pitches in. The mother spins that into sweaters for them for the winter. Sometimes they dance with the forest ferries in the moonlight. The mother takes them to see Mrs. Owl who knows more about plants trees and flowers and teaches all the children of the forest. Winter comes and they put their heavy doors on and snuggle in their warm gear. They go for a sleigh ride drawn by a white rabbit/hare in the snow. They share their food with other creatures who don't have enough in the winter. They sit by the fire and listen to their father tell stories about when he was a little boy. Spring comes and the birds sing and newborn creatures are all about and they also get a new brother of their own too! Awesome tale."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"Since I am born in Scandinavia I grew up with Elsa Beskow's beloved books. Her illustrations are just the most wonderful I could ever think of. Nostalgia is what brings me back to these books but I also want them for my grandchildren to have a hint of another era, another time when tales were told and there was some mysticism and magic in a child's fantasies. In todays technological wonder-world, perhaps those tales of yesteryear might help bring children back to wonderment, innocence, magic and also teach about personal accountability. There are consequenses to what we do!!! Or don't do!"},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"\\"Never hurt the creatures of the forest, unless they mean you harm.\\"I couldn't describe the workings of the natural world better to my son than this statement and this book. Nature is not always kind, not always pretty. But the cycles of life mean that one creature eats another, and thus we all take energy so that we may live. I'd rather introduce my son to the ways creatures try to defend themselves and cling to life, and then someday he will learn that sometimes, animals give their lives so that we may eat and live. And if he is ever in a life-threatening situation someday, I want him to be able to defend himself with strength, not cowering in fear as he worries about hurting someone or something else who means him harm.There are so many beautiful lessons in this book, about the seasons of life and taking care of ourselves. The little boys even learn in a very visceral way to be kind to the creatures who will not harm us - when they are stung by the ants they have disturbed.This is going to be a wonderful story, one that we will read and enjoy over and over throughout the years. It represents the fantasy childhood world I want my son to encounter, and is a beautiful reminder of the magical life."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"All the Elsa Beskow books, but particularly this one, are very, very special, as you will see from the very first page. I read many of them as a child, and they have stayed with me into adulthood. The children of the forest are tiny creatures that people usually don't see, since their hats look like mushroom caps. This short and wonderfully-illustrated book chronicles the adventures of a family of six forest people -- splashing in the brook, playing with the bats and frogs, learning at Mrs. Owl's school, teasing the snake, and cuddling up next to a winter's fire to hear tales from their father. It is an iconic representation of the Swedish countryside, and it will make you long to be a little forest person too, playing in those beautiful woods."},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"This book is everything a children's book should be.

The story is completely different from the story we've rented at the library, i'm assuming a \\"more\\" original version.

If I would have received this book not having read the one we love, I would have just chalked it up to a so-so/boring children's book with pretty illustrations.

We have read this book MANY times, and love how it follows a woodland sprite family through the seasons of the year. When I ordered this, I made sure to order the large format of this book (12x9 inches) - I feel that the board book version would not do the illustrations justice, plus my daughter is 5 and a baby book would be inappropriate for her at this point. The story ties imagination and nature together quite nicely as the family interacts with the animals of the forest through all of the seasons, as well as some fairies in the fall. My daughter loves this book for the illustrations and the story as well - it has led to a lot of imaginative play for her outside as the weather begins to warm up!"},{"Title":"Children Of The Forest","review":"Our 6 year old granddaughter LOVED it..Took it to school to share the day after receiving it.

I am interested in seeing stories about cultures other than my own. However, I found that this book was all over the place. In one sentence they would be talking about a tradition or meal, next sentence a complete 180, talking about a completely different topic. There are a lot of analogies in this book, and unusual sentences. This is probably a really sweet book for those you can relate to it, first hand. I do not know much about Chinese/Korean traditions. Sentence Example from book, about grandma making dinner,\\"Her fingernails scrape off the warts on the wood fungus.\\" I needed a little more explanation of what that means, and so did my 6 year old. She wondered why they were cooking warts, wood, and fungus for a special occasion dinner. I liked the book's theme.

His complex heroes, Tao and Kate, return with a host of creative new characters. The novel calls to mind the grandeur of the great science fiction authors without being derivative. This book is a true page turner; once picked up it cannot be put down. I would recommend it both to long term science fiction fans, who will find it a breath of fresh air from the cliches of the genre, and to new readers, who will find it a fascinating introduction."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"The first half of this book (the part spent on Earth) was filled with over the top characters who were completely moronic and unbelievable. This would have been ok if the author was going for something like the movie Starship Troopers (not the books) however, the characters suddenly become more real and believable almost all at once. I suppose this isn't a terrible thing but it showed a bit of confusion on which way to take the book.It wasn't until the last 1/4 of the book that it suddenly got interesting. As interactions with an alien species came in, the book became much more readable and I was hooked until the end. I will give it 3 stars because Bruce Balfour did a proper save face when it mattered and left me with plenty of questions."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"The novel starts of with promise but then the griding of the authors personal axes starts to whine in your ear. And it gets louder and louder as the pages turn. The NASA sections are just plain unbelievable. Why must every Sci-Fci author paint them with the incompentant pen pusher brush? The scenese of modern society are not beliveable. The characters are less complicated and real than the plastic toys you find in McDonalds fun meals. Once on mars it just gets more and more stupid until you wonder at your own personal skills in picking this book up and not noticing the smell it gives out. A stinker. I thought it may be trying to be funny ala &quot;the stainless steel rat&quot; but I suspect the author just can't write."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"To getting 5 stars from this sci-fi fan reviewer.Ancient artifacts have been excavated by a Russian team of cosmonauts on the red planet while simultaneously Tau Wolfsinger is laboring in the Nasa Ames Research Center on new VR technology, and wading through the bureaucratic red tape and political infighting to find funding/support for his research. His fiancee an archeologist goes to further investigate Mars on the eve of his proposal, but he soon finds himself reunited with her planetside.Balfour's science fiction offering is a brilliant balance of plot and characterization. He seemingly effortlessly weaves plots and sub-plots tightly together, without sacrificing other aspects (again i.e. characterization) to his crisp exciting story. In fact I have mentioned characterization twice because his main hero bears a striking similiarity to Bova's protaganist in his Mars epic. Either this reflection in having strong Native American male character's in two Mars novels is a coincidence, or Balfour is paying a nice tribute to Bova. The similarities pretty much stop there though as Balfour's novel is as original as another title on the red planet could be, interspersed with delightful scenes of intrique and human drama. This is a title I just recently finished, but am almost already craving re-reading."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"Fun book! Balfour does a great job of explaining the issues surrounding nanotechnology and the autonomous artificial intelligence debate.

Filled with a must-have multitude of futuristic gizmos, gadgets, and gleaming skyscrapers, technobuffs will be in heaven imagining the possibilities that lie just a few years down the mag-lev tracks.The characters are mostly well written, but the AI characterizations turned out to be the most entertaining and imaginative. A suped-up 'tamaguchi' named Aristotle that's smarter than we are, an ancient computer that's going insane, it's mortal enemy, and battle droids that live for thousands of years round out the AI character complement in this story and I couldn't get enough. I really wanted to see more focus on them and less whining about the NASA beauracracy though.The depiction of NASA department heads as little more than physically insecure, power-hungry idiots that can only shuffle paper and steal their subordinates' ideas MIGHT be completely accurate. However, it's way overplayed in the book and didn't add anything to the story.Large portions of the book resemble action/adventure. Secret underground Russian bases, assassinations directed from Capitol Hill, the evil corporation pulling strings in the background. Take out the sliding sidewalks and the trip to Mars and you'd get the makings of a political thriller. Mr. Balfour successfully blends the two genre's together and creates a great story that I've recommended to friends, family, and now YOU.Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"In this circa mid 21st century tale by this relatively unknown author, a group on Mars discovers remnants of an alien culture that colonized Mars in the distant past. Unbeknownst to them, another group on Earth for decades had other pieces of the alien technology, kept in secret. One of the groups wants to use the technology to gain international power and they will stop at nothing to unlock the secrets of the alien technology. Nanotechnologist Tau Wolfsinger, of American Indian descent, and his girlfriend and others, are caught up in this power struggle, and there are unforeseen consequences as a result of messing around with the alien artifacts. No more about it, no spoilers!This story was well written except for a couple of things, one was the battle tanks on Mars in the mid 21st century. Give me a break, sending even lightweight tanks to Mars in the year 2050 would be prohibitively expensive. Otherwise, no major criticisms, and this novel was written in an easy to read style and should keep your interest. Character development was superb, well worth reading, and you will even learn a little about American Indian philosophy and rituals."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"...writing-by-numbers, in other words. The plot is fairly straightforward, the combat scenes work quite well, especially when the machines join the fray, but the whole novel didn't quite work for me.Why writing-by-numbers? Let's start with the protagonist. Tau Wolfsinger is supposedly a brilliant scientist - the problem with this sort of declarations is that we should be shown some of that brilliance somewhere, to substantiate the claim (which, for instance, Kim Robinson did in creating Sax Russell). Nope. He's another event-propelled cardboard hero. The Navajo bit is transparently thrown in to make the guy different in some way (just the way it's done in most mass-produced thrillers today), and it never really works out. Sadly it's the machines who are the most &quot;natural&quot; and fresh personae in the novel, but we only see them for a short while, which is too bad. I just hope that this doesn't reflect the author's private life - the fact that machines are more &quot;lifelike&quot; than humans in his novel is somewhat worrisome...Other than Tau and the machines, we get Tau's significant other, his mentor (who - of course - gets offed), a Mad Russian (a very comic-book style villain, somewhat enjoyable), and a generic plot that didn't really engage this reader at any time. Good for a long bus ride, but I hope nobody bought the movie rights...PS. According to author's bio, he was previously involved in computer game development. This might explain some things..."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"BALFOUR CREATES A SCENERIO THAT TAKES US FROM EARTH TO MARS IN A REALISTIC STORY BASED ON DEMONSTRATED NASA ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

Or why the &quot;shadowy cabal government&quot; wanted them there in the first place. The characters were creative if not engaging. I just didn't find myself caring about what happened to them.

The writing is fair enough, but the lack of originality really drains your enthusiasm. Science fiction is a tough medium to write in as most of the truly great ideas have already been explored, but it's not an excuse to re-work works from Philip K Dick (\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?\\", i.e. the movie Total Recall) and Stanley Clarke (\\"2010, The Year We Make Contact\\"). Do yourself a favor and read those two books...and skip this one."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"A near-future speculative fiction novel with a fast pace, well-drawn characters, realistic science, shadow governments, conspiracy, and a sense of wonder. If you mixed Ray Bradbury with Kim Stanley Robinson, shook them together with a dash of Robert Ludlum and a twist of Tony Hillerman, you'd have a novel in the style of The Forge of Mars. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kate McCloud and her inner journey that reflected the trials and tribulations of her outer journey as she moved from a sedate existence in San Francisco to an amazing discovery on Mars. I also enjoyed the detailed Russian background of General Zhukov. This kind of character development is sadly lacking in much of the speculative fiction I've read over the last few years, so it's refreshing to see a skilled new author who takes as much time with the characters as he does with the plot. I got my hands on an advance copy, but I'm buying more for my friends."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"I just stayed up till dawn to finish THE FORGE OF MARS, and I am still reeling from this magnificent book. I loved the contrast of Navajo culture with the high-tech of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, and I didn't want the story to end.In this book, Balfour creates a fully-realized world fifty years from now, with dark conspiracies behind the scenes and characters striving to come to grips with the modern world and forces beyond their control. The writing is extraordinary, compelling, and generates a sense of wonder. The stories of Tau, Kate, and Zhukov are exciting, disturbing, and enthralling.Balfour carefully lays out several different strands of story and then braids them together with unerring skill -- the kind of plotting that trips up a lot of writers but looks easy when done by a master. On the surface, it is a gripping adventure story; but it is much more than that, for Balfour regularly brings us face-to-face with the moral dimensions of his characters. We care about their world, their struggles, and Tau's efforts to unravel the great mysteries.I want more. Right now."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Forge of Mars\\" by Bruce Balfour in about three sittings. I couldn't put it down. The story takes place in the near future. Two scientists, Tau and Kate, get caught up in political intrigue involving discoveries on Mars and their implications.Normally I don't care much for hard science fiction because sometimes the plot is just an excuse to describe scientific principles that go right over my head, but in this case the plot is super interesting, the characters are complex, and the science makes complete sense. The bad guy is fascinating (I'd love to see more of HIM), and the women are capable and strong without being masculine. Balfour is a great writer and I'm sure we'll hear more from him."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"Barely readable. Not particularly creative, nothing to ponder, characters you really don't care about. Where has all the good science fiction gone? Not here."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"On the surface, Bruce Balfour's new novel, The Forge of Mars, is a science fiction thriller with enough realistic science in it that you come away with the feeling that you've learned something. A Navajo NASA scientist is given the opportunity to pursue his groundbreaking research on Mars, unaware that shadowy government forces with their own agenda have manipulated him into a confrontation with a powerful alien intelligence. However, if you look for deeper meaning, you realize that Balfour's novel is about the human mind, human weaknesses, and how our personal interpretations of reality can alter the world in which we live. Balfour mixes a literary effort with the excitement of a mass-market genre. His style is simple, but poetic, vividly painting both the stark realities of the Martian landscape and the turbulent mental landscapes of the main characters -- ranging from a Navajo scientist fighting the shadows to a Russian general fighting for a lost ideology. I was sorry to see this story end, and I hope to see more from this author in the near future."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"This is my first Amazon.com book review. Everyone who knows me I read a lot, but this is the first time I've written about a book I've read here.I started off feeling the book was \\"OK\\"... it didn't keep me up at night, but it was an enjoyable enough book... Then later on in the book when everyone got to Mars things started to take a turn for the worse. What little bit of a \\"plot\\" that had been developing in the book started to fall apart. As other's have commented here the characters seemed to be \\"cookie-cutter\\" style, lacking depth.I just don't know where to start... the \\"Russian tanks\\" that are on Mars (yea... when earlier in the book they are talking about shipping a hand full of people at a time Russia would ship \\"TANKS\\" to Mars...), or the \\"un-killable\\" assassin that shows up on the ship, just before they blast off back to Earth, or the changing timelines (they have a ship that will be at Mar's in a few days, then a few days pass (while he is off in an alien world learning \\"the way of the warrior\\" and adding in a little randomness into the alien AI), and then after all of that they are still a few days away...I've seen a number of people here give RAVE reviews, and I guess I just look at the book differently. Anyway... I do not feel that I could recommend anyone buying it... that is unless you already like the writings of Bruce Balfour. If you know someone who has this book, or if you can get it from a library, then it might be worth checking out... but at today's book prices... in my opinion, no."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"There are only a few books I have given up on before finishing, and this is one of them. Being a fancier of possible life and artifacts on mars, I was drawn to the enticements of the book jacket. Unfortunately, once I began reading I became repelled by the prose, plotting (or is that plodding?) and characters. The writing is pedantic, the people and human situations unbelievable, the science meager, the frame of reference nerdishly undeveloped. I knew that if I persevered, I would only be angry at myself and the author for wasting my time. I must express my gratitude to the other low score reviewers for helping warn me off."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"This book is a real stinker. Written in amateur prose with cardboard characters and a plot that reads like a Saturday morning cartoon. The continuous references to a vast amount of future tech and the ridiculous amount of exposition slows down the first part of the book to the point of pain. Add to that the disjointed nature and many clich&eacute;s used by the author and you've got yourself a truly childish piece of work. There's far better science fiction out there, don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"Bruce Balfour's The Forge of Mars is certainly an interesting, singular science fiction novel, but it seems to lack a certain oomph. The rousing adventure I was promised was not quite as rousing as I had expected (especially over the course of the first 200 pages), and the novel seems to me to lack just a little bit of cohesion. While Balfour's characterization of his protagonist is quite strong, I never came to adequately understand several of the secondary characters and their actions to my own satisfaction. Still, the novel represents science fiction well worth reading.Tau Wolfsinger is a brilliant NASA technician struggling to get his ideas taken seriously in the halls of bureaucracy. A man of Navajo descent, he has a way of looking at science and the world that does not fit the corporate mold of over-specialization, and like many an eccentric genius he does not have any desire to play the game that leads to rapid promotion within an organization. Wolfsinger's interest is in artificial intelligence. His pet proposal would have him designing an artificial intelligence capable of procreating itself, learning and advancing on its own through a form of coevolution as weak links in the nanotechnology development are weeded out, and eventually (albeit quickly) out-performing and out-analyzing human beings. Grant my proposal, he says, and I will create an AI that will begin with nanotechnology and build an entire human colony all by itself. No one at NASA wants to go along with his &quot;dangerous&quot; ideas, though.Enter the Davros Group and secret discoveries on Mars. The remains of an alien civilization have been discovered, among which is a portal that the Russian scientists in control of the base have been unable to figure out. Through a somewhat clumsy set of circumstances, Wolfsinger is suddenly given the money to pursue his dream but is coerced into doing his work on Mars. Here both he and his girlfriend become pawns of powerful factions who are never really fleshed out sufficiently for my liking. The work on the alien Martial portal is being conducted (and kept secret) by the Russian military, but alien intelligences on Mars contend with the Russians over control of Wolfsinger's contributions to pivotal events bearing possibly significant repercussions back on Earth.The science of this novel is detailed and impressive, as Balfour delights in theorizing on the practical uses of nanotechnology in the future. The weak link in the story, though, involves the political shenanigans working behind the scenes. The mysterious Davros Group is barely explained at all, making its cooperation with a Russian military officer hoping to restore Russia as a superpower seems rather tenuous. Even the actions of Wolfsinger's girlfriend oftentimes made little sense to me, although Wolfsinger himself is an impressively well-developed character. I was also a little surprised to learn that the alien artifact discovered at the very beginning is basically ignored throughout the first half of the novel. The Forge of Mars is a well-written science fiction novel, but it seems to pose a number of provocative questions that it fails to follow up on outside the main focus of the plot, and that fact served to limit the extent of my personal involvement with the story as a whole."},{"Title":"The Forge of Mars","review":"Tau Wolfsinger is a brilliant, cutting edge scientist who works on Artificial Intelligence for NASA. He is unhappy because he can't get funding because he's too independent a thinker and the powers that be believe that Tau's ideas that an A.I. can build a city is to dangerous to explore. His personal life is going down the tubes as well with his fiancee Kate heading to Mars for a long time.Evidence of an ancient civilization has been discovered on the red planet and Kate is one of the archeologists going to excavate the site. Neither Tau nor Kate know they are being manipulated by a shadow government known as the Davos group who want to find out how these ancient artifacts can be used to further their goals. They believe Tau is the best person to figure out what these artifacts and portals are all about so they give the scientist the funding he needs providing he does the testing on Mars.Bruce Balfour does an excellent job of explaining the concepts of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and nanotechnology in layman's turns. His protagonist is a mild-mannered person who can play hardball when the situation warrants it. THE FORGE OF MARS is an action packed science fiction thriller that is a one sitting read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gregory's Shadow (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","review":"Skittish little Gregory Groundhog is used to having his Shadow follow him all the time, everywhere he goes.

The appendix also has wonderful forms you can use for keeping track of who gives you what when, since after reading this book, you will inevitably be checking your bill with a magnifying glass (and finding numerous mistakes, as 98.5% of all hospital bills contain them, according to the author). Since this book is endorsed by the People's Medical Society, a non-profit consumer organization that I think has ties to the Rodale Foundation, it's nice to know that the revisions of this volume have input from previous readers sharing their experiences (and how the book helped them in their own hospital experience).

This permission in most teaching hospitals needs to be given as an expressed written consent. Nurses run the show?

Overall, this book is full of wrong information. Using this as a template on how to communicate with hospital staff during your stay is a surefire way to alienate the staff.

The Holy Ghost touched my heart as I read each page. The beautiful details of Christ's ministry, the signs of his birth and death, and more are written in a wonderous style that only Jamed E. Talmage could have done. This book was written in one of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saint temples, where the veil between God and Jesus, and us is thinner and allows our hearts, minds and spirits to become much more receptive to the truth and the love our Savior has for us.He is the Carpter of Nazerth that can mend broken lives, and mend the broken bridge between us and our loving Heaveny Father.I was especially touched by the section where Peter sees his Master walking upon the water and excitedly asks to join him. Our Lord's answer was as always, \\"Come.\\" Peter jumped out and for a few moments managed to STAND and WALK upon the water due to his great faith in Jesus, and keeping his eye on the Savior as he walked across the water. However, once Peter looked away from his Lord, he felt winds and the thrashing water around and under him attacking him. He became afraid and began to sink.Yet, his faith was not totally lost: trusting in Christ, he called out \\"Lord, save me!\\" and Jesus came and pulled him out of the water, saying, \\"O ye of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\\"Sometimes, I have felt like Peter, sinking into the depths of despair, but I trust my Master that he will help me as I remain righteous and cry out to him for help. This little story teaches us to ignore the \\"shafts and the whirlwinds\\"(Helaman 5:12) sent by the devil and his influences and focus on our Lord as we 'walk across the water of life' to reach him and gain immortality and Eternal Life. It is hard, I've sank multiple times and am no better than anyone else. But, just DON'T give up!

Then I realized the book was copywritten around 1915... I guess that was the opinion of the day back then. But nearly a hundred years later, surely no sane person is walking around thinking any physical race is cursed. Are we not all children of God. This is something I would not want my children to read, nor could I in good conscious recommend this to a friend. I can't believe any church would endorse such racist teachings.

Considering the strong Trinitarian (even Modalist) passages in the Book of Mormon from the early 1830s, and contrasting these passages with the humanist and polytheistic passages in the Pearl of Great Price and D&C; 130 in the 1840s, I can see their point. That said, Talmage's apology for Mormon beliefs as then (and currently) existing are excellent, and I have used them myself when bashing.Overall, I recommend this book as far superior in its doctrinal exposition and in its tone to Mormon Doctrine, even though its scope is necessarily more limited."},{"Title":"Jesus the Christ","review":"I believe I have just read a plagiarized worked from the Big Three Victorian writers of the late 1800's, Frederick W.

It would be nearly impossible for a non-member seeking to truly understand the tenants of the LDS faith without first reading this book. Talmage's book should be considered required reading for all Mormon scholars, both within and without the faith.The LDS faithful will surely find inspiration in its pages that rivals only that of their scripture.

From the book: \\"The treatment embodied in these pages, in addition to the narrative of the Lord's Life in the flesh, comprises the antemortal existence and activities of the world's Redeemer, the revelations and personal manifestations of the glorified and exalted Son of God during the apostolic period of old and in modern times, the assured nearness of the Lord's second advent, and predicted events beyond.\\" The author reviews each phase of the existence of Christ by calling on the four standard works of scripture in the Mormon canon: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. This passage is an example of the language used throughout the book -- thorough, verbose, with a deep vocabulary.This book has helped me better understand passages of scripture in the New Testament and other scriptures.

If you have any question about Christology among the Mormons, this book will answered any and every question.Joseph F. Smith, the President of the Church, commissioned James E. Talmage, a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, to write this biography on the life of Christ. The idea was to use this book as a home reference and a Church textbook. He more than met the challenge, and this book is still in print almost 100 years later, and is standard work for LDS Missionaries.This book covers every aspect of Christ as best can be expected in one volume. It begins with Christ premortal existence, his mortal ministry in Palestine, his atonement, and finally his post mortal ministry in the Spirit Word (I believe . . . he was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell) and among the Nephites as recorded in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.The only two drawbacks with this book are it size, and the verbiage.

Don't get me wrong, I love the New Testament but I need a wider understanding of the culture into which the Savior was born. I understand that the rejection of the Savior by his own people was because of the ruling/shepherds of the jewish people had fallen into boasting of their own righteousness ie. the keeping of the Law of Moses, instead of being interested in loving and shepherding the flock of believers. The Jews , at this time were not a free people, they were under the vassalege of Rome.

At the time I knew very little about Asian food preparation, and the book helped quite a bit:The book begins with a glossary of basic terms and ingredients used in Asian kitchens, and also a rundown of grilling techniques, then proceeds to a series of ready meals (main grilled dish offered with one or two side dishes that are a traditional complement to the meal).The sauces and marinades are easy to prepare and the flavors are bold and very fresh. The book utilized fresh vegetables and fruit in side dishes and salads that are amazing with the marinated and grilled meats and make a gorgeous presentation.Furthermore, as I have discovered in the years of using the book, the recipes are also flexible and open to improvisation-resulting in possibly less authentic, but still wonderful and fun party food that can be prepared on a small tabletop hibachi grill right in front of your guests (you'll have to do prep work and make side dishes in advance, but grilling the meat and fish in front of guests has been a great way to bring a party together in my experience).Overall, I found no fault with this book at all even from a beginner's (at the time) point of view-but the recipes are interesting enough for the more experienced chefs as well.I also recommend \\"A Flash in the Pan: 100 Fast and Furious Recipes for Wok and Stir-Fry\\" by Liz Trigg and Shirley Gill for wonderful wok and stir-fry recipes for those beginner cooks who want to learn more about Asian food than just grilling."},{"Title":"The Asian Grill","review":"If you are bored with steak, hamburger and chicken on the charcoal grill, here are recipes for Bulgogi (Korean Fire Beef), Salmon in Miso Glaze, and many skewered chicken and shrimp dishes that are easy to make, but certainly a different take on grilling.

As I grazed through it, I realized it was absolutely awesome. I became completely disconnected from the party for a second because I became instantly immersed in the book. As soon as I flipped through and saw guides on reproductive health, spiritual health, and mental health, I was sold! I do not mean this in abstract 'tyler perry movie' terms, key words, and slogans. Or as plugs for essence magazine - I mean reproductive health in a way that breaks down what your period is, how it actually works, how it works when you give birth, how it works when you naturally regulate your period rather than using chemical birth manipulators, and it tells you the options of birth control if you choose those options, AND it gives you information on abortion if that is what you choose and it tells you about aftercare, AND it tells you about breastfeeding if you desire to give birth and feed your baby naturally AND about formula if you so choose for any reason (though you should be aware of the health benefits over formula, im sure its terrible to use a replacement for god-given breast milk - but as I will state in a second the book deals with the fact that not many black women are afforded the luxury of breast feeding due to hectic work schedules (i'm not sure how much the book put rightly states that but i connected some dots). I mean I could go on about what the book has to prove - i'm serious, I will. They even took on the Hyde Amendment, which was an amendment in 1976 that took paid abortions AWAY from women on government health insurance. This included medicaid patients, military women, and native american sisters on reservations. This was tied up with the religious right and they way they manipulate government with moral talk in order to consolidate and steal power for big corporations.....but i've digressed. For my masters thesis at the University of Chicago I worked on this topic. The amendment passed, and white feminists did not react, they did not raise alarm as much as black feminists had (this is shown from the little research i've done in this post-reaction period, my thesis deals with the formation and the passage of this bill, looking at the language of congressmen in order to see how they classify black, poor, and brown women with their language in order to pass such a restrictive, discriminatory, and harmful piece of legislation). HOWEVER, this research topic - white feminist's non-reaction - keeps coming up in the primary literature i have read. i would like to study this topic for my PhD. Anyway,..... and so literally millions of women have been denied access to the reproductive freedoms that were once guaranteed by the protection of the federal government. After the passage of the Hyde amendment, the loyalty that our country would like to claim to have to women was broken. This 'Body and Soul' book states the question I have been asking regarding another aspect of this amendment regarding where those who SAID they believed in reproductive freedom and equality: white feminists. The question was this: WHAT THE HELL WAS UP WITH WHITE FEMINISTS WHEN OUR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY? (I dont think this was necessarily answered to my satisfaction as a scholar, just because I am taught to be eternally curious, not because I think the authors knowingly missed or misinterpreted anything - i simply think there is more to understand about that post-reaction moment and the moments of preparation from the activist's side through some involved oral history reports. Since that history is hardly ever exposed, it must be prodded for. And I believe we sisters are the only ones that will do it. However, all the sentences I just had to relay in order to explain the Hyde Amendment, the book didnt use, but I still knew what they meant when they raised the question....(Yet, this may be because of my research in this area).This book also breaks down why black women find it difficult to unite in organizations in present day due to practical reasons. They show that even as we deeply believe in the struggle of our fellow sisters fighting for us, it is hard to find time, money, effort, and energy to give to such causes. I am not sure if the book touches on why this is, but I believe this is because we black women are very low on the totem pole of society as far as power and income go. There are extreme disparities (You should know that there are many number games that ppl play in order to skew the number of blacks upon welfare - another manipulation is the images of social media (as martin gilens showed). SO, I do NOT mean that the majority of poor women are black, for that is the opposite of true. poor white ppl stretch from coast to coast with lots of rural area in between, so the far outnumber poor blacks. society is just obsessed with urban cities and so that's where their attention goes..... Its not like broken-down projects in urban cities are brown peoples natural habitats (and their ACTUAL, NATURAL habitats have been destroyed by historic colonialization and current globalization, pollution, and contamination by corporate entities. Note that these current-day destoryed and exploited natural habitats are EVERYWHERE that white ppl DONT stand in majority. Because they simply dont raid, rape, clean and cleanse, each other). Rather, the harsh, substandard, dehumanizing 'urban', 'inner-city' living conditions are the effects of the oppression of corporations and the lobbying measures they use to sway, manipulate, and swindle the attitudes of the public - these intentionally substandard conditions should be treated as such - as but they never are. They are not realized as the neglect of country to adequately provide for a citizen unable to be absorbed into the low job market, or that is unable to survive by what they get, or by someone who is highly skilled and has just so happened to wind up stuck in a bad occupation, one that isnt in demand.... only to find they must go back to school and risk their life, credit, family etc..... and need some assistance anywhere in any of those several scenerios or countless others, instead of risking homelessness......... So black women our struggle is extremely hard, and for these purposes it takes more effort and energy for us to meet the daily requirements and sacrifices for survival, this makes it hard to do extra activities such as congregate when we should be working or washing or cooking or SLEEPING! (since we never do) etc...But sisters, be aware that every one is scared because we are, and have been, closing up the educational gap - consistently. Be assured there may be a fight to curb this. probabaly in the form of birth control options. The government always finds a way to exterminate unwanted sactions that get to disruptive or powerful (and really this means they stop them from wanting equality). We have to keep our black men believing that they are the images of [insert whoever the supreme being may be that you believe, whatever it is u say that gave life or that is life] so that our brothers stuck in oppression can see themselves for, and be, the pieces of perfection that they are..... I guess that point resonates to the spiritual and mental health that this book acknowledges that we need and tells us how to get this peace and clarity, naturally, and healthily, in ways that will make ourselves, our mates, and our communities stronger.It is in this spirit of positivity that I say the authors bring up these issues in ways that apply SPECIFICALLY to black women. They explain how, and which, of the latest sciences have not been tested on us, and therefore, could be unsafe.What I find most interesting is that the authors speak these truths in plain english. There isn't any high and mighty language that you usually find in academic writing, and there are no gigantic dictionary terms. So the book is not dry, it is a smooth, enjoyable, inspirational, and enlightening read. But the language is NOT played down to feel childish either (though you could indeed give it to our young sisters. Most importantly, I believe we should). The book feels very conversational and It is a must must must read for black women.....SOOOOooooooo, in this review, I reviewed the portions of the book that i've seen so far........ and I even added social commentary and history :)I've decided i'm going to buy this book for every black woman I know on her birthday or any other occasion that warrants a gift. I can think of four people who will get this book immediately. And that's not counting the book I just bought for me and my mom. I think the authors did an amazing job and i'm hoping to get my copy immediately."},{"Title":"Body and Soul","review":"What's with the price??I've read other things by this author and couldn't wait to explore this book but this price is ridiculous.Hope it changes soon.

HOWEVER--- this edition of his book, which I assume has long been out-of-print, is unreadable. It has, according to a disclaimer inside the front cover, been produced by robotically scanning an old copy of the book. The disclaimer says there may be \\"a few typos\\" and some \\"missed pages\\". (Missed PAGES?) This is an understatement-- the punctuation in this edition is haywire and the spelling is almost as bad (hilariously, in some cases-- on one page Shakespeare is printed \\"Quakspere\\"!). At first I thought I could put up with the errors, but there are so many of them that you get no sense of the flow of Mr. Lewes' thought and no pleasure in the reading. I ended up sending it back.

The pictures are nice (beware text-books that have reviews that keep stressing &quot;beautifully illustrated&quot; -all too often that is a nice way of saying &quot;textually lacking&quot;!) but the text is definitely &quot;dumbed down&quot; &amp; my students squirmed in embarrassment when I forced them to read it. Margins are huge, graphics are of questionable value (when WILL folks stop using exploded 3-D pie charts for anything except confusing the board of directors?)and while the emphasis on the UK does give a sort of &quot;international&quot; flavour if you are teaching in the US it also means that you will need to do either a lot of explaining or give a lot of supplementary reading. my guess is that this book would fit in nicely with standard &quot;environmental studies&quot; curricula where the students were never going to come into contact with the original literature, didn't want to be pushed too hard, and wanted to be familiar with current buzz-words in onservation. beyond that?

If you want to read a book of the sea that is gripping, heart-pounding entertainment, this book was written for you. Mowat conveys the story to the reader with true and unusual insight. I don't think anyone has ever done better. The reader will marvel at the grit and determination of these men."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"In the early 1900's, as big ships crossed the Atlantic Ocean, severe weather complicated by mechanical failure, frequently ran them aground or caused them to &quot;take on water&quot; in the unforgiving open ocean.As the gale winds began to blow, the big ships would seek safe harbor. Not so for the salvage and rescue ships running out of Nova Scotia. The more intense the storm, the more likely they would get an urgent call to leave home port and take the full bruntin order to salvage a foundering ship or rescue the survivors.The salvors make their living in the chaos of wind, sleet and an ocean streaked white with rage.Absolutely amazing feats of men against the sea and the massive forces of big ships &quot;on the rocks&quot;.The story line follows a salvage ship, the Foundation Franklin, from its own recovery, refurbishment, and baptism into the salvage business. The author breathes life into the old ship with eloquent imagery and dry wit. He explores the stalwart character of her crews, which evolve throughout the book; a collection of individual short stories revealing each fantastic rescue.Well worth reading if you like real-world adventure and appreciate the power of the sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago, lost it and have been trying to find it for about 5 years.

I have recomended it to all my marine friends but have not been able to locate it until today."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This book is an unexpectedly riveting episode-by-episode story of the Foundation Franklin, a marine salvage tug that sailed out of the ports of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the 1930s and '40s. This working ship, built in Scotland in 1916 to craftsman's standards, eventually found itself unused in a Hamburg shipyard in depression-strapped 1930 where it was identified as a possible vessel for the Canadian maritime salvage fleet. From that day to its final heart-stopping drama, the trials of this unprepossessing high seas coal-fired tugboat are recounted in all their adrenalin-filled reality in Mowat's gripping and evocative prose. Managed by callous profit-seekers, officered by experience-hardened seamen and crewed by men desperate for employment, Foundation Franklin's story is, as well, a slice of social and commercial history. The mood is workaday danger, fortitude, struggle and courage, marred by a single passing dismissive remark about &quot;union mechanics&quot;."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I first discovered &quot;Grey Seas Under&quot; about 15 years ago, appropriately enough as Able Seaman on an Ocean Salvage Tug. I was immediately enthralled. Out of the many books on the sea I have read, this one remains very dear to me (not that you have to be a mariner to enjoy it). Grey Seas Under is the true story of the ocean salvage tug, FOUNDATION FRANKLIN and the brave men who battled the North Atlantic to save hundreds of ships and thousands of lives. Farley Mowat, a master srory-teller, passionately desribes the exploits of FOUNDATION FRANKLIN with geat admiration and humor. Grey Seas Under is a true masterpiece saga of the sea. I've read this book probably 6 times in the last 10 years and I'm sure to re-read it for many years to come. I cannot recommend this book enough. I also highly recommend &quot;The Serpents Coil&quot; also by Farley Mowat, another first-rate tale of the sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This is probably my all-time favorite book.

I suppose the Rodney Dangerfield of maritime subtopics. Even the term tug boat rings a bit derogatory. Disregarded and disrespected. But . . . .I am excited to report my discovery of this extremely well authored true story of the proud ship, Foundation Franklin. Built by the British as HMS Frisky in 1918, and between the Wars, rescued from a mothball yard in Hamburg and put into service by Foundation Maritime Company as a deep sea rescue/salvage tug out of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Renamed \\"Foundation Franklin\\", the Franklin and her men performed heroically for decades, extending through and beyond WWII, saving hundreds of ships and thousands of lives, often operating under absolutely deadly conditions.I'm impressed. I learned something about a little part of the world and the men/ships that work it which I will never forget, nor forget to appreciate. Farley Mowat wrote superbly in this work, which was at times pulse-pounding. I learned to grow fond of the Franklin, and mourn her absence maybe as if I had steamed on her myself.A rather obscure topic and title, but this is a great maritime story, lived out and told in the tradition of The Cruel Sea and The Caine Mutiny. Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"Another Farley Mowat adventure in northern waters. He gives you your money's worth, and more. Great writer, and a sweeping subject: rescues at sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"The ocean-going salvage tug, \`Foundation Franklin' was more than a match for the worst the North Atlantic could throw at her, including Force 10 hurricanes and Nazi U-Boats. Perfect Storm, eat your heart out! Here is the real book about the great-hearted men and their staunch little ships that survived blow after blow from the Atlantic and bobbed up for more.If the author, Farley Mowat is sometimes guilty of over-the-top prose---well, he lived and worked on the Franklin, and he loved her sturdy lines, her jaunty roll, and every rivet that held her together while she rescued ships that were Goliaths to her chubby, little Baby Huey. No work could have been more dangerous; none required a higher degree of seamanship and courage than dropping a line on a berserk, lunging, steel-hulled freighter, and then towing her through the maw of a mid-December gale, or the shoals and \`sunkers' of the Newfoundland coast---something the Franklin did so many times that her crew lost memory of all but their most freakish or man-killing expeditions.\\"Grey Seas Under\\" will give you an interesting perspective on the true maritime heroes of World War II. Farley Mowat doesn't pull any punches when he describes the tension that existed between the expert seamen on the ocean-going salvage and rescue tugs, and their relatively \`amateur' counterparts on Canadian and American naval warships. Some of the funniest scenes in the book involve convoys of merchant ships under the \`protection' of corvettes and destroyers. Once a U-Boat had been sighted and the merchants steamed for cover, it was up to the Franklin to rescue the ones that ran into each other or shoaled themselves. Usually, the tug had to perform her duties without any cover from the warships.\\"The days the salvors (tugboat seamen) spent tethered to fat and crippled merchantmen, crawling along on a straight course at a speed of two or three knots like mechanical targets in a shooting gallery, were the kind of days that would drain the courage from the most heroic man alive...The Germans knew, that for every rescue vessel sunk there would be a score of crippled merchantmen who would never make safe port.\\"This is a great book about men against the sea, even though the language gets very nautical at times. Read it and you will learn all about Lloyd's Open Form, and the tricks that wrecked merchant masters play to cheat tugs out of their salvage fees. You'll learn to tell the difference between \`Monkey Island' and the poop deck---and the difference between \`brass monkeys' and true seamen. You'll thrill to the dangers of sunkers, beam seas, and Arctic white-outs. You'll bite through your pipe-stem, just like the Franklin's captain did during those tows when his sturdy little tug steamed back into port with barely enough coal in her bunkers to \\"cook a pot of beans.\\"Someone ought to make a movie out of \\"Grey Seas Under.\\" It's got everything---romance (between man and ship, at least); life-and-death adventures; heroism; humor; and the treacherous ice, wind, and sea of what the author respectfully refers to as \`the Great Western Ocean.'"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I have read this book twice and I loved it. Mowat wrote as if the tug was a living thing. It was wonderful. I actually cried at the end when Franklin came into the harbor with barely any power left and covered entirely with ice, thus ending her life. The people who captained Franklin intriqued me as well. In the book they were the only ones that really cared for her."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"Farley Mowat can make the stars sing with the sheer beauty of his writing. His writing is a little old-fashioned by today's standards, (all the better) but his craftsmanship is unsurpassed. You ARE there. You feel everything his characters felt, you see what they saw. The book ends happily and I know it, but I cry through the last chapter every time I read it because his writing takes me there.

The &quot;placebo paradox&quot; has confounded reductionist thinkers for decades: if there is nothing in the pill, then how can it cause health effects? Dan Moerman doesn't have to take us far out of the conventional box to show that - of course - it isn't the inert pills, but instead the meanings attached with them that have influenced outcomes in so many scientific experiments. Meaning, belief and understanding govern how we think and feel, which in turn effect our physical and psychological health. Empty colored pills, sham surgery and suggestion lead to real health effects, even under the most rigorous of settings: randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. While reasonably comprehensive and highly accurate, this book is also accessible, as it is written with a style and flair that should prove attractive to most readers. Highly recommended it is!Bruce Barrett MD PhDDepartment of Family MedicineUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison"},{"Title":"Meaning, Medicine and the 'Placebo Effect' (Cambridge Studies in Medical Anthropology)","review":"Daniel Moerman places the words \\"Placebo effect\\" in quotations because he believes that the placebo effect should be redefined. A placebo, he explains is inert. It has no causal effect. A more appropriate definition of the placebo effect he asserts is the \\"meaning response.\\"It is because of our beliefs and the meaning we assocate with a placebo that determines its effectiveness. Despite this simple formula for determining who will respond to a placebo, it is not a very good predictor for a given individual at a given time. Studies show that there is no method to determine which individuals will respond to a placebo. Attempts have been made to remove placebo responders from studies. Occasionally, researchers will conduct a precursor trial run with a completely unrelated substance to indentify those who might respond to a placebo in an effort to cull these responders from the \\"real study\\". These attempts have been futile.No reliable indicators have ever been found that identify individual placebo responders. In fact, a person who responds to a placebo in one study has no increased likely hood of responding to a placebo in subsequent studies. More remarkably, if one eliminates the approximately one third of the populace who initially respond to a given placebo, the remaining group will contain about the same proportion of responders in subsequent studies.Moerman never makes the connection between these facts and the parallels to natual physical laws at the quantum level. And though they might be only coincidental, I think it worth the comparisons.Note that a placebo has no causal effect, but instead it is meaning that determines the \\"effect\\" of a placebo. The late physicist David Bohm asserted that the entire universe is organized at all levels according to meaning. If this is true, then it substantiates Moerman's claim that meaning is operating at the macro level. But the similarites to physical law don't end here.Moerman observed that when placebo responders are eliminated from a group, the same statistical relationships hold for the remainder of the group--approximately one third of the remaining group will still be responders in the next study.Simlarities can be drawn with quantum processes such as the jump of the electron in orbit around the nucleus of an atom or the well-known process of nuclear decay. If one knows the half-life of a mass, it is possible to calculate exacly what proportion of the substance will remain after a given amount of time, yet nothng can be said about the transmutaion of any given atom. Divide the mass into two portions, and the half-life of each portion remains the same. As Moerman has shown this is exacly what we witness in placebo studies. It is possible to calculate statistically how many in a group will respond, but nothing can be said about which specific individuals will respond. In both cases, whether dealing with the placebo responders or nuclear decay, the process is determinate for the whole, but indeterminate for the individual person or particle. I have previously described this as a law--\\"nature conserves meaning\\".Moerman documents many studies involving placebos from around the world. He notes that cultural differences, knowledge, and the practitioner all statistically contribute to the meaning response. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the character and personality of the physician has more to do with the outcome of placebo studies than the make up of the patient. Moerman contends that a positive and upbeat clinician or doctor transmits subltle cues to the patient making for a more positive outcome. He states that it is what the doctor \\"knows\\" that is important. If the doctor believes his patient has a possibility of getting a powerful drug, patients will do better than if he knows they will only be getting a placebo. The conclusion is sound, but the mechanism, I believe is dubious. I'm doubtful that some sort of \\"subtle\\" cues are passed onto the patient in such a consistent mannner. I wonder if it is reasonable once again to find the answer in physical law.In the famous \\"double-slit\\" or \\"two-hole\\" experiments, it has been demonstrated that an \\"observer\\" is not necessary to change the behavior of particles. In fact, it is the mere possibility that the path or route of the particle can be determined at some point in the future that determines the outcome of the experiment. In experiments done by Marlan Scully at the Universtity of California at Berkeley it was found that it is our knowledge that determines the behavior of particles\\"...It is our \\"potential\\" knowledge of the quantum system , not our actual knowledge that helps decide the outcome\\" (Davis, 1996).Of course these associations with quantum processes are merely conjecture.Daniel Moerman's book is well documented and it is obvious that much research went into this publication. If one wants a sound understanding of the placebo effect, or the \\"meaning response\\", this book is the one to read. Well done.This book review by David Kreiter, author of \\"Quantum Reality: a New Philosophical Perspective\\"."},{"Title":"Meaning, Medicine and the 'Placebo Effect' (Cambridge Studies in Medical Anthropology)","review":"A readable, evidence based account of the power of the placebo in all aspects of medical treatments.

Moreover Moerman brings his agile mind to work about the larger ways that meaning creates a physiological response. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Meaning, Medicine and the 'Placebo Effect' (Cambridge Studies in Medical Anthropology)","review":"A review of this book must include a discussion of who the writer's audience is.After reading, I would say that this book is a good read for the general public interested in the topic, or for physicians or others in the biomedical field. Students and scholars of anthopology might find the book less engaging.For the first group, the book is a great review of research on the \\"placebo effect\\" and other psychological and cultural factors of the effects of medical treatments, with added commentary on the importance of understanding humans as cultural beings, and how that factors into how they experience various forms of healing and medical treatment. In his concluding chapter, he makes some very important concluding assertions such as how the cultural variation among our species is more important than genetic/biological variation when considering medical treatment. This makes for a very convincing and important treatise to serve as an introduction for physicians, biologists, and the lay public to engage the idea of culture and meaning and the place they have in medicine.However, for the anthropologist, the book fails to engage in more than a superficial discussion of culture's place in medicine. Most instances are trite, and often relegated to citations of somewhat outdated, \\"freshman survey course\\" references to Levi-Strauss, Mary Douglass, Marvin Harris, etc. The literature on medical anthropology from the past few decades is voluminous, engaging, nuanced, and it is a shame that this body of research is not reflected in this book. In other words, those who have studied anthropology might find this book to give a boring and over-simplified discussion of culture and meaning within its pages.Other than that, the book has a few problems. Some editorial, such as a few citations missing from the references section, and a few bad interpretations of studies (such a the blue pill, red pill study).In closing: Great book for clinicians and general public interested in the subject, but maybe a little bit of a bore for anthopologists."},{"Title":"100 More Library Lifesavers: A Survival Guide for School Library Media Specialists","review":"Last Friday was the end of week-long, high-stakes testing at our school. Also, it was the last day of school before our week-long Spring Break. Oh yes, students were in high spirits! Did I want to present an encyclopedia lesson on such a day to sixth and seventh graders? Are you kidding? No, I did not. But---I have this newly acquired, fantastic book: \\"100 More Library Lifesavers: A Survival Guide for School Library Media Specialists.\\"I had already gone through the book, marking various items about library management and professional development to return to and act upon. This time, however, I turned to the chapter called \\"Go Fish! Library Games for All Grade Levels.\\" Try Weakest Link, a game about literary trivia questions with internet links to people and questions, rules for playing, how to write trivia questions. The wonderful part about each game is internet links. Also, each game has recommended age play. This one is 7-12.Another game is \\"Go Fish in Dewey\\" categories with an online link for other games. A library version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\" is another choice (grades 7-12). \\"Fish for a Great Book\\" pits teams against each other. Each team has five questions about books. Using provided clues, each team locates the book. Catching all five books wins the game. Oh, how do they know if they catch the right book? A colored fish is in the pocket. Do you have time to color those fish? No, you select a younger class to color them (form included in this book), but they color two--one for the game, one for a bookmark to keep.Aha! Here's the one I chose: \\"Library Win, Lose--and Draw!,\\" although I modified it for an end-of-testing, last-day- before-Spring-Break kind of day. I called it Dumb Middle School Tricks, based on Letterman's Stupid Pet Tricks (we don't use the word \\"stupid\\" in our school). I used the topics (modified) in the book, then added a dumb trick to perform. Example: Find the Star Wars books, hold one up, read the title, then make Chew Bacca's sound. If someone did not know where something was, I allowed one \\"phone call.\\" Let me tell you, after the first question, students went from mild interest to standing, wildly waving hands, wanting to have their turn. As a reward, I gave each student a bag of those fruit gummies sold in the cereal section. The kids were thrilled! I was thrilled! The game was a great success!I'm including details in this review for a reason. When I went through as many library manuals, self-help books on Amazon as I could find, so many had no reviews to help me make a selection. One great title I found with only one review (and it was one of those \\"Great book. You should buy it\\" type of reviews) made me think I should buy it. I did and was SO disappointed. It is not a great book.\\"100 More Library Lifesavers\\" does not disappoint. Have you come across those cutesy chapter titles that don't provide clues to content? This book has them, but these titles ARE clue providers. Example: \\"Standards, Smandards! Why bother?\\" You know exactly the type of information in this section. Author/Librarian Pamela S. Bacon gives a list of reasons why including standards in library lessons works. Here's one example of the five: \\"Ten Reasons Why the Internet Is No Substitute for a Library\\" with an online address to print these 10 reasons. Everything is so practical and helpful!Here are the chapter titles (note that Pamela S. Bacon is a high school media specialist and some of the content is geared toward high school use):Distance Learning (courses offered by your school and ones the librarian can take for professional development),All Aboard! Exceeding the Standards (emphasis on Information literacy skills),Dive Under Cover: Lessons to Improve Reading Motivation,Keep Afloat: Great Library Management Tips (an excellent chapter!!),Below the Surface: Library Skills from the Ground Up (mostly research skills),Float Through Personal and Professional Development (has really helpful information),What Others Are Doing--Library Media Center Best Practices (a great chapter that the librarian can dip into and take),Head Swimming? Get Organized! (collection management, clutter, weeding, managing grants, etc.),Sail into Technology--Technology Tools (for high school or other large libraries with digital cameras, scanners, and the like).\\"100 More Library Lifesavers\\" does not have everything nor can the librarian use everything found within the covers. I considered deducting one star for the high school emphasis, but \\"100 More\\" will give any librarian many, many useful ideas and resources. Overall, I give this book two big thumbs up.If only Amazon carried \\"100 Library Lifesavers,\\" the first volume."},{"Title":"100 More Library Lifesavers: A Survival Guide for School Library Media Specialists","review":"I thought this book would be very helpful, but it is not.

I had even bought some of the Spider Books for my daughter even though she is really too young for them yet, just because I loved them so. That is why I was particulary pleased to find Kirk's new Biddle series designed for pre schoolers. In this sweet book a baby bunny gets tired of being squished in the nest with his brothers and sisters so he ventures out to explore the world. Look for cameo appearances by Little Bird Biddle Bird and Miss Spider from Kirk's earlier books. After Bunny has his adventure he decides that home is the best place to be after all. The story really mirrors my own toddlers struggle to find the balance between independence while still needing to have mommy near by. The illustrations are adorable and I really don't mind reading it over and over which is a good thing since I am asked to read it several times a day. I also like the length of the book. It is just the perfect length to keep even an easily distracted toddler engaged. All of the books in the Biddle series are excellent. We also enjoy the new Little Miss Spider books which are also geared to the preschool set. David Kirk is an excellent children's author and you will not be dissapointed with this book."},{"Title":"Little Bunny, Biddle Bunny","review":"My 14-month old daughter absolutely loves this book.

This collection brings together twenty-five tales by authors spinning their own variations and extrapolations of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, which postulates the existence of an ancient, evil race of beings outside the generally known dimensions of time and space that lurks in the shadows, constantly waiting and watching for its chance to reconquer the earth and destroy humanity.It's a creepy thought, and the best tales in this collection are those that filter this paranoia in new and unexpected ways: &quot;The Horror on the Beach,&quot; by Alan Dean Foster, for example, transplants the monster to the sunny California coast. &quot;The Stone on the Island&quot; by Ramsey Campbell is a masterpiece of understatement, all the more terrifying for its low-key, economical prose. &quot;The Kiss of Bugg-Shash&quot; by Brian Lumley is more in the classic Lovecraftian vein of the disgusting, slimy, implacable enemy, but chilling for all of that. Less successful are entries that ape Lovecraft's over-the-top and frankly dated writing style, or that stick too closely to his original concepts and geographical settings. Nevertheless, as a whole this collection offers plenty of skin-crawling reading. Don't read it when you're alone, or during a power outage."},{"Title":"New Lovecraft Circle","review":"I've been trying lots of the new Lovecraft inspired anthologies over the last year, having been a Lovecraft fan for more than 25 years, and have just finished this most recent.Now unlike the majority of the Lovecraft fan world, I think R.M. Price is hugely over-rated. Yes he knows Lovecraft, and literature but he is pompous, self-absorbed and a turgid writer. As editor of by far the worst of the Lovecraft anthologies, The Tsatoggua Cycle, he made me know fear; fear of Lovecraft pastiche and his overblown literary criticism. But I loved his reading of The Dunwich Horror, and based on positive reviews of this book I tried it, and am deeply sorry I've wasted my time on it.While at least it stays away from the Clarke Ashton Smith type of fantastical imitations, I ploughed through exactly half the book before I came on something good in The Keeper of Dark Point, by John Glasby. By good, unfortunately I mean in comparison to the drivel before it. So many of the stories here finish with the dreaded &lt;last line of horror in italics> that you realize just how poor Price's editorial skills are. (Not to mention his writing in his own story). There are average stories, bad stories, awful stories, attempts to do something different that completely fail ( Richard Lupoff's Lights! Camera!

There was a time I no longer wanted to de identify'd as a Mythos writer, and (as Bob Price mentions in his introduction to this book) when I was editing TALES OF LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR my editorial policy was that my magazine would contain no Mythos stories of any kind -- I wanted tales of pure Lovecraftian horror. I was being a boorish snob, and it is thanks to the really cool books of Mythos fiction edited by Bob Price that I outgrew this tiresome prejudice. I now call myself \\"a professional Cthulhu Mythos writer\\" at every opportunity, and I define my books as collections of Mythos tales. THE NEW LOVECRAFT CIRCLE is one of the collections that helped me to find a new fondness for the Mythos genre.The original Lovecraft Circle were those friends and correspondents of Lovecraft's who fell under the spell of his fiction and wrote their own stories influenced by it. The finest representation of the Lovecraft Circle and HPL's influence on them is TALES OF THE CTHULHU MYTHOS, edited by August Derleth. There was, in Lovecraft's day, a sense of fun, almost of play, when it came to writing tales influenced by Lovecraft. Even Lovecraft seems far more playful than serious in his revision story, \\"The Horror in the Museum.\\" I am usually violently turned-off when writers approach the Mythos as little more than an amusement, a jest. One writer who can convey that sense of playful humor and yet write a dead cool Mythos story is Peter H. Cannon, and his tale herein is a wonderful celebration of Lovecraftian madness.I find it difficult to understand why someone would find this anthology \\"hugely disappointing,\\" there are so many delightful and very good stories in this book.

This is a great book of fiction, some of it remarkably original in its approach to the Lovecraftian tale, others totally Cthulhu Mythos to the max. It's a great read, and an inspiration to those of us who strive to write our own Mythos fiction."},{"Title":"New Lovecraft Circle","review":"price follows up his tales of the lovecraft mythos, going to the newer pulp writers. still excellent. great stories. especially good as an introduction to pulp: good plots, not too weird, great descriptions. great stories. the best of the best. loved glasby and rainey. loved a lot."},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"\\"Ralph Christopher's 'RIVER RATS' has captured the essence of his tour of duty in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. Don't miss the impressive artwork design of the PBR churning up a brown water wash of riverine squadron shoulder patches on the book's cover, and the free-hand drawn map of the Mekong Delta on page v with place names we who were there in the early 1970s know but cartographers for National Geographic would not necessarily know. Ralph recounts the progress of the war, the day to day experiences with many of the U.S. Navy sailors, by name, who were all a part of the Brown Water Navy forces fighting a formidable enemy. There are 47 new photographs and all of his recollections are true, the men you meet through Ralph were naval warriors fighting and dying in this hostile environment. Ralph Christopher's narrative moves from often humorous situations to riveting, gut-wrenching firefights where his dialog is that of another Tom Clancy. Every armchair badmiral who served in any war will want this book in his library,\\"Fair winds...safe harbors,Kirk FergusonRET USN Commander"},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"First I did participate in the creation of the book and am acknowledged in it. So I may not be unbiased. I was also there, where and when some of the events described in the book happened. Ralph states that the book is 70% true and 30% \\"sea stories.\\" Having been involved in fact checking the areas of the book where I had some knowledge, I can honestly say that Ralph has worked very hard to get the facts right. I feel that at least 90% of what is stated as fact in this book can be taken to the bank. The remaining 10% could well be true as well.Despite Ralph's offer of free copies, I have with my own money bought eight copies. Now when the kids ask, \\"Daddy. What did you do during the war? I can give them this book. Ralph got it right. What more can you ask?"},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"I was in the military during, but never went to Viet-Nam. I think I am grateful because I don't know how I would have handled it. From talking to others who did go I have learned what some actions were like. Ralph brought to me another aspect I never knew. The river war was fought by heroes. Ralph is one of those heroes. I hold him and his book in very high regard."},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"I was so pleased to see a book that covered a significant portion of my tour with Stabron 20 on the Grand Canal in South Viet Nam. The book provides enlightenment and explains some of the events during the 1969 - 1970 period in the Mekong Delta. Its a bittersweet remembrance, made so by the sacrifice of young lives for political expedience. It was a dangerous mission for a while. Sitting against the bank at night in a 4 person gunboat waiting for the NVA to come out of Cambodia while boats down river were being ambushed was a challenge.The book overlooks some of the sadder elements, those who were unfit to serve and some of the craziness that broke out that was hard to take at times. Like the boat captain that turned up river one night on a pleasure cruise between floating bases and went into Cambodia where he was captured. The CIA worked their magic and retrieved him from the Cambodians. Later he was court martialed. I would like to know who that Cambodian officer was that we extracted from Neak Lung shortly thereafter. He couldn't speak a word of English but he was one happy camper as we headed off down the river.I personally believe the North Vietnamese knew that an invasion of their Cambodian sanctuaries was being planned and that is why we saw so much action along the Grand Canal in the Spring of 1970 as they moved their assets out of Cambodia into the Delta. MACV in Saigon was infiltrated at the highest levels.The book really fills in some blanks and helps bring back some memories and events that have been lost to me over 40 years. I knew some of the locals were vehemently anti communist but did not know why. Also, never knew who those rafts of bodies (by the hundreds) were floating down the Mekong from Cambodia. The book explains these events. Overall its well worth reading for those of us who served.Many of us had an adjustment period upon our return to civilian life. To this day I can't figure it out entirely. Thanks so much for taking the time to write this book."},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"Reading \\"River Rats\\" by Ralph Christopher was an educational experience for me. I am also a Combat Vietnam Army Veteran and author of a book relating my experiences as an Infantry Grunt with the 25th Division. My personal knowledge of the Brown Water Navy is limited, at best, and I am unfamiliar with their equipment, tactics, and mode of operations. Thankfully, Ralph's explanations, pictures and story helped me to better understand how the war was fought in the Delta.I was pleased upon recognizing many of the landmarks Ralph mentions in \\"River Rats\\" as they are the same areas my unit operated in. Although Ralph was already home by the time I had arrived in country, those shared areas were still very dangerous and very active with enemy soldiers and incoming supplies during my tour.I've heard about the bases built upon pontoons in the middle of the river, but had no idea of its size, on-board facilities, and capabilities to support these fighting men. \\"River Rats\\" is mostly told in a first-person, but portions of it come across as an \\"after action report\\". Not saying this is bad, but sometimes there appears to be too much detailed information (Navy speak) - more than a lay person can absorb while reading. I was especially intrigued with the smaller boats and four-men crews that went out on night ambushes - pulling up to the riverbank and beaching their craft - then watching for enemy movement. The reaction of boat crews during an enemy ambush from land is also something to behold...making strafing runs up and down the river and eventually beaching the craft immediately to the front of the enemy - I think there's a saying about hanging brass ornaments and these boat crews. There is just so much to learn from \\"River Rats\\" that I must recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the Brown Water Navy and the heroes of the Vietnam Delta.There is only one negative that prevented me from rating this book five stars and that is misspelled words. Most all of them would pass a spelling scan, but they are used incorrectly. As examples: passed used instead of past and set instead of sat are just a couple of examples that come to mind. Otherwise, when looking past them, it was a great read! Thank you Ralph!John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel"},{"Title":"River Rats","review":"A very true account of what flying helicopters was pre, post and during the Vietnam War. It gives the reader a better understanding of how a daily routine can go and how brave these pilots and crew-members were to assist colleagues or fellow soldiers who are calling for help.Not only was has Al an officer, but a very fine example of how an officer should conduct himself and see to the needs to the men he commands. He is their caretaker and shepherd and this officer was true to these aspects. I admire him and we can only hope that in the future there can be more like this fine example and men will have the privilege to serve under such great leaders and follow them into battle. I salute him and thank him for setting such a good example for future leaders of soldiers.This book is a very needed read."},{"Title":"La Bodega Sold Dreams","review":"Being a Nuyorican poet myself I can tell you that no one has come close to the imagery of the streets and the struggles like Miguel Pinero. He takes me back, to times I once thought were best forgotten, but after listening to Miguel, I realize those times should never be forgotten. They made me who I am today. No one should ever forget what growing up in El Bario was like. It made us a special people, and Miguel was one of its most special. Read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"La Bodega Sold Dreams","review":"Poetry scrapes against the streets...without stopping to stop and wipe the blood away from its knees. For some real boriqua sabor and struggle, pick this up while having dirty hands."},{"Title":"La Bodega Sold Dreams","review":"Has some classic Pinero poetry, that I like more than most 20th century poets, frankly. This lacks the grandeur of Pinero's theatre work with Joe Papp. It is quieter and sometimes more direct & to the point."},{"Title":"La Bodega Sold Dreams","review":"I am so glad I bought this book! Once I opened it up, I just could not put it down. I have never really read poetry and had never read Miguel Pinero before, but after reading \\" La Bodega Sold Dreams\\" I MUST purchase all of his work..."},{"Title":"La Bodega Sold Dreams","review":"As a poet myself, this is one of my many styles that I use when writing. I can say from my heart and soul that My father and Miguel were friends. The first time I read this book, I remember taking it from my fathers room and falling in love with it. I new from that moment on, that is what I wanted to be, a poet and someone who can speak for the inner city with words that can touch so many. He may not have been the best person in the world, but who is? This book is one of the best poetry books in the world. He spoke from his heart and more important, his eyes... This is a must read, my copy which he gave to my father to give to me, has become my bible in so many ways..."},{"Title":"Riverworld Other Stry (Riverworld Saga)","review":"It's been years since I've read this, but the title story still sticks in my mind. I can't tell you too much about it, since that would give away the powerful ending. The balance of the stories are also good, especially the hysterical &quot;Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod&quot; (what if William Burroughs instead of Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote Tarzan?). Definitely worth hunting for this collection."},{"Title":"Wild is My Love","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago. And even though I have not read it since I still remember it. I do not have it with me(at my parent's house) to tell you much about it but I do remember that I liked it enough not to throw it away when I was done with it. And that is saying a lot. This is the book that made me want to read the rest of Janelle Taylor. It is a book that will stick with you."},{"Title":"Wild is My Love","review":"The short narrative pretty much sums up what this delightful book is about.Princess Alysa is trying to maintain harmony and peace within her kingdom and it is an uphill battle. Along the way, Princess Alysa and a prince from a different kingdom meet and fall hopelessly in love. Together they fight the evil forces that are trying to take absolute control of her domain. The detailed storyline includes kings, princesses, princes, servants, bandits and witches. The scenarios include intrigue, greed, death and the struggles of good, love and power. The enjoyable plot sometimes seems to drag, but it did keep my interest. Do not let this prevent you from reading it! Ms. Taylor has an astute imagination and her stories are sharp and clever and Wild Is My Love is no exception."},{"Title":"Wild is My Love","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I was just recently introduced to the book, but I can tell you that after reading &quot;Wild is my Love,&quot; that I will definitely be reading more books by this author.I'm ususally not big on historical romance, but Ms. Taylor tells an interisting story of what it must have been like to live in those troubled times, when aristocracy and sorcery ruled. Her love scenes are some of the most well written that I have ever read, and the emotions of the characters are raw and real. Was sorry to see this one end!"},{"Title":"What Did It Mean?","review":"Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire series includes some of my favorite and most often reread books, but this is not one of them. Many of the characters are ones who appeared in &quot;Northbridge Rectory,&quot; and the situations in this book are often rehashes of situations from that book set several years later in time (&quot;Northbridge Rectory&quot; takes place during World War II, and this book takes place in 1953, when preparations are being made for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation). The committee scenes are copies of the working party scenes from the earlier book, and none of the characters seems to have changed in the least in 10 years. &quot;Northbridge Rectory&quot; is much more enjoyable. In my opinion, Angela Thirkell was at her best in the books written in the 1930s through about 1946. The later books just don't come up to that standard."},{"Title":"Modern religious liberalism","review":"I may actually agree with Horsch that religious liberalism is an issue if it fundamentally weakens a strong connection to core tenets of Christianity. It can result in wishy-washy adherents prone to unorthodox ideas if there isn't a grounding in essentials of faith.However, I cannot recommend this book. It confuses religious liberalism with ANY kind of progressive ideas, new customs or changing beliefs, and, most frighteningly, the very nature of science is attacked as if it a false faith. Changing cultural norms, which have changed constantly since the founding of Christianity, are confused with with weakness or strength of faith. Therefore it is a scandal if men and women associate in a closer or different manner than they used to; a scandal if a person of faith embraces the scientific method --these are signs of LIBERALISM, which is not to be tolerated in any form.I find a common thread throughout earlier Mennonite writers trying to prove a point: they openly distrust science as a rival of faith, mistakenly ascribe atheism and human-worship to the study of naturalism and evolutionary activity, deny abundant evidence in favor of cherry-picked nuggets which help their argument, and use any number of fallacies to make irrational leaps of logic."},{"Title":"Modern religious liberalism","review":"This book is actually pretty good. It is a little dry, and is primarily composed of quotes from various modern scholars.However, this book is really good if you are interested in this subject. It documents the apostasy and doctrinal &quot;murkiness&quot; that has come about in Christianity today."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Finally a novel about Savannah that is realistic!! Berendt's &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; stereotypes the city. Harris is actually FROM Savannah, and the book is not fake. I happen to attend Benedictine Military School, where part of this novel takes place, and I must say that Harris' description of the school is very real, the charactaristics are still the same today as they were in the 60's when the book takes place. Finally, Savannah has a novel that is not fake -homosexuality or the &quot;backwardness&quot; of the south are simple labels placed by various stereotypical authors who aren't even from the area."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"This novel surprised me. It started out as a straight-ahead mystery, then opened up into a richer story of families and friends who find their loyalties challenged by the changes in the outside world, and by their own human imperfections. The author has a dead-on eye for subtle details, and his love affair with Savannah is obvious. But the most interesting elements of the story emanate from how Savannah, which we were taught in John Berendt's fine story was isolated from the events of the outside world, in fact was a perfect laboratory for observing the effects of World War II, the GI Bill, civil rights, etc. The mystery is there, and it propels the book forward. But this book is really for readers who want to explore America (especially the America of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s) through the semi-fictional events of one its most charming cities."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Delirium of the Brave is one of the finest novels I have read. It has all the right ingredients of a perfect novel. It's literary; the characters are engaging and there is suspense, romance and multiple layers of conflict.I've never cared much about the Civil War or the South. When I started reading Delirium, that part of our history came alive.It's truly amazing that a Georgia podiatrist can create such beautiful fiction. I'll bet all the MFA's from Creative Writing mills are eating their hearts out.I eagerly await the next novel by Dr. Harris and if I ever get a hangnail, I'm heading for Savannah."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I have read this book twice and enjoyed it both times. I like a story with historical background. The plot was interesting enough to keep me entertained and involved with the characters."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"For those of you who enjoy historical fiction, especially about the South, primarily Savannah you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Reading this book was a wonderful experience. On the historical side the picture painted of Savannah was beautiful and enticing, full of the rich Southern and Irish-Catholic heritage that Savannah is so proud of. The families portrayed were full and in-depth studies of the individuals and their family heritage, good and bad. The novel begins with a unique bond between two good men, one a white Confederate soldier, the other a slave. The bond is friendship and trust. The novel traces family history in an intriguing plot involving serial murder, betrayal, greed and also love, brotherhood, trust and true faith. The families' lives intertwine again and again through history. This novel was far different that what I had expected it to be about, but I can say I was not at all disappointed. I was very moved by the strong key role that the characters faith in God and their relationship to the Catholic faith played and how it was their strength and life saver in their many struggles with betrayal, disappointment, drugs, war and death. From the Civil War to Vietnam and beyond this was a wonderfully crafted novel. This is not the typical \\"Irish Sad Story\\", where when it's over you heave a big sad sigh. This is a wonderful tale of a family, true love and a rich faith in a beautiful Southern setting."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"What can I say. I am not the typical reader of such fiction. I usually tend to lean toward teh science fiction genre of writing, but Delerium of the Brave struck me as good, even excellent. With an extremely well written plot and story, it provided many nights of wondering...&quot;What will happen next.&quot; That is the key in my book for a good novel. Bill Harris is a fine man, whom I have come to respect in the past as a doctor, as a family member, as a friend, and now as an excellent writer. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered about the awesome majesty of the south.SincerelyJesse Brown"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I usually don't like this type of book, but Delirium of the Brave was terrific. I couldn't put it down. Realistic portrayal of the suffering, joys, sorrows and triumphs of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"A great book!! It shows the city of Savannah at her best! The book will bring back memories for many people!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"An engrossing and moving story of family loyalties, ambitions, murders and political and social intrigues that begins in the Civil War and moves quickly from one fascinating event to another through five generations to reach a surprising conclusion in the 1990's. Fast moving and exciting. A really great read that has everything, including high school crushes, durable families, wars, heartaches and ecstasy."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I'm so glad that I chose to read this book before reading any of the book reviews that discussed its literary prose value. I fully admit to have lived in Savannah for the past ten years and probably read it for curiosity value moreso than desire to read another historical fiction. However, I had great difficulty putting this book down to work or sleep. I found the characters and plot most riveting. I found myself asking friends and co-workers that are native to Savannah about the events and descriptions of the town in earlier days, only to determine the extreme accuracy of depictions. I, too, will be awaiting the sequel eagerly."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Fabulous first novel, filled with charm, intrigue, surprise. Painted with an artist's touch. I love Savannah and I loved this book.Bravo Dr. Harris. Please give us more."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I know the author and was wondering why he thought he could write a novel. Then I read the book and was truly surprised, and wonderfully so. I thought he'd read a little too much Michener...he told me he never had. There's lots of Catholic guilt in here."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"My wife gave me this book for Christmas because we had visited, and loved, Savannah a couple of years ago. It was a wonderful read and I saw again many of the places that I enjoyed so much on our visit. This story was excellent and I enjoyed the way it moved from generation to generation and kept things so well tied together. You can feel the emotions and turmoil of the various characters. I am looking forward to Mr. Harris' next novel."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Loved Mr. Harris' novel; search for power, romance, human decency and foibles. The book has them all. Especially liked the way the generations were &quot;connected&quot; from the Civil War through Vietnam; from high school through adulthood. One part of the book brought me to tears; will let it to other readers to see if it happens to them."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I picked up DELIRIUM OF THE BRAVE because I thought it was historical fiction. As it happens, the \\"historical\\" portion of the book ends with the first chapter. Then it becomes a generational saga reaching from the 1930s up through the 1990s. I quite enjoyed reading it, but I feel sorry for the agent who had to categorize this debut novel in their pitch to publishers, and the shortcomings to this book make it difficult for me to recommend it without several caveats.It starts with a Civil War vignette, but it's not historical fiction. It has a brief mystery in it, but the mystery is solved almost immediately. There is a Vietnam character study, but it is so hastily and superficially written that it can't be measured as a major part of the work. There is a huge amount of a religiosity, focusing on Catholic guilt and redemption, but that becomes an annoying subplot rather than a narrative lynchpin. I came to look at DELIRIUM OF THE BRAVE more as a series of set pieces featuring the same characters than I did a truly linear novel. Some characters show up long enough to get you interested in them, and then Mr. Harris makes them disappear for 200 pages.My writer friends tell me that it is imperative that you say dialogue out loud in order to determine if it feels and sounds \\"real.\\" It is painfully clear that Mr. Harris either never heard or did not follow this advice. The dialogue is absolutely awful; nobody would actually speak in this stilted, herky-jerky fashion. He is much more successful with his characters' internal, emotional journeys. While some aspects of the story are rushed through in an obvious attempt to get to the next \\"big plot point,\\" others are explored in an interesting way, and it is this that kept me turning the pages.There were no surprises here for me - it was fairly easy for me to predict the sequence of events and how the book would end, but DELIRIUM OF THE BRAVE was still mostly pleasant to read for this frequent visitor to Savannah. I'm told that if you grew up in this gorgeous City and are familiar with its denizens, you can guess at the identities from whom Harris borrows for the accuracy of the story. I can make no such claim, but I know I'd be curious to hear what really happened.Even though this debut had its problems, I'm still looking forward to reading Mr. Harris' follow-up, NO ENEMY BUT TIME. The stories he finds to share are excellent; it will be interesting to see if his writing style improves as he gains experience."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I was born and raised in Savannah, attended Catholic school and graduated from Benedictine. Being a Marine hasn't allowed to get back to town much in the past 10 years so when I heard about this book I thought I'd check it out. I read it a few months ago when in Iraq and boy was I blown away. It was like I was reading somebody's collection of dirty secrets. It's hard to tell where the factual background information ends and the historical \\"fiction\\" begins. Being part Irish and having grown up and gone to school with many Irish Catholics I think this book is more akin to the Dragnet tradition of changing the names to protect the innocent -- or guilty in this case. I've gotta sneaking suspicion there's a few from the \\"Old Fort\\" that don't really care for this book. Who knows. It's just fiction right?As a read it was a decent story. I think more in-depth character development would have propelled this work from a decent 400-page book to one of those 800-page masterpieces people would be talking about years from now. Of course, that might have gotten dangerous for the author because I feel like I know who half the characters are in real life already.Good stuff Dr. Harris, keep it up."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"This novel tells a great story set in Savannah. I lived there for a short while, and this book brought back some fond memories. The descriptions of the different seasons and various settings at the beach and Isle of Hope and other places were exquisite! The descriptions of the feelings of the characters were so clear that I could imagine just what was happening to each of them. Please, Mr. Harris, write another novel soon!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"A better description of Savannah. A discription of a different strata of people. More action! Made me feel better after I finsihed it. Sexy, but not obscene."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Being from Savannah I found this book fairly entertaining. I am not sure, though, how much I would have liked it if I didn't live here. Great art the book isn't. Characters in the book lack complexity. They seem almost cartoonish in how they are either completely good or completely bad. However, it does read very smoothly and tells a decent story. It is predictable in that the good guys win in the end, but I guess that happens in most stories. On another note, the book goes to great lengths to extol the virtues of a certain high school. Being that the school I went to stood in direct opposition to it, I can't say that I agree with the author's portrayal."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"A great read ! An engrossing and fast moving story of family loyalties, ambitions, murders, and political and social intrigues set in and around Savannah (by a native Savannahian) with such a fascinating, moving and authentic presentation of the behavior, attitudes and reactions of its diverse people that the book is extremely difficult to put down until it is finished."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I find it difficult to believe that writing this poor could find a publisher."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I just finished the pocket book. What a great first novel by this author. It pushed the entire spectrum of my emotions. Great characters to love, hate and relate to. I pray this writer keeps on writing. Harris's plots are more intriguing then John Grisham's"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Great book! Thanks for the vivid pictures and history of Savannah. Our book club enjoyed your book and cannot wait for the next one. Entertaining and Inspirational!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I hope Mr. Harris does a repeat performance. His characters are great and their inter relationships a so plausible! A great summer read!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I really stumbled over this book but am thrilled that I did. Things in my household came to a complete standstill until &quot;Delirium&quot; was read from cover to cover. The story and characters are so real that you end up believing that you really know them. The plot is gripping and contains everything one could want from a good book - romance, history, intrigue, mystery, terror. And the ending - WOW!!!!!. I can't wait for Dr. Harris' next book and hope that it won't be long. He is a wonderful storyteller and makes the reader feel as if he were a part of the story. Surely, someone will see the potential for an outstanding movie in this story. Highly recommend this book. Readers of this book may also enjoy &quot;Root of All Evil&quot; by David A. Farrow"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"It is with interest that I picked up this book based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon. I like novels of American history, and I am especially fond of generational sagas. However, I must confess that I was very disappointed, because even though the story holds a great deal of promise in terms of its plot and location, it is very badly written.My chief gripe is the very poor character development. The reader gets to know very little of any of the characters because the author has attempted to cram so much into their lives. For example, one of our heroes loves a girl, loses girl, takes up with another, goes to war, suffers dreadful injuries, studies to become a priest, takes a break from this, miraculously recovers from injuries and finds girl again. Any of these elements of his life is worthy of closer scrutiny, but they are all glossed over in the unseemly haste to make this a sprawling epic.Even the bad guys get a rush job. None of the elements of a truly evil character are really brought to the fore, and they are by far the most interesting people in this busy novel.And to add insult to injury the ending was so predictable that I could have screamed. After all I had only perservered with it to find out how it ended. I could have given it 1 star for the writing, but I decided to give it 2 stars in order to acknowledge that it could have been a really magnificent novel."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Finally, a book about Savannah by a native son! It took a native Savannahian to write the quintessential novel about the world's most romantic city. This page turner captures the magic of Savannah in a way that Midnight in the Garden missed--there's a mystique about the city that a visitor simply can't perceive. This book makes you part of the life of the city, with a depth of character development that's second-to-none. A true labor of love and a fitting tribute to the author's hometown."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"The romance of Savannah comes alive in this beautiful story--clearly a labor of love for the author and a tribute to the fascinating people of this grand old city. The richness of detail and the remarkable depth of the characters combine to transport the reader to the real Savannah in a way that even Midnight in the Garden couldn't do. It took a native Savannahian to write the quintessential novel of this great city!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Every southern cliche is here, from happy slaves to decadent aristocrats, all rendered in a style so wooden and lifeless it's amazing that anyone can get through the book, much less love it. This may be the worst writing I've ever read. A completely fraudulent book from the publisher that brought us another great book for our time: MONICA'S STORY."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"For anyone who reads the dramatic, compelling books on Oprah's lists, please read this one. It completely takes you in to Savannah during the Civil War, then the 1950's, 1960's, Vietnam War, etc. Though it's somewhat historical, you get to MEET the regular people and see how they lived according to the times they were in. There's so many stories and life situations that keep you intrigued. Looking foward to his second book."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"One has to become more than casually involved with Savannah to appreciate the multi-dimensional portrait the author draws of this historic southern city. One can only speculate how much of the separate directions traveled by this novel are, indeed, based on fact, although probably no good purpose is served by attempts to guess which of Savannah's first families might be involved. Savannah hides its secrets well, but lurking in the shadows there is a deep, dark side about which it is fascinating to speculate. &quot;Delerium&quot; does an admirable job in the glimpses it evokes of people and things past, and critically integrates them in a complex, logically coherent plot which in no small way helps helps one appreciate and understand the present. What starts out as a mystery, pure and simple, turns into a compelling portrait of human emotions and depravity. The broad brush of his generational approach, not always kindly or non-critically applied, helps document the development of present-day social institutions, described autobiographically by one who has &quot;been there, done that.&quot; For anyone with an interest in the &quot;real&quot; Savannah or just wanting a riveting, page-turning read, &quot;Delerium&quot; delivers!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have read in long while. With its abundance of intrigue, passion, and murder, it's quite a page-turner; yet it sweeps you into a place so rich and full of flavor that you truly feel that you are there, smelling the magnolias and feeling the textures of the atmosphere that must be exclusively Savannah's. I was particularly enthralled and delighted by the multi-generational aspects of the story, and how the characters were connected throughout the years through a variety of actions, some good, some evil. I am impressed with Dr. Harris' ability to weave so much history into a novel that is easily read in just one day. His writing has a simplicity and an honesty that I found very refreshing. I can't wait to visit Savannah and experience it for myself!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I am anticipating a move to Savannah this summer. Friends from &quot;outside&quot; Savannah gave me &quot;The Garden of Good and Evil&quot; to read (Called &quot;that book&quot; in distain by Savannians) My new friends IN Savannah recommended I read Delirium of the Brave, and I'm so very glad they did.It captures the true spirit of the South a darn sight better than any carpet-baggin' New Yorker could ever hope to.Bravo to Dr Harris."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Perhaps the delirium here is that Harris, a podiatrist, thought he could write a novel, and that an editor at a prestigious publishing house like St. Martin's Press would publish it, after first being released by a small, private firm. It's not that it isn't a good story, but one of the first things they tell you even in the most elementary writing classes is to let the story tell itself. Here the narrator is so obtrusive with his editorial comments that it becomes a joke after awhile. Still, if you read reviews of this book, there are Sevannah natives who rave over it and others, like me, who wonder how it ever got in print. Perhaps if Savannah hadn't been one of my favorite cities I wouldn't have finished it at all, but after starting it I was determined to finish."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Unable to put the book down I flew through the book in 24 hours. As a native Savannahian the book brought back many experiences of my youth.Dr. Harris is a wonderful story teller who describes the heart of low country living.

I hope he has more stories to tell soon!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"In March of 2000 my husband and I visited his cousin in Savannah. At our cousin's urging, we arose early on St. Patrick's day and made our way downtown to witness the BEST St. Patrick's Day Parade we have EVER seen! My, oh my, what an experience it was...and I had been to New York City's St. Patty's Day Parade....In May while visiting our local library back home, my husband picked up a copy of this book. Well, we were so enthralled by this book and the history surrounding not only Savannah, but the huge St. Patrick's Day parade, that we started recommending it to our friends. It was hard to put the book down and we have asked our cousin about many of the places and things that we read about. We are hoping HE will read it also. But, you don't have to love Savannah to enjoy this book....but WE DO!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"Mr. Harris has done an excellent job of bringing to life the sights, sounds, smells, and people that truly make Georgia's gem by the sea so irresistible.

This first novel truly has something for everyone. I can't wait for the next."},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"I absolutely loved this book, especially the way history was interwoven throughout the whole story.

We corresponded (I was vacationing in Florida while my homestate of NJ was going through those terrible snowfalls) and you finally sent (through USPS mail) write-ups about you and your book - Delirium... Here's a long belated thank you so much for sending the newspaper write-ups to me. I loaned out my copy of Delirium and it was never returned, but I finally found another copy today, which I will NEVER lend out. I look foward to reading it again, and I wonder when you expect to come out with the sequel, as you indicated in your e-mails. I just hope you get this, as I misplaced your usps address and I feel bad that I never responded to you. P.S. Please read this book everyone! Excellent!"},{"Title":"Delirium of the Brave","review":"There is rich material in this chronicle of life in Savannah. However, this novel is crippled by its cliches. Worse still, the writing is tasteless and adolescent, and because of this scenes that strive for drama are sadly laughable. I believe I said in my earlier review that this is some of the worst prose I'd ever seen between hard covers. Any reasonably intelligent high school student should have developed a better prose style. That this book could have found an audience at all is a sad comment on American culture."},{"Title":"Feeling Thankful","review":"This book simply touched me as I looked at the beautiful photographs of children expressing thanksgiving for the things and people in their lives. Young children will be able to express their own feelings of gratitude as they look at the photos. Older children could even make a book of a similiar format themselves with their own personal photos or drawings. This is not a preachy book, but simply shows children things they can be thankful for. It is not necessarily a &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; holiday book...but is a super book for that time of the year."},{"Title":"Moving To The Country","review":"Having just checked this book from the library... Perhaps no more a gamble than buying country property, which is lessened by this informative, practical, ecology-friendly, non-preachy, how-to book about the process of moving to the country. I imagine there are places in Hopland, CA that try to sell you this information for quite a bit more. Skillman is straight forward as he describes everything about the process from what to expect from country economies, societies, real estate brokers, financing, etc. He provides extremely helpful advice on how and if to build septic tanks, angle of sun and slope, how to build overhangs and face your home to maximize sun in winter and minimize in summer, getting electricy and water, etc. He gives well-founded cautions on pitfalls of moving to the country. I felt like I was in dialogue with a caring uncle who was expert via experience on the subject. I could almost see Skillman measuring the water pressure or driving up gravelled roads to see where easements lay. One small satisfying book, Skillman covers everything I had to read several books to find out."},{"Title":"An Ia Story: One Thread in the Tapestry of Consciousness","review":"This book has profoundly inspired my life. Through the author's candid sharing of her life's experiences and more importantly, through exploring her motivations and the \\"why\\" behind each step in her life, she is able to leave a roadmap of her trail through consciousness. This map shows where absolute honesty and heart centered awareness can lead us towards expressing our own aspects of divinity."},{"Title":"Ghosts and Hauntings","review":"The author has witnessed a few ghosts of his own and his experiences are included in &quot;Ghosts and Hauntings&quot;, along with hundreds of other eye-witness accounts that he solicited through newspaper and radio ads (primarily in Great Britain). This book was originally published in 1965, and several of the stories are of pre-war and World War II vintage. Bardens also includes several often-published stories such as the ghostly bear in the Tower of London, Lord Soulis and his pact with the Devil, and the haunting of Borley Rectory. He tries to stick to accounts that had two or more witnesses who were willing to corroborate each other. For some of his chosen hauntings, there were a hundred or more witnesses, and for others, the story was too good to omit even if only one person had seen or heard the ghost.Haunted ships are well represented in &quot;Ghosts and Hauntings&quot;, although Bardens' 'Flying Dutchman' doesn't resemble the 'Flying Dutchman' I'd heard about from other sources (What plague? What pirates?). If you were frightened by that horrid little ghost story, &quot;The Upper Berth&quot;, then this book's seafaring ghosts will really raise the hair on the back of your neck. I swear I'll never go on another cruise!One minor problem I had with &quot;Ghosts and Hauntings&quot; was that the author kept interjecting his theories on the origins of supernatural phenomena into the stories. I think his writing would have been even more eerie and interesting if he had simply reported the hauntings, and kept his theories of cerebral electricity for another publication.Definitely read Barden's book if you enjoy excursions into the realm of true hauntings. Just go quickly over the parts about electricity in the brain."},{"Title":"Hedgehogs in the Closet","review":"Hedgehogs in the Closet was written as the third book in the Howard boys' series of 4 books. (The first book is When The Boys Ran The House.) This book is Nick's book--his story of the year the Howard family lived in England and he had to wear purple (ugh!) sweaters to school, do Poetry Class twice a week, and Drama Class ditto. But Nick also discovered Rugby--and he was good at that rough, tough sport. He found hilarious differences between the English that the English people speak and the language we Americans use. He even learned to eat &quot;Toad in the Hole.&quot; And of course, he and his brothers kept real, live hedgehogs hidden in their closets. Well, they did until a problem arose.... For me as the author, and for me as a presenter of this book in schools, it has been a happy experience. I hope you'll try it! Cheers!

Detwiler (detwiler@midwest.net), Carbondale, Illinois"},{"Title":"The Fabricated Luther: The Rise and Fall of the Shirer Myth (Concordia Scholarship Today)","review":"A popular myth is that the church assisted Hitler. This book shows how Luther's understanding of the two kingdoms (government and church) assisted individual Christians to resist Hitler. The author was born in Leipzig, was trained as a journalist and is also a seminary graduate. His discussion of how Christians struggled against the Communists in the former East Germany relates some very interesting stories. In view of the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC devoting a room to Martin Luther as cause for the holocaust, this is a book that needs to be read widely to set the story straight."},{"Title":"Essential American Idioms (NTC English-language references)","review":"What's to say.

This is the 7th time I have ordered this book. I give it to as a gift to our foreign exchange students that live with us to learn English."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"It was a very long time ago when I first started reading this series with &quot;The Warlock in Spite of Himself&quot;, &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;, and &quot;King Kobold&quot;, and if you haven't some if not most of the early stories in the series you definitely don't want to start with this one. If you have been fortunate to have already discovered the Gallowglass family, you really do not want to miss this book.I can't say that the plot itself is really great or gripping - I mean that from the standpoint of the villains that the Gallowglass family are faced with in the story. SPITE and VETO - the agents from the future are back as the antagonists, and they've got back the lead agents from the earliest books - the Mocker and Durer. However the big &quot;fights&quot; seem to be a side note to the story. What really drives this book is the story of Rod, Gwen and his children. This book is basically about saying farewell to a really beloved friend as we lose some of the main characters who have been in the story from the beginning.As other reviewers have noted there have been a ton of books in this series, but all good things must end. Rod and Gwen have four capable and now grown up children and it was time to pass the mantle.It's kind of a bittersweet story, and long time fans will be saddened as you read this book, but at the same time you'll feel a sense of completion.I kind of fell away from the series about 4 or 5 novels into the Magnus (Gar Pike) off-shoot series as they felt very repetitive, but this one was definitely worth coming back for."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"I started reading the Warlock series about 15 years ago, got distracted with other things for many years, and rediscovered the series -- along with the Rogue Wizard series and the Warlock's Heirs books -- two years ago. I've enjoyed every one, though some are better than others, and I was counting down the days till this final book came out.It is worth the wait. It must have been a difficult task to tie up all the loose ends of Gwen and Rod, the three younger sibs and their spouses, Magnus and Alea, and Gramarye itself, but Stasheff pulls it off. (I admit I was less interetested in the VETO/SPITE political intrigue than in the family dynamics and the final stages of Magnus and Alea's courtship, but by now we all know the Gallowglasses can handle their foes without breaking a sweat.) But Stasheff's dialogue, description, and pacing is better and fresher than it has been in the last few books; it feels like he took great care to get this one right, and I think he did it. (My only quibble -- when did Alea become blonde? She was always described as having chestnut hair!)I hope that those who've followed the series find this ending as satisfying as I did. Thanks for all 20+ books, Mr. Stasheff! If you decide to come back to the Gallowglasses and Gramarye at any point in their timeline, we readers will be waiting!"},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"After reading the other reviews I bought the book and put it on the shelf without reading it because I expected the book to be sad and depressing.When I finally read the book I found that it was refreshing and reminded me of his first books such as The Warlock in Spite of Himself rather than his later books which were more and more predicable. I don't want to spoil the story so all I will say is that while there are parts that made me sad the way they were written also made me very happy at the same time. I found the book very enjoyable - the plot was not predicable - there was a lot of variety, and the book had a pleasant and satisfying ending. If you have read the series then you will want to read this book."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"Since I graduated from reading Nancy Drew mysteries in grade four I've been reading the Warlock books. I started with the first book and never looked back. Rod, Gwen, their children, as well as Fess have been freinds and now I can't expect to hear (well, read) of their new adventures.So its a fond and sad farewell for me.Mr. Stasheff brings together all the threads of his many tales over the years with skill. After so long you'd expect there to be more inconsistencies in this last book from the first. Unlike many other authors, he managed to avoid the mistakes that readers always catch. Especially after such a long lived series.A wonderful final adventure as Rod and Fess go off in to the sunset and find Gwen again."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"Other reviewers have commented favorably on the book, and I must agree. If for nothing else other than nostalgia, anyone who has read Mr. Stasheff's previous novels would have to read this one.&quot;The Warlock's Last Ride&quot; is a bittersweet one, as we see beloved characters die and others operate through their grief. Writing is, as someone else pointed out, fresh, and seeing a number of plot strings introduced at various parts of the series brings a strong sense of closure. Moreover, since this is a Stasheff novel, the closure is logically presented, and consistent within the science of the series.Kudos to Mr. Stasheff, and should you read this review, I would like to say that from book 1 to this one, it has been a very long, but very companionable, ride."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"A beautifully written book, and a solid conclusion to the series. Shasheff ties everything up with a return of some familiar villans and a reunion of the Gallowglasses. The high emotional moments are, as usual, very well written and very moving. A must-read for Warlock and wizard fans."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"The Warlock's Last Ride was a fitting finale to the series. I am very disappointed that there will be no more...Christopher Stasheff was as fabulous with his last book in the series as every other book."},{"Title":"The Warlock's Last Ride","review":"Not totally unpredictable but still superbly written and leaving you with still unanswered questions. Stasheff has appropriately closed Ron's story, at least for now."},{"Title":"Puranic Encyclopaedia","review":"Indian Puranic literature is a like a vast ocean, with a web of references and cross-references. Over the millennia, a lot of stories and sub-stories have been added. There are also some stories which are more popular in a sub-region or are told with different emphasis. Different puranas also carry additional information about the same person, apart from what you get in the main purana itself. Sh. Vettam Mani's encyclopaedia is therefore like a life-boat to a person struggling in this ocean of information.The entries are arranged alphabetically. There is a genealogy table at the end. Each entry has multiple paragraphs, where required, which summarise different legends. In almost all the cases, proper references to the original purana or itihas have been given.I bought this encyclopaedia 4-5 years ago and have used it many times. I have found it to be immensely useful and accurate. Sh. Mani has an instinctive idea of just how much information should be picked up and retained in summarising a topic, so that you get a sufficient idea, but are not inundated with detail.The book has a cloth backed spine, with signature binding. I am using a 1998 reprint, the pages have turned a little yellow, but are otherwise in excellent condition. The margins are very narrow, but I suppose the publishers couldn't have made them wider for fear of increasing the size of an already large book. The 1998 print does not appear to be a laser-type set, so the printing is not as good as some of the newer books. Nevertheless, it is fairly clear, and I have not found any proof-reading errors so far.If you are a writer or just a modern person, interested in Indian religious traditions, you will find this book invaluable."},{"Title":"The Mobile Connection: The Cell Phone's Impact on Society (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This is a very good book for the reader to understand new communication devices and the impacts on society.

In revenge for his father's death and his own disfigurement, Einaem has kidnapped Katherine, Romey's and Sam's youngest daughter. As ransom, Einaem demands Molly, Netty, and Tunnelsuit be turned over to him within three days.To save his sister, Richard captures Molly and Netty. He takes them through a blue forest, a cave filled with deadly riddles and traps, and finally to a temple where time stands still. The temple is a meeting place of all the Oracles of known dimensions. Since the girls have been forbidden to ever return to Rairarubia (previous book) the Oracles hope to clone the girls and send Einaem the copies. But the girls must willingly consent to the idea or all is lost.***** I found this to be an excellent grand finale for the award-winning fantasy-adventure series. I hate to see the stories end as I have come to enjoy these precious characters. I can only hope the author, W. Royce Adams, will begin a new fantasy series.

Reading her books, one at least has a starting point - what is a cell, how does it work, what is lacking... etc. At least now you know the names and her claims, and have the ability to do MORE research - is it really true that tumor cells continue to replicate because they are lacking 'breaks'? (obviously this is nothing new and a widely accepted claim). But she at least gives you a NAME for the break, so that you can take what she gives as a STARTING point to learn more. As no one has really found a 100% cure, we all must learn and research until one day we do find it (and we will).If you have some understanding of eastern medicine, you won't find it too difficult to believe that there is at least some correlation between EXCESS and DESEASE - look at nature - wherever there is excess of food, something will be there to use it. Same in our body, when there is excess in our bodies (likely due to over-eating and STAGNANCY), something will find a way to use it. Fight stagnancy with movement, exercise, oxygen, BREATH...Anyone curing themselves needs to realize the importance of attacking the disease from all sides. Obviously, no ONE cure has been proven. But for a patient, one of the MOST important things in a cure is VISION - being able to SEE ourselves healthy is as much a part of the cure as any external method. With her book, Dr. Clark helps us see, if just ONE way, to reduce the excess in our bodies... what's the worst that can happen? get rid of parasites, and you reduce the load on your immune system so it can concentrate elsewhere? That alone is worth it.Call me crazy, but I feel a LOT safer using the fruits of the black walnut tree in my own back yard than I do swallowing some pill.To your health!"},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"Yet again another excellent book from Hulda Clark. She has changed my life and that of many people I know. She is not offering miracles, but down to earth receipes. But you have to have the will and strength to follow them. So it all depends on you.

Either you undergo a treatment of drugs, radiation and surgery which is worse than the disease itself,(success rates are worse than doing NOTHING) or you undergo a comprehensive treatment that is 95% successful.In 100 years we have gone from 1 person in 8000 getting cancer to almost 1 in 2! Obviously the cause of this disease is the multiple change factors of our food supply, environment and lifestyle. This book will show you ALL of these! This is a top notch protocol from a brilliant scientist. This treatment is so effective it is catching on like wildfire in Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Rome, Mexico etc. (Pope John Paul II physician Dr.Adolpho Panfilli follows it!) Why the popularity there and not in the western world? Perhaps cancer is a very lucrative buisness like cars or electronics? There is undoubtedly more money to be made off of &quot;many&quot; office appointments, drugs, operations, computer equipment scans(and the equipment itself.) Lets not forget the buisness of university which keeps young budding scholars adding to the &quot;latest technology&quot; in equipment and research to cure this menace. Do you not see how all this is connected?Simple answer to a simple question, &quot;What are we relying on to find the cure to cancer?&quot; Answer: Our ECONOMY! Unfortunately the words &quot;cure&quot; and &quot;economy&quot; don't fit very well! The word &quot;economy&quot; is a little more synonamous with &quot;suffering.&quot;The choice is yours.

All they can do is despense drugs that the pharmicudical industry tells them they should. It is a multi-billion dollar industry. That is where this book comes into play.

For instance; When early detection is credited for longer lives, consider that in most cases, all of the 'extended' life is the time that the test was moved up,(if you took the test a year sooner, you lived an 'extra' year), ie; no real increase. Consider that many medical tests,(biopsies and mammographies), actually force open 'scar'-sealed cancer cells that never would've entered the bloodstream if left alone. Consider that many types of cancer are known by your doctor to kill you at the same point in your painful chemo and radiation treatments as you would've died , without pain, if not treated at all, yet they do their best to keep that fact unknown to their patients. Consider how the medical establishment at large claim that diet has minimal effect on helping patients,(have you ever eaten hospital food)? If physicians want us to stop patronizing the 'kooks', then they had better start learning, and passing on, the truth. (Add to Mr Lewandoski): You confuse the mean, median, and mode. If you remove infant deaths and deaths from formerly untreatable war injuries from the \\"average age\\" of death, the population often lived as long as,(and in better shape than), our current 'averages', and without all the supposed help of our modern hospitals and nursing homes.

But the liver cleanse stuff has really increased my energy level a whole lot. One thing you do have to be careful of, however, is that in exploring alternative medicine, since it is not totally regulated by the FDA, is that even herbs and pills can have side effects that are not mentioned on the label (ex. herbel laxitives probably helped to contribute to my having hermerroids). I have used the zapper technology that was diagramed in the book (as well as zappers that have been built by independent manufacturers). Like all forms of treatment, this technology will have different effects on different people (and of course, side effects). Long term studies of the effects of this technology are still not done yet and perhaps a more scientific approach to the mechanisms of this alternative treatment should be taken so that more information can be passed to many more people. A lot of this book has a lot of good information in it. I know at least some of it is true, though I don't know if all of it is true.

According to the author, cancer, Alzheimers and even AIDS are caused by an intestinal fluke -- and easily cured by following this lengthy treatment program.The funniest part of this book is the case history section -- Many of the featured patients showed up only once, but seemed to be so devoted to following her program, that she feels certain they followed it until they were cured! A frequent diagnosis is &quot;probable cancer&quot;, a diagnosis she made after reputable doctors could find nothing wrong. This is a very strange book, a must-see if you are into High Weirdness. Stay away from it if you have cancer -- see your doctor instead!"},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"In response to the eloquent review written by the esteemed, Corey F.Dyok. Sir, in your review you have proposed that the cancer rate has skyrocketed from 1:8000 to 1:2... brilliant! In a brief review of the history of cancer for the lesser informed. Cancer has been documented in the literature for over 5,000 years. Over the past 10,000 years, life expectancy remained at 30-years until the past 150 years when life expectancy dramatically rose to 70-years. &quot;During the past 150 years, there has been a progressive elimination of infectous diseases as a major cause of death, and because most children now survive to reproductive age a sudden population explosion has ensued&quot;[Cairns, John]. So, plain and simply, diseases of old age occur frequently because we now have an aged society. And the diseases of old age are cardiovascular disease and cancer.FYI: the Federal Trade Commision is currently in court to try to shut down Dr. Clark's website for making unsubstantiated claims...in their own words: The FTC argues that Dr. Clark's work must be scientifically proven according to their standards, otherwise we may not publish it, and therefore you can't read it."},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"People will believe anything. This book is full of proposperous claims, and scientifically impossible devices. The idea of a 9V battery &quot;zapping&quot; parasited deep in body tissues is most ridiculase. Last time I checked, the skin was quite an insulator. The book has no hard facts to back up all the claims. Where are the many people that are cured from these cancers and even HIV/AIDS. There are none, because the only diaganosis cured were tested by some hocus pocus in the quacks private practice. No medically diagonosed cases have ever been cured by this money grubbing con aritist. The book tries to generate fear about being contaminated by everyday living. The cure, send money for off the wall products and supplements with no quality control packing.

It will rob you of quality of life. Prevention is the key. Living a clean life when possible and cleansing to erridicate the enviromental toxins out of your control. Sure it works but you cant' live reckelssly and expect a miracle to save you. You have to save yourself with prevention. Still no guarantees either, but suffering is not an option I would ever choose. Let Medicine be thy food and food they medicine. Hippocrates I believe.

I am a novice at using the internet and ordering things from it. I didn't think my order went through the first time, so I reordered a second time the next day, evidently from a different place. Because of a different postage category, the second book I ordered came first, and I sent it on to a relative. Then I received the first book I had evidently ordered also, not realizing it. It was a big mix up, but Amy took time to investigate and helped me understand what had happened. I had an extra book I couldn't use, so Amy graciously allowed me to return it to her. She refunded my money minus the postage she had spent on it, and I was so grateful. If you are reading this, I hope you will order some of your books from her to make up for her lost sale to me. She will treat you right, above and beyond, as I have explained above for an old, confused lady. Thank you, Amy!"},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"I read \\"The Cure for All Diseases.\\" Her claim that parasites are behind all diseases sounded plausible to me. (My husband has Crohn's disease, and just like ulcers, doctors have now discovered that Crohn's is also caused by an autoimmune response to a certain intestinal bacteria; this didn't sound so different.)But some of the book didn't make sense and some was contradictory. So I decided to do some independent research using objective sources to find out more about Clark. What I found was absolutely frightening. Her health claims and case histories are fraudulent. Her treatment facilities are inhumane and have cost people precious time, money and health and in some cases even their very lives. She has had to run from the law, from Indiana to California and Mexico.Please do some research before accepting her teachings or using any of her products or services. Wikipedia has links, articles and details regarding all of her activities and why her health claims are completely bogus. Another comprehensive site is Quackwatch org, which has ongoing lawsuits from and against Clark and her son. And just Googling her will reveal lots of information, testimonies, and legal documentation.UPDATE: Clark died in 9/09 of cancer."},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"In one of Hulda Clark's previous books, &quot;The Cure For All Cancers&quot; she states on a very prominent page at the beginning:&quot;Does this mean you can cancel your date for surgery, radiation or chemotherapy? Yes! After curing your cancer with this recipe it cannot come back.&quot;I believe that book also stated it did not matter at what stage one's cancer was, she had the cure. So now we have still another book with &quot;The Cure For All Advanced Cancers&quot;.I was impressed at the beginning of this new book with Hulda Clark's style. She comes across as very caring, creative and knowledgeable. I'm not a medical expert, so a lot of what she writes seems impressive to me. Some of it has me wondering if maybe this person has something and the public needs to listen. But yet another part of me knows we have been down this road many times before. Intelligent minds that are talented with words and charismatic -- and yet we find out later how wrong they are.Hulda Clark claims to have &quot;the cure for all advanced cancers&quot;, an extremely bold claim. Such a huge claim should at least be backed up with good evidence, but I cannot find it. The technical jargon is formidable, so I studied the 50 or so cases she presents at the back of the book.These cases use fictitious names. Maybe that is fair, to protect the people from being bothered. But it also makes it hard to check with these people on the details that are in the book. And in this book with &quot;the cure for all advanced cancers&quot;, we find out sadly that many of these people are definitely not cured. Hulda Clark appears to have no system in place for following up on these people, or compiling meaningful data on the alleged effectiveness of her methods. As many of these patients leave her care she hopes they do well, but worries they may not. Maybe they are not willing or able to have their teeth worked on, change certain details of their lifestyle, or move to an environment that is free of some particular substance. Clark usually has some excuse when patients fail. We need more than a bunch of cases where it is unclear if even one single person was saved at all by Hulda Clark.Conventional medicine keeps records, does studies, and opens this information up for review so it can be verified and analyzed. Conventional medicine does not claim to cure all cancers, and in fact admits it can help little in so many cases, and that it does make mistakes. Practitioners of conventional medicine, very intelligent people, also die and lose loved ones to cancer. Over the years it seems none of them have followed Clark's methods and been cured. As much as even physicians dying of cancer would like a cure, they know that Hulda Clark has not shown she has one."},{"Title":"The Cure For All Advanced Cancers","review":"Where are the accolades?Where are the people she saved?

I have never been big on poetry for children (don't ask why; I guess because I didn't like it as a child), and I almost didn't open this book. What a mistake that would have been.Every single page of this wonderful, fanciful and subtly geographical collection is better than the one before. Here we have a poem that extolls the virtues of Indianapolis (one doesn't see too many Indianapolis poems!) in a ridiculous but so- sweet poem. There are elephants in trees, and frogs in suspenders, and all the other lovely ideas that children can accept and love without question.The drawings by Petra Mathers make the book. I can't list a favorite; each one, so colorful, so fanciful, and so very endearing, compliments the poem it illustrates.What I like best about this book, however, is that it encourages a love of the English language without ever letting the child know it is doing so. The wonderful tongue-rolling combination of words, the silly (but not really) images the words evoke, and the simple joy in every poem are tailor-made to enchant a child and encourage him or her to read more.Highly recommended!!"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],x={key:0},E={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,P)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-e4694ada"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/4.md","filePath":"quotes/4.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/4.md"},j=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{D as __pageData,j as default};
