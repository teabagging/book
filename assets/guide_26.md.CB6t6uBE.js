This breadth of experience keeps him grounded in the real world - which is good, because that's where writing and reading are actually done. In this collection of essays, he never disappears into theoretical ivory towers, nor does he make ridiculously large claims for the art of the novel or the enormity of his own talent. His essays are characterized by a generous, unpretentious ease. This book will be immensely enjoyable for writers and readers alike, but particularly for writers. Lodge's refreshing honesty about his own writing practices and experiences - especially in adapting his own novels and others - is a treat."},{"Title":"Microsoft Works for Windows 95 Step by Step","review":"It's great!!!!!

I was very excited to read it and was definitely not disappointed. Jeff's humor and wit are even more apparent in the book, and his knowledge is shown to be flawless.The book is composed of four sections, each of which explore an area of the world: Arizon's Sonoran desert, the African savannah, the Costa Rican rainforest, and the Llanos of Venezuela. I found this selection perfect, as I'd seen specials on each of these previously. I hope, however, that maybe Jeff will explore other areas, perhaps Australia or Asia, in future books. Jeff does not merely describe animals or give facts about them; he composes an intricate story about each animal, sometimes to the point that you feel very concerned or saddened when something happens to the creature at hand. You are not really learning about Jeff's experience with the animals, you are experiencing them firsthand.The book is definitely well-written. Jeff's humor and enthusiasm come across loud and clear. Also, the photographs are second to none, and almost all of them (except perhaps five) were taken by Jeff! My only disappointment about the book was that the editing was a tad sloppy, as there were typos and words missing at times.Overall, however, this is a superb book for an Animal Planet viewer, an animal lover, an explorer, or a Jeff Corwin fan."},{"Title":"Living on the Edge: Amazing Relationships in the Natural World","review":"This is a very entertaining and educational book. I'm a fan of The Jeff Corwin Experience, and this book did not disappoint me. It is very well organized and well written, and I was amazed at the way it managed to drop me right down into the middle of the Costa Rican rainforest or the African savannah. What I particularly liked was the variety of bizarre and fascinating details that Jeff adds. I found myself sharing these bizarre facts (like giant anaconda orgies that can last for weeks and weeks...woohoo!)with all sorts of people who, no doubt, thought I was some sort of animal expert now. But best of all is Jeff's obvious enthusiasm for the subject matter, particularly the topic of conservation. It's hard not to enjoy his stories when he presents them with such passion and humor. I definitely recommend this book to Jeff Corwin fans and any readers who want to take a walk on the wild side."},{"Title":"Living on the Edge: Amazing Relationships in the Natural World","review":"Excellent, vivid descriptions make it seem as if your right there next to Jeff seeing these amazing sights and critters.

Altho I am a big fan of Jeff's and the Jeff Corwin Experience, I am still blown away by this book. Jeff describes everything vividly, yet in a beautifully poetic way (i've never heard of so many diff ways to describe the sunset). I was really surprised b/c he isn't like that on the show. I loved that many lesser-known animals are introduced, as well as the more common ones. Also, I loved that Jeff gave us the pecularities/specialties of each animal so I'm not just reading the same old boring stuff that I've read in too many nature books or seen on tv. I've learned a lot of things that I never knew about (ie: the symbiosis btwn strangler fig & wasp) and Jeff describes them all so vividly that it was even better than watching the show. The only complaint I have is that there's not enough pictures. But as I read along, I realized that Jeff already painted the whole scene for me that photos would just be icing on the cake.

Its predictions turned out to be devastatingly accurate within no time at all. Christopher Lingle, while a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore, wrote an article in the International Herald Tribune, which angered the Singaporean government. Faced with the threat of imprisonment, Lingle fled the country and began working on this book in the USA. The book was published in 1997 - one year before the catastrophic collapse of the East Asian economies.Lingle talks about the mountains of literature being churned out in praise of the 'Asian miracle' and the phenomenal economic progress of the Asian and other Asia-Pacific nations, which displayed double-digit growth rates through most of the 80s and 90s. The author contends that the highest-growth industry seems to be the one publishing books about the 'Asian century'.Lingle attributes the over-enthusiastic optimism for Asia's 'miracle economies' to the classic faux pas of extrapolating short-term observations. While no one can deny the fact that there has been rapid growth of these economies, he points out that, historically, several regimes with fundamentally flawed institutional arrangements have produced relatively long periods of high growth. Spain under Franco in the 50s and 60s, apartheid South Africa, Soviet Russia and even communist North Korea have all shown periods of sustained economic 'progress' until their inherent weaknesses led to an inevitable collapse.The inherent contradiction is that true economic advance is a direct function of the human spirit and entrepreneurship, both of which are repressed under regimes, which practice collectivist repression in order to maintain the single-party political status quo. The capitalistic tenets of contract law and property rights are fundamentally individualistic in nature and fly in the face of the policies of East Asian regimes.Lingle takes the bull by the horns in analyzing how the world reached the consensus that indeed the economies of East Asia were 'miracle' economies. It all began when the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) buoyed by the success of the Japanese model at the time decided that it was time for some economic evangelism. The extensively bureaucratic and interventionist model championed by the Japanese was at sharp odds with the World Bank endorsed neo-classical view.In order to showcase their approach as a theoretical model, which could be successfully adopted by other countries in the region, the Japanese government commissioned the World Bank to produce a report that was published in 1993 under the title 'The East Asian Miracle.' So what were the conclusions of this (at the time, enshrined in economic folklore) report? The most important conclusions of this report were that the 'miraculous' growth experienced by the region was a result of macroeconomic stability achieved by pursuance of prudent fiscal and monetary policy. Much to the liking of its Japanese masters, the report admitted that the large-scale market interventions carried out by these governments had contributed to the 'miracle'Lingle talks about Max Weber's nineteenth century view that Confucianism would retard the modernization of Asia and how that particular contention seemed to be far from the truth when the Asian ascent began in the 1970s. It soon became widely accepted that neo-Confucianism was a source of East Asian dynamism. This neo-Confucianism, created by selective picking and choosing of tenets from the original belief system and transforming them into a distinct political ideology, justifies the pre-eminence of the rights of the community over the rights of the individual. The 'virtuous rulers' theory, (rather than the choice of the citizenry) advocated by neo-Confucians fitted perfectly in the scheme of things for authoritarian patriarchal governments.Thus extensive market interventions, rejection of the notion of the self-regulating economy and the ability to enforce stability, resulted in the creation of the myth that East Asia's dynamic yet traditional rulers were responsible for the great ascendancy to economic power. This neo-Confucian inspired set of Asian values is championed by what it commonly called the 'Singapore School', which aggressively promotes its own model of development as uniquely Asian, indisputably successful and easily transplantable.The distinctive neo-Confucian concepts of 'filial piety' and subservience to authority eatly lend themselves to the one-party authoritarian style of rule of leaders like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia. The venerated Confucian tradition of strong family bonds, in a modern context translates into what Lingle calls 'dynastic succession and an entrenched policy of nepotism.'Examples of course, are numerous. From Sukarno and Suharto in Indonesia to the Gandhis and Bandaranaikes in India and Sri Lanka respectively; from the Korean Kims and Cambodian royalty to the Marcoses and the Acquinos of the Philippines, Asia has a long 'tradition' of dynastic democracies. Lingle points out that such nepotism is in direct conflict with modernizing forces such as marketization. They seem to be more compatible with imperial colonialism than modern democracy."},{"Title":"The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century: False Starts on the Path to the Global Millennium","review":"This book was written before the Asian Financial crisis hit in late 97. It basically high lights why the author thinks there will be no Asian Century and instead there will be a Global Century. Lingle believes that the Asia dragons will not be as strong as everyone thinks for the following reasons: There is no free press in all these countries so the same party stays in power; All the countries have basically a one party system. This promotes corruption; there is a lack of transparency in all the banking systems. This leads to insolvency; business decisions are made not based on marketing forces but based on connection; the cost of business includes bribes; and finally since the governments are so involved in their economies, they cannot react quickly enough to changes which take placein the market place. This will not be acceptable in the highly global competitive world of the next century.Right now based on what we are seeing through out all of Asia, Lingle appears to have known what he was writing about. He called the crisis before it hit. Based on his insightful analysis he shows us that he knows more about Asia than all these other so called Asian experts who were straight lining the Asian miricle into the next century right up to the day before the Asian Crisis hit."},{"Title":"The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century: False Starts on the Path to the Global Millennium","review":"Lingle has again written a book far more valuable than its price.For those interested in Asia,and the econo-politics of the region, this is a must for any library, private or public.

His initial beliefs were manifested in the last year and a half."},{"Title":"Parliamentary law at a glance: Based on Robert's Rules of order revised","review":"I think this book is great because it lays before you a visual of how all the orders work.

Still worth the price."},{"Title":"Epics of Sumerian Kings: The Matter of Aratta (Writings from the Ancient World)","review":"This book helped me to understand better some of the earliest literature so far discovered. It is very well thought out and gives good descriptions of the context and the difficulties of translating the cuniform tablets. The side-by-side Sumerian and translation add to the interest in reading these tales from the time of the earliest cities and a completely polytheistic world model. It is remarkable to me that some of the 'simple' things we understand today were such mysteries and fraught with gods of the gaps in that time and place. Even more so the difference in knowledge between this literature and that of the Greeks and Romans only 2000 years later. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about the early history of our civilization."},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"While I applaud the author for being the only one (that I know of) to write a book on .NET multithreading, this book has a few shortcomings. Namely, the book doesn't provide complete source for all the samples in both C# and VB, which forces the reader to understand BOTH languages, and the structure of the material does not really provide enough depth in some areas such as GUI multithreading. The book does provide useful information though.BT"},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"This book is just plain bad.The source code is awful. Not only is it poorly formatted, sometimes incorrect and in an annoying mix of C# and VB.NET, but the examples are often horribly incomplete. I usually read programming books by skimming the source and text at the same time but I can't do that in .NET Multithreading because many of the examples are just snippets and are lacking in important information such as types. I was often forced to either slog through the text or hit MSDN to figure out what was going on.The other reviewers' comments on the lack of depth are right on the mark. You'll get enough information to write trivial little applications, but that's about it. To its credit, the book does do a decent job of warning you about multithreading problems, though I think it should do a better job of instilling a healthy sense of fear in threading newbies.If you really want to understand multithreading, I'd recommend reading Tannenbaum's OS book for the basics, followed by the MSDN literature for .NET specifics. It also helps to read a book on Win32 multithreading so you can understand what's going on underneath the .NET layer. You should also read Debugging Applications for Microsoft .NET and Microsoft Windows.I probably would not buy this book again."},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"I bought this book to get a clear picture of what .NET has in terms of thread support. This book gives you that. It is reasonably well written, but the editors have failed badly because there are numerous typographical mistakes and inconsistencies between the text and the quoted code examples.Alan succeeds in getting the ideas across, but unfortunately the examples that can be downloaded from the web site are tough to find because the directory structure of the downloaded code does not correctly match the sections in the text that it is supposed to match to.I'd definitely still recommend getting the book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone switching to .NET programming, especially VB people who typically are not experienced with real enterprise application development."},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"I have done a lot of Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) work in Win32 and I was looking for a text that would show me the classes and design patterns used to build multi-threaded applications in the .NET Framework. This book was quite good for that purpose. If I had no exposure to multi-threaded programming prior to reading this book, I still think I would have found it very useful and probably a bit more challenging. This book has plenty of C# and VB.NET examples. However, as a veteran C++ programmer, I don't read VB.NET all that well (because it looks so clunky) so I found myself wishing that each example was shown fully in both languages as some other .NET books are beginning to do. Other than that, I recommend this one for anyone who wants to build robust, multi-threaded .NET applications. The author's language and approach to the material are both very good."},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"This book pulls no punches. It gives you the facts that would take years to decipher from the many of MSDN articles, and tidbits, which often contradict each other. If you are doing ANYTHING with multithreading you need this.For example, the ReaderWriterLock is often worth the extra few lines of code then the C# lock command (shorthand for the Monitor class). And you should try to never use lock(this) or lock(typeof(ClassWithStaticMember)).That is just lazy coding as you lock the entire item from ALL threads. Even when you use Microsoft's attributes under the covers, they lock the entire class!For scalable code, locks and critical sections need to be as small as possible. This book will make sure you understand what is happening and what ALL of your options are. I do not think any expert C# developer can call himself or herself an expert if they do not read this book in detail or have not gained the knowledge some other way.My only criticism (and it is a small one) is...wait.. It IS in the book and I just missed it! Never mind. I though they left out this but MANNING and the Author didn't* Synchronized contexts. You can use the SynchronizationAttribute to enable simple, automatic synchronization for ContextBoundObject objects.* Synchronized property. A few classes, such as Hashtable and Queue, provide a Synchronized property that returns a thread-safe wrapper for an instance of the class. See Collections and Synchronization (Thread Safety).* Synchronized code regions. You can use the Monitor class or compiler support for this class to synchronize only the code block that needs it, improving performance.* Manual synchronization. You can use the various synchronization objects to create your own synchronization mechanisms.The common language runtime provides a thread model in which classes fall into a number of categories that can be synchronized in a variety of different ways depending on the requirements.Anyway, I am picky as heck and this book it simply fantastic. I use many sections as interview questions for new hires.Kind Regards,Damon Carr, Chief Technologistagilefactorwww.agilefactor.com"},{"Title":".NET Multithreading","review":"The book is a good starting point for multithreading.

Unfortunately, the book lacks depth. The threading model in C# is a completely different model than Java. In java, threads are owned by parent thread or set as a daemon thread. In C#, the threading is client centric and designed for atomic processes. For example, the book doesn't cover examples where an application has persistent threads running as server processes to maximize object/thread reuse for stateful applications. Not all uses of threading is simplistic as the examples provided in the book. Overall, the book is a decent intro, but it's far from being thorough and complete. In server environments where you want a master thread to manage a pool of 20-100 threads, .NET simply isn't designed for it. The maximum threads in threadpool class is 25, which makes it totally inappropriate for many heavy-weight applications.

In the first part of the book, they seemed to have the mentality of \\"he/she's so hot that I have SUCH a hard time controlling my hormones. Let's see how long it takes to get him/her in the sack!\\" Then when they finally do the deed,it seems like every other page revolves around them either doing it or THINKING how they can't wait to get to the nearest room so they can do it again. Ugh; enough already!Toeards the end of the book, you had to deal with the mentality of \\"gee, i'm not good enough for him/her!\\" Luckily, they don't dwell on THAT mentality too much.Because of this, the characters came across as flat and boring. I never got the impression that they really fell in love with each other, but that they both knew a good bang when they saw it, and that's why they decided to stay together.I'm sorry, but I like my books to have more substance and more of an actual plot; than ones are not much more than soft porn written by an author who clearly doesn't have much of an imagination."},{"Title":"KEVIN'S STORY # 165 (Loveswept)","review":"I enjoy a good romance, and am willing to put up with some silliness in exchange for an entertaining story, but this has to be one of the worst romance novels ever written, equal to some of the worst online fan fiction.So why is it so bad? For one thing, it's horribly dated. For another, the authors ask us to believe that Kansas City is home to the privileged, elite, jetsetters, and that Kevin, who owns and manages a cookie factory, has a glamorous, desirable career. The heroine, Suzy, is somehow going to launch her own brilliant career by becoming the spokesmodel for Kevin's Kookies, and ... yeah, I could not keep reading.A book, unlike a movie, can be set anywhere at no extra cost. If you want to tell a story about impossibly beautiful and wealthy people, why not set it in New York or LA, with lawyers or something? Don't try to convince me that the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce annual reception is the social event of the season. Later on they appear on the Today Show to be interviewed by Jane Pauley. Wow, that's some cookie factory!The idiocy continues: Kevin somehow lost his hearing in a car accident. A car accident? Is that at all likely? Wouldn't he be more likely to have an SCI or TBI? Kevin's factory workers are all deaf, but the management (except him) are all hearing. It's taken for granted that deaf people ought to work on the factory floor because the noise doesn't bother them. Suzy reveals that she knows ASL because she had a deaf friend in high school, and somehow, after a few false starts, she's instantly completely fluent. The authors spend a little bit of time at the beginning explaining how ASL works, but otherwise their depiction is not realistic. For instance, they make it seem like ASL is exactly like spoken English, which is not true.The frequent sex scenes are equally unrealistic and laughable, even for a romance. Within the first few pages, when Suzy auditions for her spokesmodel job, she decides that rather than her own clothes, she would look best in a Kevin's Kookies t-shirt, so she changes in his office, and whoops! he sees her naked. Not long after, as they go for a drive together in his cookie van, they pull a blanket out of the back, and go have sex in a public park. In the middle of the city. In the middle of the day. Now you know why romance novels have a reason, however contrived, of keeping the hero and heroine apart as long as possible.

Suzy, even though at times can be too perky and unbeat for her own good is a model who practically has a heart of gold. She becomes the spokesperson and model for Kevin's cookie business. One look at each other and they are both enthralled.Suzy has no problem being with Kevin, but even though Kevin has strong feelings for Suzy, he feels he can't be a true man for Suzy because of his disability.A truly touching love story that is a funny and enjoyable read.Unfortunately this book is out of print and very hard to find.

Especially Kevin!Katiebabs"},{"Title":"Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods: An Exploration into the Religious Significance of Male Homosexuality in World Perspective","review":"Professor Long provides a much needed and long awaited treatment of homosexuality in religious perspectives. His focus on the issues of \\"gender-threat\\" and its relation to why some religions are antagonistic to male homosexuality is right on target.

I could only force myself to read half of this book before I got sick of the author constantly talking about homosexuality as humiliating and ridiculous. Having researched Native American tradition and Wicca I have come to know that neither of these traditions look down on homosexuality as being humiliation or ridiculous. This book is not at all what it appears to be."},{"Title":"Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods: An Exploration into the Religious Significance of Male Homosexuality in World Perspective","review":"An excellently thought out analysis of several religions and their views on sexuality. Long supposes that historically, sex has been treated as war in the bedroom, even if such war-play is pleasurable, ultimately it has become a crossroads of power and domination, which in is institutionalized through religious teachings. Through his thorough research, he is able to construct a case for how the human psyche came to attribute supernatural/religious significance to the mundane realities of sexual evolution.Some of his views run slightly counter to the more mainstream teachings of Women's/Gender Studies departments, but his work makes for a great companion text for any such courses."},{"Title":"Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods: An Exploration into the Religious Significance of Male Homosexuality in World Perspective","review":"I stumbled upon a mention of this book in someone's blog and was immediately interested because I was expecting a juicy examination of images of Pagan Gods in relation to gay male psychology and identity, and perhaps spiritual practice. (Books that examine images of Gods in relation to men usually tend to be quasi-Jungian redux-- like GODS IN EVERYMAN by Jean Shinoda Bolen or those written by Robert Bly camp followers, and the rarer ones that relate to current Pagan practice tend to be cursory overviews with the intent of introducing the reader to \\"Paganism 101\\"-- this includes even the one such book specifically targeted to gay men, THE PATH OF THE GREEN MAN by Michael Thomas Ford.)Instead, what I received-- thru interlibrary loan, so thankfully I did not waste my money on this dull book-- was a vapid rehash of historical material relating primarily to how major monotheisms (and a few indigenous cultures) accepted or did not accept homosexuality in men. Plus a very dull continuing exegesis on \\"topping' and \\"bottoming\\" as seen through these cultures, blah blah blah. I suspect others who have sought out this book were similarly mislead by the use of the words \\"the Gods\\" in the title. A more accurate title, which would have placed this book on the correct heap of existing material-- material has been covered before, and by more interesting writers-- would have been \\"MEN, HOMOSEXUALITY, AND RELIGION,\\" etc.\\"Gods\\" in general are *personifications* of the numinous (a term I am using because it embraces the mythic, the mythopoetic, the spiritual, the religious, the archetypal, etc.)-- or more specifically, *aspects* of the numinous. I deal in images of Gods because I am a mythopoeic artist (for examples, you can see my work at paulruckerart.com). In a sentence, I believe that human consciousness meets the Mystery/ that which is Numinous halfway by giving it humanlike (or at least familiar animal-like) attributes. This allows us to create sacred theatre, iconic art,and in a Pagan way, participate in the Mystery in a manner not possible in a monotheism where \\"God\\" supposedly encompasses everything.The Gods, as I am interested in them, are almost not present at all in this book. Other reviewers have judged more sharply the academic content of the material in this book. If I cared enough, I would. Rather, I would like to point readers to more fruitful discussion of Pagan Gods in relation to gay men, in case you too were following a similarly false trail.Top of this list: CASSELL'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF QUEER MYTH, SYMBOL AND SPIRIT: GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER LORE by Randy P.

In addition to fairly familar faces-- \\"Father Sky,\\" \\"the Green Man,\\" and \\"the Warrior\\" he presents \\"Earth Father,\\" \\"Grandfather Sky\\"-- and! \\"The Blue Man.\\" Honestly, I bought the book just for that chapter, because \\"the Blue Man\\" is the Divine Face that has mattered most to me in my art and in sacred theatre performance.Hopefully the above examples will prove inspiring!"},{"Title":"Men, Homosexuality, and the Gods: An Exploration into the Religious Significance of Male Homosexuality in World Perspective","review":"Bought this book hoping for a properly constructed thesis, very disappointing. If you don't subscribe to his thesis to begin with that the world is agin men being receptive like women, and that religions that disdain homosexuality are in fear of losing their patriarchal structure; ie. receptive male intercourse undermines male hierarchy and confuses sexual roles - well if you don't accept this to start with you won't after reading this book.It would be good to read a proper logical argument instead of frantic efforts to heap sand into ramparts before the tide of critical opinion comes in and washes these soluble ramparts away; but I have not yet found it, and this book doesn't either.It is actually quite pathetic, there is an absence of hard logic or reasoned fact. Men may well engage in same-sex relations because it pleasures them, or for some dysfunctional reason; it is the hedonism that offends religion, not the feminist line about threats to male hierarchy...............then again Dr Long can hardly use \\"penis envy\\" as a rationale but otherwise he re-hashes feminist jargon to pose some great threat to male family structures if one of them decides to bend over and be receptive to male advances.It is like tackling a souffle; the book has no coherent argument and merely reinforces existing prejudices; if you want to believe this nonsensical thesis you will enjoy the book provided you are not given to rational thought; otherwise you will feel you have just read some flaccid prose in a third-rate magazine.............maybe you have !"},{"Title":"The return of Lono,: A novel of Captain Cook's last voyage (An Atlantic Monthly Press book)","review":"I really enjoy reading historical fiction, in this case as far as I know it seems really accurate (as I looked up a few things). I am ashamed to admit that I didn't know that William Bligh was a crew member under the command of Capt. Cook. As many know Mr. Bligh would go on to be the Capt. of the HMS Bounty. The author uses a young English seaman to tell his tale. The interesting part of that is how he (as well as the other Englishmen) refer to Hawaiians as Indians, but I would think in their time anybody who was brown was an Indian. The story makes you appreciate how difficult communication could be between two groups who do not speak the same language.

La Aproximaci&oacute;n que viene luego se inicia con esta tesis: El hombre es el buscador de sentido (p. 17). A partir de ella, el autor presenta cuatro teor&iacute;as acerca del sentido que considera acercamientos al tema especialmente relevantes; las de Wilhelm Weischedel, Guilles Deleuze, Eugen Fink y Mircea Eliade. Luego, indica que lo que persigue Heidegger es un habitar aut&eacute;ntico del hombre en la cuaterna. En ese habitar el hombre cuida la cuaterna. Cuidar la cuaterna -se&ntilde;ala Heidegger en \\"Construir Habitar Pensar\\"-, es salvar la tierra, recibir el cielo, esperar a los divinos, acompa&ntilde;ar a los mortales; y agrega: este cu&aacute;druple cuidar (schonen) es la esencia simple del habitar (cit. en p. 47). \\"Desde la concepci&oacute;n l&uacute;dica heideggeriana -concluye Holzapfel-, el asumirnos en nuestro ser puestos en juego significa la posibilidad de ese habitar aut&eacute;ntico, el cuidado de la cuaterna, insert&aacute;ndonos plenamente en su juego-de-espejos\\" (p. 47). A continuaci&oacute;n, pasa el autor a un plano &oacute;ntico-existencial, tomando como hilo conductor el pensamiento del soci&oacute;logo franc&eacute;s Roger Caillois (1913-1978). De su obra \\"Los juegos y los hombres. La m&aacute;scara y el v&eacute;rtigo\\" extrae las categor&iacute;as de an&aacute;lisis fundamentales. Este amigo cercano de Victoria Ocampo \\"plantea que hay los siguientes juegos: 1. Juegos de agon, t&eacute;rmino griego que significa \`competencia'. 2. Juegos de alea, t&eacute;rmino latino que significa \`suerte'. Juegos de mimicry, t&eacute;rmino de origen ingl&eacute;s, que significa \`mimetismo', que proviene a su vez del griego mimesis, \`imitaci&oacute;n'. 4. Juegos de ilinx, t&eacute;rmino griego que significa \`torbellino', del que deriva a su vez ilingos, \`v&eacute;rtigo'. De este modo, tenemos juegos de competencia, de suerte, de simulacro (que consisten en jugar a ser otro, lo que tiene que ver con las m&aacute;scaras), y juegos de v&eacute;rtigo (siendo estos &uacute;ltimos juegos de riesgo y peligro, por ejemplo las acrobacias)\\" (p. 74). En los juegos, como en todo, tiene vigencia el principio de raz&oacute;n suficiente. Pero en ellos, a la par, hay cierta suspensi&oacute;n del principio. Sobre todo en los juegos de suerte, simulacro y v&eacute;rtigo (los juegos de competencia exigen un tratamiento teor&eacute;tico especial). En la parte dedicada a Jaspers, el autor vincula la raz&oacute;n suficiente con la planificaci&oacute;n total del mundo, y la suspensi&oacute;n de la raz&oacute;n suficiente existencial con la libertad. Lo primero lleva a la interpretaci&oacute;n que da Jaspers de nuestra &eacute;poca, la era de la t&eacute;cnica. Origen y meta de la historia (1949) proporciona el hilo conductor. \\"La planificaci&oacute;n total tiene como paradigma a la t&eacute;cnica, y con &eacute;sta el planeta se ha vuelto una \`f&aacute;brica' y la naturaleza una \`bodega de la humanidad'. Esto trae repercusiones para el hombre, el cual llega a ser un \`habitante sin suelo'. Amenaza el peligro de que el hombre se ahogue en la segunda naturaleza, que &eacute;l produce t&eacute;cnicamente como la propia (Origen y meta de la historia, ed. alemana, pp. 129, 155). La tecnificaci&oacute;n se expande a tal punto que determina el esparcimiento y el tiempo libre\\" (p. 149). La obra se cierra con un Anexo que recoge un excelente ensayo de Sandra Baquedano titulado \\"La raz&oacute;n suficiente: de Leibniz a Schopenhauer\\". El libro consiste en un conjunto de perfectas \\"series dial&eacute;cticas\\" -en el sentido que da Ortega a la expresi&oacute;n en Origen y Ep&iacute;logo de la Filosof&iacute;a-, en las que los pensamientos se concatenan con meridiana claridad. El autor nos gu&iacute;a con un orden ejemplar a trav&eacute;s de complejas teor&iacute;as y diversos puntos de vista que a&uacute;na magistralmente en torno a una cuesti&oacute;n central: la vigencia y la suspensi&oacute;n del principio de raz&oacute;n suficiente. A esto &uacute;ltimo le llama juego. De ah&iacute; el nombre del libro, que constituye un hito importante dentro de la ya consolidada trayectoria filos&oacute;fica de Holzapfel, y un significativo aporte a la meditaci&oacute;n sobre el hombre y nuestro tiempo.Jorge Acevedo GuerraProfesor TitularDirectorDepartamento de Filosof&iacute;aUniversidad de Chile"},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"In \\"Free Fall in Crimson,\\" the 19th Travis McGee episode, author John D. MacDonald refuses to be tied up with boundaries. In fact, this book seems a great deal like a geography lesson, as the plot takes him from Ft. Lauderdale, to other Florida parts, to Beverly Hills, and, finally, to Iowa for the climactic scene!However, readers should not let that put them off another top-flight installment in the McGee series--this time involving, yes, a murder and other corruption, a hotair balloon competition.The plot is set aloft when Ron Esterland approaches Travis for help--seems he's been completely cut out of his inheritance when his father was murdered two years earlier (most of the estate has been left to his estranged wife and her filmmaker friend). Ron wants Travis to find the truth about the murder, suspecting that the wife and friend had much to do with it.Travis' pursuit then takes him cross country, eventually landing in Roseland,Iowa, where a film is being made about a hot-air balloon meet. As with the other McGee stories, MacDonald keeps us on the edge until the final pages. It is not that we don't know the guilty party; it is just that Travis must find a way to secure justice--usually his own brand--as many of the guilty are \\"out of bounds\\" to legal prosecution.Readers will not be disappointed in either the story or McGee! While the series does not require a chronological reading, the earlier books establish the characters (especially McGee and economist friend Meyer). The first book is \\"The Deep Blue Goodby\\"--and it's a good place to get started, to \\"channel\\" the McGee interest. But regardless, \\"Free Fall in Crimson\\" merely adds to the charm of the series and of the character--it will leave you grasping for air!(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"One of the things I like about the McGee series is the strange authority MacDonald brings to it. He had a very strict, intelligent mind and a disdain for shoddy work that rivaled Hemingway's, which often gave his descriptions and depictions a shrewd authority. Even when you may not fully buy what's going on on the page, you can buy that the author and the characters believe it, which is often enough to go on.But with \\"Free Fall in Crimson,\\" the authority is a little flimsy. The book, published in the early 80s, is the first McGee that just does not convince on several key levels.Most of that has to do with McGee's brief dip into California outlaw biker culture in his attempts to track down a murderous Hell's Angel named Dirty Bob. Nothing about the scenario -- not the crime McGee investigates, not the people he meets along the way, not the stilted dialogue he engages in, not the situations he encounters -- feels convincing.A millionaire goes to buy a little hash and takes gold Krugerrands to purchase the drugs? McGee is made an honorary member of a bike tribe (\\"The Fantasies\\") and given a special pin to use... if he ever needs it? A character on the run who needs to hide his identity suddenly gets a terminal illness that allows him to drop 100 pounds in two months?The second half of the book -- McGee's visit to a debauched, coked-out 80s-era film set, where a Dennis Hopper-esque auteur is having a big budget meltdown as he tries to make an existential thriller (about balloon pilots?) -- is a little more convincing than the biker stuff, but the dialogue still smells too much like exposition, the film crew's lines sound transposed from research.I did enjoy the nightmarish riot that begins the last act; and I liked the creepy section in which McGee slowly, gradually figures out that his prey has turned around and is coming after him; and, oddly, I was completely convinced that McGee could survive a leap from a runaway balloon hovering 50 feet off the ground (just remember: land on the balls of your feet, tuck your chin, roll forward with your right shoulder out and down, hit the ground running....)But as far as the series as a whole goes, this is probably one of the weaker entires I've read. But, should I ever fall or jump out of a hot air balloon, I seriously think I'll know what to do."},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"This is a great book if you're in the mood for a philosophy lesson on the meaning of life and how to maintain it. John D. MacDonald knows how to keep the action flowing, without hitting the reader over the head. It's nice to be treated as if you are an intelligent reader, which is why I keep coming back to the McGee series. Travis helps out a man whose father was killed, shortly before cancer would have taken him anyway. As Travis pokes around, he finds a web of dispicable characters hiding behind the entertainment industry. Justice is served to the guilty, as usual. Unfortunately, some of the innocent do not come out of this one, but only those who are not as careful as our houseboat hero. This is definitely one of the better entries in the McGee series, but one should read &quot;A Quick Red Fox&quot; first."},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"Dishing out heavy doses of moral philosophy, McDonald always keeps the reader entertained and thought provoked.

That way, you know if they &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; a book that at the very least you will find it tolerable, and you may just find it a thrill.Robert B. Parker used a shrink/girlfriend for Spenser to put a PC spin on everything he was doing and thinking, as they talked about his cases. The weakness in the Travis McGee series is, first that John D. created Travis in the Sixties era of Hugh Hefner, and second that although Meyer softens Trav, there is no way to make Travis McGee politically correct by any decade's standard other than the Sixties.John D. was by now (FREE FALL is 1981) responding to this sexist backlash. Slightly. I think John D. was also on the final stretch of his run, and had recovered his second wind.--From CRIMSON:She dipped a finger in her remaining half inch of Moselle and drew a slow circle on my chest. \\"Hmmm,\\" she said.\\"Hmmm what?\\"\\"I guess everybody has heard that ancient joke about how do porcupines make love.\\"\\"Very very carefully,\\" I said.She reached and set her empty glass aside. Her eyes danced. \\"So?\\"I gathered her in. \\"Let me know if it gets to be not carful enough.\\"--Actually, my favorite part of this puppy is when Trav jumps out of a hot air balloon to avoid being killed.This resonates with me because I've done a bit of hot air ballooning. First off, did you know that Hot Air Ballooners have to file a flight plan? This has always seemed absurd to me, and maybe it is no longer necessary, it's been awhile since my last ride. On my last balloon ride, there was a Velcro-failure on the third group: there were no deaths, since it happened at a low altitude, but the riders were pretty banged-up, and some of them may have gone to the hospital. Actually, I think that because of this near disaster, and others, Velcro-strips may have been eliminated from Hot Air Balloons. An Internet search is showing an improved balloon circa 2013 without a Velcro strip. Now, apparently, the pilot has an on/off valve at the top of the balloon to dump out hot air on an as-needed basis: Much Better! On my rides the pilots had a cord to pull that would open a Velcro strip in the side of the balloon to quickly dump the air out to make landings safer in the event of high wind. Otherwise the wind would drag the basket along, banging the passengers around. Problem was, if the pilot used the Velcro strip on the first or second trips, he would have to re-assemble and re-inflate the balloon from scratch, which would take time and expend propane. The second ride banged the balloon around quite a bit, which apparently loosened but didn't quite break the Velcro strip. Until the flight of the third group. I watched them go up slowly...I turned away and was talking to a friend who stopped and suddenly pointed...I turned and saw the balloon going down quickly on the other side of a hill...I didn't see it, but the basket hit an angled soft dirt hillside. I remember watching an earlier balloon being assembled and inflated, on my first ride ever, and worrying out-loud about the Velcro: \\"Velcro? This thing is held together with Velcro??\\" That pilot told me: \\"I've never had a Velcro failure. I've never even heard of a Velcro failure.\\"--Anyway, Travis McGee takes on a Biker Gang, Hollywood Power Players, Stuntwomen, and possibly the most frightening creature imaginable: an actress Superstar. @hg47"},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"John D.

In fact, Lysa Dean figures more prominently in this one than in \\"Quick Red Fox\\" (and I still do not understand JDM's and T. McGee's disdain for this interesting character). This installment is very similar to \\"Quick Red Fox\\" in that they're both about pornography and the seamy underbelly of decadent, self-indulgent Hollywood (and both have a red color in the title). There's also a reference to a police lieutenant who first appeared in \\"Scarlet Ruse\\" (rounding out the the red theme).I've notice that the earlier novels were intended to be stand-alones, and there are very limited references to other novels. But in the last five novels, JDM really embraced the possibilities of the series character, and there are more plot and character elements that carry through. I think it is helpful to read the last five in order, and it is helpful to have read the previous Travis McGee novels."},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"So, what exactly do I mean by the title of this review? Well, what I love and hate about the Travis McGee series is that the development/evolution of the McGee character is both wonderful and dreadful depending on which book is read (earlier books, the better). To put it frankly...DO NOT START YOUR McGEE / JOHN D. MacDONALD ADVENTURES WITH THIS BOOK. I've read from other writers of fiction series characters that they try to get a good mix of story and background development/character development in something like the 70 / 30 range. In other words the series can be picked up with any book and the reader would find the story is what pulls them forward to complete the book where further character exploration (soap opera portion) would take second seat and perhaps drive some to pick up another book in the series. Well, Free Fall in Crimson (FFC) just plain misses this mark. In fact, the central story gets a bit lost at times and tends to wander a bit. Yes, we start seeing more of the older and wiser McGee that certainly still has \\"it\\", but he's starting to question his \\"retirement in stretches\\" and contemplate more stable and safer career paths than that of \\"Salvage Consultant\\". The only problem with all this is that this whole dilemma (which is really the catalyst for McGee's whole quest in FFC) is going to ring a bit hollow unless the reader has already spent some time with McGee and Meyer already.Now, as far as the story goes, well it's one of MacDonald's weaker imaginations. It's as if he had taken a hot air balloon ride, thought it is was cool, and wanted to get it into a story in one of the most contrived ways possible. Granted, there's some deeper commentary by MacDonald at work here (balloon as symbol and metaphor) regarding the whole idea of creating art and the Hollywood effect (amongst other themes), but by the end of the book it just seems hollow and actually starts making McGee look a bit pathetic. In FFC it almost seems as if the times are starting to pass MacDonald and McGee by while they're wearily grasping for that brass ring while looking to keep centered in a world that's getting a bit crazier with in the arms of a woman.Travis McGee is perhaps one of my favorite fictitious genre characters, but FFC just starts to make him look a bit pathetic...but perhaps that's what ole John D. had in mind. No doubt that in my eyes, FFC serves testament to the waning creative joy and juices that MacDonald once had for possibly the most overlooked and underestimated American pulp hero."},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"#19 on the list of 21 Travis McGee novels, \\"Free Fall\\" was published just 5 years before the author's death in 1986. While the book is more refined from a technical standpoint than previous offerings, the characters, especially Meyer, have lost some of their luster. This McGee is a step slower, more willing to accept help. He has evolved from a rambunctious cowboy into a more pensive, cautious person. MacDonald was the master of climax, and Free Fall is consistent. Abrupt and violent, you are almost left wondering, \\"What just happened?\\" A great read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Free Fall in Crimson","review":"I always thought \\"Crimson\\" was one of the weakest of the McGee books. I am a big fan of John D. MacDonald but few things in this book hang together. The author thought \\"Indigo\\" was a failure but \\"Indigo\\" was better than this novel.The plot doesn't really ring true and some of the incidents don't either. It's one of the few times in a MacDonald novel that I will read a scene and say, \\"Wait a minute...\\"Not every novel is a success but I thought both this book and \\"Cinnamon Skin\\", written after \\"Crimson\\" were among the weakest of the series.

I wouldn't avoid it if I were going through the series but don't look for the usual MacDonald here. It's fairly strong on character as MacDonald always is but a very weak, convoluted plot takes away from any strength of character the writer exhibits. It's like MacDonald got caught up in it and didn't know how to extricate himself!

MacDonald. The storyline as narrated by protagonist Travis McGee is straightforward and therefore highly readable. McGee's well known tendency to wax philosophic is sufficiently subdued so that it doesn't become annoying. (As it does in some other entries in the Travis McGee series.)On the negative side: The plot is a bit too simplistic and unevenly paced to satisfy most mystery fans. And unlike the author's best novels, the supporting cast generally lacks the nuance that make them believable, three dimensional characters capable of reaching out and touching the reader.Bottom line: Free Fall in Crimson is an effortless read by virtue of its straightforward storyline. Unfortunately, it does not rise to anywhere near the level of John D. MacDonald's best fiction."},{"Title":"Biography - Hill, Janet Muirhead (1942-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","review":"A concise and fairly accurate biography as far as it goes, but needs to be updated.

It's held my interest through muliple reads, and to be honest, it's what DuBois *doesn't* say that makes the action all the more plausible. What shape would the US economy be in if Wall Street suddenly vanished? What would EMP pulses do to (mostly non-shielded) equipment back in the early 60's? How would the veterans be treated (or controlled / mollified?) Worse, what types of leaders would be left and how would they try and consolidate their power? That's what this story is about. I found it a great read, and am hoping he has other books this good published."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"What if nuclear war resulted from the Cuban Missile crisis? And what if a key to explaining those events surfaced ten years later in a much diminished America?

Evidently, it's little-known, despite the fact that Brendan DuBois received an award and much critical praise for Resurrection Day. For anyone who likes the alternate history genre, this book is a must-have. For anyone who's interested in thrillers in general, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"October 1962 was a nerve-wracking time for most people but it was only much later that I learned that I probably should have been closer to \\"terrified\\" than to \\"nervous.\\" I remember well reading the headlines and short articles in my thin local newspaper about the confrontation between Khrushchev and Kennedy that was happening in Cuba. There was a sense of great danger in the articles but I don't recall talking with anyone who really believed that Russia and the United States would actually fire nuclear missiles at each other over the incident. Of course, I was only 14 at the time and may have been spared the truth about what adults were really thinking, but subsequent release of details about the confrontation show how utterly nave so many of us were. (I do remember one of the infamous nuclear bomb drills, the old \\"duck and cover\\" routine, at my school that week but even that didn't really scare me since I had already experienced several of those silly things.)Resurrection Day, by Brendan DuBois, starts with the Kennedy-Khrushchev stalemate over the nuclear-tipped missiles that Khrushchev was installing in Cuba at Castro's \\"invitation.\\" But DuBois takes an alternate path, the path we came so close to actually following, and explores what might have happened if Khrushchev had not blinked at nearly the last possible moment and agreed to remove his nuclear weapons from Cuba.Ten years later, 1972-America has still not recovered from the devastation of the short war with Russia. Washington D.C. is still a blank spot on the map, New York City is off limits and has been fenced in by the military, and the country is still partially dependent on food supplies from Great Britain in order to feed people in its major cities. Russia has been effectively wiped off the map and its survivors forced into primitive living conditions in which their long term survival is still in doubt. It seems that the Soviet arsenal was greatly overrated and contained far fewer missiles capable of reaching the U.S. than had been thought before the war.Carl Landry, military veteran turned Boston newspaper reporter, opens up a can of worms when he refuses to end his investigation into the murder of an old man who had contacted him with promises of a huge story. Despite being warned off the story by his editor and the paper's resident military censor, Landry keeps snooping around and begins to uncover, with the help of his new British girlfriend, secrets about the true condition of New York City, the upcoming presidential election, and a plot between British and American military forces.Brendan DuBois has created an intriguing version of America struggling to recover from the loss of its major city and its capitol. It is an America in which many want to believe that Kennedy survived the destruction of Washington D.C. and will return to power with a plan to rebuild the country while others despise him and blame him for being so trigger happy that he started a war that resulted in the deaths of millions of Americans and Russians. It is a world in which most of America's former allies seem to delight in the fact that she is on her knees and needs their help, a condition in which some wish her to remain forever more. It is a country filled with paranoid citizens who truly do have to worry about being watched, arrested, and sent to detoxification camps if they say the wrong things to the wrong people.Resurrection Day is not perfect. It probably overstates the difficulty that America would have rebounding from the kind of limited nuclear war described, one she actually won, and some of the characters, particularly the chief villain of the piece, are a bit on the stereotypical side and the ending feels a little too formulaic, too much like the culmination of so many other \\"spy thrillers,\\" But fans of alternate history will appreciate the world that DuBois created for us to ponder and should take a look at Resurrection Day."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Unique and imaginitve - what if the Cuban Missile Crisis turned into World War III.

Into this story walks a US army vet and reporter Carl Landry who will discover a national secret, what happened that led to World War III, but must contend with the SAS, shadow elements in the US government and others.Well written, great characters and outstanding plot line, it remains one of my favorite books of all time and one of the best alt-history books written."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known.

What if the Cuban Missile Crisis had not ended, but became a nuclear war instead? DuBois paints a very harrowing picture of a military state in his post-war America.The story takes place in 1972, ten years after the Cuban War, and it centers on Carl Landry, an ex-army sergeant who is now a reporter for the Boston Globe. He has a strange encounter with another veteran who turns up dead a month later. Although his editor tells him to drop the story, Carl thinks something is amiss and continues to investigate. Intrigue ensues. The story gets a little convoluted at times, and is easy to predict at others; but overall it is fast paced and engrossing.If you enjoyed 'Fatherland' then you will probably enjoy 'Resurrection Day.' And if you have not read 'Fatherland' and you read and enjoy this book, give it a try."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"So you've never been attracted to historical fiction. Me neither. But don't miss this fabulously entertaining read!If you want to disappear into a story and get totally immersed in another world, you'll love this book. While the story works well as a thriller, it is so unlike anything else out there, you'll find it as refreshing as fascinating.The alternate history is told so plausibly, you will get caught up in the post-nuclear world that has relegated America to third rate status. As a result, you'll find yourself putting the book down, looking around and truly appreciating the freedom and wealth we enjoy in America, as well as recognizing the fragility of our largesse.For quality escapist reading, I highly recommend &quot;Resurrection Day.&quot; Now duck and cover!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Brendan DuBois has written a classic, following in the footsteps of Harris's 'Fatherland' and Deighton's 'SS-GB'. But I think DuBois has surpassed the afore mentioned. Resurrection Day is so eerily real in some strange way. I stayed awake all night to finish it and I was still thinking about the characters and the scenario days later. This is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it. DuBois is a great writer, with an easy style and a very complex imagination. The suspense is there until the last word."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I got this book from the local library and read it in one sitting. Having read &quot;Fatherland&quot; a few months ago I though the idea of a post nuclear holocaust US very intriguing. The prospect of &quot;what could have been&quot; is truly terrifying and though maybe the book might contain some cliches I think it is a great read and a great escape for a few hours. I like the character of Carl, an individual in the true American sense who will not be compromised. Very worthwile."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Like all good creative ideas it leaves one wondering 'why didn't I think of that ?' Unfortunately the book that's hung around the idea is no more than a mildly entertaining potboiler that parallels the spirit of 'Fatherland' (a far better book) perhaps a little too closely. I'm sure it will capture the popular imagination on both sides of the Atlantic, but sadly for me, to my mind a lot of the plot premises don't hang together or aren't explained. Europe is untouched by the war, yet what of the SAC bases in the UK, France &amp; Germany at the time. The dual key Thor missiles in the UK ? The Jupiter missiles in Turkey. With the Nukes flying the USSR would not have ignored them. We were in reach of their medium range missiles don't forget.As has been discussed, the US would not be as politically and economically damaged by the loss of 5 large conurbations, 10 million souls and a handful (never quantified) of military bases, terrible as that would have been. Transpose that damage to a country the size of the UK and you may have a situation comparable to that described for the US in the book. For a continental Superpower with a highly developed infastructure you would have to multiply the damage by at least a factor of 10.Another thing never quite explained is how, in a world where the empire is still unravelling (Idi Amin in Uganda gets a mention) Britain has managed to get itself in a position of such economic and military strength that it can not only provide a huge relief effort to the US but also threaten it militarily (while still buying C-130 transport planes from it), especially under a Ted Heath government - he would have been too busy trying to join the Franco-German alliance !There are other things; the US abandonment of the Pacific (how does Britain hang onto Hong Kong ?), or the angst that British troops feel at the prospect of wresting the last Nukes in the world from the grip of General Curtis (why ! ), but lastly, I afraid I have to say the British characters are absurd caricatures. Joan Collins and Stephanie Beecham were obviously wasting their talents in all those episodes of Dynasty. Have you people learnt nothing from Hugh Grant &amp; Austin Powers ?Seriously, for those of you intrigued by the question, 'What-If ?' you can't do better than to read Harry Turtledoves 'Great War - American Front' series. Starting with 'How Few Remain'."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This novel is an interesting concept, but is done in by a completely predictable climax that you can smell before the book is barely a third over because once again, JFK hagiography must ultimately rule the day. All one has to do is substitute the name of Curtis LeMay for the novel's &quot;Ramsay Curtis&quot; and you know right away how things have to turn out. I have seen this cliche hashed out time and again in other alternate history novels like &quot;Promises Kept&quot; in which no one can ever point to any flaw in the leadership of JFK, or that he would have been the savior of America and never done any wrong, and the end result is still utterly banal and predictable."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I found it ironic that this book dealt with a scenario which &quot;might have been&quot;, because that was exactly my feeling when I finished the book. While I didn't detest Resurrection Day, I was left disappointed that the book's potential that was never realized.This unfulfilled feeling extended to all parts of the book. The characters, while adequate, were never developed to the point of being memorable. The dialogue, while not entirely detracting from the book, also didn't give the reader anything worth remembering. Finally, the narrative itself suffered from that most dreaded of maladies: the tidy ending. For instance, the &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; of the story got a great deal of buildup, but then was barely mentioned at the end. I had imagined a lot of possibilities for that aspect of the story. Instead, it got just a few sentences in the last chapter. Other facets of the story suffered a similar fate. A more thorough development of the narrative would have resulted in a more memorable book.Some of the hype would have one believe that Resurrection Day is as good as Fatherland by Robert Harris. I'd actually put it on a level with Harris' Archangel. Both are stories that have great premises, but are not developed to a level that sufficiently explores those premises. As with Archangel, Resurrection Day is not a bad book. However, the promise does not equal the actual product. Consequently, the result is a book that is instantly forgettable after one finishes it."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Fairly decent &quot;junk&quot; reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I have read all of Brendan Dubois' novels and over half of his short stories. He is an intriguing writer, but nowhere better than in Resurrection Day. It still makes mecringe to think how close we came to mass destruction during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Dubois sets the stage for that era- 1962- very well and what results is a page-turner that won't let you get up. Very high on the list of alternate history stories."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"When I first started reading Resurrection Day I was afraid that it was just another thriller, just that it was set in an alternate reality, like Fatherland, but the truth be told, its so much more. In this alternate reality the Cuban Misssle Crisis escalated past demands and threats and into a full out nuclear war, leaving the Soviet Union utterly decimated and the USA better off, but only slightly so. Our hero is a former Green Beret turned reporter, and our heroine is a reporter for the London Times turned MI6 spy. So 1962 was the year for the nuclear war, Vietnam never escalates into a war, protestors never have a chance to start in with that, but the draft is still in effect and thousands of soldiers are drafted and sent to zones infected with radiation. So protestors still take on the draft. The people of the United States still learn to distrust their gov't. during this tumoltuous time period just as it happened in our own reality. Our country still looses its innocence during the same time period as it happened in our own. Though I read a lot of alternate history, this one got me to thinking about alternate realities in a much more philosophical way. Sure there may very well be other realities out there where the Nazis won WWII, or the South won the Civil War, or where oranges evolved into the dominate species, or they may be just as boring as your desk sits 2 inches over to the right from where it currently is. But with all that out of the way, this book was very believable, I could see everything invisioned in the pages of this novel, and could have lived there myself, it seemed that well thought out and imagined.-SPOILER WARNING- Do Not Read Past This PointOne thing that I liked and disliked at the same time was the charactor of General \\"The Rammer\\" Curtis, notice the similarities between this man and the charactor of General \\"Hooker\\" from Dr. Strangelove. Both are cigar chomping men who are looking to start a nuclear war.What bothered me about this? Well mainly its that I'd have thought DuBois could have developed something on his own, rather than such an obvious copy of a classic movie character. And I liked it, because I recognized the homage paid to Stanley Kubrick."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. The plot is great, although flawed on occasion. However it will keep you thinking well after the book. The prose is a little static and the flow seems to be missing. It certainly has a &quot;new-author-first-book-with-potential&quot; feel to it. In fact the writing reminded me of those readers digest recommended thrillers or westerns you'd get at your grandparents house. I feel a better editor might have raised this to a great novel rather than a good read.Despite the above criticism, I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone with a love of conspiracy theory or wanting a light read with a fascinating storyline. I gave this to my significant other who is not much of a reader, and he was wowed by it. I have also lent it to other men as it has a &quot;blokey feel&quot; to it.

It captures all of the realism, all of the personality, all of the feeling that you are actually living in this alternate history after the Cuban Missile crisis led to WWIII. Except for a few parts, Resurrection Day always focused on the main character and went in depth to his experience of WWIII in such a way as if you were getting to know him for the first time, learning bits and pieces here and there. It also threw in notable figures of &quot;our&quot; history in situations they could have possibly been involved if this war had actually occured.I recommend highly that you read this book. I plan on reading it again sometime."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Unfolding layers of intrique in this novel grip the reader. Those of us who lived through the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 hesitate to consider what could have happened if one world leader hadn't blinked; a full-blown nuclear holocaust between the two biggest world powers.Brendan DuBois brings that terrifying possibility to life with marvelously drawn three-dimensional characters in a devastated but functioning country still struggling under martial law 10 years later. There are no winners in this war. Gov. George Romney is now the American president, but the real power is with the military. The new frontier is dead, virtually as well as figuratively. England is now sending Bundles to USA. World economy is shattered and post war recovery agonizingly slow. Major cities including Washington and New York remain in shambles from nuclear blasts a decade before. They are restricted and under military guard.The reader visits those cities as he/she follows lead character, Boston Globe reporter Carl Landry, through a labyrinth of dark events, precipitated by what appears to be a routine murder of an old man in East Boston. Landry's discoveries are hard won but each pixel of the puzzle draws a darker cloud after him that keeps him moving and fast.....with Sandy Price, fellow reporter with the London Times in this country on special assignment. He learns quickly his enemy has weapons he does not and at stake is a very important truth the world needs to know.The momentum is constant and the characters are original. No Ian Fleming influence here. Landry is hard-hitting when necessary but humorously self effacing. He is a high-principled journalist with a dogged commitment to truth. He mourns the loss of his parents to the war. He was safely tucked away in Saigon in the regular army when the buttons were pushed.\\"Resurrection Day\\" is for both men and women. The book is full of the unexpected, just when the reader thinks he understands what's unfolding.DuBois researched his history well and the fiction he made of it projects insight into many examples of human folly."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"A very scary what if scenario. The characters are very well developed and the descriptions are awesome. I'm very glad that the Cuban Missle Crisis ended the way it really did and not the way described in this book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Ten years have passed since the Cuban Missile Crisis turned into an atomic war between the United States and the Soviet Union. For the past decade, martial law with media censorship rules America. The British provide aid to the struggling country. The Soviet Union is a vast wasteland as they did not come close to matching fire power with the USA.Boston Globe reporter Carl Landry investigates the murder of a veteran Merl Sawson. Carl's interest started a month before someone shot Merl in the head. Hinting at a conspiracy in '62, the vet approached the journalist asking for help. When Major Devane deletes Carl's innocuous article from publication, the reporter begins to question the system. He soon meets London Times reporter Sandra Price at an English Consul reception. Her inquisitiveness encourages Carl to investigate Merl and his theories even if it places both of them in harms way from two governments who want the truth left out there.RESURRECTION DAY is a superb what if tale centered on the decade following an exchange of atomic bombs during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The alternate history story line works extremely well as real persona from the seventies make appearances that seem genuine. The suspense never eases up as the audience becomes fascinated with the roles of Rockefeller, McGovern, and Reagen, etc. while fully rooting for Carl to expose a not so disguised General Curtis.

For my 2 cents worth, I would also add that the &quot;love&quot; interest is surprisingly underdeveloped. The two characters have sex a couple of times and eventually declare their love for each other but there appears to be no real connection between them (modern love....?)But my biggest gripe is the complete abscense of thrills in what is supposedly a novel of the thriller genre. Where is the tension? Where is the edge-of-your-seat quality which forces you to keep reading to the wee small hours.I found this novel easy to put down (and admittedly easy to pick up), which is a shame because the premise was an excellent one. It was just so mundanely executed. You never felt that the characters were in any real danger (moral or otherwise) or that it really matters what happens in the end anyway.The ending was a bit pat as well. If it was really that easy to publish the story (locking the censor in the storeroom indeed!) then why hadn't the press done it before.And one more thing.... Where were all the women? I know it was the 70's and after a nuclear war, but the only female with a serious speaking part was the supposed love interest. Even Tom Clancy can generally manage better than that....All in all, a dissapointing effort."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Yes, the writing is poor, and there is little character development. The mood and setting are not well developed either, but the big problem is the economic and political geography. America with the minimal damage outlined in the book would not have been in as bad an economic or political state as presented. Other than one major city, New York, the country is presented as largely undamaged. Perhaps Mr. DuBois needs to travel and see how truely large the U.S. is, and the incredible resouces in people, land and industry it holds. I remember 1972, and a rich America beyond New York. Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, Detroit, Milwakee, Indianapolis,Cleveland, Columbus, Cinncinati, Buffalo and Pittsburgh to name a few world class cities flourished then and now andunless the book is revised and all major cities in the USA are eliminated as well as all State Capitols and secondary cities, then the premise simply does not work."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I have a collection of over 6,000 books,and I have to say that this book is the best book I've read in ten years!It is absolutely riveting.Be prepared to read it one go,you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I really can't say enough good things about this book. It takes as it's foundation an immensely believable historical event (the Cuban Missile Crisis goes bad) and runs with it.Two things that really jump out about this book are it's accuracy and how well the story keeps moving. In regards to the first point, most people don't realize how badly outgunned the Soviets were in 1962, but Dubois' firm grasp of history assures that the shakedown in the balance of power reflects accurately the military-political realities of the time. As for the second point, many alternate histories spend a great deal of time talking about whatever event makes it an alternate history. Not so in &quot;Ressurection Day&quot;; any alternate information the reader needs to know is smoothly unveiled in the context of the plot, which keeps the book moving along at a great clip.Finally, this book, while immensely entertaining, is also historically rigorous enough to prove the merit of counterfactuals as a valid means of examining history. I can only hope that Dubois will continue to write alternate history with the same mastery he displayed in this book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Resurrection Day is a multi-theme, multi-plot novel that is complex but easy to follow.

Fantastic and so close to what could have happened its scary."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Resurrection Day details an America that is shattered after having won WWIII at enormous cost. The problems immediately at hand have been mentioned, but here they are again:1) According to the book, New York City, Washington DC, Miami, and San Diego were total losses. While this would doubtless be a heavy loss, it would not relegate America to the status of a second-class power. There are just too many cities and too many resources that would be there to take up the slack. Germany and Japan, both much smaller countries, sustained damage comparable to that and were thriving ten years after the war. Secondly, while the scheme for San Diego (destroyed by a nuke-armed submarine) is feasible, it's hard to believe they wouldn't have done a better job of protecting New York.2) Britain's scheme for being a major world power is a bit hard to believe -- by 1962, most of the former British Empire was independent. I doubt, for example, that reasonably peaceful Canadians would welcome a huge British military presence with no real enemy in sight (the USSR was removed from the map in the 1962 war, and America was too debilitated to be any real threat to the Canadians -- and let's face it, the last time Americans and Canadians fought was 150 years prior to the story taking place.) Who are the British there to protect them from, the Eskimos?3) The book rips off entire scenes and premises from the far better and more cogently written 'Fatherland'. The semi-hostile superior officer reviewing the hero's record, for example. The 'lost people' the hero is searching for (the Weisses in Fatherland, Sarah Landry in this one.) The hero's attitude of being a good cop / reporter while being enough of a freethinker to disapprove of the totalitarian government under which he lives.If you like what-if stories, this is a good one, but not a great one."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is one of the better books of Alternate History. It kept you guessing to the end. It reads like a John Grisham novel. The only flaw I found it doesn't go into what the rest of nation is like only breif glimpases, what about states that weren't touched by the bomb such as Ohio or Iowa??"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is an extremely important part of World history which has really been ignored. &quot;What if&quot; the crisis turned out differently and war broke out? Did we have such an advantage over the USSR? Would our alies have sat back and watched? Who would the world powers have been in the aftermath? I think it would have been better to describe actually what occured in '62 and explain in the alternate history version what went wrong. The author could have done this when the hero went to NYC - maybe he could have run into someone that could explain in more detail why things turned out the way they did. This could have been a great chance to explore exactly what went right, what JFK and others did that helped avoid a war. In reading this book you get the real impression that it was simply the toss of a coin that made the difference between war and peace. I'm not a big JFK fan but from what I know of how the crisis was handled, this was one of his brightest moments. The turncoat girlfriend was also predictable and goofy.P.S. For a good &quot;alternate history&quot; novel on the Civil War - check out &quot;Guns of the South&quot;."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"The location and activities of the early sixties in the book were like looking in the mirror of the past.

Those of us who lived through the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 hesitate to consider what could have happened if one world leader hadn't blinked; a full-blown nuclear holocaust between the two biggest world powers was ready and waiting.Brendan DuBois brings that terrifying possibility to life with marvelously drawn three-dimensional characters in a devastated but functioning country still struggling under martial law 10 years later. There are no winners in this war. Gov. George Romney is now the American president, but the real power is with the military. The new frontier is dead, virtually as well as figuratively. England is now sending Bundles to USA. World economy is shattered and post war recovery agonizingly slow. Major cities including Washington and New York remain in shambles from nuclear blasts a decade before. They are restricted and under military guard.The reader visits those cities as he/she follows lead character, Boston Globe reporter Carl Landry, through a maze of dark events, precipitated by what appears to be a routine murder of an old man in East Boston. Landry's discoveries are hard won but each pixel of the puzzle draws a darker cloud after him that keeps him moving and fast.....with Sandy Price, fellow London Times reporter in this country on special assignment. He learns quickly his enemy has weapons he does not and at stake is a very important truth the world needs to know.The momentum is consistant,the characters are original. No Ian Fleming influence here. Landry is hard-hitting when necessary but humorously self effacing. He is a high-principled journalist with a dogged commitment to truth. He mourns the loss of his parents to the war. He was safely tucked away in Saigon in the regular army when the buttons were pushed. \\"Resurrection Day\\" is for both men and women. The book is full of the unexpected, just when the reader thinks he understands what's unfolding.DuBois researched his history well and the fiction he made of it projects insight into many examples of human folly."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Ressurection day , is a book that will grab your attention and keep you going untill the end of the book , and will keep you gusseing , what if....."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Resurrection Day is one of those books that you can't put down once you've started in on it.

A couple of quibbles- the dialog with his English sweetie was corny and too cutesie, and yes, there were times when it bogged down in some irrelevant detail. At times I found myself thinking \\"OK, got it, let's move on.\\"Another thing I really liked was how he wove in just enough examples of what really would have/did happen that it avoided becoming too wildly implausible, like so many other alternate history novels where we find ourselves thinking \\"Yeah right, that is SO not going to happen...\\""},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is an 'alternate-universe' look at the Cuban Missile Crisis - what went wrong, and what price America paid for the mistakes!BUT the message here is as CURRENT as today's newpapers - rioting in Africa, strife in Iran.

However, the unrelenting political thrust of the novel, given life by the sensitive / tough-guy / ex-army protagonist, becomes very quickly annoying.

In this book, the Kennedys lost, and so did America and Russia. As Michael Dobbs noted in his 2008 \\"One Minute to Midnight\\", our plans for the invasion of Cuba were blissfully ignorant of the eighty cruise missiles with Hiroshima-size atomic warheads aimed at Guantanamo Naval Base and the beachheads.One Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War (Vintage)When I was stationed there, the fourth-level alert siren would have signalled \\"Man the Final Defense Line\\", but if those crude Frog missiles had launched, the Final Defense Line would have been wherever you were standing when toasted.

I happened to grab it off our shared bookshelf at work when I had nothing else to read one day at lunch. I could hardly put it down. I was mesmerized by the imagined post-nuclear world that Dubois describes. It's a book I might have found fantastical prior to this last year post Sept. 11. But having watched our government seize more and more control, I think the portrait the author paints is extremely believable and truly terrifying. The story line was entertaining, but I was far more interested in the descriptions of everyday life, the thoughts of survivors, the crush of civil liberties and all else that would (inevitably?) follow in the months and years after nuclear war. I intend to buy this book for some of my good friends and highly recommend it to others. I hope the publisher decides to re-issue it. It was published in 1999, but that's another world ago since Sept. 11, 2001, and I think there'd be a huge market for it given the right promotional campaign. It would also be one heck of a movie."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Perhaps &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; by Brendan Dubois would have been a more intriguing read had the story taken place directly after the missiles started falling on America and Russia; rather than ten years after the fact. The story itself is fairly crafted, but there's very little actual thrill to any of it.The greatest nation on the face on the planet reduced to less than second world status? Highly improbable. The strategic retaliations that Mr. Dubois proposes are somewhat far fetched. I would think that the entire European community would have been brought into the war in 1962 had the events unfolded as the story would have you believe.Carl Landry is a so-so protagonist. He has mixed emotions over both aspects of his life. Which is he truly? A former army sergeant or a Boston newspaper reporter? Mr. Landry himself doesn't seem to know. He can't have it both ways. Several times throughout the novel he detests the work he's done for his country, and equally loathes being called a &quot;quota baby&quot;. It's either one or the other, Mr. Landry.Hot zones, relief-aid from Great Britain, decon camps, poor electricity and food shortages. All are very possible, but a decade after the war? Yet more improbabilities. America's farmland was providing for quite a bit of the world and then some at that time. So, why wouldn't they have done so for their own countrymen? According to Mr. Dubois, none of the Midwest states were even touched. It's details like this that made portions of the story tepid.The supporting cast is lightweight and all too common in these sorts of novels. Suspicious editors and co-workers, homeless veterans with more knowledge of what actually happened during the war than most citizens, and British consulate workers and military-types with nefarious plans all their own.As far as &quot;what-if&quot; novels go, it's not too bad. Some of the inner-storylines could have been re-worked or removed altogether. It's a very light read for those people interested in a filler novel before your next big read."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Alternate history enthusiasts familiar with &quot;Fatherland&quot; will be delighted to get their hands on this romp through the post-World War III United States, devastated emotionally to a much greater degree than physically. For those who like fast, easy reads, a warning: you will have to slosh through some more or less tedious preliminary scenes that are nevertheless essential for the overall plot setup before you get to the fast-paced, page-turning stuff in the second part of the story. Personally, however, I've enjoyed the &quot;preliminaries&quot; as much, if not more, than the thrilling unwinding of the plot and a breathtaking, head-spinning ending. A very old adage came into my head reading about media censorship, peaceful demonstrations broken up violently and without provocation, work camps, orphan street gangs, and more: In conquering, we become the conquered. In the world where the largest communist power is covered with radioactive sludge, its worst traits - civil rights and freedoms infringement - are continued by those who seemingly fought to eliminate them. It is very appropriate that the main protagonist of the book is a reporter - defender of the First Amendment, representative of the most cherished freedom in America, which is the freedom of speech and expression. Despite an optimistic ending, &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; once again stresses the point that there can be no winners in the nuclear war, even if the survivors remain."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Having just read &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;, I thought i'd share briefly my opinions, which are mostly favorable. On the whole it makes for an entertaining book, using a a cross-pollenation of genres and sub-genres, beginning as murder myster set in an America 10 years after the Cubam Missle Crisis became a nuclear Cuban War, which crippled the US and annhilated the USSR. It then procedes to turn into a political thriller, as our hero, Boston Globe reporter Carl Landry, delved deeper into the murdered vet and finds all manner of intrigue and danger involving the US and UK governments, military personel, and the truth about what happened in 1962. Elements of post-apocalypse sc-fi also are present in visits to a bombed Manahattan populated by gangs and people fighting for survival. And there is even the dystopic element, represented by a US under ten years of marshal law.Carl Landry makes for an interesting and mostly sympathetic hero, and the world Brendan DuBois has created is on the whole plausible. Certainly, it does become predictable about page 300; I had pretty well figured out the whole murder mystery by then. And there is a certain whistful nostalgia about the nobility of JFK, and a very cynical view of Curits LeMay (renamed here as Ramsey Curtis) which seem a little simplistic, but it makes for overall an entertaining yarn, particularly for AH-addicts who might need a quick fix."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"What would America be like if the Cuban Missile Crisis had heated up? Brendan DuBois asks this question in Resurrection Day and the answers are frightening. The protagonist is Carl Landry, an Army vet who now works as a reporter for the Boston Globe. Like many other people in this post apocalyptic America Landry just goes through the motions of living, marching on as his life descends into a grey twilight in an American police state. It is only after a military censor spikes one of his stories, a seemingly innocuous one about the murder of a fellow veteran, that Landry begins to ask questions. Who was Merl Sawson? What was the significance of the list of names that he gave Landry in an earlier meeting and why is the military so concerned with his death? Landry begins to ask these questions and the answers lead him to bombed out Manhattan, the remains of Hyannisport, destroyed by anti-Kennedy mobs and into a liaason with a reporter from the London Times who is not all that she seems.All in all this is an excellent book, more plausible than Robert Harris's Fatherland as this really could have happened and almost did."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Resurrection Day was a very good read. The title gives you the impression that the book may have a religious theme. It's an alternative history novel. Very good, but I think readers of a certain age, meaning readers who are old enough to have lived through the Cuban Missle Crisis will find it more interesting than say someone who has only read about the event or seen movie about the subject. I think the greatest compliment I can give the author is the fact that the read was so good I did not rush through the book, I lingered over this book because it was such an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I like alt history very much. I got burnt out on Turtledove (as many of us have) This story is fresh enough, nearly beleiveable (the 2 russians pilots was too much for me) Better than Fatherland (by a little) nearly as good as How Few Remain. The best thing about R Day is the fresh subject, the Cuban Missle Crissis. Unlike WW2 or USA Civil War, Cuban missle crissis is fresh. I hope Dubois tries his hand at alt history again"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"One of the best alternate history books I've ever read, quite frankly. It sits up on my shelf up next to \\"Fatherland\\". While there may have been a few weak points (the motivation behind the US Government inviting British troops in to do its own dirty workreally was not expressed that strongly, or convincingly) the world DuBois paints is strong enough to sweep you along with the narrative, so weak points are easily forgiven and accepted.Perhaps if I had read this book pre-9/11 I would not have been struck quite so strongly by it: but as is, reading it now as our own government considers having its own citizens inform on each other, and fearful of civil liberties being trampled in the name of security...it chills the blood, to see in fiction, where such actions could lead. Highly reccommended, this book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"So you've never been attracted to historical fiction. Me neither. But don't miss this fabulously entertaining read!If you want to disappear into a story and get totally immersed in another world, you'll love this book. While the story works well as a thriller, it is so unlike anything else out there, you'll find it as refreshing as fascinating.The alternate history is told so plausibly, you will get caught up in the post-nuclear world that has relegated America to third rate status. As a result, you'll find yourself putting the book down, looking around and truly appreciating the freedom and wealth we enjoy in America, as well as recognizing the fragility of our largesse.For quality escapist reading, I highly recommend &quot;Resurrection Day.&quot; Now duck and cover!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Except for &quot;Fatherland&quot; and other isolated examples, alternative history novels are usually, and strangly, short on originality. However, Resurrection Day, is not only an example of originality but also very good writing that kept me reading until the end.

I usually judge writing on whether or not a book keeps drawing me back to finish it, and this one passes the test with flying colors. Makes me want to try Harry Turtledove, if I could only get past those goofball covers. Bad points: Seemed like the author couldn't make up his mind whether to have the American characters talk with British accents or not. A newspaper photographer named &quot;The Beast&quot;.

I was one of millions of very scared pre-adolescents during the Cuban missle crisis. Much of the well researched &quot;alternative history&quot; seemed all too plausible back then, especially to folks such as myself who lived near ground zero of a major SAC base.True, the plot of the book (and ultimate conclusion) was a bit predictable, and some of the characterizations were extremely one dimensional - but for light summer reading, you can't beat this novel.And here's the best endorsement I can give &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;: I look forward to the author's next effort."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is one of the rare Alternate History Novels that is written like Mainstream Fiction instead of Sci-Fi. Although it is predictable, it is a fun, well written novel. Some of the possibilities that the author uses are pretty scary. The book also shows just how easy it would have been for the Cuban Missle Crisis to escalate into a war, and makes you think about how stupid it is to threaten world wide destruction over a few ideolodgical differences. There are a few corny parts with the Ronald Reagan Variety Hour and a certin Public figure leading a different civil rights march. Other than that a very entertaing read for a plane ride and stuff like that."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I've just read a surprisingly good novel by Brendan Dubois titled RESURECTION DAY (Putnam). Just came out and is in hard cover.Surprisingly, because it's an alternate history book. The clue that it might be good is that though the novel is classifiable as science fiction it is not. (Publishers have always been reluctant to class a &quot;good&quot; novel as SCI-FI.)The time break in the novel is the Cuban Missile Crises. (I was in the USAF as a cryptographer at that time and remember how close we came to a blow up.) In Dubois' vision the situation does esclate into a nuclear exchange which results in the destruction of Russia and pushes it back to something resembling the Middle Ages, destroys Cuba, NYC, and Washington, D.C. and the Kennedy's. The fallout hits Europe and the US quite hard. America is no longer a major power and is being being bolstered by England. The writing is quite good. We are lead to the destruction and the effects quite subtly.The country is under the control of the military, but the depth of the control and the condition of the country sneak up on the reader.Is Kennedy really dead? What is England really up to?Here's a solid novel for summer reading. You can put it done with ease...that will give you the time to ponder. Rest assurred you will return to RESURECTION DAY.&quot;Amazing isn't it, how wars and empires can change because of a few incidents over the course of a single day. After Lexington and Concord, what happened. All stemming from that park and this bridge.&quot;&quot;That's true of all wars,&quot; he said. One Cuban dictator and one ambitious American president and one scared Russian premier later, look where we are.&quot;"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This was a rather interesting book but it had a few points that really spoiled it for me. For example, author portrays most of US military as ashamed of what they did to Russia during the war. What does he thinks US should have done? Invite russians for tea while they nuke united states to kingdom come?Of course, he portrays JFK as a hero that tried to stop the war unstead of philandering weasel that he really was. For the life of me I can't understand why anybody would think that he was a good president let alone a hero of any kind.Then, we have the rogue general that gives the command to use nuclear weapons agaist Russia agaist JFK's orders. So predictable. Also, author thinks that Canada actually has a military(in a name only). What planet is he from?Despite all my complaints, I think this is worth a read but only if you don't pay attention to his antiwar rantings."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"An interesting &quot;what if&quot; novel dealing with the cuban missel crisis, what if things had turned out differently and the soviet union and the u.s. went to war. At least that is the premise of the novel, it's setting.What the story really is is part love story, part espionage story. Dubois keeps the story moving with various turns in the plot and some interesting background story as to what it is like in this alternate world. He creates likeable, believable characters. It's good for some light reading."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I got this book from the local library and read it in one sitting. Having read &quot;Fatherland&quot; a few months ago I though the idea of a post nuclear holocaust US very intriguing.

The author is quite knowledgeable about 1960's military capabilities. If you are not a progressive, be prepared to suspend disbelief on economics and the military mindset. The author is talented enough that if you can overlook his bias, the book is still quite good. One of the better stories I've read in a while. I have given it 4 stars only because I believe the author could have abstained from interjecting his political views. They are not overly intrusive but do not add to the story. I will read other works by this author and I am a conservative."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Read it! I must have read this 5 times. The research that went into this alone is worth it. Great read, totally recommend....."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is an interesting book and worth the read. Start with the premise that the Cuban Missile Crisis develops into the Cuban War and results in a nuclear exchange. Because the U.S. has a superior nuclear arsenal in 1962, the U.S.S.R. is destroyed. The U.S. does not come out unscathed - New York, Washington, San Diego and Omaha, among others, are hit by Soviet atomic bombs. That is the backdrop for the murder of an old veteran and an investigation of the murder by a Boston Globe reporter in 1972. The reporter is an army veteran working in a society in which the concept of a &quot;free press&quot; died in 1962. His investigation begins to shed new light on the events which lead up to the war. The plot is intriguing. However, the writing is uneven. It could have benefitted from one more swipe of the editor's pen. While the book is worth reading by fans of &quot;what if&quot; stories, this may be one case where the movie could be better than the book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"The escalation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis into a brief, one-sided nuclear war is the founding premise of this noirish alternate-history, which adopts elements of both Philip K. Dick's &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; and Whitley Streiber's &quot;Warday&quot; into its own slightly-weird liberal parable. The ghoulish entertainment includes an unguided tour of a radiated Manhattan ghost town (inhabited by subterranean Democrats) as well as glimpses of a stagnant post-war milieu governed by the fussy military censors of a thinly-disguised Gen. Curtis LeMay."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Whether or not you are old enough to remember the Cuban Missle Crises or not you must read this book. I was 17 years old and 4 months pregnate with my first child and I remember watching the news and crying, wondering if I would live long enoigh to deliver it. Living on one of the largest basic training forts the Army had we knew that Ft. Leonard Wood was on the top 15 target list if it happened. JFK got us thorough that and that alone makes him a hero in my eyes. This book catches the exact feelings of terror and thankfulness we all felt that few days when the fate of the world hung in the balance. If you never read another book read this one."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is a good alternative history novel. The premise is that the Cuban Missile Crisis resulted in a nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union. This is hardly implausible. The Soviets had activated nuclear armed missiles in Cuba under the control of the local Soviet commander. A misstep and war could have been the result. Dubois then proceeds to a well plotted thriller which cleverly uses elements of the real history of the 1960s and early 70s as a guide. There are clear analogies withe the anti-war movement, the Pentagon Papers case, The Franco-German alliance, etc. This is generally done well and written competently.As pointed out by a prior reviwer (SM Stirling; himself a well known writer of alternative history), Bubois' mistake is to leave the USA severely damaged, Europe unscathed, and the Soviet Union devastated. The latter would certainly have occurred. But Western Europe, home of NATO, would have been severely damaged, and the USA would have escaped with some, but hardly overwhelming damage. The USA would still be the world's major power and probably still a successful democracy."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"During my vacation, I picked up a novel by Brendan DuBois called Resurrection Day. An interesting bit of alternative history that could have been better than it was...The book is set in 1972, 10 years after a thermonuclear exchange that wiped out Russia and left America dependent on the aid of others. This all happened because of the Cuban missile crisis. The US invaded Cuba, Cuba used tactical nukes, and the US treated that as an attack by Russia. Most of the government was killed in the attack, and plenty of areas are still off-limits (like New York City). Carl Landry is a reporter for the Boston Globe, and he's been contacted by someone who has documentation that shows what *really* happened during that time. But before Landry can get the papers, the source is mysteriously killed. Landry then becomes the focus of a number of groups who want to know what the source had, and they all think that Landry either has the inside track or possesses the papers. When he discovers a thriving underground culture of people living in New York (who the government says don't exist), he has to figure out who to trust in order to prevent an impending invasion of the US by foreign powers.The book has an interesting premise, and on that point it's not a bad read. It's also a long paperback (580+ pages), and I think that's where it breaks down. I think this book could have been done very well in about 350 pages. As it is, there seems to be a lot of ground that's covered repeatedly without advancing the story as quickly as it could be.If you're into alternative history, you'll probably like the book.

Anyone who is a history buff will; being a teacher, the part about the NYC ophans and how their teachers spent the hours of a nuclear attack really got to me. Some of the other reviews here ranted about the military caricatures, but if you really know your history, the hawks were really there. It seems improbable now, but times were different then. Don't listen to all the critics, get and read this book. it's excellent!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Brendan DuBois certainly had an opportunity to create a gripping AND original piece. While he did admirably enough on the former, he failed miserably on the latter. Yes, &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; is an engrossing read, a thriller, that takes an alternate view of what could have happened in world history in 1962. As such, it is deserving of 3 stars (tho' DuBois could have been a little more careful on some of his facts, but then again, it is fiction). However, and this is SO typical of SO many baby-boomer types, writers or not, the almost unnatural affection for anything and everything Kennedy was palpable. Gee, Brendan, what an original concept; a Kennedy as a national (indeed, world) savior, one who could have done SO much, if only the evil military and Republicans hadn't ruined it all for all of us. How trite. And not to ruin the story for anyone, but it CERTAINLY stretches credulity to find that it is the Republican candidate for President (in this case, Rockefeller) who is in thrall to those who wish to subjugate US autonomy, and deny individual rights, and it is that brave defender of freedom and limited government, George McGovern, who would be the savior of the Republic. So very trite. this novel was a wonderful concept, Brendan- next time, try to make it a little more realistic, by leaving your politics aside. The 60's,and the &quot;New Frontier&quot; are long gone- get over it."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This novel was more successful as suspense than as effective alternative history.As an investigative thriller, it had its moments and kept my interest. As an alternative history, however, it was fairly weak. There is so much gratuitous Kennedy worship and obvious, ham-handed left-liberal propaganda (evil Republican dictators, the saintly George McGovern, how wonderful we would all be if we just gave control over everything to the UN, etc.) that plausible implications of the counterfactual got lost. Even the big secret of the book is essentially an anti-anti-Communist fantasy/nightmare. This book does not compare to Fatherland or SS-GB, which work on both levels.Still, despite its flaws, it was a good, engaging read which I enjoyed. This should not be the first alternative history you read, but is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"\\"Resurrection Day\\" is a mystery novel set in America a decade or so after the nuclear war resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The real mystery however is how one man wrote a book that starts so well and goes so wrong. Opening with a flourish of details about the now shattered and crippled US of A so perfectly nuanced in their detailing of the fried and irradiated nation that one can't possibly fault the dated attempts to write Anglo-dialog for its british characters or how blatantly the author rips off from the far superior \\"Fatherland\\". In RD, far from backing down from the brink of nuclear warfare, the Yanks and Ruskies went toe-to-toe. Though details are scarce, eveyrbody seems to blame the now assumed dead JFK. (Imagine a world in which Dallas, 1963 never happened? No disco, no bell-bottoms or mood rocks? About the only history left pristine was the collapse of South Vietnam). Though scarred by the war, America is its victor - with Russia bombed back to Tsars. The only real winners were the Europeans who somehow managed to avoid being dragged into the war or at leats catch some of its heat. Still armed with nukes, the US's situation approximates that of the former USSR - were too poor to survive, but too powerful to be left for dead. We're also an embarrasing joke for the rest of the world: even foreigners profiting at America's expense silently pine for the great USA of old. Though the war as described here was actually quite limited, Dubois describes an America in a state of collapse, with whole territories considered lawless zones, and martial law becomes the rule. All newspapers are subject to military censorship and, for good order, are staffed with army vets - guys not prone to buck the system. Though it's business as usual a decade later, the author throws in a plot of something brewing: the murder of a visiting Brit who may be on a secret mission; the dissappearance of a vagrant who may have been on JFK's honor guard; the heralded re-opening of Manhattan Island (left sealed off and supposedly deserted since 1962); more secret machinations from the British and also those of the powerful General \\"Rammer\\" Ramsay, and hints that the truth of October, 1962 may somehow turn up.Then it goes bad. I'm not sure where, but the author soon takes a turn for the trite. Dubois' hero/Detective is Carl Landry, an ex-soldier who writes government-sanitized news in Boston. Landry's job seems guaranteed to engender in Landry an evolved acumen for investigation, primed to turn the soldier into a true detective. Instead, Landry becomes less an active investigator than a poor shmo powerless to ignore the steady stream of conspiracy theories that come his way. Dubois gives his hero no sense of disbelief and therefore deprives the reader of any sense of surprise. Dubois's JFK never rises above being the same product of the Camelot myth - eventually enjoying a sort of fulsome praise that undermines this novel as an objective mystery. By the same token, General Ramsay never becomes more than an uninspired fictionalized version of General Curtis LeMay, the hawkish USAF Chief of 1962. Though popular, the General is the object of suspicion that Dubois practically telegraphs from the moment his character is introduced. (Popular blame for the war falls squarely on JFK and his circle; but the sentiment seems forced, making it obvious that conventional wisdom is in for a painful reasessment). Though billed as a mystery-alternate history in the \\"Fatherland\\" mold, Dubois never ties in the disparate elements of his story to the alternate history as Harris had in that other novel. There are none of the historically ironic moments of \\"Fatherland\\" (my favorite being a murder victim whose criminal history amounts to a disturbance at a beer hall in 1922). Dubois spends so much time crafting his alternate history to match \\"Fatherland\\" he almost completely forgets the deft connection between the mystery and the history and the historical figures who live through both. Few of the characters are developed beyond being foils for Landry, and some details are painfully wrong - when Landry and his british lover meet and relive the story of WWIII, despite the hardships of daily life in post-war America coupled with censorship appropriate to a police state, Landry is actually better informed on the subject than she is. Also, unlike Dubois, Harris used real figures taken out of their historical context (one of whom, strangely enough, is an altogether different President named Kennedy, and not one anybody will be comparing to King Arthur).It is in its climax that \\"Day\\" compares least favorably with \\"Fatherland\\". The latter of the two books has no happy ending, only the willingness to look the Holocaust square in the face. In comparison, by the end of \\"Day\\" the main charachters pal around, pat each other on the back and congratulate themselves for successfully re-writing history, i could almost hear the laugh track and the strains to the MASH theme. A major botch - nuke this book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"If you're old enough to remember the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, then your attention may be captured by RESURRECTION DAY, an exercise in alternative history. Within its pages, it's 1972, and the United States is still convalescing from a military invasion of Cuba ten years earlier that had resulted in several of America's cities being nuked to oblivion by Soviet warheads, including Washington, DC, and the First Family of Camelot. In retaliation, SAC had bombed the USSR back into the nuclear Dark Ages, an act for which the US is regarded almost as a pariah state. It's only apparent friend is Great Britain, which continues to send food and aid to America's struggling populace, otherwise governed by a weak civilian administration dominated by the military and a shadowy, retired Air Force general. The protagonist of this fairy tale is Carl Landry, an ex-Army sergeant now working as a reporter for Boston's major newspaper. While covering the murder of an aged vet of the Kennedy era, Landry stumbles onto the trail of yet another guv'mint conspiracy, this one with a decidedly British accent.This potboiler hardly simmers through its first half. It's only when Carl and his English gal pal, Sandy, a reporter for the London Times, are chased through the ostensibly uninhabited city of New York by military thugs that the plot heats up beyond lukewarm. As a matter of fact, the love affair between Carl and Sandy suffers from the same lack of heat. I've seen more passion between two snails. To be fair, some amount of frigid water is thrown on Carl's ardor as he begins to suspect that Sandy is not quite what she purports to be. (A secret agent for the Queen Mum, perhaps. Her mission, to find good Indian take-out.)The biggest problem with this \\"thriller\\" is that the Landry character is painted in such wishy-washy tints. The reader has no idea even what he looks like, much less develop any sympathy for his predicament or root him on to final triumph. He doesn't have an obnoxious drinking buddy, favorite parakeet, nasty chewing tobacco habit, or weakness for cold spaghetti - anything that would flesh out his persona. In any case, as the true nature of the conspiracy is revealed and our marginal hero saves the day, it was hard not to stifle a yawn, or two. Perhaps my drowsiness was a function of the intrigue's level of evil - it wasn't as horrific as usual in most fiction, but just real-life banal. (I mean, the Florida Ballot Chad Machination was more Machiavellian than this.)I grant this novel three stars, not because it's that good, but because the author was well-intentioned and gave a good effort. Towards the end, however, I hastened to finish the book only because I wanted to get on to the next one on my shelf, which I trust will be much better."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Probably one of the best alternate reality books I have read.

The Soviet Union is totally destroyed while the US is severly crippled. The story revolves around a reporter, Carl Landry,who investigates the murder of an old veteran who has information on the true events which occured leading up to the nuclear exchange. What he finds out has vital importance to the upcoming Presidential election and the freedom of the American people. The ideas Brendan Dubois explores such as how the use of \\"emergency powers\\" can lead to governmental opression is interesting, but character development is lacking. This, coupled with a rushed ending makes this book less then what it could have been."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Dubois gets credit for tackling a subject that has not had much alternate history devoted to it -- the Cuban Missile Crisis. Like much alternate history, Resurrection Day has a great setup and a great idea, but the plot itself is strained. It is fascinating to read Dubois's vision of the United States ten years after a limited nuclear war, with President Kennedy maligned as the reason for the nation's collapse. The most original idea is Britain's smug condescension as the U.K. is called upon to offer aid and assistance to the now-impoverished United States."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"If you enjoyed the alternate history novel Fatherland, which imagined a world 20 years after a victorious Nazi Germany in Europe and was made into a good HBO film starring Rutger Hauer, you'll love this book, because it almost actually happened.It is set in 1972 mainly in Boston, 10 years after the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis turned into a short-lived nuclear war that left the United States badly wounded but victorious over a Soviet Union that was completely obliterated back to the Middle Ages and spared most of the world. Washington D.C., San Diego, Omaha, and Miami were destroyed by Soviet missiles, and Manhattan abandoned after suffering a near miss from Soviet long-range bombers crossing over the Artic, which managed to hit Queens and New Jersey with nuclear bombs on October 30, 1962. The United States, now just a Second World country still suffering from gas and food shortages alleviated by aid from the United Kingdom, is still under martial law, controlled by the military and with newspapers under heavy censorship, its capital now in Philadelphia. NATO had disintegrated after the war and the European powers, spared from the nuclear destruction, are plotting to become superpowers again with the UK against the increasingly powerful French-German alliance. While thought to have died in the destruction of Washington, D.C., there are those dissidents who still believe that JFK managed to escape and is still in hiding, his memory maligned as a coward and the greatest mass murderer in history, his aides hunted down and imprisoned or killed by those who wish to rewrite history.In this story, a newspaper reporter from the Boston Globe, investigating the murder of a veteran from the Cuban War with the help of a beautiful reporter from the London Times, uncovers a fiendish plan that will take away what status the United States has left as a sovereign nation and will reveal the truth behind how the Cuban Missile Crisis turned into the Third World War and JFK's fate on October 30, 1962.Needless to say, it is a good, suspenseful tale that blends what is now known about the Cuban Missile Crisis from declassified documents, the White House decisions that averted a nuclear showdown with the USSR, and the state of the world at the time with what might have been had the U.S. gone to war against the Soviet Union instead.

Although I found the national security state concept a little far fetched as there would have been a line of succession in the civilian government. And it could use some grammar checking."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"One thing that ticks me off about after-the-bomb books is weak research on the effects of nuclear weapons, or on operational plans and capacities. This book suffers from that fault, despite good writing and a nice plot.Apparently the &quot;Cuban War&quot; of 1962 results in the US getting hit by something on the order of 10-12 Soviet nukes. This is reasonable, if slightly pessimistic. (My own guess would be something on the order of 6 or 7.) The Soviets simply didn't have many delivery systems which could reach North America.Two things aren't reasonable:First, after losing 3 or 4 cities and a few military bases, the US is shown as still devastated ten years later, with widespread areas dangerously radioactive and the economy only just recovering from a near-total collapse.Not!My father stood in a slit trench 1.8 miles from ground zero during a bomb test in the late 1950's, and he's fine at age 83. Yeah, if you're under the immediate fallout plume from a multimegatonne ground-burst, it's game over. But two weeks later, the same territory is pretty safe; a year later, virtually completely so. Most active isotopes have very short half-lives. There are exceptions (strontium-90, some metal isotopes), but there were scores of above-ground tests, and the increase in the cancer rate nationwide was undetectable without fairly sophisticated statistical analysis.Hiroshima and Nagasaki were reoccupied immediately after the explosions. Generally speaking, ten years after a bomb goes off you can go to ground zero, strip naked, rub the dirt all over your body and eat it with a spoon, and all you'll get is a dirty skin and indigestion.Hence the US, with a largely undamaged infrastructure, would recover quickly. Germany and Japan did, from far worse damage -- they don't call 1945 &quot;The Year Zero&quot; in Germany for nothing, and the damage in Japan was worse. The firestorms in Tokyo and Dresden killed about as many people as nuclear attacks, and did as much physical damage.Second, the USSR did have a very dangerous launch capacity in 1962... only it was aimed at Central and Western Europe, and the book shows those areas getting off scot-free.Not going to happen. Not even remotely possible. The missiles and bombers were set to go and would have launched immediately against European targets when SAC went into action against the USSR. Western Europe was chock-full of USAAF bases, just to start with; and the Soviets planned for a city-busting strategy, as well.They certainly weren't going to let the _Germans_ come through intact, for Christ's sake!As the joke went in the 1950's and early 1960's, the Soviet Union's deterrance capacity could be summed up as: &quot;If you Americans attack Holy Mother Russia, we will nuke the hell out of Germany, France and Britain! Just see if we don't!&quot;Britain, for instance, would have lost at least a dozen major cities -- and given the dense population and restricted area, would have been an absolute charnel house.The actual result of a nuclear war in 1962 would be:Moderate damage to the US. Moderate if you didn't happen to be in NYC or Washington, that is.Total devastation of the USSR.Very severe damage in Europe."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Let's start with the basics: Buy it. Read it. It is a very good story. Here is the why:In general, what separates the great stories from the avarage ones? Some might say that its the ability of some part of the story to remain with you long after you have finished reading it. In this respect, &quot;Ressurection Day&quot; deserves to be classified as a classic of Alternate History and a great story to boot.From the beginning, Dubois chooses his fork in time carefully. An all too near to reality scenario where the Cuban Crisis ends in World War III is just the kind of twist to lend this alternate world a heafty dose of credibility. Focusing on JFK has Dubois sending his readers directly into what I would term the &quot;Oliver Stone realm of nostalgia&quot; - the world as it might have been had this or other event not hapenned.From these basic ingredients, Dubois weaves an intricate tapestry of memories and tragedies, hopes and fears. This is a world full of regret and a palpable sense of sadness, looking back in anger at the shattered American dream. And in it comes Ressurection's main character, Carl Landry, ostensibly trying to solve a murder, but actually hoping to achieve much much more.Landry's journey through a devastated America is a tour de force of sketches into the avarage person's life after such a cataclysmic event. There are no big heroes to fill the canvas, just a collection of disparate people, nut unlike you and me, trying to make the best out of a horrible situation. The people and the places, the hopes and fears are what you would expect to find in your own neighborhodd, a fact which makes the horros of the war resonate with an uncanny attenuation. I guarantee you that long after you have forgotten any of the characters or the plot, the images of an America that might have been will remain in your mind as a powerful deterrent to a future you will not want happening."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Resurrection Day was full of promise to be one of the most interesting tales told this year. The premise is fascinating. What if the Cuban Missile Crisis had escalated into all-out war and the United States had been hit with nuclear weapons?With this premise, Brendan DuBois presents us with a cast of characters that could inhabit the devastated landscape one might find ten years after such a tragedy. Unfortunately, the characters are predictable, more types than individuals, and the plot unfolds according to the formula. The picture DuBois paints is somewhat interesting, but his execution falls far short of the promise.Carl Landry is the protagonist of this tale. Now a reporter for a censored version of the Boston Globe, he is an ex-veteran, a man who joined the Army in the flush of enthusiasm that accompanied the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. He served in an obscure country called Vietnam and lived to see starvation in California. In Carl's world, American survivors envy rich Canadians and rich Mexicans. He is joined on his search for truth by Sandy Price, British reporter for the Times, the obligatory love interest and temptress who is not completely what she seems on the surface.Disappointingly, this book offers nothing more than a simple morality play of the good people versus the large and malignant forces of the government. Our hero faces impossible odds, and it is not all that difficult to imagine how things are going to play out in the end.For readers who do not mind the predictable nature of the story, Resurrection Day does paint an interesting picture of a devastated landscape, of a country that is bowed but not broken. Read for what it is, a mass market paperback, it is not all that bad. Readers who expect something new or different, something at all challenging, are likely to be disappointed.This is a good book for a long airplane trip or for someone who wants a break from challenging books. It's mildly entertaining, but not at all a keeper."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I've been mesmerized by ,&quot;Seven Days In May &quot;, &quot;The Wind Chill Factor&quot;, and &quot;Red Storm Rising &quot;...this novel was BETTER. When you pick this book up be sure you've given yourself enough time to finish it in one reading , because it is impossible to put down . The author takes the simplest of premises --What would have happened if the missiles had been launched in October of 1962 ?--and gives a complex ,thought provoking , and spellbinding answer. As one of the baby boomers who can still remember air raid drills as a schoolboy in Queens, New York City I found the passages about the Battle of New York , the &quot;lost&quot;children in the schoolbuilding basements , and P.S.19 both plausible and probable . Living in an age when its become cynically fashionable by the historical revisionists to sneer at the idealism of the Kennedy Era I found this story of Grand Tragedy and Heroism to be compulsive reading. The style with which the alternative history of this tale is deftly told puts this book at the head of its class. Great adventure, mystery, history, and storytelling all roled into one----H.G. Wells and Jules Verne would tip their hats to the author. BRAVO !BRAVO !---If you are looking for that perfect book to curl up with and forget about everything else in your world for a night or weekend -this is it !!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else. Not badly, not well- just as humans, struggling to survive."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Don't get me wrong, DuBois' writing is terrific and the book is well-written ~~ but it seemed to have dragged me along in a couple of chapters as I anxiously await to read what the reporter Carl Landry is on the hunt for. And some of the characters are predictable ~~ much to my chagrin. But if you're looking for a really good &quot;what if&quot; book, this is it.I was born way after the Bay of Pigs incident and the Kennedys I know of are the ones I read about ~~ John John and Caroline. Oh yes, Senator Ted Kennedy. So, when I picked up this book, I thought, oh cool, a history lesson mixed in with fiction. Well, DuBois didn't really go into the history part as much as he writes about what if the Russians did bomb us and we bombed the Russians, and how would our lives be? That part is terrifying ~~ I cannot imagine living in a police state nor can I imagine losing everything and everyone in a nuclear blast. And DuBois plays well with your emotions and fears as he writes about Carl Landry on a mad hunt for the truth.Landry is joined by a British reporter, Sandy who has secrets of her own. And together, they tried to find out what had really happened that fateful day World War III had broken out. And the military is hot on their tail ~~ they didn't want Landry to find out the the truth. It makes for a good reading.Just because I didn't think it was suspenseful enough for me (No one can be like Patterson or some of those other writers), it is still a good book to pick up. In fact, I am planning to pass this onto my friends and family and see what they think of it. I am sure my parents would enjoy it better as they had lived through the Kennedy times ~~ and still remember those drills in case of a nuclear attack.If you're looking for a fiction that has plenty of action and dialogue, then this is it. If you expect it to be more historical, this isn't it. Still a good read though."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I looked forward to this novel with great eagerness, as I am a fan of intelligent alt-history/sci.fi. writing. However, when I was through reading, I put the book down with a slight feeling that something was missing.I would have liked more information on the hero, Carl Landry...less of a soap opera plot between Landry and Sandy....less caricature of the military... It seems as though Dubois had several different ideas for the story -anti-military harangue? Potential movie of the week?-and while the book had many interesting and touching points, most were brought up, glanced at, then dropped. That is, I would haved liked to know more about the orphans in the NYC subways, not just have them appear as a convienient plot point. However, this book was entertaining, well-written and basically enjoyable. I just feel that Dubois could have done more...or better. I think it would have been more effective if he either dropped some characters and subplots, and fleshed them out more fully and made a much larger book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This is an \\"alternate history\\" novel. The premise of Resurrection Day is that the Cuban Missile Crisis got out of hand, and escalated into a full nuclear exchange following a US invasion of Cuba. The aftermath is that the Soviet Union has been completely destroyed, and the United States is crippled, economically depressed, and under what amounts to a military dictatorship. The US is the junior partner of Great Britain, which is untouched by the war, and which has supplanted the US as the preeminent world power. The British mission to the US wields great power within the country. Here, by the way, the author uses the same concept of a US as a political satellite of Britain that Streiber used in \\"Warday\\" (which is another, earlier novel about the aftermath of a limited nuclear exchange).The story moves along reasonably well, although I would not say that the ending is particularly startling. The novel's strong suit is the detail and realism of the author's portrayal of America under military control. One gets the impression from reading the novel that such a thing could happen, and that it would of course be a disaster for the country.Like \\"Warday\\" the novel's weak suit is its premise that an America that is down for the count would not get back on its feet in the manner shown by the Germans and Japanese following the second world war. The novel gives no real explanation for why it assumes that America would remain poor and impoverished from devastation that, while bad, is less complete than what either Germany or Japan experienced from WW2.Overall a decent read. It accomplishes its goal of making the reader appreciate the fact that the Cuban Missile Crisis did not escalate."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"&quot;Resurrection Day&quot; kept me interested throughout, but I must admit that it's depiction of America in 1972 post WW III didn't ring quite true to me. If you're an alternate history fan, or interested in the Cuban Missle Crisis, then this is a worthy read, but that's not to say that it was ~completely~ satisfying (but then few books are).Although &quot;devastated America&quot; kept being alluded to, it never quite came to life for me. Carl's daily life seems fairly ordinary, and affected only in small ways. This might indeed have been the case if the war happened in '62, since the world wasn't as wired and thus as fragile at that time, but even so, I expected more ~&quot;Alternativeness&quot;~ in his world than I found.For those that might feel similarly, I recommend the book &quot;Warday&quot;, which was published back in about 83-84. &quot;Postman&quot; by David Brin, a great book and not-so-great movie also explores the same genre in a surprisingly effective (and affecting) way."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"The Cuban Missile Crisis ranks as the most terrifying moment of the Cold War, the point when the United States and the Soviet Union came closest to waging a nuclear war. In this novel, Brendan DuBois offers a terrifying speculation how it might have turned out, with a postwar America still recovering from a \\"limited\\" attack that killed millions and turned the country over to a quasi-military regime. DuBois' concept is well thought out, from the gangs of \\"orphies\\" (children who were safely in bomb shelters while their parents were caught above ground when the bombs fell) to the legend created around the possible survival of John F. Kennedy, a figure reviled for plunging the world into war.Yet for a work of alternative history to succeed, it isn't enough simply to have an intriguing premise. The story within the book needs to be strong, and it is here where DuBois's book stands out from most alternative history novels. His plot, which follows a reporter whose investigation of a seemingly mundane murder leads him to the conspiracies which form the foundation of the post-war America, is exciting, with realistic characters that readers can relate to struggling to survive in this nightmarish America. All of this is told in a fast-paced, gripping narrative that make for great reading."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"My first introduction to Brendan Dubois in '99.

Mostly I'd just like to respond to S.M. Stirling: If you read the novel carefully, you find that the Restricted Zones are actually a fiction perpetuated by the USA's military rulers - case in point being the thriving communities of supposedly \\"depopulated\\" Manhattan Island. In fact, a major part of the \\"conspiracy\\" is to prevent ordinary Americans from finding this out.Anyone who's studied the history of Fascism knows that such a r&eacute;gime must have an \\"enemy\\" to combat. Just as the anti-Jewish \\"struggle\\" was central to Nazi ideology, so are the RZ's (along with the vilification of the Kennedy Administration) central to the mythos perpetuated by the general and his mob in the novel.

Did Kennedy escape to South America or did he die a hero at his oval office desk?A chilling example of just how heady those days were is played out in a history lession given by the base commander in New York City.New York was badly damaged by Atomic strikes but as the story will show, the big apple is surprisingly resilient.Alternate storylines are always fun and this is no exception.Just like Robert Harris' Fatherland we can see a world that is rather dark and scary but thankfully not real."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"When I originally bought this book it was so I would have something to do when things got slow at work. To my surprise this has been the best book I have ever read. My girlfriend loved it, all of my friends loved it, and both of my parents loved it. The entire way this book keeps you on edge, there are so many different scenarios scratching at your head that you can not put it down. This book is defenately a page turner."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Brendan Dubois's novel 'Resurrection Day' is a fun and thrilling Alternate History story set in a world where cooler heads did not prevail. Instead of working out a deal, the US and the USSR begin a full scale nuclear war in the wake of the Cuban Missle Crisis. Ten years later The United States is a police state, where military conscription and British foreign aid are supposedly the only things keeping the country from reverting to barbarism. When a reporter stumbles onto a story about the true beginnings of the US-Soviet war he soon finds himself in the middle of the largest cover-up in US history and is soon being hunted by the US Air Force, British secret agents, and other, more mysterious figures. While the author does a tremedous job of creating this fictional, nightmare world it still doesn't hold a candle to Robert Harris's 'Fatherland,' to which this novel is often compared. It is much slower moving than 'Fatherland' and a bit more implausble in some areas. Also the characters, while compelling, aren't nearly as interesting as Harris's. That being said it should also be pointed out that this is a first rate AH story that should be embraced by all lovers of the genre. A lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"World War III happened in 1963, and the United States won. Sort of. It's not a very pretty world, and it gets less pretty in this story of betrayal and conspiracy. A classic &quot;man who knew too much&quot; story, well done."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"This being my first venture into &quot;fictional history&quot;, I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel. The premise (&quot;Cuban Missle Crisis Goes Horribly Wrong&quot;) piqued my interest enough when I saw this book on the shelf to give it a try.I wasn't disappointed - especially after I slogged through the first 150 pages. The protagionist of the story is a likeable and sympathetic enough character that you can't help not rooting for. In addition, there are a number of &quot;nasties&quot; along the way that sometimes make it tough to figure out who's good and who's evil. The &quot;plot&quot; has enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing throughout the last half of the book. And, I might add, is based on a believable enough premise that you'll &quot;thank your lucky stars&quot; things didn't work out this way back in the 60's.I would have liked to have seen the real historical figures (Kennedy, Johnson, Cabinet officials, etc.) used more often in the novel to give the story more &quot;history&quot; and less &quot;fiction&quot;. But, when they WERE used, it made for some of the better parts of the book. (Especially imaginative were the references to the candidates in the Presidential race that was taking place throughout the book.)The novel is a little slow in spots and the romantic interlude involving our &quot;hero&quot; and the British journalist is uneven, at best. On the other hand, DuBois IS a very good storyteller and many parts of this book shine. (I think the average reader will certainly enjoy the trip to Manhatten Island.)If you enjoy &quot;fact&quot; mixed in with &quot;fiction&quot;, then I don't think you'll be disappointed with &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"For AH fans, this makes for a good quick read that you shouldn't think too much about. A number of glaring improbabilities, some gaps in logic, and characters that are a bit cardboard. But nonetheless it's fun and the setting is pretty well conceived. It held my interest throughout, and the ending was reasonably satisfying (though not much of a surprise). I would have given it 3 stars, but decent AH is hard to find."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Wonderful premise and the allusions to Fatherland are apt. However, the love story seemed obligatory, at best, and the events at the end which led to the invasion being called off were far too insignificant not to logically have been ignored by the would-be invaders."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Brendan Dubois's novel takes place in an alternate universe, one where the Cuban Missle Crisis erupted into World War III. The story picks up in 1972, a decade later. The United States has been decimated by a nuclear holocaust and is now entirely dependent on its European allies for survival. There are national food and energy shortages. The country is under a totalitarian-like state of martial law and the media is strictly censored by the Army. On the other side of the globe, the Soviet Union and most of the Asian continent have been obliterated from the face of the Earth. The story revolves around two reporters - one from Boston, the other from London - who together indirectly end up pursuing information that leads to revealing the truth about how President Kennedy lost control of the Cuban Missle Crisis, plunging the U.S. into third world war. I had loved the novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; and I was attracted to &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; because of the similarities pointed out by professional reviewers. Alternate history is a fascinating genre, because I guess from time to time we all think - if perhaps narcissistically - about how our own lives would've been affected had we ourselves taken a turn in the road different from the one we ultimately chose. Though &quot;Fatherland&quot; isn't perfect, I think it's a stronger book and more plausible in its concept than the scenario DuBois creates in &quot;Resurrection Day.&quot; It takes about 20 or so plus depressing chapters for DuBois to build the foundation of this nightmarish world before anything of great importance really occurs in the novel. Then when it does, he takes us into the bowels of New York City (literally) on an odyssey that seems to be a little too bizarre and a little too fantastic for me to believe could've happened in such an alternate universe. I also felt a few of the main characters - most notably the military personnel depicted - lacked any real depth. Much of the dialogue at times also seemed weak, as if it were borrowed from a Steven Seagal film, though there are a few great lines uttered by the protagonist from time to time. One other thing that troubled me about the story: I couldn't figure out how the rest of the world had survived World War III so well. I had been taught as far back as grade school that even a limited nuclear exchange by the U.S. and Russia (even in 1962) would've led to nuclear winter. But yet we learn that ten years after the fact, the British are thriving, the Germans and French are building a space station in orbit, and the Japanese are on their way to becoming the economic giant they were apparently destined to be in both histories. What about all the dirt and dust kicked up into the atmosphere? What about all that lethal radiation? Wouldn't a poisonous radioactive cloud have been carried by the jet stream to rain down on Europe's cities and farmlands; contaminating their water, their crops, and their livestock too? Wouldn't they be in just as bad shape as the U.S.? Despite the faults I found with the book, I certainly have to admit that DuBois's tale of nuclear horror made me think. He's also the first author ever to give me nightmares, which I guess means he made his point. I would recommend this book to friends with my above concerns stated, because I think alternate history is a helluva hard genre to write for and I respect him for doing it as well as he did. In my opinion, it's not as good as &quot;Fatherland,&quot; but it is a noble effort."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"I *love* alternate histories, and liked Brendan DuBois when he was writing about his modern-day ex-DOD-analyst/Amateur Detective Lewis Cold (in Dead Sand -- thhe first of his series), but the current book was so depressing and unbelievable that I wondered how it could have received positive ratings from so many people. I kept reading (skimming) to the end, hoping for some redeeming feature, but had no luck. The basic plot device is that the Cuban Missile Crisis escalated into WW III: Washington DC, a part of New York, and much of Florida (?) was destroyed, along with all of the Soviet Union. One of the unbelievable pieces of dialog that appears in the book was having the viewpoint character, a Boston Globe reporter, explain to a beautiful, wealthy London Times reporter (who seems to LIKE him) that Americans feel guilty about wiping out the Russians, since their military clearly weren't up to the US level of power (they only managed to kill 10 million Americans -- thus the guilt). The plot develops as a weird working out of the author's political fantasies, including an alternate universe Kennedy Death Conspiracy, at least as weird as the weirdest one I have ever heard about the actual Kennedy Assassination. Since the author is in charge of reality here, irrefutable proof is discovered, showing that this weird conspiracy theory is TRUE! I recommend against this book unless you're interested in conspiracies."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"Although not a frequent reader of alternate history, I found this book very engaging and unusually pertinent to the world we find ourselves in Post 9/11. It centers around the curtailment of citizen freedoms and the abuses of military power in the name of &quot;national security&quot; following a fictional nuclear war occurring at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The story is well-conceived and a great read. What I found chilling are the parallels to 2001 where citizens are being arrested and detained without legal recourse, where the news is being censored in the name of military security, where military tribunals in secret are being put forward in place of open public trials. I found the villainy of the British in Dubois's book a bit unlikely, but the villainy of our own military was very believable. On a positive note, Duboise's conception of the strength and resilience of the people of New York City in the aftermath of disaster turns out to have been amazingly prescient and right on. I heartily recommend this as an involving and timely book."},{"Title":"Resurrection Day","review":"How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477?

This is largely due to such depressingly self-evident phrases as &quot;life's too short&quot; or &quot;you're only young once&quot;. But what if we had more time?Francis Saxover, a respected biochemist, discovers a way to slow the ageing process, making it possible to live a couple of extra centuries. With a discovery of this magnitude, there are bound to be far-reaching implications, and Saxover tries to keep the miraculous cure (which he calls Antigerone) under wraps. Because the supply of Antigerone is limited, it's a question of deciding who gets the treatment. Who would use the time most wisely?The benefits of most scientific advances are usually limited to the rich at first. But this changes over time. &quot;Trouble With Lichen&quot; is a satirical novel which poses some questions on the pros and cons of an increased lifespan. One obvious con is overpopulation. As we know, Earth is a planet of finite resources, a planet overburdened by an immature species contending with famine, disease and habitual war. At first, Antigerone is unlikely to alleviate this problem. On the other hand, if Antigerone did become widely available and people could live longer, they wouldn't feel the pressure to marry and have children as quickly as they do now, in order to pass on the family name. In fact, one could put off starting a family until they're in their early nineties. What about the rise in umemployment as people take longer to retire? One possible way around this would be to make people stay in school longer. At the moment twelve years is scarcely adequate for a full, comprehensive education. The learning process would be far less stressful if it wasn't so rushed. Can you imagine starting high school at fifty?It would be nice to think that the longer we live the more wisdom we would gain. The pace through life would be much more leisurely and happy, not fraught with a feeling of dashed hopes and time slipping by.It might have been interesting to actually see how the characters' lives unfold over the next two hundred years or so.

Read it- you'll like it."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"This is George Bernard Shaw's most important work. A successful drama that has enjoyed continuous popularity for nearly eighty years is worth a read. Most audiences find it very satisfying. Shaw has a gift for lucid dialogue that brings a centuries old story to life. This is one of the most approachable of the great English language plays.Why then does \\"Saint Joan\\" fall short of five stars?Fictional accounts of Joan of Arc's life are numerous and seldom accurate. Shakespeare makes her a witch. Voltaire makes her an idiot. Schiller makes her admirable - and gives her a magical helmet that protects her from harm until she falls in love.In a rare exception to his usual satirical style, Mark Twain spent months in France researching her life and published a fictional biography. Readers who enjoy accurate historical fiction would do well with Twain's \\"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc.\\" Twain considered this - not \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" - to be his finest work.Shaw pays far more attention to accuracy than most fictionalizations. Several lines in the play are Shaw's own translations from her trial transcript. Shaw's long introductory essay aspires to be history as well as drama. Most scholars agree with his assessment of Joan of Arc's socioeconomic background. Shaw acknowledges a few dramatic economies: he combines the historical Jean d'Orleans and Duke Jean d'Alencon into a single character. What causes problems are Shaw's unacknowledged deviations from the factual record.Shaw argues that Joan of Arc was a forerunner of Protestantism who got a fair trial. Among serious scholars this argument gains no credibility. A surviving letter from the English government that financed the trial guaranteed her execution even if the court found her not guilty. Joan of Arc never rejected the Roman Catholic Church: she rejected the authority of politically biased judges bent on discrediting her and, by inference, on discrediting the king she had crowned. Twenty-four years after her death the Pope reopened the case. The appeals court not only found her innocent but discovered such extensive violations of proper court procedure that it accused the late Bishop Cauchon of heresy.Shaw's choice works as drama rather than as history yet he advocates it on historical grounds. He might be sincere but he is certainly not honest. To an academic scholar who has explained the facts to umpteen Shaw enthusiasts the difference can be infuriating. This is why \\"Saint Joan\\" collects a handful of scathing reviews.A reader who understands this little shell game with history should have a lively time with the drama. If this is your first reading of \\"Saint Joan\\" then I envy you. Nothing quite equals the first encounter."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his &quot;Saint Joan&quot; did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a &quot;rebel&quot; except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"What has most stuck in my mind, many years after having read Shaw's book, is the fact that it's more logical to think of Joan as a protestant saint, instead of Catholic, when one considers how she rejected the Catholic Church's authority and was, naturally, rejected in turn.He makes a very good point when he says that, right as that Church was to ban her on those grounds, nothing could give it the moral right (or any other right, for that matter) to condemn a woman who disagreed with it on matters of faith. In all fairness, they should have simply excommunicated her and said: &quot;If you think you have a better idea, then you go ahead and create your own Church&quot;.It may be a thoroughly idealistic point of view of course, too democratic for that age (perhaps any age), but nonetheless it strikes me as completely fair.If you like a club but object to some of its rules, and that club isn't willing to change for your sake, they may have the right to throw you out, just as you may have the right to start a new one on your own - but they shouldn't be given the right to take away your life for having dared to challenge their concepts.This lesson has stayed with me and I recommend this book for the wisdom it contains."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"Shaw was a close friend of a Benedictine Abbess, Dame Laurentia, who &quot;vetted&quot; his plays for fairness to the faith. This play is fun, takes lots of bites out of politicians and clergy, and says something beautiful about the imagination. This Joan is no dolt and had to be burnt at the stake. That is a complement to her faith."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"Radical feminism, to which I pledge complete allegiance, has put gender issues at the forefront of historical interest in Joan of Arc, but historiography is scarcely pertinent to the reading of George Bernard Shaw's play 'Saint Joan.' I'm told that this awkward play was a smash hit and held the stage for decades in Britain, but it's hard to imagine how or why. The first problem is not gender but 'genre.' Is it intended to play as a farce, before an audience that will chuckle genteelly at hearing Jehan d'Arc speak with a Yorkshire brogue? Or as a philosophical tragicomedy, preparing the stage of the future for Samuel Becket? The dialogue is half music-hall burlesque and half pompous twaddle. I'd have a hard time declaring which is more juvenile, the humor or the sententious lecturing.If anyone who reads this review has seen a staged production of the play, I'd be interested in hearing whether it was 'played for laughs' or performed earnestly. Shaw is of course taken quite seriously in the world of anglophone theater, though actual productions of his works are rare in the USA. Shaw was not reticent about assuring \\"us\\" of his intelligence, and not particularly chary of condescension, but this play features some of the dumbest jokes and most preposterous dialogue I've ever read. Any audience that wasn't overawed by Shaw's elevated reputation would groan out loud at Joan's flippant folksiness.There seems to be a \\"Joan-of-Arc\\" effect on the minds of writers, which disposes them to bizarre extravagance. I turned to Shaw's 'Saint Joan' as a follow-up to reading Mark Twain's romantic novel/ biography \\"Joan of Arc.' Both works are based on historical sources, chiefly the trial records, yet neither can be interpreted as 'history' in a modern sense. Shaw was aware of Twain's book, and regarded it skeptically, yet the two works have more in common than not. Both are polemics against humanity's inability to comprehend sainthood."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"\\"Cauchon: If you dare do what this woman has done - set your country above the holy Catholic Church - you shall go to the fire with her.\\"So speaks a more engaging, complex executioner of the legendary young soldier put forth by Bernard Shaw in \\"Saint Joan.\\" Even if the Bishop put Joan to death for political reasons he likely believed that her execution was just. The Catholic Church's problems with Joan lingered for nearly 500 years. Her active assertion of nationalism as a holy endeavor intuited by her own judgment undermined the Catholic church's political authority, and yes, presaged the Reformation, even if Joan was not a Protestant (Shaw labels her \\"anti clerical\\").And she willingly asserted a non-traditional feminine role (soldiering and politicking), which by its nature required non-traditional feminine behavior and dress. Reviewers who say that Joan wore armor to keep from being raped are half right, since Joan's soldiering included such hazards, like being wounded. But she did and thrived at it anyway. In fact, I agree with Shaw that the voices spurring her on were Joan's own subconcious, but that is another debate...Those who are skeptical of Shaw's ideas would do well to consider the year of her Canonization: 1920. It's no accident that a year after the Great War, in which the world's powers successfully mobilized against each other in the name of Nationalism (the churches providing prayers and getting out of the way), Catholicism threw up its hands and recognized the genius of the French teenager. This too as women had been called on in support roles like nurses and ambulance drivers, and were being enfranchised by their European and American nations.The play itself is typical Shaw - bright, smart, very worthwhile. None of the play's acts goes on too long. None is weak, except for Act III on the eve of the battle of Orleans, but Shaw is Shaw and seems embarassed by the warlike bluster. Joan herself, as others have observed, often speaks in lines that are taken directly from the trial transcripts. When she doesn't it's usually to give her a flash of wit that rarely seems contrived. This is Joan for grown-ups. And it is Joan for the 21st century: post-modern, the old sentiments put aside.Also reccomended: Regine Pernoud's books. If you need to hear what a pretty, chaste, tear-provoking, goody goody of a girl Joan was buy Mark Twain (I myself donated that volume to the public library when I was 17)."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"Shaw's keen understanding of French Patriotism as illustrated in Joan of Arc story transcends borders, cultures, languages and skin colors.

I loved it every time. I agree fully with Shaw that the Catholic Church has gotten a bad rap over Joan. When you listen to her words she was espousing overt Protestant beliefs -- God can, should and will speak to one person, individually and doesn't require a mediator like the Pope or Mary or any of the saints.I actually got the most out of this play by hearing it on a tape from Books on Tape for the Blind and Disabled. I was able to speed the tape up and suddenly the wimpy, silly voices of the court officials came out perfectly. The farce inside the tragedy revealed itself clearly.Shaw is brilliant and astute -- but no one needs me to tell them that!"},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"This version of \\"Saint Joan\\" includes not only the play, but also commentaries about the play by George Bernard Shaw as well as the transcript of the original trial and the Order of Rehabilitation.The play itself is excellent. It tells the story of Joan's triumph and tragedy with wit, humor and power. The play includes not only the dialogue, but also occasional instructions on how the play I to be presented. I read this book in anticipation of seeing the play. I was a little concerned that knowing how it proceeds may spoil it, but the dialogue makes me more eager to see it. I want to see how this work of art is played out.Shaw's interpretation of the play is contained in the Preface, some letters and an interview. Shaw places the play in its historical context, which helps the reader assess the merit of the positions of each. He also presents his own interpretation of the proceedings, asserting, among other things that Joan was burned, in part, because she was ahead of her time in ways which challenged the authorities of her day. Her claim of direct communication from Sts. Margaret, Catherine and Michael is portrayed as a precursor of Protestantism, in the claim that an individual can communicate directly with God. He presents this as a threat to the Church by eliminating the need for its role as a mediator. Shaw identifies Joan as an apostle of nationalism, a concept alien to her medieval world and a threat to the feudal powers which judged her.I found the play itself to be intellectually and emotionally stimulating. The supplementary materials aided my understanding of the play. I have an increased interest in knowing more about St. Joan as a result of reading this book. This will aid anyone wanting to understand this play."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"Audio recordings of plays are usually done with different actors reading the roles as in a radio play. This is the first time I have listened to a play being read by only one reader. It is not at all the same experience, but better than one might expect. The reader uses a neutral American accent for the French characters, but a slightly British one to differentiate the English characters. There was a recording on Caedmon of the play with Siobhan McKenna repeating her famous performance, but it is not available. (Some libraries still have it on vinyl, but that doesn't help me pass the time while commuting.)Shaw's play is intriguing, coming as it did so soon after Joan's canonization and Ireland's war for independence (\\"France for the French\\"), but there is no denying that is rather untheatrical, save for the climactic scene. Joan confesses to her supposed sins to save her life, but then withdraws the confession, choosing execution and martydom. I had never realized how much Arthur Miller owed to Shaw; I was reminded of the scene in The Crucible when John Proctor confesses to a lie and then recants, preferring an honorable death. These scenes are both based on historical events, of course, but the resemblance in the way they are dramatized is striking nonetheless. Here's a potential trivia topic: How many plays and movies can you think of that use the device of a false confession followed by an even more dramatic retraction?"},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"In one surviving account, Joan of Arc was quoted as saying that her judges were merely putting her on trial because they were members of the pro-English faction and therefore her \\"capital enemies\\"; unfortunately, this play tries to claim otherwise. One of Shaw's primary themes is the notion that Pierre Cauchon and Joan's other judges were acting as \\"sincere\\" defenders of the Church in their prosecution of her, a view which is contradicted by document after document as well as the above quote from Joan herself. Cauchon and his cronies are well known to historians as having been long-term supporters of the English and Burgundian factions, and the eyewitnesses said repeatedly that they prosecuted Joan out of revenge for the defeats that their side had suffered at the hands of her army, rather than out of any genuine belief that she was guilty of heresy. Cauchon even allowed her to take final communion (which was never done in the case of heretics), indicating that even he didn't truly believe the charges against her. As Shaw was aware, these charges were soundly debunked when the case was appealed after the English were finally driven from Rouen in 1449; and the arguments put forward in this ruling have been confirmed as accurate by experts in medieval theology and canon law, whereas Cauchon's arguments can easily be refuted by consulting medieval theological works - his arguments are, at best, merely distortions of what the medieval Church actually taught. Here are some specific examples which factored prominently in Shaw's play:- Shaw, like Cauchon, claimed that Joan was guilty of heresy for wearing male clothing allegedly as a personal preference, despite the fact that both of these men were aware of her own statements to the contrary. She was quoted as saying that she wore soldiers' clothing (of a type which had \\"laces and points\\" by which the pants and tunic could be securely tied together) primarily to protect herself, as her guards had tried to rape her on several occasions; this reason is also given in some of the 15th century chronicles, along with similar quotes from Joan herself on the need to protect her chastity while surrounded by the men in her army. The medieval Church allowed an exemption in such cases of necessity (read St. Thomas Aquinas' \\"Summa Theologica\\", or St. Hildegard's \\"Scivias\\", for example): the practice of so-called \\"cross-dressing\\" was only condemned if it was done as a preference. Shaw rejects all of the above based on the specious argument that the \\"other women\\" who accompanied armies in that era didn't wear such clothing, ignoring the fact that these \\"other women\\" were: 1) prostitutes, who wore provocative dresses because they were trying to encourage sexual encounters rather than the opposite; and 2) aristocratic women sometimes were given command of their family's armies in the absence of their husband or son, but these women did not bed down at night among the troops in the field, as Joan often did. Shaw chooses to ignore these circumstances.- On a somewhat related subject, Shaw tries to portray her as a rebel against \\"gender norms\\", again ignoring her own statements and the circumstances of the era. She was quoted by one eyewitness as saying that, quote, \\"I would rather stay home with my poor mother and spin wool [rather than lead an army]\\", which hardly sounds like someone who is trying to reject traditional gender roles. When another woman, Catherine de la Rochelle, wanted to get involved, Joan told her to \\"go home to your husband and tend your household\\". At no point do we find her making any 'feminist' statements. She was given titular command of an army for the same reason other religious visionaries sometimes were given such a role in that era, not as part of a \\"feminist crusade\\".- Shaw admits that Joan was a devout Catholic and yet claims her as \\"the first Protestant martyr\\" - in the same sentence. This seems to be a rather willful contradiction, and the claim of \\"Protestant tendencies\\" is merely based, once again, on the old business of accepting Cauchon's claims about her at face value while ignoring the circumstances. If you read the documents you will find that Joan never opposed the Church as a whole: she merely stated her objection to being tried by a panel of pro-English clergy, and repeatedly asked to be given a non-partisan group instead or to be brought before the Pope. It was a violation of Inquisitorial procedure to stack the panel of assessors with people who were pursuing a secular vendetta against the accused: what Cauchon and his cohorts were doing, as Inquisitor Brehal later pointed out during the appeal, was itself an act of heresy. The notion that the medieval Church viewed all Inquisitorial panels as \\"infallible\\" and therefore not open to question is just a stereotype, bluntly contradicted by actual medieval theological writings: St. Hildegard, in her 12th century book \\"Scivias\\", warns the clergy against judging someone in error or out of anger, as it would be the offending clergy who would be punished for it by God. Joan was perfectly within her rights, even under the rules of the medieval Church, to question her biased judges, and was declared a martyr for Catholicism by Inquisitor Brehal when her execution was declared invalid in 1456. Shaw ignores this. The claim that his play is somehow vindicated by the fact that it was \\"vetted\\" by one Catholic (out of the hundreds of millions of Catholics worldwide) is a pointless argument: there are \\"Catholics\\" who claim that Joan was having adulterous sex, and all sorts of defamatory allegations. The bottom line is: this play does little more than repeat the slander leveled at Joan by the men who cruelly put her to death, despite the work of generations of scholars to bring a more accurate picture of the issue to light."},{"Title":"Saint Joan (Penguin books)","review":"I'am an actress.

I was more disappointed by the play itself-it is not a play about Jehanne's life, but rather about the pompous musings of male peacocks spreading their tails like an eclipse over the Maid herself. Shaw portrays Jehanne as a silly little tomboy who threw off her skirts and donned trousers to play soldier and skipped into the King's chambers cooing &amp; giggling about God and war. Jehanne is rarely actually IN a scene - much of the play is, as I said, dominated by the peacocks of her trial discussing her, ranting about her, defaming her, etc. She only skips in throughout to swoon mindlessly over God and stamped her spoiled foot for war. Shaw gives one the sense that her presence in a scene is only disrupting the continuation of his wordy play of peacocks! Redeeming quality: the last scenes - Shaw actually allows Jehanne to grow a sudden brain and speak out intelligently against the peacocks, which he has already condemned her for in his preface!

H. Henry (1913-2003) was one of the most important evangelical theologians of the twentieth century. He was instrumental in the founding of Christianity Today and Fuller Theological Seminary, both of which have drifted toward liberalism as of late. (Fuller's slide toward liberalism is detailed in George Marsden's REFORMING FUNDAMENTALISM.)In 1960 or so, Christianity Today serially published a number of brief essays on various topics in theology, which were published together in this book. (Christianity Today was more scholarly and conservative in those days.) These essays (which number 43, plus a postscript by Roger Nicole) were written by some of the most prominent evangelical thinkers of the day, including Cornelius van Til, F. F. Bruce, G. E. Ladd, and E. J. Carnell. Actually, just about all the deep thinkers in Evangelical Christianity of the time except Gordon Clark appeared to have contributed to this project.This book is an informative mini-systematic theology.

Zhang argues that it is still a highly relevant topic in the post-Mao era due to its influence on the modernization process. Zhang then breaks his book down into six chapters each looking at the influence of ideology and economic reforms in a specific period. His general thesis is that a juxtaposition of ideologies has been at play during the period of reform, which has had serious effect on the path that the modernization process has taken. The book appears to have been well researched, and includes a wealth of useful information relating to Ideology, policy, and economic reform in the period in question.Zhang examines the period 1978 - 1993 and aims to explore the juxtaposition of ideological currents and economic reforms that took place beneath the guiding light of Deng Xiaoping .It starts with a brief introduction that focuses on the relevance of ideology in China in the post-Mao era arguing that, in the era of reform, Ideology is still a very important topic because ideological orientations have influenced policy preferences, which undoubtedly, has had a marked effect on China's modernization path. Zhang (1996: 3) breaks the study into three important groups of questions which are: What have been China's ideological trends since 1978 and Why?; How have these ideological trends influenced China's economic reforms and why?; and what conclusions can be reached on the role of ideology in economic reform during Deng's period of influence?After the introduction, Zhang uses a chronological format in his study breaking the chapters down into timeframes, or \\"cycles\\". Chapter one looks at Ideology and China's modernization in historical perspective\\". It briefly describes the history of China since the mid 19th century and the different models that the Chinese Communist Party has attempted to implement to achieve modernization and true socialism in the period 1949 - 1978. Zhang claims that the moderate Leninist model adopted in the period 1961 - 1965, allowed China to achieve good harvests and industrial growth. However Mao, realizing that his power and prestige were in decline, decided that China was taking a revisionist path which led to the disastrous Cultural Revolution. In this period the moderate Leninist approach, once again gave way to the radical Maoist approach with great emphasis on ideological mobilization. (1996: 16 - 17) In summary the first paragraph claims that although China's attempts at modernization had some disastrous consequences, China did succeed in laying a fairly extensive industrial basis for economic development in the period 1949 - 1976.The remaining five chapters are then broken into two parts each. Part A concentrates on the major ideological trends of the cycle in question; and part B, the ideology and reform policies of that period. These sections are then broken down into further relevant headings, which makes the book a useful and easy to use resource for researchers interested in specific policies or events during Deng's period of reform. In general these chapters describe how \\" the doctrinal failure of Maoism and the primacy of the modernization goal have compelled the Chinese communist reformers to initiate the theoretical and operational reformulation of socialism\\". ( 1996: 221).Zhang's general argument is that competing ideologies have been working within the CCP which have acted either as a stimulus to reform or a constraint on them. These competing ideologies have effected the pace and scope of China's modernization in this period. He also argues that there was a dynamic process of interaction between Chinese intellectuals and political leaders with the former attempting to transcend the official discourse in order to influence policy options, and the later engaged in either doctrinal renovation or continuality. The study also places great emphasis on Deng's policy of \`socialism with Chinese characteristics' which appears to basically constitute, a pro-business ideology that retains some socialist characteristics.In summary, the aim of the book is to analyse the importance of ideology on economic reform in the period of Deng Xiaoping. It begins with a brief overview of PRC ideological and economic history and then concentrates on the period of reform 1978 -1993 in which Deng Xiaoping's influence was dominant. Zhang argues, that ideology still played a major role in post-Maoist China due to the influence that competing ideologies had on the implementation of policies of reform. In general the author appears to have researched the book well, and it includes a wealth of information on ideology, policy, and economic reform in support of a well written argument."},{"Title":"Poems","review":"The poetry in this book covers the full spectrum of emotions.

Marc, a young college graduate from London, has returned to an unnamed island, much like the author's island of Sri Lanka, on a mission to connect with his father's memory. His father, a military pilot, left the family in England when Marc was a very young child and returned to the island where he died while on a mission. Marc's doting grandfather, who raised him, never understood what drove his son to return to the very island he himself had escaped.The novel opens with Marc's arrival at the island by boat, and Gunesekera quickly establishes the mood and the themes of freedom and repression, and past and present, as the boatman, upon his arrival, releases two flying fish, accidentally netted during the trip. The island is under military control, and the hotel where Marc stays strictly limits his movements.In an intensely romantic scene, Marc escapes the stultifying restrictions one day and meets Uva, a young woman who is trying to repopulate the forest with native birds and animals, all of which have disappeared during the long war. When Marc is suddenly rendered unconscious and Uva disappears from his life, the mood changes instantly from romance to surreality, as Marc finds himself in captivity, enduring a regimented life more akin to science fiction than the heights of romance. Mind-numbing violence, brutally perpetrated by the military to remove any question of free thought and independent activity in the population, is the only constant in the lives of the characters, as Gunesekera explores our need to remain connected to our pasts and the ways in which our futures are outgrowths of our pasts. The graphically described violence further sets into sharp relief themes of personal identity, the desire for beauty, and the need to protect and preserve the natural world.Sometimes enigmatic and even a bit preachy, the novel is at once magical and nightmarish, full of myth and allegory at the same time that it offers haunting, cautionary tales about the past and the use of violence to change the present and affect the future. Echoes of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the fall of man, legends about peacocks and leopards, and episodes telling the importance of love and respect pervade the novel, giving it immense color and depth. Clearly a pacifist, Gunesekera says, \\"The art of killing cannot be our finest achievement...Nothing is inevitable.\\" But Gunesekera does not believe in being completely passive or non-violent when faced with true threats to life. \\"Sometimes you have to sacrifice your innocence to protect this world,\\" he says. In this memorable novel with its stunning depictions of nature, especially birds and butterflies as they try to survive the depredations of man, he makes a powerful, ecological and political statement, presenting characters who try to create gardens of their own out of the decimated gardens of their pasts.

It is a great book for pros and anti-death penalty believers. Too many time I have read studies on the death penalty which are inconsistent. I have yet to see evidence that shows a rise in the murder rate when capital punishment is in effect consistently. The only reason why I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after researching boths sides of the argument and there refutations, I became a supporter of the death penalty. But it's still a good read though since it contained numerous facts and views that I did not know before. I encourage all to not come to a conclusion on a specific topic without hearing and researching both sides. And not commenting on hoping that people will come to their senses and abolish the death penalty based on your views. One main reason why I support it is because I believe the bible supports it.- Genesis 9:6 \\"Whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed.\\" - In Exodus 21:12 \\"He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.\\" - In Numbers 35:31 \\"Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.\\" - Paul said, \\"If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die.\\"This is a very brief argument and I just want you all to know that their are good and logical reasons for keeping the death penalty.

Didn't God command the Israelites to kill many people when they went into the &quot;promised land&quot;? The commandment reads Thou shall not murder, not kill as my grandpa explained to me.

So, please, don't use the Bible to justify killing by ignoring COMMANDMENTS and referring to obscure passages.

RR"},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages. Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival. Cos goes to war with Ar.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread. This is not yet published."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"Assassin of Gor, the third Gor book that I have read, is clearly inferior to the first two. The storytelling skills so evident in Priest-Kings of Gor and Nomads of Gor are as strongly displayed as ever but it suffers from flaws not present in the other two. Firstly, John Norman has become self-indulgent. He goes into far too much detail on the training and discipline of slaves. To some extent this is necessitated by the plot, a large portion of which takes place in the House of Cernus, the largest slave trader in the city of Ar (think ancient Rome). Nevertheless, it's more detail than I care to read. The counter-argument is that the detail adds to verisimilitude but if you choose this justification, then how do you account for the book's other major flaw: scenes that are so absurdly over-the-top as to be (unintentionally) laughable. Specifically, the slave auction in Chapter 19, the arena battle in Chapter 21, and the tarn race in Chapter 22 defy credulity. Also, the humor which contributed so much to Nomads is missing, but this is a minor quibble. One other point of note: this is the first story to show one of the Others, who were just hinted at in Nomads and become so prominent later in the series from what I have read on this website. The Other is kept offstage for most of the book but is seen briefly and at a distance near the end. On the whole I have to say that this was a fun read but it's not as good as Priest-Kings or Nomads."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"Clearly \\"Nomads of Gor\\" is the most popular of the Gor novels by John Norman, but I would still argue that \\"Assassin of Gor\\" is far and away the most ambitious in the series. For that reason, I consider it the best of the Chronicles of Counter-Earth series. Certainly Norman never tried anything of this scope, either in terms of the size or the complexity of the novel, and there is a sense in which this is the last Gor book in which Tarl Cabot is more an Earthman on Gor than a true Gorean. \\"Assassin of Gor\\" begins with the title character, Kuurus, being hired to avenge the assassination of Tarl Cabot, a warrior of Ko-ro-ba. The trail leads to Glorious Ar where he finds political intrigue in the House of Cernus, agents of the Priest-Kings, spaceships arriving from Earth with new female captives, a dramatic auction of pleasure slaves, a thrilling tarn race, a climatic battle of gladiators, and a couple of intriguing games of Kaissa (the Gorean version of chess).As with the best of Norman's books, \\"Assassin of Gor\\" is full of vivid characters. Elizabeth Caldwell is back as Cabot's chief ally in finding out why the House of Cernus wants him dead and how they are involved in the endeavors of the Others, the galactic foes of the Priest-Kings. There is also the return of a major character from earlier in the series and a brief flashback involving the fate of the last egg of the Priest-Kings. However, the depth of the book comes out in terms of the new characters, including Mip the Tarn Keeper, Sura the house slave, the new slave girls Phyllis and Virginia, the young warriors Relius and Ho-Sarl, Scormus the young Kaissa champion and Qualius the blind player, and Hup the Fool (my favorite). We also meet a major supporting character for future Gor novels, Samos the slaver of Port Kar.The emphasis is still on the action and adventure in \\"Assassin of Gor\\" more than the Gorean philosophy that would come to dominate the later volumes in the series. Even by this fifth book in the series the principle that only by totally submitting to a master could a woman find true freedom, pleasure, etc., was pretty clear. I never really wanted a woman chained to my sleeping furs, so I tended to ignore those elements, especially as they became a repetitious mantra. For me the best Gor books were those that took the tradition of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars books with John Carter and upped the ante on the action. That is why \\"Assassin of Gor\\" is the best of the lot and why Norman never really tried to do anything this monumental ever again. In fact, the rest of the series would always suffer in my mind because of how far short the remaining volumes fell of the plateau of \\"Nomads\\" and \\"Assassin.\\""},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's.

I find that if you focus on Norman's obvious fascination with bondage, the series lose some of their flavor. This is why some of the later books aren't as well liked. (He REALLY got into the bondage details, for chapters it seemed!) If you're uptight in the least, these books aren't for you, but if you can accept them for what they are, extremely detailed views into a totally alien world with strange cultures, you'll love them as I do. Add to this, a hero such as Tarl Cabot and BAM!"},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I read a lot. And the Gor series stands out. Great, great, great.If you like fantasy, it is obligatory to read the first five. Nomads and Assassins are the best. You can get reading copy sets off Ebay of these five for $25. I cannot imagine $25 better spent. If you have not done so, go for it, you'll not be disappointed.Raiders(6) is also good and has scenes that'll be with you for a long time, skip Captive (7) unless you really dig the slaving/SM side, Hunters (8) is a bit weak but has a couple of memorable moments, and Marauders (9) is also acceptable and has great action scenes. Tribesmen (10) is acceptable, you can skip Slave Girl (11), and Beasts (12) is very very good. Go for this set after you've done the first 5; your call, the first 5 I guarantee!!!After that, you'll probably be hooked.\\"Honor is important to Goreans, in a way that those of Earth might find it hard to understand; for example, those of Earth find it natural that men should go to war over matters of gold and riches, but not honor; the Gorean, contrariwise, is more willing to submit matters of honor to the adjudication of steel than he is matters of riches and gold; there is a simple explanation for this; honor is more important to him.\\""},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"assasins really does develop the tarl cabot character. i felt that it was a timley installment in the gor series. as usual, norman dives into the natural male/female dominance/submission theme, but i like his opinion."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I think Assassin of Gor is the best book in the entire series. Its not as exciting or adventurous as Nomads, but it has a deeper, richer plot. Its the pinnacle of the Gor series. It was Norman's first big step into the BDSM thing and it doesn't go too far with it like (God forbid) some of the later books in which it makes up half the story."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"Having read every single book in the Gor series, I can honestly say that this is the only one of the early books that I don't like, and can't re-read. Norman does best when the physical action is coming at you fast and furious; not so good when the only action taking place involves complex human interactions.Not only are many of the scenes way over the top, but there were too many characters to keep track of. At times, Tarl Cabot gets lost in the storyline. I simply didn't care enough about many of the minor characters to want to hear much about them.I think it was just a bit too ambitious an undertaking for Norman, and it didn't play into his strengths as a writer. Fortunately, this is the last book of this type."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"have palyed and read alot of the gor books.and seen the movie. looking for the books in audio form. thank you"},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"John Norman keeps one interested with all of his strange characters and now takes us on an assignment. Who is the assassin? I shall not tell you. You must read it to find out."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"ASSASSIN OF GOR is an old school Burroughs adventure. John Norman definitely outdid ERB in the plotting department in this one. Norman's admirable storytelling abilities increase with each book. The first two Gor books were enjoyable but the author really hit his stride with the third PRIEST KINGS, then he proceeded to knock one out of the park for the next three books, more or less. NOMADS and ASSASSIN followed, both so good it's hard to say which one's better.The building blocks of ASSASSIN's plot fit perfectly, every character named has a pivotal role to fulfill. The architectural intricacy of the story is breathtaking, each segment is vital to the construction of the big picture. A large cast is assembled around extraordinarily gullible hero Tarl Cabot to tell a sweeping yearlong story based in a pseudo-Rome. The narrator's use of High Speech lends to the tapestry and texture of the world building, something Norman is a master of.Plenty of peaks are reached in ASSASSIN. An odd third person opening abruptly shifts into first person, in mid-chapter. The story is rich and varied with a Kaissa angle, a tarn racing subplot, a chapter given over to celebrating Kajuralia (the Gorean Saturnalia) and some gladiatorial swordplay in the arena. Also there are two character turnaround/reversals, one telegraphed, one not, and an unexpected trick ending.ASSASSIN is a finely crafted story yielding many surprises"},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"Assassin of Gor is not as good as the previous books in the series nor does it hold its own against any of the next six to seven volumes (Save Captive Of Gor).While I did not thoroughly enjoy this novel, I did not hate it either. The book did add much colorful detail to the World of Gor. Desert city Tor is mentioned for the first time, as is the character Samos, soon to become a mainstay in the series. This in addition to the bringing back of a pivotal character in the series, a man that would become Tarl Cabot's foil in many future volumes of the series.While Norman is overly descriptive and extremely verbose at times, he only held his own in Assassins of Gor. I too wish the book had been edited of some 100 more pages, but I guess the people of Del Rey and later DAW wanted to give him a free hand in adding to his colorful World of Gor.To sum this up, I would advise readers to temporarily skip this book. Return to it after you have read up to and through Explorers of Gor.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I missed the humor of Nomads but I loved the deviant, Cernus. The man was beyond evil. How did Norman even dream up the slaves that were raised never having laid eyes on a man? A wicked, wicked mind maybe? Still, it was very interesting to read and find out their fate at the end of the book. There was a little too much detail sometimes and yes, there were a few \\"over-the-top\\" chapters but it was still a very fun read."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"This if one of the finest of the Gor series - written at a time when the tone of Norman's work was still vaguely romantic and his characters optimistic. It centres around intrigue in the city state of Ar (Glorius Ar!) and the machinations of Tarl Cabot's erstwhile father-in-law - the indomitable Marlenus of Ar, Ubar of Ubars (Lord of Lords), - who has lived in exile since the first novel in the series.Tarl thinks that he's been sent to Ar in disguise to discover and forstall the plans of the mysterious Others, the enemies of the Priest Kings. Whilst a paramount warrior and hero, Tarl is not too bright when it comes to intrigue. Not even his fellow spy, the beautiful slave girl Elizabeth (Vella), who is also of Earth, can help him see through the myriad of plots that surround him.Whilst their relationship hits its zenith, it is also unfortunately near the peak of Norman's writing as well. There are gladatorial battles, Tarn races, revolutions and the ubiquitous diatribes on the training of slave girls and what women *really* want."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"Assasin leads to 4 to7 more books which develop the Kurii vs Priest Kings theme. If you don't read them in order, you may be lost. Each book refers in the opening pages to several events in preceding books. The references are vague, but tie in very well if you read previous books. Among the first five books, this one rates high. With later books Norman dives into Male/Female roles and becomes irritating. This mostly begins with the Kajira caption and Guardian trilogy.

He was hired for twenty pieves of gold to avenge the death of a warrior. Now he was on his way to the great city of Ar, where he was forbidden by ancient sentence of death never to appear again. He knew nothing of his intended victim, save that the man had taken part in the savage tarn races at the Arena of Ar. And all he knew of the man he was to avenge was a name. The name was that of Tarl Cabot, the great warrior and servant of the all-powerful Priest-Kings. And that was strange. Because the true name of Kuurus was Tarl Cabot!"},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I feel like an architecture critic being asked to appraise a hole in the ground. 'Assassin of Gor' looks like a particularly lazy and sloppy attempt to write low-rent porn in a scifi context. Which is hardly surprising, since that's what it is. Assessing it as a story, I might say that Norman frequently repeats the exact same sentence five or ten times in a scene; or that whole chapters are wasted expounding trivial details, such as when a character takes 36 pages (!) to lock a door; or that we get not even the slightest attempt at humor or light-heartedness. Why bother? Everyone, including the fans, agrees that this book is tedious, predictable, repetitious, bloated, dull, and dreary.Norman's real purpose is to write as much as possbile about women being murdered, raped, tortured, and humiliated. That is the sum and the totality of this book; Norman never keeps his mind out of the gutter for five pages. The utter absurdity of the sex scenes in this book speaks for itself. Others may take cheap shots at Norman and his readers; I won't. This book is hateful towards women. That's an exercise in stating the thuddingly obvious. Only slightly less obvious is that this book is hateful towards everyone and everything else. The driving philosophy here in nihilism.(Of course some will retreat to the oldest argument in the book: ignore the violent hatred and pornography, and just appreciate the book as an old-fashioned adventure yarn. I offer the oldest response in the book: why should I put up with this filth when I don't have to? Plenty of authors can tell good stories without adding pornographic garbage. Why settle for less?)Conclusion:\\"They mean death. When they say that mankind shall be free at last, they mean that mankind shall commit suicide.

This is the 3rd re-issue of the series and is truly a classic in every sense of the word. For far too long has the sci-fi/fantasy world been without the Gor books in print! If you haven't read any of the Gor books, you really must. In this day and age of &quot;political correctness&quot;, these books are a refreshing reminder of who and what we are as human beings in our most natural state. Far beyond any of the &quot;standard&quot; sci-fi/fantasy fare, these books delve deeply into the very essence of human existance, and reflect the hidden truths within each of us."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"&quot;Assassins of Gor&quot; is a well-written novel that tellsa compelling story. &quot;Assassins&quot; and &quot;Nomads&quot; aretied in my mind as the most effective books in the Gor series. People who like Edgar Rice Burroughs may find these books of interest (starting, of course, from volume 1).The above notwithstanding, the works of John Norman are, in some ways, extremely disturbing. Norman's books epitomize the sexual objectification of women, and depict a society in which women are at best portrayed as the natural inferiors of men, and at worst as animals. Norman's fiction involves extensive, sexualized violence perpetrated upon women, this most flagrantly in the context of institutionalized degredation through the practice of slavery. Perhaps most offensive, Norman panders to his readers' lowest and most dangerous of sexual delusions: the idea that women are somehow aroused by the experience of slavery, torture, and rape.At best, the works of John Norman appeal to the same adolescent fantasies as do the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs: not high literature, but entertaining. Burroughs, however, includes none of the institutionalized violence toward women which seems so central to Norman's works. In the end, ubiquitous sexual violence profoundly detracts from Norman's fiction -- for who among us can truly identify with a protagonist who intermittently tortures and rapes other human beings, much less with a society in which such behavior is openly condoned?Evidently, John Norman feels compelled to prostitute his obvious talent to the impotence of an adolescent audience that is obsessed with fantasies of power -- both physical and sexual. Such fantasies are neither uncommon, nor (in themselves) harmful. By contrast, blurring the moral lines with regard to the perpetration of sexual violence, is. And to whatever extent Mr. Norman's novels may have encouraged repressed and disturbed adolescents to act out their impulses to violent, sexual assault, Mr. Norman has a great deal for which to answer."},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor","review":"I read the first 2 Gor novels about 25 years ago, and was fond of them. Imagine my surprise when I found the first 6 all in one place. The first 3 are excellent, fast-paced escapist reads. \\"Priest-Kings\\" explores the themes of caste, destiny and slavery more profoundly than Norman had done previously. \\"Assasins,\\" however, is another story altogether. First - it's about 100 pages too long. The plot is also complicated and plodding. That is when it's not interupted by truly disturbing descriptions of the systematic degradation of women. Page after page of sexual degradation lovingly retold by the author. Lovingly and, strangely enough, boringly since you will read the same words and phrases again and again, repeatedly. This novel wants to be a sci-fi, Roman-style fantasy but is really soft-core porn. If you try to skip those parts, the novel becomes virtually unreadable.

We also read about her relationship with Rita Mae Brown, plus the showdown with her parents once they figured out she was gay. It's interesting to observe Martina's mindset at this time--in her book, she was still making a half-hearted attempt to convince the reader that she was bisexual and interested in men...she mentioned Wayne Gretzky and speculates what an amazing kid they'd produce. At the time this book was published, Martina was in the throes of passion with Judy Nelson, former Maid of Cotton with The Perfect Hair and future Martina nemesis. I'd really like to see Martina update this biography--it would interesting to hear her side of the Martina/Judy Galimony Fracas, as well as how she felt when she finally retired from tennis, plus what she sees herself doing in the years ahead.

She seems very smart and very accomplished -- and very proud of herself, without coming off as being haughty.I don't know whether Martina's English-As-A-Second-Language plays a factor in the narration, or whether it's George Vecsey's writing here, but the book, while clear, seems JUST A TRIFLE stilted. I'm also not quite sure who was just a friend and who she dated... not that it mattered, but it confused me. It reads like an A+ book report written by a senior in high school, not like a story.Nonetheless, I enjoyed it a great deal."},{"Title":"martina","review":"THIS BOOK REVEALS HOW MARTINA DEALS WITH ADVERSITY AND STILL COMES OUT TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST TENNIS PLAYERS EVER.

It is meticulously researched and beautifully written. I note that another reviewer thought that it misrepresents the native cultures of the region, but she is mistaken (and perhaps overly romantic).

Thank you so much!Now, as usual, Suttles manages to bring together the so often separate worlds of academia and lay-writing in a way that both is relatively easy to understand but does not skimp on the academic merit. Brilliant!Another thing I love about his writing is the ability to pre-empt the issues people might raise. So often, when reading academic literature, I find myself asking questions or raising issues with the content, and the author can't answer them, leaving me thoroughly frustrated. Suttles ALWAYS seems to know exactly what issues will come up and addresses everything pretty much air-tightly.His work is fascinating, and his death a great loss to the anthropological community as well as the people of the Northwest Coast."},{"Title":"Coast Salish Essays","review":"I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it...

The book is inspiring to read, makes a nice gift, and is a wonderful resource for women's groups. The author is widely known as the Angel Lady. Her book A Rustle of Angels is a best seller, selling over 300,000 copies in English as well as in many foreign languages. Other books by Marilynn include How to Become a Sweet Old Lady Instead of a Grumpy Old Grouch and The Angel Victorian Tea Book. She is a frequent contributor to the Chicken Soup for the Soul series of books.The opening chapters of Tea with the Angel Lady recount Marilynn's adventures with tea. Hundreds of people have enjoyed tea at her home. Her teas have been featured on British television and newspapers including The Orange County Register. The reader will learn how Marilynn discovered ways that anyone can be a blessing to others while enjoying the joys of teatime. The book details how you can refresh your soul with your own personal teatime and ways to enrich the warmth of tea for two. Here you will find professional secrets on how to prepare and serve tea for a small group. Unique to this book is the section on planning a tea for a large number of guests, even a hundred or more, something that requires different techniques than serving a small group. Many readers will want to follow her suggestions to reach out to others by bringing a tea in a basket or even having tea over the telephone. Yes, it is possible to \\"do tea\\" in many creative ways.The second section of the book is filled with her best recipes for tea. Here you will find professional tips on ways to prepare tea specialties. Marilynn also tells how to make the presentations and how to serve the teas and tisanes.Marilynn has given the program to hundreds of women at teas of all kinds. The groups include church women, tea societies, charitable organizations, clubs, sororities, and professional associations. A bonus feature of this book is that Marilynn's most requested programs are included in the third section of Tea with the Angel Lady. Each one is complete with instructions for the theme with suggestions for everything from publicity and decorations to the presentation itself. First is a beautiful tea devotional that can be used for any occasion, from tea for two, a few friends in a home, or a large gathering.

Other programs include a Joyful Tea, a Tea of Encouragement, and Taking Time to Smell the Roses Tea. The Christmas Tea includes a reader's theater script that can easily be given by two players. Titled \\"Out of the Ivory Palaces\\", it presents the first Christmas from the perspective of the angels. Of course since it is written by the Angel Lady, you can be confident that this original drama is Biblically correct, filled with suspense and natural humor, and with theological insights that will bring a new understanding of the greatness of God."},{"Title":"Tea with the Angel Lady","review":"This is a great book for those who want to open their homes and share tea time with friends.

If you are familiar with books from this era, they are usually published in segments and later put into one full book, (such is this case). Details on the four sections of this book are as follows:Book 1 & 2: Story of a man named Paul Flemming, who lost a loved one and is on a journey through Germany. This is almost entirely thoughts on philosophy discussed between himself, his good friend Baron (who departs at the end of the second book), people he meets, people telling stories and sharing opinions, most of which is naming and contemplating the works of other famous writers, poets, artists, musicians, songs and so on, and reflecting their own sentiments of the works.Book 3: Much of the previous, now in Switzerland, but with an introduction to a good friend Mr Berkley and Mary, who shares similar interests and he quickly comes to love. But in telling a story, he embarrasses himself and decides to leave with his friend, Berkley, to continue his travels.Book 4: Now with a more negative outlook, Flemming travels with his friend when a storm follows and Paul falls ill. After a few weeks, he begins to feel better, and Mr Berkley reads to him. Soon fit to move on, the story continues. Paul is more on the subject of life and death, and with, (at least to me,) an unhealthy interest in graveyards. I guess he's in a transitional period. He meets more people and is inspired by their stories. At the end, he hears the voice of his Mary in the next room and dreams of her. But instead of seeing her, he leaves to continue his travels.Mostly theory and observation, but not enough practice. Given his circumstances, I'd imagine he'd be going through changes. Some interesting introspection and thoughts on life; though, if you're looking for a story with a definite feeling of beginning, middle and end, this is more of a philosopher's book told through the heart of a young man in the midst of a deep existential crisis.PS. I'm under the assumption, also, that Longfellow chose the name Hyperion from the uncompleted epic poem of John Keats (as Longfellow seems to be a fan), since the poem talks about despair of the Titans and their fall to the Olympions. Keats temporarily gave up because it felt too Milton-esk (which Longfellow seems to also be a fan) and from tending to his brother who succumbed to death from TB in 1819. Later Keats attempted continuing the poem (The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream): \\"framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding\\"..... Of course, for all I know, Longfellow mentioned this in the Introduction, which I did not read...Ah, as for aesthetics, this is a lovely little edition."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I am just sorry that more people didn't enjoy the book as much as I did. Actually, I should not say enjoy...the book hit too close to home to be so enjoyable, as I, too, am a manic depressive. I am 19 years old and even though I have no children of my own, I do know, when my mind allows me to think clearly, the pain and hardship my condition causes my family. I think Gibbons portrayed a person with such an illness in a true and poignant way, as she herself suffers from the condition. It is not an easy life to live and she illustrates that in the book. Some thought the woman's episodes hilarious,however, to live the life is to know, and it's not funny at all. It is a matter of getting up every day and not knowing how you will feel or what you will do. It is a matter of hurting those you love unintentionally on a daily basis, hurting yourself on a daily basis, and never knowing where your life is going. Gibbons's plot may not have seemed as &quot;page-turning&quot; as some would have liked, but the illness, though unpredictable, is not the stuff for an action-adventure novel, except to those who live with it. The book is wonderful, and true to life, and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"SIGHTS UNSEEN, a short novel by Kaye Gibbons, tells the story of a woman named Maggie Barnes with bipolar disorder, told through her daughter, Hattie's, eyes. Hattie, writing from the perspective of the woman she's become, relates the events that happened to her mother, specifically those events that took place during Hattie's twelfth year, in 1963, when Maggie, between bouts of sex-crazed mania and suicidal depression, ran into a woman with a car and was sent to Duke for electroconvulsive shock therapy that was meant \\"cure\\" her.The strength of the novel is in Kaye Gibbons' sensitivity to the severity of manic depression and what it's like for someone who has to live with bouts of extreme joy and severe sadness. However, if you're looking for some kind of insight from Hattie in this novel, you won't find it. Hattie is a completely impersonal narrator; it's easy to forget that she is Maggie's daughter. She seems so disconnected from the story and the events that are happening. The reader gets no insight into Hattie's hopes or fears--we don't know how she feels about growing up without a reliable mother; it's almost as if Gibbons deliberately skirts Hattie's feelings in order to talk more about her mother's antics. There is a brief suggestion that Hattie desperately desires her mother's attention, but it is not fully developed, and is therefore unbelievable.The novel has potential--but, because of Hattie's failure as a narrator, it falls short of the goal Gibbons probably imagined it would attain."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"As a woman who is fiercely close with my mother, my heart broke repeatedly for Hattie. She wanted the most basic thing every child craves: Love, and she spends her whole young life trying to understand her mother's illness and in the process she comes to understand herself and later her own children. Hattie is wise beyond her years at times, other times she is like a baby you just want to pick up and carry away from the situation.Hattie is funny and tragic and careful and complex all at once. She longs for what many of us take for granted--a mother to laugh with, shop with, talk about boys with. This was the first book I read in a long time that actually made me cry.Kaye Gibbons is a master of telling stories that are so real you think you are the main character. EVERY word she writes is necessary to the story. I have read every one of her books and I think she is excellent. It's easy reading too. I read Sights Unseen in a day.After reading Sights Unseen I appreciate my mother and the life she gave up for me that much more. In fact, after I read it I wrapped it up and gave it her with a note of thanks on the inside front cover."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"In the past few years Southern Fiction has exploded into the mainstream. Recognition for Southern writers has risen to new heights and readers, especially Southern readers, are the beneficiaries of some of the best fiction anywhere. Contemporary Southern Fiction has a unique and timeless perspective. One of the most promising new Southern writers is Kaye Gibbons. Ms Gibbons is a shining light and her novels are exceptional. Like the characters she so carefully and precisely creates, her style is compassionate and spirited. She offers an especially unique and fresh portrayal of women in the South.Her most recent novel, Sights Unseen is a haunting story, dealing with the difficult problem of manic depression. Retrospectly told from the point of view of Hattie, the daughter of a manic depressive, this story focuses on one family's struggle for normality. Hattie longs for a mother who will read bedtime stories and bake cookies, but her reality is austere. Young, confused, and excluded Hattie makes painful attempts to understand and accept her mother's illness. While her family tries to protect her, Hattie finds herself the objective center of the situation. While the rest of her family seems immersed in her mother's illness, Hattie watches and absorbs. It is as if she is ghost of sorts, ever-present but uninvolved. Hattie tries desperately to belong. Her nurse and her brother are her only viable connections to the family. However, it is a relationship with her mother for which Hattie longs. Hattie's mother is incapable of such a relationship and as a result Hattie finds that passing her mother in the hall is like passing a stranger on the street.Amazingly, this is a story about depression without being depressing. This novel is a must read for mothers and daughters. In the same way many mothers and daughters flocked to the theater together to see Steel Magnolias, they should read this book together. Undoubtedly, Kaye Gibbons intended to illuminate the ups and downs of all mother-daughter relationships. It is a special bond that even the most extreme circumstances can not break.In Sights Unseen, Ms. Gibbons gracefully confronts a subject that would be difficult for most writers. It is perhaps most remarkable that Ms. Gibbons is able to write about this subject despite her own personal struggle with severe depression. This is Ms. Gibbons' fifth novel. All her novels place women as the central characters, and these women are clearly Southern. What is wonderful about her characters is they are extraordinary in an ordinary way. They are not tragic heroines. They are real women with real problems and real triumphs. They strike an unusual balance between wisdom and imprudence, strength and frailty. Ms. Gibbons' characters are like women we know; they are not Scarlett O'Hara. Ms. Gibbons' portrayal of Southern women deserves praise and recognition.Other books by Kaye Gibbons include: Ellen Foster, A Virtuous Woman, A Cure for Dreams, and Charms for the Easy Life."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I'll read anything written by or about Kaye Gibbons. She's quintessentially southern, lyrical, insightful, etc.And she suffers herself from bipolar disorder, I've read, so this book must have been written from the bottom of her gut. It's hard to discern where reality gives way to fiction and vice versa.Heart-wrenching, redeeming, and definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I am a big Kaye Gibbons fan, but I found this book to be a little weaker than the rest. The character development (usually a Gibbons strength) was not great. The book rambled a little bit. All that being said, &quot;mediocre&quot; Kaye Gibbons writing is still phenomenal by any standard."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Great book. Kaye Gibbons is such a good story teller. She can take what could be a difficult topic and makes it very readable and warm, and you don't feel like you've been given a guilt trip or been hit over the head with an agenda, like with some other authors. I've enjoyed all of her books."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Kaye Gibbons has long been one of my favorite writers. Whether it was reading about a young Ellen Foster dealing with her abusive father or a woman who prepares meals for her husband to eat after she dies, it is as if Ms. Gibbons characters have become cherished friends. Unfortunately, as I read the story of the Barnes family about their manic depressive mother and wife, these characters never really got under my skin. Perhaps it is my failing that I found it diffcult to read about this subject matter and that I never felt I came to know the characters but this book left me hungering for another Gibbons' title I can sink my teeth into."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"What makes a book 5 stars...maybe a theme that captures an era or an event in time that could stand on its own. Kaye Gibbons comes close to weaving such a story. The characters are beautifully developed and never do they overreach. Instead we have a small story that speaks twenty volumes of the forces that shape children. Maybe more importantly we are left knowing eight characters and the thirsts that are at the core of their lives. Kaye Gibbons is truly gifted in drawing the reader into complexity with a simplicity that seemingly requires little writing effort. Don't be fooled. It's almost as if, at completion, you don't even know what hit you, only that you have been hit."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"As a Southern woman and the daughter of a schizophrenic, I read this book with particular interest. In places I was amazed to find my experiences described exactly, and the book was always affecting and detailed. However, coming from a situation in which the family came to economic ruin, and lives were destroyed by mental illness, I found the book in some ways too comfortable. A lucky family indeed that is gifted with the money, the isolated farmhouse, and the hired help to manage Maggie's illness the way it is managed! And lucky family whose mother's illness --as we are told at the very beginning of the novel -- is cured. Still, I admired the plainness with which Gibbons told her story, and the fact that she was not tempted -- as the author of _The Daughter of the Queen of Sheba_ was -- into pitching a parent's catastrophic mental illness as an empowering experience."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"hysterical account of a North Carolina family copingwith manic depression. Unbelievingly moving and piercinglyaccurate, Gibbons has a peerless touch when dealing withhome and the ties that bind. Her characters are sotrue to life that they could be your next door neighbors,and by the time you finish the book, you are reluctant tolet them go. With her latest triumph, Gibbons secures herposition on the list of noted North Carolina writers. Buythis one in hardback--it is sure to be added to the list ofmodern classics."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"What I really miss in this book is a sense of the narrator. The story revolves around the young girl Hattie, who tries to come to terms with her mother's mental illness. But instead of getting to know the young girl's emotional distress at having no mother-figure in her life, or the pain caused by being excluded from the small-town society because of her mother's illness, the central space in the novel is occupied by what seems a collage of independent and grotesque stories about the mother's crazy stunts. As a result Hattie never really comes to life, and the reader is left with an odd feeling that Gibbons really doesn't know her own narrator well enough.Originally, when Gibbons turned the novel in to her publisher it was twice the size it is now - half was edited away before being published - and in the end one cannot help but wonder if that other half is really what is missing from the book. It really is a shame because the story could have been very interesting if there hadn't been such a distance between narrator and reader."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"This short novel wasn't one of Kaye Gibbon's best. Hattie is the daughter and essentially the narrator of her own life with her mother who suffers from severe bouts of mania and depression. The underlying theme is Hattie is searching for a mother figure she never experiences. My gripe is that Gibbon's never really brings out her emotion of this great loss and it makes the story slightly loose and mediocre. I think that it had the substance of truly being a terrific novel but it doesn't deliver that underneath sense of loss and fright this girl has during her childhood years with her mother.Too bad , I am a fan of most of Kaye Gibbon's fiction but this one felt contrived."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"....but ultimately not so sad or depressing that you want to put it down. Your heart breaks for Hattie, but in the end she learns that she can rely on herself, even when her own mother lets her down. If you liked this, I'd also recommend Liar's Club, She's Come Undone, An Egg on Three Sticks, and anything by Ellen Gilchrist."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"While I could definately feel sadness for the husband and children of this woman who suffered so severely from bi-polar disorder/manic depression, there was a part of this book that made me laugh hysterically.Naturally, a child of an ill mother (whether mental or physical)is a topic which will generate sympathetic conversation. The subsequent loneliness and abandonment leaves a hole in children.At the same time, Kaye Gibbons portrayal of this woman made me laugh out loud. From her justifying hitting a woman with her car because she dared to wear a certain outfit, to her tirade over hearing the spoons click in the bowl, I began to wonder if I weren't a little imbalanced for finding it funny instead of sick. The reactions didn't seem so far fetched to me. That or perhaps I know a whole lot of undiganosed folks out there who I thought were 'normal'."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"This novel had a good story idea, but it is a bit drawn out. It could have been written on half as many pages and still told the same story. Even though I liked the story idea, I did not like the way everybody catered to and coddled Maggie - I didn't think she deserved it. It might give other &quot;crazy&quot; people the impression that they have the right to be babied. Tolerating someone is okay, but Maggie wasn't just tolerated - she was given everything she wanted and was treated like a queen and did not have to take responsibility for anything. In a way, the novel was sad because Hattie longed for a mother - I know that feeling, so I could relate to her. Except for the brand-new one, I have read all of Kaye Gibbons's books in the order in which they were written, and none of them measure of to 'A Virtuous Woman'. I don't think I'll ever read any more of Kaye Gibbons's books, because her writing style gets farther and farther away 'A Virtuous Woman', and it doesn't look like we'll have anymore books of that quality. Her latter books have been drawn out and a bit dry."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"This book is the story of Hattie. Her mother has a severe mental illness. Hattie cannot bond with her mother, nor can she feel normal love and affection. I feel that the mother's character was not developed enough in the book, but maybe that was intentional, because the mother's character was suppose to be distant. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 - because I felt I should have gotten to know the mother a little better."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"This book chronicles a few years in the childhood of a young girl named Hattie whose mother is a severe manic depressive. Unlike other children, Hattie and her brother, Freddy, operate more as caretakers than as children. They watch their mother and act according to her state of mind for that specific day. Pearl, the cook and maid, acts as surrogate mother, nurturing the siblings with care and love as they grow older, something their mother has never been able to do. Pearl also acts as guardian to the mother, keeping her from leaving the house in a frenzy when she is manic and from killing herself when she is depressed. Although this book was easily read in a day, it was disappointingly bland and somewhat anti-climactic. I can't place exactly what it was - it just didn't build up to a page-turning &quot;what-will-possibly-happen-next&quot; mindset and I grew bored and apathetic towards the end which is highly unusual for me. I would recommend it as a good, thought-provoking, informative book on manic depression but certainly not as entertaining fiction."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous &quot;healing&quot; of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Well I can't say that this was the best book I read. It was definately a fine book. Fine being Ok not good but not horrible. It was an easy read with nothing to miss seeing as Gibbons pushes everything down your throat. Not much thinking needed for this one. I would have liked to see more of what a child sees in a mother. Not what a commercial says one should be. If the book had gone into more depth and actualy painted the characters with lives outside of Hattie's I might have found it more interesting. For a mediocre read about woman who goes from insane woman with passions to a Stepford Wife whom Jesse Helms himself would be proud of, pick this book up. If it doesn't sound good your money is better put to laundry or a good CD."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"The character development was poor and insufficient, almost like the author tried to disguise the identity of them. As far as what was there, it was accurate, from my experience with people suffering from a bi-polar disorder but I wouldn't look here for any great insights. Worth a read if you don't have anything else handy because it is a fast read, but I've read short stories that were better thought out."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Sights Unseen is the story of a woman with manic depression and her battle back to health, told from the viewpoint of her loving, but baffled young daughter.Because it is told from the perspective of a young child, we are limited in what manic depression feels like, although there are a few succinct descriptions.Where it errs is after the mother is well, and her continuing wellness is presented as a \\"choice.\\" Even with medication and therapy, people with mental illness can relapse, and to present it as such an easy and permanent victory does those who suffer from mental illness a disservice. Manic depression is simply not something one can \\"decide\\" to recover from and stay well."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Quite a book! Not what I expected after reading The Virtuous Woman by the same author. It has its own strengths...very thought-provoking, poignant. My heart broke for Hattie who tried so very hard to help her mother and find the love that she needed so much. I just wanted to hug her and tell her what a wonderful person she was!I loved the book no matter how difficult it was to read at some points.I look forward to enjoying other books by Kaye Gibbons!"},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I had a love/hate relationship with this superbly written novel. I felt distressed at the lives of Hattie and her immediate family because of her bipolar mother, and yet I couldn't pull myself away from the book. I wanted to read more about the Barnes family and their not-too-well-hidden secret. I was captivated and repulsed at the same time.Although Hattie and her brother lived in a nice house and had Pearl and their father to help with their nurturing, unfortunately their mother Maggie was unable to even touch and hug them like so-called normal mothers. Their father was so consumed with keeping Maggie happy and his father, Mr. Barnes, from being angry that he was often emotionally unavailable. A plus to the book were Gibbons' wonderful character descriptions, and I could visualize Mr. Barnes riding roughshod over his family and his property.Things improved in the Barnes household after Maggie received several ECT treatments just as Hattie was on the cusp of puberty. With her Maggie sane and home, mother and daughter were able to salvage their relationship and establish a close bond. Interestingly, both of the Barnes children went into the medical profession.As a psychology instructor, I immensely enjoyed reading the descriptions of Maggie\`s episodes. Despite the effects these events had on her family, they were fascinating to read about because of the increased knowledge I gained. Textbook knowledge is one thing; a firsthand look (like a case study) is another."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"&quot;Sights Unseen&quot; came as an even greater disappointment to me after having my expectations built up by &quot;Ellen Foster&quot; and &quot;A Virtuous Woman,&quot; two terrific novels by the same author, Kaye Gibbons.In those two novels, Gibbons displayed a knack for the perfect turn of phrase, and a deep understanding of the human heart. Both qualities were lacking in this book.Page after page chronicled the mishaps in the life of a manic-depressive woman (weeks in bed, followed by deliberately running into a woman with her car), as told by her daughter. I would rather have heard the story from the woman herself. What was running through her head as she pressed that gas pedal? What, in her mind, was the reason for her seemingly miraculous recovery, and her even more miraculous, instant reconciliation with her daughter?A subplot that seems only somewhat related focuses upon the narrator's grandfather, an overbearing bully who keeps everyone except his daughter at a distance.Overall, a well-meaning book that could have benefited from substantial revision."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I felt extremely sorry for the children in this novel. Kaye Gibbons made me feel as though I was with those children myself. Feeling all the neglect and disgust that they recieved from their mother. Watching their grandfather pamper and spoil their mother and hate them tore them to pieces. They never experienced what other kids had because their poor mother was crazy. Their strong, bold father always trying to do the best thing for them and his wife deserves the credit. He is by far a hero in this novel. The children also are the strongest I've ever seen because they perservered and grew up to be productive human beings."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Sights Unseen is a moving story about a young girl who has a mother who is mentally ill, and by all accounts, unable to have a real relationship with her daughter. The yearning for the closeness young Hattie wanted with her mother, Maggie, is only too heartbreaking. This book not only shows how hard it is for Hattie to deal with her mother's emotional dips, but for her brother, Freddy, as well as her father. Pearl, the loving housekeeper, sometimes seemed to be the life preserver that kept the family afloat. She's a likable character, and it's too bad you don't know more about her. The only complaint I have about the book, or Kaye Gibbons as an author in particular, is the fact that there is not more dialoge in the book. The story is there, but there should be more interaction and depth between the characters."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"I come from dysfunctional Southern family plagued by alcholism, mental illness and the inability to express affection to children. Many of us were raised by house-maid surrogate mothers. The characters in this book were very real to me. I've had the experience of trying to catapult vomit from the second story of a vacation home so as not to upset my grandfather. I read it in one sitting. Ellen Foster and a Virtuous Woman did not move me in this way."},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"The most significant strength in the book was the characters. Each character seemed so real and so full of emotion that I felt I was really seeing the story unfold from a first-person point of view. The way each chapter ends makes you want to read on and find out what events will surface next in the jumbled lives of the Barnes family. I strongly recommend this book to all readers!"},{"Title":"Sights Unseen","review":"Sights Unseen is Kaye Gibbons novel of a family'stentative and complicated love as seen through the eyes ofit's fervent, young daughter. Desperate to capture somedegree of familial normalcy and traditional roles in thewake of her exotic, manic-depressive mother, Hattie nudgesto fit in. Kaye Gibbons gives Hattie a language that iscommon in tone, but exceptional in conjuring up images ofplace and time. There is comfort in the use of familiartv shows and brand names long forgotten by the reader.Although the author downplays actual events that drive mostnovels, she uses tone, gesture, and reaction that leave thereader understanding completely - &quot;She looked at me sideways,as if she were a gull beside which some other bird hadlanded.&quot; It left me nostalgic for a place I've never beenand a family I wouldn't think I wanted."},{"Title":"Eleusis and the Eleusinian mysteries","review":"This is a reprint of a book that runs over a hundred dollars on the used booksellers market, when you can find it.

However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work. When I return to the market for such a dictionary, I will search for better option."},{"Title":"German Business Dictionary","review":"This compact German and English business dictionary, while not exhaustive, is an excellent all-around source for business terms in the two languages, covering severals areas of business, including freuquently used German and English computer business terms."},{"Title":"Sing the Brave Song","review":"I choose to read Ennamorato's book for a theology course at my university. When I came across her book I began to read the first chapter and for the first time I can honestly say that I could not put down the book. The clear and concise writing made it easier for me to understand and it hit home to the experiences that my people endure in the church and state residential schools. This book helped me understand the history,and the abuse that occured at the schools. Ennamorato disects the history of the First Nations people and instead of our culture sounding and being seen as a hopeless people and a lost warrior generation, allowed me to understand that our people through no fault and choice were literally forced by federal law and religious assimilation to change our lifestyles. I choose this book because the theology courses term paper dealt with the topic concerning how different cultures have their own religions. In reflection I realized that our Indian culture once had a religion that to them made them close to the Great Spirit, in white culture God, however, the white culture could not unserstand this. This book conveyed that our culture is rich and full of history and that it was no our fault our generation is lost. I would like to send a thank you to Judith Ennamorato for writing an eye opening book to my native eyes and the predjudices that I had even toward my own people. I now understand that our people are warriors and will once again sing the brave song."},{"Title":"Sombra","review":"i saw this book in a store and fell in love with the subtle beauty of these photographs. being a photographer myself, i loved seeing the antique printing processes Mr. Afanador used creating images that seem to be made 100 years ago, but with a modern edge. Sombra, means \\"shadow\\", and i love his play with that, making dark, shadowy images. i love dancer bodies and this book is an homage to the grace and line of them. i also enjoyed seeing male nude photography of thinner, and in a way more feminine men, which is a wonderful contrast to his other book, Torero, which i went on a mad chase and finally found one that i could afford. those photographs are much different, more traditional and masculine, but still with a feminine touch, but i think they are both wonderful companions to one another. Mr. Afanador is a master at what he does, especially in showcasing the androginy of the male form, in both books. so if you are a fan of male beauty, in all its shapes, this is an excellent edition to your collection."},{"Title":"Sombra","review":"After his first book of photos, Torero, this one is a real letdown. Compared to the natural drama of those earlier photos, the present group seem contrived and merely melodramatic. And instead of the super-real textures--textures that you wanted to reach out and touch--he has tried some new printing or over-painting techniques that are not very effective--almost every photo and/or model is solarized or daubed or spatter-painted or metallicized or whatever. And the poses and subjects are repetitive and uninspired. I guess that an artist can't follow the same path for his entire career, but this seems more like a backward step than an advance."},{"Title":"Sombra","review":"Definitivamente una obra de arte transgresora, es dif&iacute;cil expresar todo lo que estas im&aacute;genes provoca en el espectador, imagenes que logran una est&eacute;tica sofisticada, m&iacute;stica y melanc&oacute;lica.

The state of mind of a fully enlightened Buddha is not truly known by many of us in the West; we just don't have living examples among us demonstrating for each living being, the exact same heartfelt love in action that a mother has for her child. In giving this commentary, Geshe Kelsang Gyatso provided the living example one could refer to in oneself becoming a Buddha. Meaningful to Behold is therefore more than an exquisitely clear and precise compilation of method. It is more than a step-by-step manual for the highest personal attainment. It is the expression of pure love expecting nothing in return that inspires us to become the best and happiest people that is possible for us. Nothing inspires us like absolute kindness; this is absolute kindness in its most helpful and instructive form. It shows us how to be happy beyond anything we can now imagine. A very worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold","review":"Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has written an incredible commentary to Guide to the Bodhisattva's way of life, extracting the essential meaning of Shantideva's precious text and making it applicable to Western practioners in today's modern world.Geshe Kelsang explains the complete path to enlightenment focusing specific chapters on how to successfully cultivate peaceful states of mind that ensure long-lasting happiness, and how to effectively eradicate negative states of mind that cause suffering and harm to others.He explains in detail how to cultivate bodhichitta, the spontaneous mind that wishes for all living beings to be free from suffering and why that mind is so important for ourselves and others.Geshe Kelsang also describes how to overcome our attachment and increase our love as well as other virtuous minds such as: patience , effort, concentration, and wisdom. He also gives an in-depth analysis of what the ultimate nature of reality is and why if we understand it, we can experience unlimited happiness.This is an advanced text on Buddhist thought and meditation for the serious spiritual practitioner interested in deepening his/her insight into some of the more challenging tenents of Buddhism. It is incredibly inspiring and demonstrates clearly that the author Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is an extraordinary being."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold","review":"This book is my favourite of all the books by this author. Chapter 8 is sublime as it explains how to develop love to its fullest potential. The whole theme of the book is that a highly advanced Buddhist monk is giving himself a teaching, often scolding himself &amp; it is entertaining as well as inspiring."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold","review":"This huge tome is a commentary on the 8th century master Shantideva's \\"Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life.\\" It provides a step-by-step methodology in near-infinite detail. It's a definitive text. Interestingly, the Dalai Lama provides commentaries on two somewhat shorter texts (one by Asanga and one by Nagarjuna) on the same subject in his \\"Illuminating the Path to Enlightenment.\\" This is a free book published by Ranjung Yeshe Publications. I have attended a weekend with Kelsang Gyatso including empowerments. It was certainly beneficial. This was the first of his books that I've read. It's one of the best of the 5 I've now read. It does, however, include list after list of entries in a very tightly organized outline-like format. I find such lists rather mythical because I believe the number in the list more important (and symbolic) than the list itself. Frequently such lists vary between authors and the entries don't seem to hang together too well. Nevertheless, this is a a fine commentary to one of (if not THE) classic text on the Bodhisattva Path."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold","review":"The reversal in our way of thinking engendered by this book is not be underestimated. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's commentary to Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life inspires me to emulate the actions and reactions of a compassionate being. It is a celebration of the virtues of selflessness.As is often the case in Geshe Kelsang's books, original and often complex Sutras are explained quickly and simply. The original cannot otherwise be understood at all in this latter-day age.You will find reading this is like grasping the ideas of a Buddhist practitioner of 1000yrs ago. Surprisingly forceful for a book mainly about compassion - a timeless treasure available to us for the first time."},{"Title":"Meaningful to Behold","review":"This is the companion commentary to Shantideva's 'Guide To The Bodhisattva's Way of Life.'

The author of this book is the same rigid character who claims swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm without any discussion of purification or karma in another one of his books, The New Meditation Handbook. He has a tendency to ignore some sides of an important issue like this.Of note, is the across-the-board 5-star reviews. Where is the critical thinking? The Buddha said to use your wisdom. Did that mean almost cult-like fervor for the author? Remember, the author calls himself a Geshe even though he refused to take the Geshe test when offered. Would you buy a book about medical health self-help from a self-proclaimed \\"doctor\\" without a medical diploma? The same theory applies to the author of this book. Gyatso refused the Geshe test and is not a Geshe, period. Therefore, he is no more an authority on this subject than any other lay person.The presently reviewed title suffers from the same problem. Comparing this interpretation to genuine and authentic Buddhist authors will instantly reveal the inadequacies of this volume. It reads like \\"pop\\" Buddhism for the \\"new age\\" Western Buddhist mind rather than as a serious commentary, which it purports to be.Again, with all the other commentaries available on the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, pick a title written by a genuine and authentic Buddhist author instead of this cloudy book.Postscript: I bought this book by Gyatso (and many others) when deeply into the New Kadampa Tradition. After April 22, 2008 (Google the date and the Dalai Lama), I came to realize the true nature of NKT and walked away from it."},{"Title":"Lees Lieutenants Arlington Edition 4 Volumes","review":"Douglas Southall Freeman (1886-1953) was a southerner, a Lynchburg-born Virginian; a newspaper man, editor of the Richmond News Leader from 1915 to 1949 and, most of all, a historian of such stature that it is no exaggeration to call him a giant.His reputation is based primarily upon three great pillars: \\"Robert E. Lee,\\" four volumes, published 1934-35, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1935; \\"Lee's Lieutenants,\\" three volumes, published 1942-44; \\"George Washington,\\" seven volumes, published 1949-57 (the final volume completed posthumously by his assistants), winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1958.These fourteen thick books are not only good in themselves, they have virtually set the playing field for all subsequent histories. To a historian, Freeman is simply there, and he cannot be avoided by anyone studying Lee or his army, or George Washington or his. This is not to say that Freeman is either an ultimate authority or that he is infallible. Progress has been made and new information has been discovered since Freeman's time. (For example, modern metal detectors have established that a few battles and firefights actually took place in locations where no surviving written records had put them.)Nevertheless, any historian putting notions to paper in contradiction to those of Freeman must do it consciously and only when fully prepared to defend his departure from Freeman's well-known line.In his forward to \\"Lee's Lieutenants,\\" Freeman wrote that after completing his biography of Robert E. Lee in 1934, he began to collect material for a biography of George Washington, but he \\"found that mentally it was not easy to leave the struggle about which one had been writing for twenty years and more. A question plagued and pursued: In holding the light exclusively on Lee, had one put in undeserved shadow the many excellent soldiers of his army? 'Stonewall' Jackson undoubtedly has won a permanent place in the history of American wars; Longstreet and \\"Jeb\\" Stuart probably have, but at least a score of other able officers who fought under the same leader and added to his fame, rapidly are being forgotten.... [I]t did not seem permissible to pass to another period of military history until that company of gallant gentlemen had been placed in their proper relationship to their chief. It was beyond one's capacity to paint all of them fully, but it might not be impossible to prepare, so to say, a succession of sketches. In June of 1936, this was undertaken.\\"...It was assumed that this work could begin with a brief review of the status and personnel of the Confederate command on June 1, 1862, the date when General Lee opened the headquarters of the Army of Northern Virginia. Before inquiry had proceeded far, it became apparent that many of Lee's problems of personnel were set for him in advance. His hopes and plans were circumscribed by appointments and by organization, good and bad, that went back to the spring of 1861. Command was not created but was inherited by Lee.\\"After years of research, Freeman admitted that he had found no proper way to present his information: a history of the Army of Northern Virginia would be too much a rehash of his \\"Robert E. Lee\\"; a series of separate biographies of Lee's subordinate commanders would involve endless duplication and repetition. At length he recalled a letter from Lee to John B. Hood, that Texan, the bravest of the brave, who had lost so much of his anatomy in the service of the Confederacy (and, alas, would soon lose Atlanta, too). \\"Lee answered: 'I agree with you ... in believing that our Army would be invincible if it could be properly organized and officered. There were never such men in an Army before. They will go anywhere and do anything if properly led. But there is the difficulty--proper commanders--where can they be obtained?' Enough was known of Lee's difficulties to make it clear that he constantly was seeking 'proper' commanders. Was not that,\\" Freeman asked, \\"a possible basis for a study of Lee's Lieutenants? Might not the book be a review of the command of the Army of Northern Virginia, rather than a history of the Army itself?\\"In three massive, dignified, black-bound volumes containing 2395 pages of text plus CXLIII pages of introductory material and photographs, Freeman demonstrated that the answer to his rhetorical question was a resounding yes!This is a magnificent collective study of the strengths and weaknesses of as remarkable a group of men who ever trod on American soil: Joseph E. Johnston, Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, James Longstreet, Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, \\"Jeb\\" Stuart, Richard Ewell, Ambrose Powell Hill, Daniel Harvey Hill, Jubal Early, John Bell Hood, John Brown Gordon, Fitzhugh Lee [1865, Major General, Confederate States Army; 1898, Major General, United States Army] and many, many of others, perhaps a hundred and fifty in all. It is a headlong tale of bravery, occasional cowardice, steely competence, painful incompetence, dogged determination, selfish politicking, glorious triumph and, of course, total ruin.This is an American epic, told in the heightened, formal and very wise words of an American Homer.Five brilliantly shining stars with appropriate drum rolls and flourishes!LEC/AM/8-08"},{"Title":"Essays By Robert Louis Stevenson","review":"Disappointingly out of print.

Despite photographs, eye witness accounts and other hard information they were unsuccessful in breaking the code of silence. Again Dr. Douglass is accurate in his information and presents the most complete study I have seen on the subject.Betrayed is not a pleasant read, but it is a must read.

I and my mentors discussed the probablity of the things Dr. Douglass writes about. We actually believed we were simply speculating now that we see the proof in writing with the documentation to back up what is written. We now know why when any one gets close to gaining access to who really is behind the abandonment, pressure is brought to bear on them to stop looking.

In this important book he outlines the connection between the Soviet state and the fate of our POWs from three wars-WWII, Korea and Vietrnam. In terrifying detail he explains how our POWs were used as human guinea pigs. His sources are not taken just from historial archives but directly from one of the highest ranking members of the Soviet system in charge of our POWs; a person he personally debriefed as a member of the intelligence community. Importantly, he continued to work with this high-ranking defector until the defector died some decades later. The story he was told was later confirmed by unforlding events and testimony of surviving POWs. Of equal importance is the information he learned concerning the Soviet's massive physopharmacological program directed towards destroying the West. In this day of narcoterrorism, all Americans need to know what is revealed in this important book. It is written in a clear style that makes this story comprehensible and fascinating. I recommend the book without qualification."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"An incredible, true account of the terrible betrayal of our U.S. Servicemembers. Must read for those who want to know the truth about how our politicians and those other 'powers that be' sell the lives of our citizens so cheaply. It is an 'eye opener' for those who think our enemies will honor any agreements we may have with them. I highly recommend this must read book."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This whole book is ridiculous. Instead of wasting tons of space and loads of my time, I'll wrap it up quickly: What Douglass purports to be true in his book, i.e., the transfer of US POWs to the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia could not have happened. Look at the timeline. Douglass would have rational people believe that the Soviets would use the Czechs to transfer US POWs at the same time the Soviets INVADED Czechoslovakia. So, let's see - the evil KGB would enlist the help of the same people they were CRUSHING? Come on. This is ridiculous and shows that anyone can get a book published."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"Suzanne Enoch is an extremely talented writer and I absolutely lovedBy Love Undone, the first of the Bancroft Brothers books (followed byTaming Rafe). Maddie and Quin are wonderful characters and their romance is so enjoyable to read. The witty dialogue and verbal sparring is highly entertaining and Maddie is a great heroine, a real spitfire who is not afraid to stand up for herself. It was also a wonderful change to have the hero be unafraid to declare that he's in love (in this book, it's the heroine who is reluctant to admit her feelings out loud). The secondary characters were well-written and three dimensional; the Duke and Duchess (Quin's parents) were both complex characters and neither of them was portrayed as being simply \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" making them very realistic. I loved Rafe, Quin's younger brother, and cannot wait to read his story.SUMMARY:Madeleine Willits was 18 years old when she was ruined after being caught kissing a young man who was not her fiance (the guy was actually drunk and forcing himself on her). Her friends and fiance abandon her and her parents lock her in her room; she escapes and decides to create a new life for herself, leaving London behind and vowing to have nothing more to do with London society or the nobility. When we meet Maddie, she is 23 years old and has been been the companion to an elderly gentleman, Mr. Malcolm Bancroft, for four years. Malcolm receives a letter from his brother, the Duke of Highbarrow, telling him that Malcolm's nephew Quinlan Bancroft, Marquis of Warefield (30), is coming to visit. Although Maddie has promised her employer she will be on her best behavior, she can barely control her antipathy and antagonism towards Quin (she pretends to cover it by being sickeningly sweet).Quin is the upstanding and obedient elder son who has always fulfilled his obligations and taken care of his responsibilities, yet he is confounded by the immediate hostility he encounters upon meeting his uncle's companion - whom he assumes is actually Malcolm's mistress. When Malcolm (a great secondary character!) catches Maddie and Quin kissing, he insists that Quin help reintroduce Maddie to society to make up for it. The battle of wits that ensues is highly entertaining and you will greatly enjoy seeing Quin and Maddie getting to know, like, and eventually love one another.There is a subplot involving characters who are trying to stop Quin and Maddie from getting their HEA and although I don't usually like contrived obstacles that get in the way of the hero and heroine's love story, there were none of those major misunderstandings/mix-ups between the main characters that sometimes ensue, so it didn't really detract from the book.MAIN CHARACTERS:Maddie is a strong and independent heroine; she's very likable and admirably overcomes a painful past and creates a new life for herself. Like I said before, she's a spitfire who sticks up for herself and it's fun to watch her clash with Quin (and the Duke!!). Quin is a terrific hero; a lot of times the guys are rakes whom the heroine tames, so it was a nice change to have the hero be a man who is normally Mr. Respectable Nice Guy and who meets in the heroine a woman who makes him want to let passion and his heart guide him.BOTTOM LINE:A must-read that I would recommend buying; classified as a keeper and definite re-read in my library. Other Enoch books that I have read and enjoyed includeA Matter of Scandal (With This Ring, Book 3)andLondon's Perfect Scoundrel (Lessons in Love, Book 2), as well asTaming Rafewhich is this book's sequel."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"&quot;By Love Undone&quot; is my first Suzanne Enoch book - I actually picked up 3 at once because they're all highly recommended! I'm definitely not disappointed with this, I totally loved it. The female lead character, Maddie was a great, strong character - and I loved the fact that Quin fell in love with her for that. Their scathing, sarcastic words to each other were just so perfect - totally sizzling with underlying sexual tension. And I was very very impressed with the ending, wonderfully written - not many authors would ever risk the chance of the 'perfect' happy ending, which in my opinion makes it seem a bit too unbelievable. I loved that Quin chose Maddie, he loved her that much, to forsake all the other inconsequential ('dull') things in his life. I totally fell in love with both the Bancroft brothers and cannot wait to start on 'Taming Rafe'. If you haven't read this, you definitely should."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"Suzanne Enoch delivers a charming tale which is sure to delight Regency fans. Madeleine Willits, the companion of elderly Malcolm Bancroft at Langley Hall, is the estranged daughter of a viscount. She became an outcast among the ton when a stolen kiss created a scandal, ending her engagement and forcing her to flee London. For five years she has lived a fairly happy, secluded life, but she carries a grudge against members of the nobility for shunning her. Maddie considers her employer's nephew, Quinlan Bancroft, Lord Warefield, &quot;the bluest of blue bloods&quot; and dislikes the man sight unseen. When Quin arrives at Langley Hall to oversee the estate during his uncle's illness, he not only encounters Maddie's sharp-tongue, but her sharp mind as well. The spirited, capable young woman intrigues him, but she also presents a challenge with her veiled insults and attempts to ridicule him.But, nonetheless, a physical attraction begins to develop between them. When Quin is caught kissing her, Malcolm becomes upset--partly because his nephew is engaged to be married, but also because he is very fond of Maddie and he doesn't want to see her hurt again. He insists that Quin reintroduce her to London society, under the wing of his family, so she can find an eligible gentleman to marry. Despite Maddie's objections, Quin takes her to the home of his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Highbarrow, and the Duchess reluctantly acts as her sponsor. Quin and Maddie become allies, and the longer he is around her, the more he realizes he doesn't want to let her go. But there is the matter of Quin's fianc&eacute;e, Eloise, his parents' objections to Maddie, as well as the threat of being disinherited, which present major conflicts. Also, Maddie's former fianc&eacute; has been calling on her, eager to pick up where they left off five years prior.Filled with sparkling dialogue and engaging characters, BY LOVE UNDONE is a real charmer. Just as Maddie's insolence began to get on my nerves and I began to ! wonder if the hero had any backbone, the author shifts gears--Maddie starts to mellow and Quin becomes a much stronger, very likeable hero with a mind of his own. The character development was a pleasure to behold as the hero and heroine changed and grew, while realizing their love for one another. If you're looking for an entertaining, but generally sweet Regency romance, you'll enjoy this lively and whimsical battle of wits."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"OK, OK, we get it. You don't like or trust nobility. The heroine, Maddie, spends the first 1/3 of the book in a tedious round of snide insults with the hero, Quin, Marquis of Warefield. If you can make your way past the beginning, once a \\"truce\\" of sorts is called between them and she stops being so witchy all the time, I actually came to really like the story. The secondary characters were well done and I enjoyed what they brought to the story. By the end, I would have given this book 5 stars, but once I thought back on the beginning I knew I couldn't. As much as I liked the book, I don't think I'd read it again knowing I'd have to plow through those first annoying chapters."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"Quinlan Bancroft, the Marquis of Warefield, travels to Langley Hall to manage the estates of his Uncle Malcolm, who is recovering from a stroke. When Quin arrives, he meets Malcolm's beautiful companion, Madeline Willits, who he assumes is Malcolm's mistress. Madeline is an aristocrat, who has been living in exile due to a scandal. Malcolm, who loves her like a daughter, wants her to triumphantly return to London. He asks his nephew to be her escort.In London, many of the Ton continue to snub Maddie as if she is a criminal. Quin quickly realizes that he loves Maddie, but knows that she will reject another proposal of marriage from because she believes he pities, not loves, her. Quin has his work cut out to prove to his beloved that even if she was the Regency's most popular person, he would still want to marry her because he loves her.In a rather short time, Suzanne Enoch has leaped to the top of the historical romance sub-genre. Her previous novels (LADY ROGUE and STOLEN KISSES) are well written, fun to read stories that landed on most people's top ten lists. Her current tale, BY LOVE UNDONE, is another jocular, witty story that will also land on top ten lists. The lead characters are superbly drawn and will garner much empathy. However, it is their rapier exchanges and the meddling of Malcolm that makes Ms. Enoch's latest Regency a sure fan favorite.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"Others have mentioned the heroine is a brat, and she truly is. I'm half-way through and dislike her immensely. Shouldn't I like her by page 156, and be rooting for her and the gorgeous hero? I feel bad that Quin is going to end up with this awful woman. This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many better ones! The plot sounded fun to me and Quin isn't an alpha male, but still likeable enough. Its Maddie. She slaps him. She makes fun of him. She has atrocious manners. She's insufferable!"},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"Madeleine Willits works as a companion to Malcolm Bancroft. After Malcolm falls ill his nephew, Quinlan Bancroft, Marquis of Warefield, is sent to help run the estate. Even before Maddie sees Quin she knows that she will hate him. She knows his type and is definitely not impressed. For Quin's part he isn't that thrilled to be ordered by his father to go to Langley Hall. He was supposed to be on his way to spend some time with his soon-to-be-but-not-quite-yet betrothed. After his arrival Maddie tries not at all to stifle her contempt for him and Quin finds himself quite fascinated by her (for some reason). Malcolm tries to get Maddie to be nicer to Quin which results in her insulting him in the most sugary sweet way possible. She seems to believe he's an idiot and chortles to herself about him not picking up on her oh so subtle insults. After more insults on Maddie's part and fascination on Quin's part they indulge in a kiss. Malcolm catches them in the act and much drama ensues. Because of Quin dishonoring Maddie he agrees to have his family sponsor her in town and try to reestablish her in society.I disliked Maddie enormously. It was really hard for me to like the book because most of it is told from her perspective and she made me want to smack her. I don't have a problem with unlikeable characters that learn and grow from their mistakes, but I never saw that here. If I can understand the motivation of a character and see that it is in line with how their personality is portrayed I can deal with even the most unlikeable traits. Maddie, however, did not have a compelling reason to act how she did. I get that some lout stole a kiss and everyone in the ton (including her family) turned their back on her. I understand that she would be a little (or a lot) bitter. But she never really owns to any sense of responsibility for anything. She revels in her preconceived notions of nobility (even though she's one too) and even when shown that not all noblemen are cardboard cutouts of each other she still refuses to believe that she may be acting like a whiny immature child. She was just so rude about everything!Quin was a little more likable than Maddie, but I never got a good grasp of his character. I didn't understand why he liked Maddie. I know that I was supposed to be taken in by the fact that he was fascinated by her, but I couldn't believe it. We are told again and again in the book that no one had ever spoken to him like Maddie did. Is the fact that he was never angry about it (for some mysterious reason) supposed to show me that she's the one? It just didn't make any sense. Added to that was the fact that he had an agreement to eventually be engaged to Eloise when he kissed Maddie. He dipped dramatically in my esteem there. I spent most of the story feeling sorry for him because he didn't have a backbone. He let people insult him (Maddie again and again) and push him around (his father) through the whole book. The fact that he finally stands up to his father at the end didn't convince me of his character growth. As I saw it, there was never any real threat from his father. He may have been able to stop paying for his lifestyle, but I didn't see how his threat to not let him inherit his title held any weight. Maybe I missed something there...The kiss that Malcolm saw didn't seem like a good reason for Quin to have to reestablish Maddie in the eyes of the ton. She never said no. She never even tried to discuss why it wasn't a good idea. She was just as responsible for it as Quin was. I'll admit that she told his uncle as much, but she was very dramatic and nonsensical about the whole thing. Why would she try to run from Langley Hall because she felt she was ruined again? Malcolm already knew about the first kiss that ruined her. He even told her he wouldn't kick her out. Then Malcolm presents his plan to fix her reputation. Maddie tries to get out of it but ends up agreeing to go along with it for a limited duration. After that time period is up she gets to return to Langley Hall having fulfilled her part of the bargain. How does that even remotely make sense? She was ashamed and tried to leave, then she gets pressured into the bargain but only for a while and then she can come back to Langley Hall. What??? Wasn't she just trying to leave there because of the shame? Why is ok to come back after a limited time period? Maybe I'm once again missing something.I was really disappointed with how the situation with Eloise turned out. In the beginning it seems like there's this perfectly nice girl that Quin has known since he was a child. There has always been an understanding between their families that they would eventually marry. She was understanding and let him keep dithering about the wedding date and not being officially engaged. They wrote letters to each other all the time and visited often. Instead of having Quin have to deal with wanting to be with Maddie but not wanting to hurt Eloise, which would have added depth and real conflict to his character, Quin never has to question himself or his feelings because of who Eloise is shown to be. It seemed like a cop out to the possibility of a genuine conflict. Eloise was such a caricature. Everything about her was so over the top. I get that the author had to show us why Quin could never possibly be with her, but come on. A little subtlety would have been nice.I didn't mind the fact that this was a reissue, I knew that going in. I am a very big fan of Suzanne Enoch and have enjoyed many of her older works. However, this one really did not work for me. For those new to Suzanne Enoch: If you did not enjoy this book, do not write this author off completely. Try another (newer) book by her and see if it works better for you. It might just turn into a keeper for you."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"I usually love over-used plots such as the one Suzanne Enoch chooses for this novel: Regency era, heroine has been ruined due to scandal and has been living in seclusion but is to be re-introduced to society with the help of hero. Throw in a fianc&eacute;, a terribly straight-laced father, and life changing love and it sounds wonderfully mind-numbing and sweet, does it not? Said heroine is beautiful, said hero is dreamy and this is the stuff romance tales are made of!Except this book fell dreadfully short. The heroine, albeit beautiful and strong minded, came across as childish and so incredibly small she was unlikable; I didn't identify with her at all. Most times I wanted to put a sock in her mouth.The hero was also a raging disappointment. He seemed weak-willed and blind, and also childish for chasing the other child a.k.a. heroine around! Give me an Alpha-male anyday!Some of the dialogue was humorous, but the story was flat and the characters, who should have been able to carry the story over for a bit, just made the book worse. I would not reccomend this book."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"I liked the development of this story. It was clear and concise without a thousand subplots and enoch kept the focus on the hero and heroine. The characters were well developed and I enjoyed reading of their struggles to come together. Sometimes keeping the story simple is such a good idea. So many HR authors seem to have forgotten that in their new releases - I guess in attempts to come up with something new they end up muddling down a story with just too much ado. Also, the love scenes in here were hot, even if short. It amazes me how almost all of the new books out have the first love scenes between the couple take up several pages with them going through every base and more and back again before they (how in the world do I delicately put this?) get on with it. That just seems so unrealistic. I think there is more likely to be so much passion in most of the circumstances in a story and still a little bit of timidity with a first time. So I just really enjoyed reading this today and recommend it as fun and loving read."},{"Title":"By Love Undone","review":"I enjoyed this book although Maddie did get on my nerves.

Not so. This is a reprint of a book published in 1998. FIRST: why can't the publishers be honest enough to alert the purchaser of this news????? As soon as I saw the publication date, I was completely disinterested but tried to give it a go anyway. Needless to say, after the first few chapters I was bored and skipped all the way to the last to see how it ended. SECOND: This author has put out some really good books over the past few years so I know she has a talent for story-telling. But ten years ago, not so much. A very predictable story with the same old characters. I didn't care much about any of them, except Miss Marguerite -- and she was a pig! (a real one; and she seemed to have a great personality) I wish I could have given this a higher rating but my extreme disappointment over the publication date still has me annoyed. The book (from what I read) has some amusing and witty parts but not enough to recommend it to fans of the author.

I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Your God Is Too Small is a books that helped me understand how and why I view God as I do.

DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book along with Leslie Weatherhead's \\"The Will of God\\" are the two most influential books in determining my own personal view of God and how to make sense of many things in this world. There is not much more I can say regarding this book as I feel that that statement of itself speaks volumes for my opinion of this book. It was recommended to me by the one minister in my life who has had the largest influence on my Christianity...and for which I am thankful.Phillips addresses most all of the views of God that I have encountered in people and then sets each aside by exposing the problems inherent with each view. He challenges the reader to expand his or her view of God and not to try to fit God into a neat little box, but rather embrace God for what He is...bigger than we can imagine. By doing this, it frees the reader to understand Him so much better."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"In this small book, Phillips strikes at a vital issue in today's church: the multiplicity of false conceptions of God. The false conceptions of God that we hold are damaging to the faith and Christianity as a whole. Phillips brings many of these inadequate conceptions of God to light in the first half of the book, which I thought was some of the most poignant writing in the book. Too often we limit God, especially so that we can have our \\"God-in-a-box\\", which is essentially a shrunken-down God that fits OUR notions of what God is like and where He is. This along with many other false conceptions of God which Phillips gives name, create a pseudo-god that we ourselves hardly respect, and neither do those outside the church. And more importantly they do not reflect the true nature of God as revealed in the Bible.I was slightly disappointed in the second portion of the book where Phillips tries to open up a more full image of God. Most of it was very well written, and I especially liked the way he pointed to Jesus Christ as the \\"focused\\" God that came to be among us and die for our sins. However, scattered things in the latter portion of the book I disagreed with, for example, the way Phillips seemed to downplay sin somewhat. The true ugliness and despair of OUR OWN SIN is what nailed Christ to the Cross and was the punishment Jesus bore IN OUR STEAD! This makes the resurrection of Christ all the more joyful for sin-wearied souls, as we have the promise of forgiveness and eternal life WITH OUR SAVIOR!!! It is important that we recognize our own sinfulness and are repentant that we may receive this great gift. Altogether \\"Your God is Too Small\\" is a good little book for all Christians to read."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the \\"New Testament\\" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I have listened to a lot of sermons in my life, often from people who would not want to spend that much time listening to me, who, of course, thought that I needed to be saved, or who thought that none of us could possibly understand a bigger picture than our own self-interest, and I have also listened to people who spoke out of a desire to proclaim whatever they considered godly. This small book is a great summary of the real ploys which may work for or against any of these views in a particular situation. Count me among the people who have had more trouble with doctrine than with poetry, but who might be more open to considering questions about God than about the meaning of life sometimes. The big transition, near the middle of this book, jumps from &quot;Unreal Gods&quot; to &quot;An Adequate God.&quot; Trying to give up the common modern substitutes in order to worship precisely what everyone else is supposed to be worshipping only works when those people who think they should have your real devotion aren't paying attention."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book is dynamite!

Phillips via his rather bouncy and energetic translation of the New Testament; so buying this book was the next necessary and logical step.In it, Mr. Phillips discusses way that we limit God; we limit His power, His influence in our lives. It reminds me of what Joseph Smith said, \\"It is the constitutional disposition of mankind to set up stakes and set bounds to the works and ways of the Almighty.\\" We have these weird conceptions of God. I think they come from Type \\"A\\" overachievers-these people who are the movers, shakers, and leaders in the world-who make God in their own image, so he ends up looking more like a rulebook, and less like a holy being.For some reason, we don't want a strong God interfering in our life, telling us to love those oh, so obnoxious people.Besides, a weak God is easier to control.His section on God in the arts absolutely tore my head off. Mr. Phillips makes the point that we never see God interacting with evil people, only with the Good, as if He is only concerned with the good. In \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" near the end, we see Annikin/Darth Vader have a few pricks of conscience before he kills Emperor Palpatine, but you never see this wrestle with conscience in other villains. But we know it goes on!J. B. Phillips has a blessed gift for language that is flows, bounces, and he creates wonderful images that stick with you. On top of these obvious linguistic abilities, he was a piercing insight that glances through the creaky creeds and misconceptions of our age, and into the holy of holies."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"The basic premise of this book is that most of us have an inadequate concept of what God is. The first half, subtitled &quot;Unreal Gods&quot; is devoted to dispelling a number of popular notions about God's nature. The general thrust is that our personal theologies put too many limits on the Almighty.The second half of the book &quot;An adequate God&quot; was, ironically, less convincing than the first. Too much ink was used to promote the &quot;Jesus was God&quot; theory, adding that Jesus' message 2000 years ago was all God ever needed to give us to prove Himself to us. Too little space was given to what God is for us here and now.The book challenges us to part with our limited perspectives, but is not entirely successful at inspiring unlimited vision."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Being a 40 year old book I thought this text might be a bit outdated. I was pleasantly surprised. J. B. Phillips seems to be best known for the New Testament he wrote hin a language is modern day Londoners would better understand. He wrote this book about the most common ways people view God incorrectly. I would call it putting our personal baggage on God.Examples would include, The Kind Old Man view of God which see him as wise, but out of touch. My favorite, and most personal was the Meek and Mild God. This God is ineffectual, irrelevant, and unassertive. Although Jesus was gentle at times, he could show some serious backbone as well.This book is well worth reading, especially given its small size."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book was written by a British preacher long ago but the material is still relevant, although the language is at times outdated. I read an updated version of this book and then went back to read this and liked the original better! He presents many arguments about people's ideas about God and what constitutes a more realistic image of the Almighty. Interesting reading."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. J. B. Phillips is a Bible scholar who writes in a way a lay person can grasp his meaning. &#34;Your God Is Too Small&#34; has helped to mold my idea of a loving, inclusive God. I would say this book played a big part in making me a better Christian. I recommend it for Youth and up. Amust have in Christian publications."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Book was in great shape and what I wanted.Why do I have to type more words if I don't have any more to say to review this item?"},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"J.B. Phillips wrote this book many years ago, but the insights he offer are still poignant today. The reader is sure to come across several lesser gods that he is at least prone to if not fully devoted to. The older, simple style, is refreshing as Phillips does not concern himself with modern atheist-theist debates and arguments but simply proceeds with what he believes. For this reason, the agnostic may be disappointed, but if he should continue through to the end, I am sure that he will not be upset at Phillips lack of apologetic, but appreciative of his sincerity and what he does accomplish.Book thesis: It is the purpose of this book to attempt two things: first to expose the inadequate conceptions of God which still linger unconsciously in many minds, and which prevent our catching a glimpse of the true God; and secondly to suggest ways in which we can find the real God for ourselves.As noted in the thesis, Phillips divides his book into two sections. The first section deals with all of the false notions which are prevalent in the minds of believers and unbelievers alike. Surely, there are more that are present (and Phillips acknowledges such), but the ones that he puts forth are pertinent to many people today. For some of them the reader may think, \\"No, never thought that before,\\" but for others he may say, \\"Yes... sadly, I do tend toward limiting God in that way.\\" The second section of the book approaches things from an angle I was not expecting, but an appropriate angle and one which is helpful for believers and seekers and agnostics alike. He begins the second section by essentially asking, \\"What if there was a God?\\" and \\"What if this God entered physical reality?\\" By doing this, Phillips provides the reader with the philosophical framework to consider the presence and immanence of a deity. He does not force the reader into Christianity but simply leads the reader asking \`what if' and \`shouldn't we expect'-type questions. For the Christian, this is also helpful because it gives them a framework by which to keep their own thoughts of God in check.By the end of the book, which should not take too long, the reader will be aware of how easy it is to slip away from an accurate conception of God revealed, and he will be encouraged with joy and hope do know God personally and truly as he is. This book will spur him on to seek out the person of God deeper through study--primarily through the study of Scripture but also through the teaching of theologians and philosophers through the centuries."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I received the book much quicker than I thought I would and it was exactly as described; GOOD CONDITION.Thank you for the quick delivery and honest description.Traci M. - Henderson, NV"},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"J. B. Phillips has written a book that the average lay person can read and understand and react very positively to. This book quotes a lot from his translation of the Bible and that certainly enhances the book. A good read on Christianity for all Christians.J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\""},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This vintage book is still a source of great wisdom, and thought-provoking insights. For those seeking a \\"pure\\" religion."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Do you struggle to understand why God didn't answer your prayer?Are you convinced that He will like you more if you do the right things?Or do you think God is a lovable papa bear in the sky who only wants you to be happy? Reading Phillips' classic may disturb you into a proper understanding of the real and living God, a mystery whose ways are higher than our ways, whose thoughts are unfathomable.In this pocket-sixed book, Phillips deals with incorrect ideas about the God of the Bible. He's not a cosmic policeman or a divine grandfather. Neither is He a bellhop, a tottering old man, nor a fire-breathing despot. He is a God who loves the world for His own glory and calls everyone to repentance for their sins against Him. Does that fit your understanding of God? If not, you may be deceived. Don't let yourself exist with a God too small for your life.Read this book. Come to know the infinite Almighty."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"In this 40-year-old short Christian classic, Phillips does a masterful job showing just who God isn't...and is. There are certain false images that we may have of God, but Philips tackles these in the first half of the book. I believe much of the views today's America has about God come from the media and their stereotypical nonsense--this is the kind of thinking Phillips seeks to destroy. The second half is dedicated to the constructive view of the authentic God who, it should be pointed out, is much greater than the limited box many stick Him in."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I picked up an early edition of this book at a used book sale recently. I had heard of Phillips, but had not read any of his writings. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I enjoyed the second half of the book much more than the first. I am a C.S. Lewis fan, so I am already quite familiar with the &quot;destructive&quot; views of God which are briefly examined in the first half of this book. But, the second part of the book in which the &quot;constructive&quot; view/feel for God is explored is, in my estimation, good and original stuff. [I liked that Phillips used the word &quot;stuff&quot; so I thought I'd add it here.] Like Lewis, and unlike so many of the more modern Christian writers, Phillips can certainly &quot;turn a phrase&quot;. He writes so well that it makes his constructive vision of God, in the person of Jesus, come alive and convince. Christians should share/mention the book when evangelizing; non-Christians should read it to see that God is big enough to handle their questio ns and criticisms."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book will show you how we all want to define God as we want to, not as God wants. You will see yourself in the pages of this book and hopefully, you will make an honest effort to rise above your restrictive defintion of God. If so, it will have expanded your understanding of your world. This is a good book for a class in spirituality to discuss."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book helps us learn to accept God as He is rather than as we imagine Him to be. It helps those who have either an authoritarian view of God or a permissive view of Him. We must also face the fact that God does not operate in ways that we can predict. Hence, for example, the challenge of suffering and evil."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I first read this book in the mid-70s after a few semesters at Bob Jones University and it confirmed the rightness of my decision to move on from fundamentalist and conventional Christianity, including the parochial Catholicism I grew up with. This, and Robinson's Honest To God, helped me in the personal journey from Sunday school and catechism piety to an authentic adult spirituality. Adults everywhere have been making the same move over the past thirty years and it is helping our religions to grow up as well. Read this book and join the movement from the pious pablum of traditional religion to the savory sustenance of adult spirituality."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book is really rather easy to read and fun. We often &quot;assume&quot; God is supposed to be one way (God is our conscience, God is a policeman, etc) where in truth those ideas are derived from other sources and have nothing to do with scripture. This book points us in the right direction and is refreshing reading for both believers and non-believers."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"...then keep reading to move towards a better understanding of him.In church school classes, in Bible studies, even in pulpits, I constantly encounter people who have a neatly categorized, labeled and filed-away God. The most common thing I see is people who reject a particular doctrine, Scriptural passage, or the like, because they know &quot;God wouldn't do that&quot;. And how do they know? Because THEY wouldn't do that if THEY were God. Yes, their God is too small; and probably so is yours and mine. Reading this book will help us realize how great he is."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"The first half of this book is devoted to demolishing destructive views of God. Phillips can be as unsparing at this as Nietzsche or Feuerbach. Especially shocking is his section entitled \\"Pale Galilean.\\" The second half of the book attempts to reformulate the Biblical view of Jesus and to make his sayings palatable and comprehensible to modern readers. Some readers may feel that Phillips \\"tames\\" Jesus's hard sayings to the point that they become unrecognizable. On the other hand, for those who are looking to escape from fundamentalism into a more liberal version of Christianity, this book just might be the key."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"An oldie but a goodie.

When I was finally able to move to an acreage and get my own horses I realized that the scanty training I got by osmosis from my Dad did not quite prepare me for starting a new horse nor win at local shows. This lack of knowledge led me to various libraries where I browsed several volumes varying from dressage to training jumping and race horses.After reading several books and magazines and still feeling unsure, I stumbled across this book in the Cardston library. This book has it all in concise, easy to read language. Using the principles outlined I have become somewhat sucessesful in competive trail and pleasure showing of the Tennessee Walking horse.Mr. Williamson grew up with circus horses and claims the methods for all training go back to classic dressage. He is famous in cutting and reigning circles. I found his book so concise that I made a check list of training steps and memorized the leg aids and never had a bit of trouble applying them. It really covers all areas of good horsemanship. I do not think I have read anything since that is not covered in this book. The title is deceptively restrictive. The book is very easy to read.

I have used it on a number of horses with great results. Horses learn with no stress. Be sure they know what you are asking of them before you go on to next levels. Wonderful basic training for either western or english riding - using snaffle or curb bit. It's the body language that works with horse and rider, not the equipment.

I took lessons from Charles and visited him in his home. His grand white mare could pole bend at a trot forwards and backwards faultlessly. She did wonderful one tempi flying changes, the Spanish walk, etc. ridden in a bridle or only a halter. It didn't matter.In no time at all Charles had taught me to ride my own horse lighter and with more abilities than I thought possible. For fun we would ride a square, so many paces forward, then so many paces to the left, so many paces back, so many paces to the right, and then so many paces forward to where we started. We did it at a walk and trot. It was fantastic training for a stock horse. Afterwards, when I put my leg on my mare's side she would slide sideways at whatever gait we were in: walk, trot, or canter.Everything is in his book to teach a person how to work with his horse as a partner. It was a blessing to know Charles. It is equally wonderful to read his book.

Since animal behavior is explained by appeal to notions like perception, memory, intention, learning, and emotion, the &quot;no reason or belief&quot; thesis is plausible only if those concepts can be explained without recourse to either reason or belief. Sorabji investigates this with close reference to Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and many other philosophers of antiquity.In the second part of the book, Sorabji examines the significance of the animal minds debate. He argues that Aristotle's denial of reason and belief to animals has a long and sad legacy that deeply affects humans' relations to animals in Western Culture. Sorabji concludes that a proper account of human minds would motivate new moral judgments.Sorabji's mastery of the classical literature is truly impressive, and he forges many interesting connections to Donald Davidson's famous denial of animal thought and to many other contemporary debates in the philosophy of mind."},{"Title":"The Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams : Planning Together for Less Stress and More Joy","review":"I'm in my 40s and getting married for the first--and only--time in a few months.

Married since 1988, they also have the personal experience of marriage longevity in the difficult-to-navigate labyrinth of relationships. Their co-authored book, The Smart Couple's Guide has personality as well as practical advice.Divided into fifteen chapters, Drs. Sherven & Sniechowski thoroughly discuss aspects of the wedding plan. The authors offer true-life cases from hundreds of couples as examples of those who chose to plan their wedding together. These examples are used in a variety of settings: from \\"Popping the Question\\" to \\"To Change Names, or Not.\\" Dispersed throughout the book are insights from the authors' own co-created wedding. The authors even research the history behind wedding customs, yet empower the wedding couples to co-create their specific style of wedding according to the themes and traditions of their own choosing.The Smart Couple's Guide...is not a wedding planner, but a useful source of suggestions that illustrate how a couple can plan their wedding (and marriage) together. The authors state: \\"By living out your commitment as a couple throughout the planning process, you will experience new possibilities and new levels of awareness.\\" Pre-marital relationship building skills is a main theme of the book; the authors cite values such as honesty and integrity as the foundation of the wedding, not the number of tiers on the cake or names on the invitations. To strengthen those skills, the authors give the reader questionnaires regarding \\"The Ten Key Issues of Married Life\\" and \\"Financial Truth.\\"Whether it is the reader's first or fourth marriage, whether the reader is age thirty or seventy, The Smart Couples Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams is a must-read prior to the \\"big day.\\" After all, the wedding day is a step into the maze of marriage.

Sherven and Sniechowski have filled a void by treating both men and women, brides and grooms, as co-partners. It may be heresy to say that the white-attired princess on the white horse is no longer the only star of the wedding process, but it's a long-awaited heresy that meshes beautifully with today's reality -- the reality that the vast majority of men and women who marry DO share in the wedding process. This book is for those sharers, those individuals determined to be partners before their wedding, during their wedding and for the rest of their lives.This utterly indispensable book for married-couples-to-be will do wonders for lowering the divorce rate.

For instance, the author describes the silly tradition of feeding each other cake (occasionally forcefully) as \\"abusive\\" and makes a blanket statement that it shouldn't be done.

In a literal sense, The Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams covers a narrower subject than any of their three previous books. But actually, predictably enough given the authors' excellent writing skills and tireless, creative devotion to promoting passion, their latest offering manages to transcend the limits of the genre of wedding guides. Not seeing a book that went beyond the technicalities of wedding planning and touched the spirit of the event, they took the plunge and wrote it!Perhaps the best way to describe The Smart Couple's Guide is as a combination of two things: 1) a collection of many wonderful true stories from married couples about their special celebrations; and 2) an alternative wedding guide that primarily addresses issues omitted from most or all other wedding guides. So if you are searching for a list of wedding caterers, or suggestions for choosing the best wedding photographer, there probably are better books for you (also Judith and Jim do provide some insights on most of these more traditional wedding planning issues).But there are several other scenarios in which this might be a great book for you to read, and many of them don't even require that you are planning a wedding! If you are preparing to tie (or re-tie) the bonds of matrimony and want to read a book by two authors with a great understanding of issues of the heart and spirit behind marriage, this book is for you. If you want a book that will cover topics that elude other wedding guides, The Smart Couple's Guide is for you. And if you are a fan of stories of love, tears will come to your eyes on almost every page as you read through the many wonderful hand-picked stories Judith and Jim have chosen to illuminate their points. (The tales from their own wedding and those of their close relatives were quite welcome.) I'm very glad I read this book despite its lack of applicability to me as I approach my fifth anniversary of being happily married. Just try to keep a dry eye as you read about how one couple had their first \\"chicken pot pie\\" date, symbolizing their down-to-earth commitment to each other, at the ceremony itself, where they treated all guests to (you guessed it) the dish representing their love!So what are some of these subjects that are left out of other guides but examined here? For starters, the ten key issues of married life to discuss with your spouse-to-be before tying the knot. (Each issue is helpfully enumerated along with numerous sub-issues belonging to that category.) The male engagement ring--yes? No? A list of questions to ask each other and yourselves regarding budgeting, another list of questions regarding invitations, and still another set of queries about finances. The name change issue: who should change names, and why? The authors even broaden the mission of the book to encompass some topics beyond the four corners of their subject, such as a list of smart money behaviors.A couple times I had to take my hat off in admiration to Judith and Jim for the outlandish creativity of some of the issues they covered. So we get a list of sample lines you can use to draw your boundary when that pesky relative tries to horn in on what should be your special day. And Judith and Jim give pointers on how to deal with guest misbehavior. Should you have a bachelor party? How about if you do it as a roast of the groom (wish I'd thought of that idea for the bachelor/bachelorette party held one week before my wedding!)? Or how about if it's done as a wine tasting? By the end of the book, I was half-expecting a little man to pop out of the last page and ask me what further assistance I needed, but I guess even these authors are limited by current technological capabilities.Judith and Jim remind us to expect old patterns to surface in our marriage, and that marriage can be approached as a psychological workshop. Tears will come to anyone's eyes on reading the heartfelt vows that are listed here. One of many wonderful stories is the tale of the surprise wedding that was held in the elementary school class taught by the bride, with the principal officiating and her students the only guests.The authors, while clearly fans of non-traditional events, to their credit, do take some concrete positions on certain issues rather than adopting an \\"anything goes\\" approach. For example, they recommend you just say no to money dances and money trees as in poor taste. I'm not sure I fully agree with their recommendations that bride and groom frontally face the audience rather than facing each other but I appreciate their thinking. They also recommend that photographs be taken before the ceremony, for a range of practical and emotional reasons.The book closes with a chapter on the honeymoon and the couple's transition back to real life. Some may prefer to focus on the magic of the \\"perfect day,\\" but isn't creating the best, most magical real life possible one of the main reasons we choose to get married in the first place? Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski certainly hope so. With their help, we can learn to create a special day that may prove only the first of many in a long, exciting voyage of discovery we can take together with our spouse."},{"Title":"The Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams : Planning Together for Less Stress and More Joy","review":"I am engaged and reading everything I can about wedding planning. Your book, The Smart Couples Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams is the best I have found--hands down! In fact, I am reading it for the second time in 6 months. I can always learn something new with each reading. I love the fact that, in this book, there is lots of focus on preparing for marriage. Judith and Jim do a clever job of weaving the wedding planning into the importance of thinking ahead to the marriage itself. It's refreshing to see after all the books that deal with wedding plans only. Very thoughtfully and lovingly written and I will go back to it often as I get ready for my own wedding."},{"Title":"The Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams : Planning Together for Less Stress and More Joy","review":"The Smart Couple's Guide to The Wedding of Your Dreams is invaluable. I must have read 30 or 40 books while planning my wedding, and the Guide was one of only a few I relied on. It is refreshing. It is written from a more mature perspective than the other wedding guides. This is one of the only guides that does not assume parental financial authority in weddings, and it is the only one that I found that suggested FULLY personalized ceremonies (instead of pre-assembled ceremonies with personalized vows). It is well written, comprehensive and witty. A definite must for any wedding planner, bride, groom and even parents!"},{"Title":"The Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams : Planning Together for Less Stress and More Joy","review":"I've actually seen the authors live and read their other works, including \\"The New Intimacy\\" (another great book for couples).

Although I could see other readers enjoying it, I did not find the book very practical. Nor did I agree with some of the suggestions. For instance, I felt that the writers glossed over the concept of wedding favors. They advised not to do them. I would have preferred suggestions on different types of favors that are cost-effective.It's not a bad book but I did not find it very useful for my needs. I am leaning towards a more traditional wedding and I needed help on details concerning planning. I preferred Joyce Scardina Becker's \\"Countdown to Your Personal Wedding\\". Her book is a different type, however, more oriented towards planning and instructions on how to go about wedding planning and information on procedures (i.e what items a seamstress should be looking at during wedding dress fittings).If you get the Smart Couple's Guide to...I advise that you also buy a book that is geared towards the details of planning a wedding. Unless you are an extremely organized and knowledgeable person when it comes to weddings. As interesting as it is to read, I wouldn't go it alone with the Smart Couple's Guide. I appreciated Ms. Becker's expertise in wedding planning and organization and turned to it more than I turned to the Smart Couple's Guide. I do reiterate that they are two different types of books. I hope that helps."},{"Title":"Duke: We're Glad We Knew You: John Wayne's Friends and Colleagues Remember His RemarkableLife","review":"I received my book in record time...it was early.

END"},{"Title":"Duke: We're Glad We Knew You: John Wayne's Friends and Colleagues Remember His RemarkableLife","review":"One of the reasons Wayne was so popular was that he symbolized everything America wanted to be; strong ,brave,loyal,savvy and honest.His character was a fighter who never backed down when he knew he was right. He was a role model to millions, his screen actions were a roadmap to manhood. That was John Wayne,Icon.But there was another side to Wayne. He was a real man,flesh and blood, and he had real thoughts and feelings,strengths and weaknesses. He was as brave as his larger-than-life screen persona in his real life,such as in the way he faced up to cancer, and very very human.This is John Wayne,the Man.This book does an excellent job of showing both sides of the John Wayne coin,Man and Icon. It does it with stories told by people who really knew him. After reading this book you actually feel like you've had a bull session with Duke's friends and co-workers. It's got a very amiable feel to it.The book also reminds me of Studs Terkel's books. Studs would just turn on a tape recorder and let his subjects pour their hearts out. The author here uses a similar approach. Each story is like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle and at the end of the book you can put all the pieces together to get a clear picture of the Duke.After I finished reading, I wished I had known him too."},{"Title":"Duke: We're Glad We Knew You: John Wayne's Friends and Colleagues Remember His RemarkableLife","review":"The book &quot;Duke We're Glad We Knew&quot; was one of the bettermovie star biographies I have read in a long time.

I have never read any UK printed fiction historicals before. Some of the lingo in it is very different than in America but I figured out pretty quick. It follows the life of a girl named Tuesday. She was born in 1918 on a thursday during some important historical event-I forgot what it was-so her parents named her this.This starts out how she was to be a seamstress but decides she wants to join the mobile VADs-nursing assistants-she gets sent to a place not far from home. This story follows along when the Germans started bombing London and surounding areas. This is definately an eye opener for those of you who are in your 30s who never got this war covered in school. I only remember the conservation camps nothing else so if you want to learn alittle history AND read about real people and how they learn to love even if it means their man goes off to fight the war-this is the book for you. Any of these type of books well good reading about common folk. Its a nice change from reading about rich people.

(Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"I loved escaping with &quot;Sisterchicks on the Loose!&quot; so much that I now want to find my own family in Finland--create an adventure with one or more of my own sisterchicks. Robin's writing rings true about the longings of the midlife mom who wonders if she's got a special, latent gifting. Her lyrical passages help the reader see places and faces and traces of what's true in the deepest parts of our souls. I highly recommend it and look forward to reading her next in the series: &quot;Sisterchicks Do the Hula.&quot;--Author of &quot;Girlfriend Gatherings: Creative Ways to Stay Connected&quot;"},{"Title":"Sisterchicks on the Loose! (Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"I've heard a lot about \\"Chick Lit\\" lately-- those books that center on our woman-to-woman, girl-to-girl relationships. I wanted to see what this new genre of literature is all about, so I picked up Sisterchicks on the Loose.What a delight.Yes, it's fun-- full of experiences like lacy underwear shopping in Helsinki and savoring chocolate on more than one continent-- but Robin Jones Gunn's delicate use of language and emotion take us much deeper. There are word images in the book I will never forget-- like touching the translucence of a fragile bone china teacup or seeing a lone star through Sharon's eyes or watching snowflakes incinerate on sauna-heated skin.The spiritual element unfolds just as inticately as the relationship elements. I wouldn't have missed this book. I'm ordering Sisterchicks Do the Hula."},{"Title":"Sisterchicks on the Loose! (Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"I'll confess: I adore so-called &quot;Chick Lit&quot; in all of its many guises, whether that means a Bridget Jones &quot;singleton&quot; heroine or a Jennifer Crusie-type middle-aged woman striking out on her own for the first time. However, all too many of the &quot;Chick Lit&quot; characters and plots involve myriad kinds of substance abuse (from caffeine to codeine and beyond) and self-loathing (cottage-cheese thighs, wardrobes lacking glamour, nasty boyfriends). So I found Robin Jones Gunn's new novel SISTERCHICKS ON THE LOOSE! a refreshing antidote to these other books, and believe that women of various spiritual paths will relish this different take on female lives and friendships.Meet Sharon, a Washington State Christian wife and mother whose best friend Penny roared into town on the back of her husband Dave's Harley. After nearly a decade of living next door to each other, Sharon and Penny are separated when Dave takes a job in San Francisco. When Penny calls and reminds Sharon of their long-ago church-nursery vow to take off on an adventure together, Sharon is loath to leave her family --- even when Penny explains that she's paying for the jaunt to Finland to meet her dead mother's only sister. Unlike other Chick Lit heroines, however, Sharon has a steadfast and warm husband supporting her. When Jeff tells her he can handle hearth, home and three of four children (eldest son Tyler is away at college), Sharon faces her fears of flying and takes off with Penny for Helsinki.Of course, no plot would be complete without tension, and since Jones Gunn has given Sharon a good man, she cannily provides a bad mother-in-law to ratchet things up a bit. Gloria, given to calling her daughter-in-law &quot;Sharondear&quot; and Penny &quot;Daveswife,&quot; is not a one-dimensional caricature, but a deeply unhappy person whose constant woe threatens to unseat Sharon's calm demeanor. Knowing that Gloria is back in Chinook Springs spreading her own little garden of bitterness makes Sharon uncomfortable, and the various travel mishaps that occur during the first leg of the friends' trip make her even more so (many readers will relate to the lost luggage, airline crowding, and hotel miscommunications that follow).Some of the scene setting seems tedious, but Gunn's portrait of two women smack in the middle of life rings true, especially when Sharon and Penny are annoyed with each other. The author's definition of a &quot;sisterchick&quot; is &quot;Someone who knows the deepest wonders of your heart, loves you like a sister, and provides a reality check when you're being a brat.&quot; What's not here is all the binging and whining that mark all-too-trendy British Chick Lit titles, although they do indulge happily in chocolate. When Sharon and Penny come unglued, they don't let their relationship unravel --- they keep communicating, moving and praying. For small-town Sharon, the biggest joy and wonder of their trip may be realizing that other women of different cultures, ages and stages can be sisterchicks, too.Meanwhile, the discoveries and experiences along the road from Washington State to Helsinki to London and Liverpool help the &quot;sisterchicks&quot; deepen their bond and tackle some deep issues. The fact that Gunn's Epilogue shows that some of those issues took time to resolve made everything much more realistic, and sets the stage for her future books.

(Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Sisterchicks on the Loose!! It was more than just a \\"fun\\" book - it brought out issues about friends, spouses, in-laws and just getting along. I so much enjoyed reading about other 40ish women and their insights. It was hard to believe that it was a work of fiction - seemed like it really could have happened! I loved it and would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Sisterchicks on the Loose! (Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"This book details the friendship between 2 friends and their adventures in England and Finland. This was a very interesting book, getting to read more about Finland and England, and about the people and their customs.I enjoyed the humor throughout the book. I liked reading about the customs officer teasing Penny about her name, Penny Lane. I liked the contrast between the 2 characters: the one free-spirited and assertive, and the other one, more serious and cautious. Yet, the characters were able to come together and have a lasting friendship.There were plenty of ups and downs withing the book, like Sharon losing her luggage, Penny worried that she was going to die because her mother died so young, and the discussion about Penny's past, and the cousin who was going through some worrisome times. But there was a lot of fun, like the chocolate and the visit to a Finish sauna.I highly recommend this book about a good, Christian friendship."},{"Title":"Sisterchicks on the Loose!

That sounds like a cliche, but I can't think of any more accurate way to describe it! As a twenty-something mother of a toddler, I wondered...would I even enjoy a book about middle-aged mothers of teenagers and their friendship? However, the story carried me across the world from my daily responsibilities and gave me a 24-hour vacation! I loved it!Best friends and middle-aged mothers Sharon and Penny embark on a crazy trip to Finland to search for Penny's roots and relatives. While dealing with lost luggage and entertaining encounters with strangers (and consuming great quantities of chocolate), they each discover new sides to their identities and hidden strengths in themselves and their friendship. The hilarious chapter describing their first encounter with a Finnish sauna is worth the price of the book alone! Robin Jones Gunn has created genuine, down-to-earth, endearing, unfailingly fascinating characters.

I had heard at a librarian's book sale that the Sisterchicks series was laugh-out-loud funny. Well, I wouldn't exactly say that. The story did have some humourous parts, but it certainly didn't make my sides hurt with laughter. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that Sharon's character was a bit of a mooch. Plus, her friend Penny was quite flighty and slightly off her rocker. I also thought that they were making an awfully big deal about being in their 40's. Come on people...40 is the new 20 :)I shouldn't pan the book entirely. It was enjoyable. I especially liked reading about life in Finland.

(Sisterchicks Series #1)","review":"In 1982 in a church nursery in Chinook Springs, Washington, best friends Penny and Sharon watch a vicious horde of children including seven that belonged to the two moms. Weary from the mental and physical stress of these youthful activists, Penny and Sharon make a deal that when their magnificent seven graduates they celebrate in Finland. However, a few years later the deal appears dead when Penny and her brood move to California.In 1993, Penny sends Sharon a ticket that will send the dynamic duo from San Francisco to London to Helsinki. The supermoms are running away from home now that graduation has occurred. With two West Coast sisterchicklet baby boomers invading Europe, will the English and the Finns survive and will American diplomacy (Clinton style) be needed to calm the waters and snow that the daring duo dive into as they go from one brash adventure into another.This is a fun tale that feels like Lucy and Ethel taking Europe in the 1990s, yet each one remembers why they were and still are best friends while renewing their faith in God. The key to the tale is the message that plenty of life remains to enjoy for the over forty crowd without Robin Jones Gunn preaching to the choir. Readers, especially middle age, will appreciate these super SISTERCHICKS ON THE LOOSE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sisterchicks on the Loose!

Because they were aimed at the university students, the sermons are somewhat academic in style, perhaps more like lectures than sermons, and I must admit that this book is not really an easy read. However it is definitely worth the effort.This book contains ideas that were developed in later works by Newman. Sermons 10 to 14 focus on the relationship between faith and reason, a subject which the author would later explore most fully in his \\"Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent\\". And the final sermon is on the \\"Theory of Development in Religious Doctrine\\" , a subject to which Newman of course returned in his \\"Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine.\\"I would definitely say that the sermons on faith and reason - \\"Faith and reason contrasted as habits of mind\\", \\"the nature of faith in relation to reason\\", \\"Love the safeguard of faith against superstition\\", \\"Implicit and explicit reason\\", and \\"Wisdom as contrasted with faith and with bigotry\\" - are worth reading for themselves. Newman's brilliance has not been dimmed by the passage of time since the 1800's, and I would say he still has a lot to say to us today, when there is, arguably, a danger of religion as a whole falling into disrepute, due to the actions of religious extemists on one hand, and the writings of people like Richard Dawkins on the other hand! Newman does remind us that faith in God can be a rational choice, does not have to lead to prejudice or bigotry,and that faith involves the mind and the heart.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Cardinal Newman's thought, and in fact it should be in the library of anyone with ambitions to be a Christian intellectual!"},{"Title":"Fifteen sermons preached before the University of Oxford, between A.D. 1826 and 1843","review":"No one plumbs the deeps of faith more illuminatingly than John Henry Newman, and in these fifteen sermons he affirms the dignity of our state with an eloquence and conviction that place him in the very first rank of Catholic apologists.Pounce, gentle reader."},{"Title":"Prosser, Wade and Scwartz's Torts Cases and Materials (Eleventh Edition)","review":"I would recommend this book to law students in both pre-law and law school.

I recommend it for anyone who has had a broken heart or just needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"Chick Fu: The Man's Guide to Surviving Women or Secrets from the Other Team's Playbook","review":"This has got to be one of the funniest books I have read in years. I can't believe all of the crazy stuff the chicks in this book do the poor guys! I admit it, it reminds me of a few personal stories from over the years. It all starts off with \\"The Story of Og,\\" Mack's first tale of all the crazy ways that chicks try to get their way with guys. its a parable that rings true.This book genuinely affected me in a good way: I laughed, I felt bad for the guys, and I have to admit that I learned a few things that I didn't know before. For example, how to recognize when a woman is playing me for a sap. I also learned the secret moves any dude can make to protect himself from getting hurt.In this world of boring \\"re-imagined\\" remakes of old movies and copy-cat, generic, lame entertainment, finding an original, unpredictable and creative book like Chick Fu is a breath of fresh air.

Instead, those students might be best served by a set of Netter's Anatomy flashcards - just pulling the muscle cards from the set would create something similar to a pocket guide with considerable detail.What this pocket guide IS fantastic for is when you want to show a client which muscle(s) you are targetting. Sure, some clients will be interested and/or knowledgeable enough to want to see more advanced materials, but I have found that for most clients the clarity and simplicity of the muscle pictures and info in this pocket manual are exactly the right amount of info to try to convey.If you are not just a student but are actually a practitioner working with clients, this pocket atlas can serve as an inexpensive yet effective and handy addition to your client education materials."},{"Title":"Pocket Atlas of the Moving Body: For All Students of Human Biology, Medicine, Sports and Physical Therapy","review":"All trainers should own this book.

Set in an evocatively depicted 1950s Hong Kong, this book is a devastatingly funny account of Chinese culture and family life. In many ways it remains acccurate even today.The Monkey King contains many many wonderful insights into colonialism, Confucianism and family politics. This is a humane, arch and beautifully-written piece of social and human analysis blended with touches of whimsy and magical realism.Like Sun Wu Kong the famous Monkey King of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Wallace uses his brains, sleight of hand and force of imagination to eventually pull success from the jaws of failure. However, the disturbing ending of the book points to deeper and darker forces at work within this sunny and good-humored tale.Some people may have a problem with the &quot;dialect&quot; that Mo has his Cantonese-speaking characters use when they are speaking &quot;Chinglish&quot;, personally I think it's a marvellous use of an artistic convention to confront speakers of standard English with the fact that local dialect adaptations of English (not elite-sanctioned text-book varieties) are the standard method of communication in many different places.Despite the official pronouncements, this book is actually alive and well and available through the UK Amazon site. It is published by Mo's own Paddleless Press which he set up in 1995 after he sacked Random House as his publisher."},{"Title":"The Monkey King","review":"This story of a Cantonese family in Hong Kong is filled with warmth and humor. It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Monkey King","review":"I first read this novel, set in 1950's Hong Kong, while living in Hong Kong in the nineteen nineties - a cracking good read.An eccentric Chinese family living in a crumbling, atmospheric town house (of the kind that has, alas, been utterly swept away by remorseless development) is slowly revealed to the reader in absorbing, fascinating detail. I was amazed, as a Hong Kong resident, at how many of the actions and attitudes of Mr Mo's fictional family were still to be encountered in nineteen nineties Hong Kong (and no doubt today). I felt I met these people, or observed them, many times while living there.A sad, funny, ironic book that gains in strength by not becoming sentimental about Hong Kong, nor pulling any punches. Like other accurate reads about Hong Kong (such as Paul Theroux's Kowloon Tong - read it if you like this one), Monkey King tended to put a bee in the bonnet of some readers, chiefly those types so well-described by Mr Mo herein, and may be a painful read for some. But the detached reader has in store for him an excellent story, great characters and (an added plus) a book that is very informative about the Hong Kong of reality."},{"Title":"The Monkey King","review":"Several times i laughed out loud. It wasn't a comfortable laughter, though, because all people in this Hongkong-Chinese family novel (with a mild outsider as main actor) are unsympathetic - just everyone. Mo also makes them talk a Pidgin English that feels degenerate in written form. Anyway it is nice to observe family life. In the books first half nothing much goes on; if a household member dies, the problem is calmly approached with some cerenomy and less emotion.There are interesting, mildly bizarre intercultural encounters, seen with Chinese eyes. Side figures bear cute names such as Mabel Yip or Pippy da Souza - you gotta love it. The novel is clearly split in several parts: town - village - back to town. The second half has a few weird ongoings which probably only Chinese or old Hongkong hands will fully treasure.Mo English sounds energetic, erudite and non-judgementally sarcastic, I found his tone rather gripping. To me as a non-native English reader, he is certainly more difficult than say Naipaul or Theroux; but he's never dull.The Hongkong novels I liked most so far are Suzie Wong and Kowloon Tong - both written from a westerners point of view. Not bad I thought was A Many Splendoured Thing, with a more Chinese angle."},{"Title":"The Monkey King","review":"I am not going to relate what is in the book - there are enough descripitons of it's contents - and I am not going to analyse it. I only wanted to write, that I could not put the book down. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Monkey King","review":"Timothy Mo, the twice Booker Prize nominated writer of part Chinese descent, writes with confidence and authority about the marriage of an outsider (Wallace) into a Cantonese family and his eventual acceptance by the patriach who breaks with tradition and hands the reins over to him when he dies. The first third of the novel is undeniably captivating and often hilarious in its authentic account of Chinese customs and beliefs and in its characterisation of the various members of the Poon family, from the loutish Ah Lung to the two unmarried sisters, the elder of whom makes a thunderous noise when she washes in the morning. Mabel is another unforgettable character. But as soon as Wallace and May Ling are packed off to Mainland China, the pace starts to slacken and I found myself quickly losing interest. Things didn't improve much even when the scene shifted back to Hong Kong for the final third of the novel. I found myself skimming the pages and looking forward to its end. It was a major source of irritation for me that Mo makes all his characters speak in the weirdest past tense, an attempt no doubt to capture in dialogue the ungrammatical English used by Hongkongers, but it only comes across as cute and condescending. &quot;The Monkey King&quot; reads like the real thing for the most part but is ultimately disappointing."},{"Title":"Behind the Message: Information Strategies for Communicators","review":"I received this product in a timely manner. Great service and great price! I will definitely purchase again from Amazon.com.Thanks for everything!"},{"Title":"Lady Wu","review":"This is the classic story of a Chinese woman. Lady Wu is power hungry and will go to any length to get and keep power. She is an expert manipulator, and destroys everyone in her path. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. The best Chinese novel I have ever read. Lin Yu Tang was a genius. His other books are also excellent, I recommend them all highly."},{"Title":"Lady Wu","review":"The story of Wu Zetian is a fascinating and important detour in the history of China's most glorious era, the Great Tang Dynasty. \\"Lady Wu\\" began her career as one of the minor girls of Li Shimin, who more-or-less founded the Tang, and (maybe with the Kang Xi emperor of the Qing dynasty) one of the greatest rulers in China's long history. After his death, she latched on to his son, the new emperor, seduced and dominated him, murdered most of their children, took over China, and tried to found her own dynasty. In short, she's one of those bad girls who make history that the bumper sticker talks about -- not a career woman you want to mess with.Told by Lin Yutang -- and who better to tell it? -- this is the only slightly fictionalized story of her rise to power, what she did with that power -- sex, religion, megalomania, mass-murder, the poorly planned new dynasty -- and how the Tang ultimately got back its groove. Lin puts the story in the pen of a lucky Tang prince who survived Wu's purges. Like all Lin's writing, this book is work of profound humanism, with ironic distaste for the cruelty, somewhat understated and without ignoring Lady Wu's real genius. It is probably not a coincidence that this book was written while Chairman Mao was doing even worse things to the China Lin loved so deeply, but Lin manages to avoid sounding audibly on that chord.A few years ago I surveyed two or three dozen people in Shanghai and Henan. One of the questions I asked them was whom their favorite ruler was. I didn't think to include He Zetian in the survey, but one girl wrote her name in anyway. I was surprised to find that along with Tai Zong, Kang Xi, and Sun Yat-sen, not only Mao, but Qin Shihuang, the cruel Qin ruler, ran neck-and-neck for the top spot. It only goes to show that, if you break a lot of eggs, most people won't mind if the omelette comes out to their liking. Reading this book, I did not find the thought comforting.If only all history books were like this! I read it in a day or two."},{"Title":"Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy Of Intellectual Property (Critical Studies in Communication and in the Cultural Industries)","review":"In the field of political economy one looks at the real-world effects of laws and regulations, how they are applied, and who applies them. Here Ronald Bettig applies this type of analysis to the specific areas of copyright law and intellectual property, in which there is not just the letter of the law, but also the concentration of power and control that vested interests can achieve through the application of that law. The exercising of copyright law is usually accompanied by rhetoric about compensating the creators of original content. However, look closely and you'll find that legal actions are often enacted by large corporations, who have gained control of the copyrights for creative work, in order to preserve their own profitability. Another issue is the public domain and free marketplace of ideas that are guaranteed by the constitution, but are increasingly restricted by power grabs from corporations. For example, the amount of time before a copyrighted work enters the public domain has been miraculously increased by lawmakers every time Mickey Mouse was about to graduate from the clutches of Disney.Bettig illustrates cases in cable television and home taping in which the media firms used heavy-handed applications of copyright law, as well as big-money lawyers, to control or crush technologies that might have damaged their profitability, all under facetious claims of protecting creativity. Through Bettig's specific focus on copyright law here, you will see how the letter of the law doesn't always come to pass when the two sides of a legal battle have vastly different amounts of money and political power. Also, watch for a future edition of this book in which Bettig could apply this analysis to the fascinating realm of music file sharing. After reading this edition you won't be surprised that downloading an MP3 file creates far deeper issues than a loss of a sale for a musical artist.

I kept it carefully stored, and have actualy purchased a second used copy, to avoid wear and tear on the 1st one. The actual book itself is an old fashioned, high quality affair with enameled paper, consisting of selected copies of letters to and from Ansel Adams, some well printed photographs, and show that Ansel was not always that friendly, had some deep convictions, and was more than willing to go to the line to defend his viewpoints and those of others. His dislike of the Reagan Administration was profound. If you're a photographer, and a reader of and about photography, you will like this book. There's really nothing bad about it except for...The dust cover. For some reason, this dust cover is incredibly sensitive to light and my preserved copy, sitting on a dark shelf for over 10years has faded where a slight amount of line from a SHADED window struck it in the afternoon only. If you buy one of the books, and want a perfect copy, stipulate that the dust cover has to be GREEN, NOT BROWN!!!"},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Incomplete is how this book seemed to me. I've always liked David Weber's writing style. A lot of the time it seems crisp and smooth, and no one can write battle scenes, spaceship-to-spaceship or sword to sword like he can. He's character development is weak, and this book continues that unimpressive streak. Also, there seemed to be a lot of chapters devoted to Leana, but I'm not sure why. Her perspective didn't really improve upon the story, and the information she learned could have been relayed in other (shorter) ways. However, if she becomes a main character later on, then maybe her inclusion would be worth it.There are a few issues I have with this series so far. The first is the lack of character development. Bahzell and Brandark are essentially the same two individuals that they were from the first page of &quot;Oath of Swords&quot;. I would think that the events they have lived through would have marked them in some way. I too was dismayed and felt a strong feeilng of contempt by the scene in which Kerry throws small pebbles at Bahzell. It was silly and childish and stupid."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"&quot;Wind Rider's Oath&quot; continues the adventures of Bahzell Banahkson, the first hradani Champion of Tomanak in 1200 years, that began in &quot;Oath of Swords&quot; and &quot;The War God's Own&quot;. This time, Bahzell finds himself as envoy to the Sothoii, hereditary enemies of his own tribe, the Horse Stealer hradani. With him are the hradani Brandark Brandarkson, the newly-formed hradani chapter of the Order of Tomanak, God of War, Justice, and Truth; and fellow champion Dame Kerry. They face numerous problems: a mysterious demonic attack on the Sothoii's beloved coursers, a legal dispute between a free-hold of Warrior Maids (followers of God of Light Lillinara, sister of Tomanak) and a neighboring Sothoii lord, political intrigue against Bahzell's host, and his host's 14-year-old daughter, far too smart and impulsive in a society where women have little or no standing except as mothers and wives.The book juggles three interconnected storylines, dealing this time with the plots of two Gods of Darkness; Weber juggles them deftly, not setting any of them aside for long before coming back to it. Nonetheless, this book seems a bit less satisfying than previous books in the series.The strong points: the pacing is good, remarkably so given how many storylines Weber is juggling. There's promise of interesting things to come. Two of the three major storylines reach satisfying conclusions, though the aftereffects are still to be felt (reminds me a bit of the ending of &quot;In Enemy Hands&quot; in the Honor Harrington series). And of course there is Bahzell, Brandark, and Kerry.The weak points, however, should not be overlooked: the humor is stretched a bit thin; whereas it suffused previous books in the series, it seems more incidental in this one. There's too little of Brandark, and about half of what there is involves the evil-doers saying how important he is (though we readers still don't know exactly how). Most of the interactions seem to follow stereotype scripts (the shining exception being the interaction between Kerry and Lord Trisu). Given how much time and effort Weber has spent reminding us that the very notion of a female warrior, let alone a Champion of Tomanak, is near-blasphemy to the Sothoii, and even more so the notion of a hradani Champion, it seems to take remarkably little effort for most characters to come to accept both of them. Again, the shining exception being the interactions between Kerry and Lord Trisu. And fans of the Honor Harrington series will have a strong sense of deja vu when it comes to coursers and wind riders (a bit too much like treecats and adoptees!).All in all, it is clear that of the three books in the series so far, this one is the weakest. It would certainly be a very bad place to jump into this universe; while either of the two previous books made a reasonable good starting point, this one is most definitely not. However, &quot;weakest in the series&quot; is still pretty good overall, and those of us who enjoyed the first two books will certainly enjoy this one... if a bit less then the previous ones."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I know that one of the main premises of this series is that the hradrani are mage/god touched as to make them into super-warriors, and our male lead, Bahzell, is the biggest, \\"most giftedest\\" one of all. And this is a fantasy novel. Still, occasional subtlety would have been refreshing. The forshadowing was very heavy-handed (enormous man who has always \\"secretly\\" pined for an enormous horse in the land of enormous horses saving said horses from a fate worse than death....hmmmm...what could possibly happen?).The editing really should have been much tighter. There were a number of loose ends left unresolved from the earlier books, and many more were added with this book. Characters were introduced, then disappeared from the main storyline or were killed, seemingly introduced only so that the author could name those being wiped out. I had to reread portions just to make sure I'd gotten straight who was doing what to whom and where. The maps in the front really weren't much help at all. I kept flipping back to them thinking that locations should be clearly labeled on them, maybe even travel paths, but they weren't.The cover picture was just wrong. I kept trying to figure out who the grumpy-looking \\"chick\\" with her boobs hanging out was supposed to be. See the cover of \\"The War God's Own\\" for a much more appropriate representation of what the male and female lead would be wearing, then add a layer of gore and damage, since they had just finished a battle.A friend loaned me the three books in this series, and they sat for months before I finally decided to read them because the descriptions on the back covers sounded too \\"over the top\\". I was pleasantly surprised. The first two books were good enough that I wanted to read the third. This book was okay, and I will read the next one in the series to find out what happens, but I'm really hoping that they will clean the fourth book up before it's published. Maybe they'll even make the cover artist actually read the book, too."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"The main problem with this book is that most of the time it does not focus on our giant champion friend and his companion, but rather on a female interest that really does not contribute much to anything.I am probably being to hard on the book because it is the middle of the serise where most books regardless of their genera tend to go momentarily flat. I thought the book was O.K but I will not reread the book agian and agian like I did with War God's Own and Oath of Swords.Overall-I really should not be this disappointed over a book I know but I waited for 6 years and got my hopes up. My mistake."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Most of David Weber's work is military SF, but he has branched out into the swords and sorcery genre with his three books about Bahzell Bahnakson. I don't usually have much time for \\"Conan\\" style books even when they're written by authors of the calibre of Roland Green or Harry Turtledove, but these three - Oath of Swords, The War God's own, and Wind-rider's Oath - are something else.Some of the particular strengths of this series are things which are carried over from Weber's other work - good use of humour, brave but believable heroes and heroines, characters who have to overcome their own prejudices and mostly do so.One thing which I appreciate about David Weber as an author is that he does not find it necessary to insert a gratuitous love story into every book, even in this genre. Not that his characters are sexless or incapable of love, and there are hints of interplay between characters which may - or may not - develop into romances later in the series, but Weber's characters fall in love when it fits the bigger story canvass and not for the sake of including a romance in every volume in some formulaic pattern.Perhaps the best feature of the book is that it is not entirely predictable and first impressions are not always right. For example, when one of the central characters meets someone who initially appears to be a bigoted blockhead, there is a roughly 25% chance that he or she really will turn out to be a hopeless case or a bad guy, and a 75% chance that he or she will actually be an honest person who is at least sometimes capable of doing the right thing. Equally some of those who appear at first to be good guys (or girls) turn out to be in the wrong, or even working for the dark Gods.The storyline is strong, if a little complicated. It is much easier to keep track of what is going on if you had previously read the first two books in the series. One interesting feature is that, during a pause in the middle of the book, Bahzell's patron God gives him an explanation of how free will and destiny could both exist: it is a take on the \\"many worlds\\" thesis which I had not previously encountered and for me it was worth reading this book just for that passage.There are some irritating minor issues in the presentation of the book. It contains two maps, but both of them fail to show most of the main locations in this book. There is a list of mortal characters at the front of the book and a list of Gods (good and evil) at the back. The three most important characters in the book are not included, which is not really a problem, but also excluded from the list are one or two characters from previous books who are repeatedly referred to and I found this rather annoying. In one scene two of the characters discuss someone called Wencit of Rum, and after trying and failing to remember who he is I looked at the index of characters: no mention. Eventually to make sense of the conversation I had to dig up the previous books in the series to remind myself who Wencit is (he is approximately the equivalent of Gandalf or Belgarath).When I originally wrote this review I said that the point of the cover art, showing the concluding scene of the book, appeared to have been diminished by the unfortunate placement of a bubble with the words \\"New York Times best seller\\" which I suspected hid the object which Kaeritha has just thrown in Bahzell's direction. In subsequent printings the offending words have been removed and the item is indeed now visible.Bottom line: if you liked any of David Weber's other books, read the three Bahzell Bahnakson books and it is unlikely that you will be disappointed. If you like the swords and sorcery genre generally, it is also likely that you will like these three. But if you do read any of these, make sure to read them in the right order, which is Oath of Swords, The War God's own, and Wind-rider's Oath."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"First, let me say I have followed David Weber from the beginning of his writing career. I enjoy his writing style very much. But this novel is typical of all his latest books. The multitude of subplots make it confusing and detract from his style. The characters are flat and inconsistent; they don't jump out of the page at you and they don't make the reader want to empathize with them. But most of all, David Weber has began to specialize in massive info-dumps, paragraph after paragraph of detailed exposition, which only manages to slow down the pace of the story.I still buy his books in the hope he will return to his earlier form. Since I doubt that will happen, I will probably stop buying them."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I enjoyed the book and found it a quick and fun read.

I went so far as to buy the second ( War Gods Own) in book form as it was not available in kindle formate. I intend to get the fourth book soon. I like the characters even if gsometimes they spend a lot of time talking to each other about nothing."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I was a bit worried when I opened this book. It had been years since I read the first two in the series, and I didn't have them with me. But the story drew me right in, refreshing my memory of the characters and the world without getting bogged down in summarizing the earlier books.David Weber does a lot of things well. His battles have a powerful, epic feel, and the action in this book pulls you right along.At the same time, there's a distinction between being larger than life, and being a bit flat as a character. I don't just mean Bahzell here. All of the heroes are too heroic. Weber spends a great deal of time building up the animosity between the Sothoii and the Hradani, but pretty much ever one of the Sothoii go through the same pattern of initially hating Bahzell, then seeing the error of their ways and humbly apologizing, after which Bahzell so nobly offers his understanding. It's nice that all of the good guys are oh so enlightened, but it started to strain the seams of credibility.Likewise, the nastiness of the villains started to go a bit overboard when they all started giving off a poisonous, vile green glow.My last nitpick is that things happen a bit too easily for the champions, at times. Not only are they all marvelous warriors (which makes sense, as they're champions of a war god), but if they're ever in over their heads, the god Tomanak pops in to help them out. They're stronger than their enemies, and Bahzell's god is stronger than everyone else's. Even the green glow of kryptonite--I mean, of evil--isn't enough to defeat these superheroes. They get tired and exhausted, pushing themselves to the brink, but there's rarely a sense that they're in genuine danger.I admit it: I'm a picky reader, and I have a hard time ignoring flaws like these in a book. In this case, the strengths of the story were more than enough to pull me through. More than anything, Bahzell and his companions are fun. They believe in justice and good and all that noble stuff, but they also have a sense of humor. Even the war god jokes around with his champions sometimes. And while I prefer my stories and characters a bit more complex, there's also something to be said for a good old clash of good vs. evil.I would definitely recommend starting with the first two books, which I think are stronger. But I don't regret buying this one, either."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"The first of this series I had the pleasure to read was the middle volume, THE WAR GOD'S OWN. I found it to be well written and interesting and different enough from the run of the mill product to be really of note. After that, I read the first volume and now I have just finished the third. It too is well written but does not have the excitement or the humor of the second. It is about on par with the first volume. This may be disappointing but it should not be. Everything cannot be a masterpiece and even Weber's lesser works are VERY well done.In this installment, our Hradani champion is called upon to go to the Sothoii Kingdom, the hereditary enemies of his own people. He is called upon to foil yet another plot the a coterie of the gods of darkness and this time it will be more difficult because they are working under false colors. It is also more difficult because the political situation with regard to his race as well as that of his allies is highly complex. The Sothoii love the Coursers and both hate the Hradani. That makes it difficult when the Champion come to save your people is a hated hradani and it gets weirder when the champion gets bonded with a courser. It also makes for a few smiles.Its not his best work but it is enjoyable."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"It's an excellent book, but it just... ends. There's no wrap up. No satisfying conclusion, nothing. I only hope there are a couple more in the works."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I liked the book. But, of the three books, this is the weakest. Still, I hope that the story continues...But... The cover! Don't artists know that a SIGNIFICANT part of the story needs to be depicted? Not this one. The cover depicts a scene that happens after the end of the story. The closing paragraph. I really hated that. Perhaps the artist only read the first and last chapter before deciding what to paint, and couldn't come up with anything better."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Though badly outnumbered hradani horse stealer Bahzell Bahnakson persuaded Sothoii leader Baron Tellian to surrender to him rather than lose to him, as Bahzell is the War God's champion (see THE WAR GOD'S OWN). As part of the agreement reached by Bahzell and Tellian, he allowed the Sothoii to go home in peace in one piece.Named by his father the hradani chief as ambassador to the Sothoii, Bahzell travels to the Wind Plain. Being extremely tall, he sees this as an opportunity to obtain a large steed, something the Sothoii are noted for and why they detest the hradani for stealing and eating their horses.Surprisingly several Sothoii accept Bahzell as a windrider-the first hradani to achieve such acclaim. However, between the surrender when they outnumbered the enemy by 30 to 1 even if he is the War God's favorite and the honor of windrider bestowed upon a hradani, many Sothoii purists are outraged; this outsider has battered their pride in their heritage. An insurgency surfaces further stirred by the Goddess Queen of Hell and those who recently lost power plotting assassination to bring down the current rulers including Bahzell.WIND RIDER'S OATH is not up to the level of excellence normally achieved by David Weber especially with this sword and sorcery fantasy series. The story line contains too many subplots that lack action and seem more like gates to future sequels. The prime tale centers on the heroic Bahzell who learns how hard it is to be a God's champion as challengers come from everywhere. Fans of the series and Mr. Weber will be a bit disappointed, but need to consider that hradani threads go through WIND RIDER'S OATH.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I'll come right out and say it--I was disappointed by Wind Rider's Oath. I had been looking forward to it ever since I heard there would be a new Norfressa book (I have just about worn the cover off of Oath of Swords) and jumped at the chance to read the e-book (at the publisher's website) before the pulp version appeared in stores.IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF SPOILERS STOP READING NOW.Granted, the main &quot;surprise&quot; was telegraphed several books in advance. Much has always been made of the fact that Bahzell is so tall he can't ride a normal horse. And that the Sothoii have sentient horses that are very large. And now Bahzell is traveling to the Sothoii, where they have big horses. And he's traveling on foot because he's too big for a normal horse. Hmm, do you think maybe he's going to end up with one of these horses? What a shock! Not really a problem, though. It gave me something to anticipate, and the scene where he finally meets his courser is one of the less execrable of the book.Which brings me to the rest of the story. The whole thing seemed choppy and hurried. There was a great deal of blah-blah-blah exposition introducing new characters and building them up, then... nothing. Leeana just drops out of the book 3/4 of the way through, with her story unfinished. The evil priest whatshisname likewise steps out of a room and never re-enters the story. Was this a longer book that got chopped down? Is there supposed to be a sequel to tie up the numerous loose ends?Also, the story seemed to change gears somewhere in the middle. At first it was full of political intrigue, infighting, and secret plotting. By the time the 3/4 mark rolled around, though, it turned into a hack-and-slash adventure. All the bad guys get systematically slaughtered, one after another after another. A couple of good guys who didn't have a single line of dialogue appear just in time to die in glorious contrived sacrifice. None of the political storylines are resolved, even though it was clearly explained that violence would worsen the situation and give the political bad guys the advantage. After nodding wisely every time this was explained, the heroes then blithely slaughtered everyone without regard to consequences. And everyone applauds. Why?What irritated more than anything else, though, was the ending. Kaeritha had just fought her way through a temple of evil priests, and was staggering with exhaustion and pain. Then once Bahzell appeared and made a stupid joke, suddenly she felt she must chase him around pelting him with small rocks while a bunch of people she'd never met stood around laughing heartily. It's the sort of ending that might be mildly funny if done tongue-in-cheek. Played seriously, it's just stupid. Not funny, not ironic, just stupid. When did this turn into an episode of Scooby-Doo?You know what's even more stupid? I'll be buying this book when it comes out in my local bookstore, so I can get the free Baen CD that comes with it. Because I am a sucker for the thought that I might get some of Weber's backlist titles free. And it was just good enough that it didn't completely disillusion me. I will buy it in hopes that the next book, whenever it appears, is better."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"On the strength of many of his latest books, the answer to the above question would have to be \\"Yes!\\".The plot has been summarised elsewhere, so I won't rehash it.If you have not read the earlier 2 novels in this series then don't start here. The (small) pleasures of reading Wind Rider's Oath are mainly for those of us who are already big fans of Oath of Swords and The War God's Own. Even there, don't expect much about Brandark or any character development for Bahzell (the story's principal character).Multiple sub-plots are in desperate need of editing out(has David Weber become too successful for his publisher to dare?), especially the poorly thought out sub-plot of the runaway Leena. Why would the intelligent Leena think running away to join a group of people despised by her father's peers will help her father's political situation? Does she also think pigs fly?The book didn't develop the personalities of the principal characters to help us care about them or succeed in generating any previous tension as to the likely outcome of the battles. As a result, the battle scenes, where Mr Weber often excells, were totally unexciting to read. Also, while I enjoy some of Eric Flint's books, I fear his variety of humor (ie. childish slapstick or childish insults, identical in tone each time irrespective of the characters involved) may be contaminating David Weber's writing, who co-writes some books with Mr Flint. The ending is just corny.If I wasn't such a huge fan of most of Mr Weber's earlier works, I may have been less disappointed with some of his latest efforts.So long as we keep buying this and other recent mediocre Weber books (eg. March to the Stars, Shiva Option, War of Honor), an otherwise excellent author will probably keep churning them out. I suggest you go to the library if you want to read it."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"In WRO Weber took the fresh and original invention of the two prequels and left them out in the sun for a month. What was his editor thinking?The first in the series, Oath of Swords, was great (5 stars) because of its character development, clashes between original (and differentiated) cultures, believable action, and witty repartee throughout. My paperback copy of Oath of Swords is absolutely tattered.The second in the series, TWGO, wasn't quite as good (3 1/2 stars) as Oath, but had some re-readable scenes. I enjoyed: the taming of the geek (Vaijon), meeting Bahzell's family and culture, and the battles. I also liked the hint of great things in store for Brandark who was beginning to be less witty, in fact little more than a sounding board for Bahzell. My problems with the second book center around too much exposition. The order was described in painful, multi-worded detail, as was dwarvenhome. Even more annoyingly, the introduction of Kerry was immature stylistically as well as boring, and a huge detraction from the book's merits. Mature character development is a slow exposure of a person, each revelation related to plot tensions; actions depending upon and revealing the character's past history, present motives, and future dreams. Inexplicably, Kerry vomits forth her entire life history to Bahzell and a large crowd of other strangers at the moment of meeting him. Worse, it's the trite \\"I was raped and hated all men until saved by love\\" pablum. Being set, Kerry's character did not learn or change throughout this or the third book.Although I complain about TWGO, my copy is, if not tattered, at least unkempt because whenever I reread Oath, I skim my favorite parts of TWGO for dessert. The 3rd in the series is different.Wind Rider's Oath:Be warned that the book does not stand alone. You have to have read the prequels to give a damn about a single character.Other reviewers have mentioned the staleness of the sisterhood of chicks-in-chainmail plot. I would only add that the original version (the wholly and brutally male chauvinistic world that allows an unbelievable level of freedom to a very few chicks in bikini chainmail if they will only insist on it with swords!) was created decades ago and described almost identically by Marion Zimmer Bradley who called them Renunciates. Weber has added little to the concept while subtracting a believable cultural or personal backstory. I'm still wondering why Leana would do such a stupid thing, or why anyone would take her seriously. Or why half of the book followed her boring and unbelievable story which suddenly switched off without a conclusion. If it was merely to give Kerry notice of something she already knew, it was clumsy; if it was to lead to a further book about Leana, please spare me.Like other reviewers, I was unsurprised by the outcome of Bazell's first meeting with an unattached courser. Talk about foreshadowing!It is not, however, details that make the book fail. It is the lack of originality in the action, the characters, or the cultures they move through. The evil characters are without believable motivation; we are merely told they are evil and that explains them. The sinister plots of the bad guys are simplistic and clumsy, and always fail. The conversations are stilted throughout and exist solely to impart information. Worst of all flaws, there is no humor! (Don't remind me of the pitiful slapstick ending. That is not humor!)I have been waiting for this sequel for years, but I am only grateful that I saw Wind Rider's Oath in the library before I bothered to buy it because it's not worth rereading."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"First, let me say that I love almost everything that David Weber writes (I only qualify as almost because although I've enjoyed everything of his that I've read I'm sure I've missed something), but I wouldn't put this at the top of his books.As some readers have pointed out, you definitely want to read this after the first two in the series - Oath of Swords (vol. 1) and War God's Own (vol. 2). It's also fair to say that quite a bit of this story was about Leana (a whole lot of the story). Now she's an okay character, but if you've been reading this story since the beginning - you're really looking for Bazhell and Brandark (Brandark in particular gets short shrift in this story).So why did I give it four stars? I still read it cover to cover in one sitting (I do that alot so that doesn't mean that a book is phenomenal, but at least means its good and engrossing). Weber has great fight scenes (although there's not a ton of them). His characters are also usually very interesting (although Bazhell comes across a bit like Superman). Bottom line - despite the nitpicking it was a fun book to read.The series is kind of going through an evolution. Oath of Swords was pretty much a straight up adventure - two buddies going on an adventure with only limited &quot;grand scale issues&quot;. The War God's Own introduced a few more characters and started getting more involved in political issues - Bazhell's father leading the Hrdani (sp ??), the political structure of the War God's religion, etc.This third book really gives the impression that you're in a series. Multiple characters and plot threads developing. But there's still a good climax (actually a couple of good grand fights at the end).Don't read this book first. Oath of Swords introduces the characters really well. You care about them after reading that book. If you enjoy the first two in the series, you won't be disappointed in this one (I think its the weakest of the three, but its still good)."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I used to be a huge fan of David Weber, I in particular really enjoyed the first book of this series, Oath of Swords. It had all the humor, engaging unique characters, plotting and a proper sense of scale that is almost entirely lacking in this looooong delayed sequal. I was really let down by the first 2/3rds of WRO, which seemed packed with too much of the author's exposition and too little of descriptive action and (interesting!) character interaction. Seems interminably long with too many &quot;parlor&quot; scenes where characters explain what they are going to do and why, ad nauseum.Even worse is that there is no real sense of peril, the two champions of Tomanak (certainly Bahzell) seem invulnerable and the villian's inept and weak. Threats to the Big BB hadrani champion seem to just shrugged aside too easily for this reader to be truly engaged in the lead character's struggles. Only real suspense comes way too late in the novel with the female human champion of Tomanak.The greatest flaw is probably the number of plots, characters being juggled by the author in a somewhat forced if not (horrors!) pedestrian manner. In my opinion, David Weber could stand a real severe editing for all of his books of the past 5 years or more, this book should be pared down to maybe one major plotline and remove all of the unnecessary characters/minor plots (the nephew of the Baron's first taste of independent command/battle and maybe much of the Leanna story could be trimmed/dropped out or placed as short stories in some future anthology). I've read a great set of books when he works with joint authorship with Eric Flint (even with John Ringo, as much as I dislike the man's politics) in his Honor Harrington anthologies and the 1632-universe of Flint's.It might be that David weber, like too many sucessful authors these days, needs to maybe cut back on the number of series/projects he's commited to (sometimes I curse the coming of the computer/word processing software, which allows authors maybe to write too much too quickly and dilute that which made the writing so special in the first place)."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Weber has faltered with this series, and, oddly, he has faltered in much the same way he did with his last Honor Harrington book. Both the Bazhzell and HH series have lived on their great action scenes. Well, the last HH book (war of honor) had virtually no action until the final few chapters, and neither does this Bahzell book. How little? This book has 46 chapters. Bahzell does not draw his sword in anger for the first time until chapter 41, Kerry, not until chapter 44. Most of the rest of the book is dialogue. And not particularly interesting or amusing dialogue either. Those of you who follow the HH series might be thinking about the dejavu of that. Weber also spent virtually his entire last book on dialogue, and not very interesting dialogue there, either.Others have noted the plot line involving Leeana, the teen war maid. I found it intensely dull, and by mid book was not even bothering to skim any more - I was skipping all the scenes of her entirely. Unfortunately, if other reviewers are right, Weber is setting her and the boring war maids up as the centrepiece of at least the next novel. Sad, very sad.This book could have been awesome. I had expected to see scenes of the high and mighty Sothoi trying to wrap their minds around Bahzell and company. We got little of that, and not cleverly done either. Maybe Weber is losing his touch. I'd hoped to see something of what the Hradani were building with the war done, as well, but we got nothing there.Don't get me wrong; this book is worth reading. There are some decent scenes and - leaving aside the girl Leeana - the rest is fairly readable. But you might want to wait for the paperback version. And watch out if there's another book and it features the boring young Leeana."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Bahzell Bahnakson is the first hradani to be Champion of the war-god Tomanak, which means that he's stuck righting wrongs, fighting evil, and generally carrying on even if the people he's helping don't like him. And they really don't like him. After a thousand years of war, the Sothoii hate anything having to do with the hradani--and there's a sizable segment of the court who will do just about anything to stir up trouble and end the pesky peace that threatens to break out between Sothoii and the hradani. The dark gods, always looking for an angle, are happy to take the opportunity Bahzell's opponents give them. With luck, they'll be able to eliminate Bahzell and his fellow champion, Kaeritha (the only female Champion of Tomanak in maybe forever). Their first step is the slaughter of a courser (horse-evolved but with human intelligence creatures) herd--and stealing the power that this gives them.WIND RIDERS OATH switches back and forth between two simultaneous plots launched by the dark gods. In one, they attempt to undermine the peace--and Baron Tellian Bowmaster--along with the coursers under his domain. In the other, they stir up hostility between the unpopular War Maids (women who have fled to free cities where they are no longer subject to Sothoii's parernalistic legal structure) and the conservative nobility. Success in either plot would cast Sothoii back to its 'times of trouble.' Success in both would be a major victory for the dark gods.Author David Weber continues his fantasy series with a strong adventure. Bahzell is a charmingly 'human' champion of his god--a champion who sometimes resists the god's orders and who certainly follows them in his own way. The coursers are only a part of the strong world-building that Weber brings to this series.Weber is a story-teller rather than an 'author,' and he occasionally gets bogged down in boring conversations where characters chat things out, explain what they are going to do to one another, and generally kill the action. As with many of Weber's books, a hundred pages of trimming would have made the story stronger. Still, when Weber gets down to action, he's hard to beat. The second half of this story, in particular, was a rolicking adventure that kept me turning the pages.As with many recent Baen hardbacks, a CD-ROM, containing the full text to dozens of novels including the earlier books in this series and Weber's Honor Harrington series, dramatically enhances the value of the package."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"Just so you all know I consider myself a Weber fan, and have read most of his books. To me his stories can be hit or miss; this is one of the biggest misses. But I'll still keep reading his books because I love the good ones and re-read them again and again. I'd advise passing this one by, or waiting for paperback if you must have it. And if you like all of Weber's books, you'll probably like this one as well.I really missed character development in this one--which is my usual complaint when I don't like a Weber book. Where's the interplay between Brandark and Bazhell? To me, their friendship and development was key to the first 2 books, but in this one I barely saw any of that. As for the other characters, their stories weren't as compelling as they were in the first two books of the series. The secondary and minor characters had depth and I cared about them more in those books.Maybe the jokes are getting a little stale or the characters are too powerful and have developed as far as they can. Bazhell isn't struggling with becoming or being a champion anymore, and I didn't get any new, believable conflict in this story for his character. We've read about how he can run and keep up with horses--enough already.I feel compelled to say that talking horse companions have been beaten to death in this genre, so seeing them crop up with some of the same jokes from Mercedes Lacky used just doesn't inspire.One final note, in this case you can judge this book by it's cover. In the history of bad cover art, this passes the cover to Billy Joel's album, &quot;River of Dreams&quot;. At least he had the excuse that his soon-to-ex wife designed it (you will note it didn't save the marriage). Not only do they pick the worst scene in the book (see the other reviewer), but the people look like posable action figures. OK, this is probably a publishing decision, not an author's decision but I couldn't keep quiet.Maybe number 4 in this series will be better."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"This book appeared seven years after the second book in the series and, I think, has suffered in some people's opinion because of the time separation. Weber is obviously working to the same sort of plan he did in his Honor Harrington novels (although I prefer his style in this series), with plot strands carried through from one book to the next. This was less obvious in the first two books than in WRO, and I believe the dissatisfaction some readers have expressed results at least in part from the fact that Weber didn't intend the book as a stand alone.This is clearly a complex, well realized fantasy universe, and he obviously has a long story to tell. That's going to take time and wordcount, and books are going to be interconnected and interdependent, like this one is. There are, indeed, unresolved plot strands which I expect to see resolved -- in whole or in part -- in the next book. Which hopefully will be coming out in the next year or so.Personally, I found the book very enjoyable and readable, and I felt that it progressed naturally from a &quot;launch phase,&quot; in which a whole new society (that of the Sothoii) was being introduced, to fast and furious action in the last few chapters. Given the lengthy time break between this book and the last one, I thought Weber did an excellent job of connecting the two while still giving the new reader enough information to know what was going on. My biggest criticism? Weber and Baen Books should have given us this book at least four years ago . . . and they'd better give me the next one a heck of a lot sooner than they did this one!"},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I got the impression while reading this that Weber was desperate to fulfill his contract for another Bahzell book so he could get back to Honor Harrington. Windrider's Oath lacks the breathless excitement and political intrigue of \\"The War God's Own\\" and \\"Oath of Swords\\" while attempting to introduce new characters that really aren't that interesting. This series doesn't advance the overall adventure or tie up any loose ends. What about Churnazh? What about Jashan? Tell us more about the gods and their war, Mr. Weber. I loved the first two books but can't really recommend this one unless you're just in desperate need of a Bahzall fix (Brandark, the second-most interesting character, gets short shrift in this book). Let's hope the next one gets it right"},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"David Weber has completely captured my attention with the Bahzell series. This is the third book in the series and I just wish he would write them faster.Bazell is a hradani (very tall human like with fox ears, unhuman endurance and 'the rage'). Weber has more fantasy in this series than in some of his others but once again, his writing is excellent. He drags you into a world where the Gods sometime interact thru their 'champions'. The War God has chosen Bazell as one of his champions and sets him tasks to help all of the hradani people. It's easy to find yourself in this world and only wake up when the novel is done. The characters are well thought out and in-depth - after reading the first two books, I was looking forward to the reaction some of the characters would show...I don't want to recap the plot since it's above in the synopsis but if you like fantasy and enjoy well written novels, the Bahzell series is fun and full of life."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"While i generally like SF better than F this series is the exception. Weber's Honor Harrington series is good, this one is notably better, richer characters, deeper landscapes and tighter plotting. This story is not how ever as action filled as the first two in the series, but the action is crisp and well detailed."},{"Title":"WIND RIDER'S OATH","review":"I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the series, but this one is a joke.1. Everybody gets more and better powers. And even more and better powers. No, really. What a cheap trick.2. Leena irritated me. The war maids irritated me even more.3. There are at least two plot points that received absolutely no resolution.Mind you, Bahzell's relationship with his God is always fun to see, and some of the nonmagical battles were nice. But this was as tremendous waste of time on my part."},{"Title":"A Visit From the Footbinder","review":"I enjoyed Prager's collection of short stories, which is well worth buying for the cover art alone: a woman's foot molded into the shape of a heel is juxtaposed with a picture of a Chinese woman with \\"beautiful\\" bound feet. Prager writes on a variety of subjects, from a group of women who get together and read their alumni bulletins to the title story in which young Pleasure Mouse anxiously awaits the visit from the footbinder, who will lead her into the exciting adult world that every older female she knows inhabits. Prager's plotlines and characters stay with you when the book is closed.

However, he highlights aspects critical to a sustaining culture that lie outside the boundaries of convential educational thought, and even outside the previous bounds of Orr's comprehensive vision of education.He explains and argues for a continually expanded vision of 'education' again, and embeds this process in the larger processes of life; tirelessy showing that there are no boundaries between the two - and what this means for our place in the living world.Chapters such as &quot;Architecture as Pedagogy&quot; represent some of his past work refined.It is in the first half dozen chapters, however, that I feel he gets closest to the heart of the matter. In chapters such as &quot;Slow Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Verbicide&quot; he brings forth such elements as time, information, the speed at which we unite (or disjoint) them, and our relationship between such daily elements. I have been on a constant search for commentary on the implications of our relationship with time as it concerns sustainability. (Some of the best writing on it, that I've found is in The Sabbath by A.J Heschel and Spell of the Sensuous by David Abram). There is little written directly about this in the general literature, much of it not embedded in the concept of sustainability. The majority of it is also somewhat hidden in studies of religion, symbolism, and philosophy. Orr brings these relationships into the open and connects our perception and the design of our use of time directly to the ground. He never loses sight of the how such processes impact our prospects for a livable future.He also contextualizes this relationship in the ever widening definition (largely thanks to Orr himself) of DESIGN - specifically ecological design.These aspects are only part of this commentary however; other areas focus on the idea of wilderness, political economy, vocation, technology and human development.David Orr's ability to connect such topics and contextualize them within the qualities of 'usefulness' is needed fundamentally.He uncompromisingly subjects dominant current (and lesser-discussed, but possible) beliefs, paradigms, technologies and techniques, to the questions:&quot;What good is it, are they? How does it/do they influence us? How does it/do they inform our actions? Does this further our best intentions? How does this influence the prospects of life now and in the future?&quot;Never before has such scrutiny been so necessary, and I have found no more enlightening and pragmatic commentary than that offered by David Orr. This book should raise the bar for others in the many fields of sustainability to broaden, deepen and connect these concepts further, and soon."},{"Title":"The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention","review":"One needn't read the blurb to know that DO is a professor. The writing style, the subject chosen and the way it has been treated, the examples given... all point towards a very advanced mind! The power of this book lies in the relentless power of the ideology and the prose to raise questions in the mind of the reader, and forcing the reader to reconsider some of his/her own beliefs and viewpoints.The professor makes this journey even more enjoyable through his deliciously witty sarcasms and digs at the capitalistic society of today and its spin-doctors of advertising. Through numerous examples and penetrating questions, the writer clearly supports his point of view that humanity today is rushing headlong into the future, with a blind reliance on science and technology/forms of government/economic theories... and this faith he claims, seems to mirror an almost religious fervor. The writer clearly illustrates how humanity is increasingly trading its unknown future for short term gains of a few in positions of power to exploit those gains.The book deals with the subject of designing the future with Nature in mind, and speaks of the nature of design. Quite a heavy book in terms of the ideas, though the writing is wonderfully simple and straightforward. But aren't the clearest minds with the most elegant and terse prose, the hardest to comprehend? Simply a brilliant book that is a must read, and replete with a wonderfully diverse reference list at the end."},{"Title":"The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention","review":"Orr's book is a fantastic illustration of the current state of the world in terms of the relationship between technology, ecology, design and economy from a theoretical-philosophical perspective. He does not brush anything \\"under the carpet\\" and provides a very broad and deep understanding of our incompetence as a society saturated with consumption to deal with the consequences of our modern way of life. The best thing about this book, in comparison with other books in the subject, is first of all that it provides a highly engaging read, and second of all that it offers a very clear solution to our social and environmental problems - to live within and according to nature's limits. Orr's argument is convincing, not only because it is supported by many beautiful references, but mainly because it provides a very practical and honest pathway to the future."},{"Title":"The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I actually did.

Many of them have resulted from these popularized films and documentaries which contain few documented facts or historical observations about ancient Sparta.This edition, by H. Michell, was written in 1964. It is a serious academic work (though it is easy to read). This book was written in the days when scholars were permitted very little literary license. Consequently, it is an accurate record, well-documented and well-supported, of ancient Spartan civilization that evolved over almost 1,000 years of its history. (The book is in very well-written English, Cambridge University Press, 1964). (The subtitle is ancient Attic Greek. A good translation (not the only possible translation is: \\"A Revelation of Ancient Sparta\\")This book accurately, and intelligently, provides knowledge to illuminate the ancient Spartans. Many (so called) modern \\"documentaries\\" are mere exploitation of the extremes in Sparta over its long history. There is no doubt that Spartan men were subjected to inhuman brutalities in their training. There is no doubt, however, that many of those brutalities have been mis-portrayed in modern \\"documentaries.\\"For example, the book very accurately (with support from ancient observers) describes the ritual flogging ceremony known as''''''''''''' diamastigosis (from ''''''''''diamastig, \\"to whip harshly\\"). Modern revisionists would lead us to believe that it was a senseless torture of young men for the gratification of the priestesses. There may be some truth in this, as the era of ''''''''diamastigosis extended over a period of over 1,000 years (from about 1,000 BCE to the end of the Roman empire). However it was more of an athletic competition (with harsh consequences for injury from the whips (not unlike modern athletes endure injuries in modern sports competition. It is helpful to have the dates which are documented in this work (as well as many other timelines for Spartan cultural excesses) so that one can gain an intelligent understanding of the aspects of Spartan culture otherwise mis-portrayed by modern \\"scholars.\\" Michell points out that the ceremony became a blood ceremony (as noted by Cicero) in about 140 ACE when the Romans used it as a tourist attraction to promote commerce. (Not unlike Hollywood or the NFL)This book is an excellent research source, and, provides an intelligent and classic view of Ancient Sparta. If you are interested in the real Sparta, this book is worth almost any price.If you would like a fair, non-revisionist, treatment of ancient Sparta (and Mycenae) you can find it inIn Search of the Trojan War. Although this documentary focuses on the excavations of Troy, it expands into the entire Greek world, including ancient Sparta (Helen of Troy was, after all, Queen of Sparta) at the time of the Trojan War."},{"Title":"Sparta","review":"This is a scholarly introduction to the social and political structures that underlay Sparta's rise to prominence as the most powerful polis in ancient Greece, much admired by Plato. Not a history, the chapters deal with the institutions, the Spartan Constitution, the Discipline of the Spartan soldier from childhood, the Military and Naval Organizations ,The Public Meals, Public Finance, etc. Very convincing descriptions of the circumstances in which Sparta chose or was forced to abandon the strong literary and cultural traditions of her early development, to deal with their early military success, culminating in the subjugation of neighboring Messenia. (One in ten of the population was a Spartan soldier, the other nine were either outsiders (merchants, traders, etc.) or mainly subjugated people constantly seeking to throw off Spartan domination.) He is most expansive on the Constitution, Land Tenure and Public Finance and less detailed on the social institutions but he demonstrates that the goal of the education was obedience, stout endurance and skill in battle. I would have liked maps since the area being dealt with is fairly small and a brief history would have been welcome, as well as more detail about the geography which played a role in their landlocked mentality.. Overall, it provides a background to explain how Sparta became the most powerful polis in Greece, admired and feared, and why it left so little impact on subsequent history.

Cullen Davis- the story of John Hill- the disappearance of Helen Brach- the case of Lord LucanAs you can see this is a very solid list of cases. All 10 cases are fascinating, interesting, legendary. I think that this book is a good read and that it will be a good addition to any True Crime buff's library. The author did a very good job researching all of these cases, the book is well written and full of interesting informations. I think this is a great book for beginners, people who doesn't buy plenty of True crime books. I have more than 80 True crime books/Encyclopedias in my library, so I learned nothing new while reading this book, and I'm sure that most people who buy plenty of books on Criminology and crimes will feel the same way. The cases you'll find in this volume are all interesting, however it's very easy to find better books about the JFK Assassination, the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa or the death of Marilyn Monroe. The fact that more than half the book is spent on these three cases is disappointing, I think the author should have spent a little more time on some of the more obscure cases, not the three cases that are the most well documented.

Brock is the former president, serving from 1987 to 2002, of Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, GA, a four-year, liberal arts, residential school affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in America. I picked up a copy of this book at a homeschooling conference where Covenant College had an exhibitor table. With more than four thousand colleges and universities in the United States alone, how can parents assist their children in selecting the right one? Brock helps parents of high school students negotiate the maze of choices with sound advice and practical information by answering many questions parents have, such as \\"Is bigger necessarily better?\\"; \\"Can I afford to send my child to a private college?\\"; \\"Is prestige important?\\"; \\"What is a 'good' education?\\"; \\"What constitutes a positive learning environment?\\"; and \\"Should I send my child to a Christian college?\\" One may not necessarily agree with every specific statement, but in general there is a lot of wisdom expressed.This is a fascinating book. The chapters on \\"College Education Today\\" with its history of post-secondary schooling in America, and \\"Understanding Teens\\" based on Brock's experiences as a college educator, contain excellent information. Other chapters have helpful material about social factors affecting the learning environment, the pros and cons of college loans, and the importance of student attitudes. Brock contends that both parents and students benefit by discussing what they want out of a college education, and he offers valuable material for discussion. I thought that there would be more emphasis on worldview, but this is not entirely omitted. Indeed, it is summed up in the closing sentences. \\"How do you want your child to view the world after college? Do you think a person can spend four years of study without being affected by the perspective held by his or her esteemed professors? Is college really just about getting a good job? Should it be? How will you talk to your student about the lasting impact of a life-changing education?\\" Parents of college-bound students will benefit from this straightforward, honest approach to choosing a college or university and the need to choose wisely."},{"Title":"An Educated Choice: Advice for Parents of College-Bound Students","review":"This is a well written, thoughtful consideration of the college situation today and the need to choose wisely.Walt Chantry"},{"Title":"An Educated Choice: Advice for Parents of College-Bound Students","review":"Frank A. Brock, former President of Covenant College packs a ton of wisdom into this short book. It echoes a lot of the themes I discussed in Thriving at College, but in a book suitable to parents walking their children through the college preparation and selection process.Brock sets out to help parents \\"understand something of the educational landscape and see that there are many types of learning communities with differing philosophies of education, all of which have different outcomes.\\" He wants to help higher education customers be discerning, because \\"there's a difference between getting a degree and getting a good education.\\"Brock explains that there are four \\"emotional filters\\" through which parents tend to process the college decision: financial, location, familiarity, and who they view as the primary decision maker, the child or themselves. Brock advises parents to initiate a series of conversations with their children about what is important in the college decision. The goal is \\"an intentional student, one who knows where he or she is going and why. Such intentionality will greatly increase the student's own desire to make the most of the college experience, thus significantly increasing the likelihood of getting a good education.\\"Brock incisively captures today's teen mindset-as true today as when the book was published 10 years ago: They go to college seeking money and success, whereas they used to go primarily to develop a meaningful philosophy of life. Only about half of high school graduates pursued college as recently as 1970, today it's well over 70% (although half of these don't complete a B.A. or B.S. degree even after six years). The number of colleges has proliferated-i.e., supply has grown to meet the rising demand. To best compete for students, colleges have reduced the number of mandatory courses from 6.9 in 1964 to 2.5 in 1993. Since students don't have to work hard to get A's and B's in high school, they go into college never having learned good study skills (and assuming they'll still get high grades).Professors often don't care to address student work ethic and character in general (let alone their spiritual development), as they were trained (and are now rewarded) in research, not teaching. Many colleges have thus become disintegrated into sharply divided departments, rather than providing a coherent, unified educational experience for students of all majors. But \\"curricular coherence\\" is of vital importance, writes Brock, as is students developing a meaningful philosophy of life, and becoming truly wise and virtuous members of society.On campus visits, Brock suggests that students ask these sorts of questions:Was there interaction between the students and the professor in the class?Did students appear interested or bored?Were students taking notes?What are the tests like? Are they true/false and fill in the blank, or essay tests?The learning environment of the college outside the classroom is also important-e.g., the residential culture, opportunities for meaningful cross-cultural service/missions experiences. Brock recommends that parents assess the selectivity and cost of various schools, but not to forget that private schools often give merit- and need-based financial aid.Much more can be said about this excellent book. I highly recommend it to parents of high school students."},{"Title":"An Educated Choice: Advice for Parents of College-Bound Students","review":"Dr Brock's book is one that I recommend to parents of children heading off to college. Biblical. Balanced. Wise."},{"Title":"Molecular and Cell Biophysics","review":"This is an awesome book, it covers a huge range of topics and shows how physical thinking can provide answers to biological questions at scales ranging from the molecular to the cellular. Most biophsics books seem to get hung up on single molecules, but this one stands out by moving beyond the simplest building blocks and discussing higher order structures, self assembly, and cell motility. The book is highly accessible and does not demand advanced prior knowledge of physics or math."},{"Title":"Colt Terry, Green Beret (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"Colt Terry is my uncle, and I grew up hearing most of the stories in this book. If you want to know almost first hand what our soldiers were doing in most of the overses conflicts, police actions and wars; then this is the book for you. Colt recalls with great detail people, places, and times where he was in great danger and political turmoil.He truely is a real modern day hero and I hope that many of our service men and women read this book. I think that it teaches us that people in our military do sacrifice a lot of their lives for our freedom and this book shows what it was like to fight for that freedom.You can read this book story by story or through its entirety and never get tired of it!Also, Colt Terry died in September of 2005. His obiturary is in the Orlando Sentinal if you would like to read more of what his life was like."},{"Title":"Colt Terry, Green Beret (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"As an avid reader of history, I found this to be a very good start for Mr. Patton. He brings to life a real american hero focusing on both the positive and the negatives of his life. Colt Terry was definitely a hero, serving his country in multiple wars and spending five years under fire. His story needed telling and if you enjoy and learn from history, you will enjoy learning about him.Mr. Patton does a great job helping the reader understand life in the Korean conflict as well as Vietnam. My only critique is that i would have enjoyed more detail and this book should probably have been a bit longer as a result.In conclusion, if you have enjoyed Ambrose then this book should also be sitting on your shelves."},{"Title":"Colt Terry, Green Beret (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"As someone who has never served in the armed services, this well-researched biography of Colt Terry, a person I had never heard of before, certainly paints a vivid picture of the chaos that accompanies war. The Special Forces, have gotten much greater attention in modern times in Afganistan and Iraq, yet this book doesn't concentrate on the formation of the Green Berets, rather its focus is on a single individual and his life as it relates to the institution. Unusual in the sense that it is easy-to-read, as much as the subject matter is heavy and sometimes disturbing. Well worth it for the lay reader as well as the military historian."},{"Title":"Neuroendocrinology in Physiology and Medicine","review":"Conn and Freeman's excellent book &quot;Neuroendocrinology in Physiology and Medicine&quot; covers th full range of topics in the field from molecular biology to electrophysiological control mechanisms. The level of anatomical detail in chapters is always appropriate for the specific topic covered. Explication of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic mechanisms are detailed without undue speculation. The reader will find a balance between pre-clinical and clinical considerations. It would serve very well as a text in a seminar course as well as a beginning post-graduate lecture course in neuroendocrinology. The coverage of chronobiology is excellent but discussion of pineal and habenular mechanisms needs development. Medical students would profit from its relevance to alternative and complementary medicine in conjunction with a detailed work on the Limbic System. Physiological psychologists, neurochemists and all other neuroscientists would profit greatly from owning this book."},{"Title":"Neuroendocrinology in Physiology and Medicine","review":"I am an endocrinologist and bought this book because I wanted to make a deeper review on neuroendocrinology.Some of the good points of the book is that it's written by experts on the field, and from all around on the world, wich provides you with a comprhensive view.Another good point is that there are not many books that study this area, so this one comes to fill a gap.The book edition iis just september 2010, so the information is updated as posibly it can be.some of the \\"low\\" points are that you need to know about the theme, or it can be a little hard to understand, but if you decide to take the time to reed it and consult the complementary information is very good book.finally, graphics are few and monochromatic, they can imporve it by adding some more and adding colour.In general, I am glad to have bought the book, and I recomended if you want to go deeper inthis field, altought I recognize that probably for some people at the begining it can be a little hard to follow, since it requires a relativelly good knouledge of the neuroanatomy, but besides that, it's a very complete and interesting reeding."},{"Title":"Greek Rhetoric and Literary Criticism (Our Debt to Greece and Rome)","review":"More than 2,500 years ago the Greeks plotted a course for clear communications. They argued that people could be persuaded by appealing to reason, emotion and the speaker's character.Judging from many of the presentations and speeches I hear and see one might be tempted to think the ancients were outdated. In this 1928 book, classical scholar Rhys Roberts distills Aristotle's books on Rhetoric into 10 simple tips. Followed, they will improve everyone's attempts to influence events and thinking.They are:1. Be logical.2. Think clearly.3. Reason lucidly.4. Argument is the soul of persuasion.5. Study human nature.6. Observe and react to your audience.7. Delivery is the essence of eloquence.8. Use language properly.9. Take time to organize your material.10. Close crisply.Much has been written since Aristotle. Yet few have said it as well. If you do not have the stomach for Aristotle's original three volumes writings, take the time to review Roberts' rendition. Neither could have conceived of PowerPoint, yet this 2,500 year-old structure is the foundation for any successful speech or presentation."},{"Title":"Whose Daddy Does This? (A Sliding Surprise Book)","review":"My children love sliding open the pages to reveal the surprise hidden behind it. It's a great way for young children to learn characteristics of animals. For instance, it is the daddy penguin that sits on the eggs. Minor drawbacks are that the pages are sometimes hard to open or shut and that the illustrations do not seamlessly slide into each other."},{"Title":"Whose Daddy Does This? (A Sliding Surprise Book)","review":"This book is a little flimsier than some of the other Sliding Surprise books. However, the content is just as enjoyable to my 13-month-old son, Brandon.

The 2010 version is nearly useless, as the intermediate level maps have been deleted and in many cases the large overview maps show secondary roads as only light colored outlines.

One bothersome point was in regard to the &quot;grandfather&quot; character. Was he the protagonist's great-grandfather, or his great-great grandfather? Different places in the book explicitly state each. It doesn't make any difference to the plot, but stumbles in continuity are symptomatic of other problems. The book is uneven, doesn't hold together real well in places, leaves lots of loose ends."},{"Title":"Harold and the Purple Crayon: Dinosaur Days (Harold & the Purple Crayon)","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers--these newer, more colorful Harold books... miss the point entirely. In this book, Harold and his crayon dont seem to have much to do with the world around him; the story is disjointed; the prose is wooden... Where's Harold's ingenuity? (ok, ONE instance of 'drawing/thinking on his feet) Where are the accidental strokes that he turns into strokes of genius?Harold and the Purple Crayon was the first book I ever checked out of the library and it was magical... and, by extension, made the library seem a magical place of infinite possibility--like my own purple crayon. The simple line drawings with just that purple crayon prove to our little ones (and us!) that imagination is the only tool you need for magic... Conversely, these slick multicolored books have no magic."},{"Title":"Harold and the Purple Crayon: Dinosaur Days (Harold & the Purple Crayon)","review":"My son loves Harry and the Purple Crayon and he loves dinosaurs so of course he LOVES this book!

In this book she photographed and he wrote separately, and they combined their efforts although they did not attempt to match the text to the photos.Czechoslovakia, which was formed in 1918 in the aftermath of the First World War out of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, was 20 years old and about to be divided up in 1939 between Nazi Germany, Poland and Hungary. Maybe the authors gave a geographic title North Of The Danube to their book because of the uncertainty of the continued existence of the nation.Bourke-White's cameras capture beautiful portraits of the local people, landscapes and architecture in their last year of peace before the war, including a couple of photos showing the new Nazi presence. Photos used in this book are dated from April 1937 through August 1938 on the Life Magazine websiteWhile Erskine Caldwell is a great writer, his lack of knowledge about the region is obvious. His text is full of vivid descriptions with very little context. As travel book it is good, but it lacks the depth of analysis he was able to bring to You Have Seen Their Faces which he wrote with Bourke-White about tenant farmers in the southern states of the USA. What is evident as they move towards Germany in the eight chapters of this book is the increasing Nazi influence that troubles the Czechs and Slovaks they meet.They traveled from east to west starting in Uzhgorod which is now the capital of the Zakarpatskaya oblast of Ukraine and end their visit in Prague and Bohemia. At Uzhgorod they hire a chauffeur to drive them to a remote mountain village called Uzhok where years ago the peasants supposedly ate their seed wheat and have no bread, living on oat meal mush. Then they take a train across Slovakia from Kosice to Zilina where Caldwell reports on badly behaving German travelers. They visit almost every corner of this young country and Bourke-White's photos are a snapshot of the country in the two years before the war.It is not obvious from the book itself how completely their travels were since there is no map and place names are often small towns and villages, some whose names have changed over time. This inspired me to write a Map Review of the book using Google Maps. You can see the completed map review here: [...]"},{"Title":"The NutriBase Guide to Fast-Food Nutrition","review":"This is the most up to date Fast Food guide in publication today.

For those with the courage to think through the implications of an ecological world view and want to learn the scientific concepts which help facilitate greater understanding of natural systems, leading to (hopefully) better decisions regarding resource use, this is a great book. By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet. Rigorous and enchanting cognitive medicine for all those working to make a better world."},{"Title":"A Recursive Vision: Ecological Understanding and Gregory Bateson","review":"The best explanation of Gregory Bateson's ideas I have read!

It stands the test of time, proven by the fact that this is a slightly revised edition of itself, first published in 1992. It was far ahead of its time. Reading it now, one has the sense of it being very current, revealing aspects of one man's journey that is both intimate and timely.I recommend this book highly. It carries in it the clarity of thought one associates with the best thinkers, yet it explores, unashamedly, things such as telepathy, off-world histories, the intentions of dolphins, and how to contact angels. Wyllie brings a well-tuned ear to his work, speaking in a voice of dignity and erudition. This is a remarkable book.So many books that treat this type of subject are poorly written, often begging for a more critical view, and radical editing. It this case, one relishes the use of words, the extent of Wyllies vocabulary.This is a seductive book. It takes you to places you might blush to admit interest in, and gives you pause to wonder at your shyness. Wyllie is an excellent guide to the inside, the places where a small coterie of people have been brave enough to explore the unthinkable--the realms of non-human intelligences. It surprises with its candor; it delights with its bravery; it leaves us with a sense that we have been privy to secrets; and it never preaches.Read this book. Breathe deeply, dive in. Enrich yourself."},{"Title":"Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins, & Shamans","review":"A summary of this book best comes from a line in the last chapter, &quot;One of the features of the dolphin journey is that I never quite know what is going to happen next or where it is all leading.&quot; The trip progresses from interspecies communication (with dolphins) to underwater birthing (humans) - he includes a nice mix native practices with current sceintific research. But this is no armchair adventurer, he is out the world experiencing it - and we are lucky enough to be along for the ride. My preconceived ideas were turned around as I thought that the underwaterbirthing would not be interesting, but those sections are now hightlighted in my mind. Reading this book, I couldn't help but think of Herman Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot; - each journey is unique, no one else can follow the same path, yet hearing another person's story can change our own. As if to emphasize that, unlike many other 'new age' books Mr. Wyllie doesn't give us a website to find followup workshops - having stood on his shoulders, you are expected to go ahead on your own. I found this very readable, with no psychobabble to get in the way of the story and would thus recommend it to anyone who has been curious enough to go far enough to read this review. It stands alone or can be read as a sequel to &quot;Dolphins, ET's and Angels&quot;."},{"Title":"Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins, & Shamans","review":"Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angles, Aliens, Dolphins &amp; Shamans by Timothy Wyllie is an original collection of amazing metaphysical adventure stories, exploring telepathic experiences with angels, dolphins, and humans around the globe; planetary mysteries; and the essence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

The adventure takes you through inner and outer landscapes: Key West; New Zealand; Bali (when it was peaceful and nonpolitical); New York and New Mexico. There are visits with others who know and love the dolphins, including John C. Lilly. Angels and other extraterrestrials are a part of Timothy's widespread communications network.The appendices offer further trips to take.

But I have to say if you want a book that not only gives _the_ most complete history of the flies within, but a book that gives a _clear_ picture of what the fly should look like, then look no further. I had the opportunity to meet with author/illustrator Chris Mann in Cheltenham, England March 2002. I sat with him as he illustrated a fly for one of his upcoming books. The flies are illustrated with every detail involved and constructed on screen as you would tie them: every hair, every thread wrap, every fiber, every shadow and every hue is represented just as Chris sees the fly in his studio. And, I have to say the flies he received are just as perfect as his drawings, no kidding. So, if you start with perfect flies, you get perfect drawings. To top it off, an evening's dinner with Chris reveals that he clearly has more historical fly fishing and fly tying knowledge in his head than he could ever write; what you get in the book is just the tip of the iceberg.

The circles which are the most obvious features of the design look like the eyes of needles made of concrete. The concrete aqueduct which carries passenger boats through these circles are supported only at the outer edges, so it is possible for a camera to capture pictures of the sky or a distant hillside through the arc under the canal. This is described as \\"the high-level Union Canal.\\" (p. 62). The Falkirk Wheel allows boats to be lowered to a basin leading into the Forth & Clyde Canal, part of a continuous waterway link between Scotland's east and west coast. The visitor center at the lower ground level has windows that allow spectators to look up as the wheel rotates, observing a gear system that keeps each caisson containing water and boats level during the fifteen minute drop or lift. Anyone expecting to see a lot of pictures of bridges and stadiums is likely to be surprised on pages 5-6 to see a shallow arched canal ending in mid-air, with the boat suspended in a container of water so close to the slanted windows of the building below that the shadow of everything is the most ominous clue that whatever is going on is not ordinary.People who have learned to work with computer aided design programs that figure out all the angles and lengths for unusual shapes might appreciate the number of calculations required for the Yokohama Port Terminal built in Japan in 2000-2002. The index lists pictures on pages 13, 15, and 56-59. On page 13 it is described as \\"a whole \`landscape' of passenger concourses and external terraces has been created with a structure of folded steel beams.\\" A ceiling that could be flat plates welded together is described as \\"Interior ramp with folded-plate beams above, typical of the complex, fluid spaces inside the building.\\" (p. 59).The best roller-coaster pictures I have seen show the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point Resort, Ohio, 2002-2003. The tubular tower of yellow cylinders supports a red sectional steel trusses track that climbs 400 feet and twists 270 degrees as it falls vertically. This has a snowy backdrop in the pictures on pages 159 and 164-165. I did not find any pictures showing what holds the riders in the roller-coaster during this high-acceleration ride.The interesting roof structures for bus and train passengers at Oriente Station in Lisbon, Portugal, 1993-1998, cantilevered steel-and-glass canopies provide the drama on pages 20-23. This is a big book, with big dams, sea barriers, telescopes, wind tunnels, and the CERN Large Hadron Collider \\"inside which protons and other nuclei will crash head on, Big Bang style,\\" (p. 154) in Geneva, Switzerland, 1997-2006, an underground great ring tunnel 17 miles long."},{"Title":"The Middle West: Its Meaning in American Culture","review":"James Shortridge employs unique research techniques and an innovative way of thinking to provide an original perspective on what and where the American Middle West is. He studies popular literature to search for the prevalence of the term \\"Middle West,\\" and he utilizes survey techniques to measure how people define where it is. He finds that its image has remained fairly constant--American pastoralism--but its location has shifted from the edge of the Great Plains toward the east, and then back toward the west once again. Similarly, its image has waxed and waned in American culture, from being the paragon of the real American character and soul to being a rural backwater. This book provides tremendous insights into the meaning of the one region in America whose self identity remains uncertain."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"Father Greeley introduces us to new and captivating fictional (but don't we know real-life folks similiar?) Irish-Catholic families in Chicago and deftly interweaves them with suspense in Post World War II Germany. But, here's a *WARNING* I wish I would have known when I started this book: this is &quot;Part One&quot; of the saga. Unlike the Blackie Ryan or Nuala Ann books, it is NOT self-contained. One must read the 2d of this series, _Younger Than Springtime_, to have even a glimmer of how it all ends. Order both now, so you won't have to pester your Postperson to keep reading ;-) I hope, to complete the saga (still not wholly resolved at the end of _Springtime_,)that there will be a _Summer_ and _Autumn_?"},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"I enjoyed this book, spending the better part of a Sunday afternoon to finish it. It is the beginning of a series focused on bright and personable young Chuck O'Malley. The young man has the gift for detective work that is a common trait of Greeley's protagonists. While the setting and character types are familiar from other Greeley novels, the story is a pleasant exploration of familiar territory. This story provided a nice balance of action, suspense, and good characters. It's frustration is that it is the first installment in a series and just when you want more the book ends. Of course, the next installment is available as I write this belated review. Chuck O'Malley may just end up on my favorite character list along with Blackie Ryan and the Coynes (Dermot and Naula Ann)."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"The dust jacket says its set on 1947 but the first hundred pages--the funniest he has ever written--are tributes to an American Catholicism circa 1920-1965 at its most grotesque, mean, charitable, and loving. The next hundred give us the most charming faux naif narrator since Huck Finn, while exposing to a new generation what it was like to grow up in the depression and survive into the postWar's endless miracles. The German setting enriches the background of his earlier Blackie book by taking us to a Germany of the generation previous to the Bishop and the Three Kings. Finally, his hero owes us another book--- the culmination of the novel is so powerful that I can only hope it is just ACT One"},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"This is an unusually (sorry, Father) cleverly written book.

I wish he would have mentioned one ofmy wartime favorites, the eponymous H.V. Kaltenborn. I would haveliked a little less sarcasm (mild tho' it was) and less G.I. obscenity(tolerable tho' it was).This book deserves a movie contract- withFather Andrew directing!"},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"A Midwinter's Tale, Andrew Greeley's first book in the O'Malley series, is the adventures of a young man growing up in the great depression and World War II. Charles Cronin O'Malley, the main character and narrator, tells the tale. Chuck (called Chucky by most folks) is the center of the story. The narrative begins as he is a young boy and briefly talks of middle school and Catholic High School years, then records his service in the Army. Most of the book concerns his military life stationed in Bamberg Germany (1946-7).I liked the adventures in Bamberg. I was stationed in Germany myself, many years after Chucky, and I love the little towns and picturesque villages . As Chucky cruised around the German countryside and walked the streets, I felt I was again in Germany enjoying the people and the culture. For a veteran, Chuck's activities with the Army are hilarious.This is a chronicle of a boy coming of age. The story emphasizes Chuck's psychological and social growth and adjustment. Greeley provides artful character development and intrigue, especially in Germany, where Chuck serves with the Constabulary Forces of the American Occupational Army. Chuck's exploits, mostly well intentioned and frequently comical, lend excitement and interest to the story.An excellent account of the development of a boy. Interesting details about living during the great depression and post war Germany. A pleasant read."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"A coming of age, a little romance, a little suspense, a little mystery-- Father Greeley has put a little of everything into this coming of age story of a young Irish American. As in many of Greeley's stories, this \\"accidental\\" hero soon grabs the heart of the reader. The yarn of adventures wrapped around the characters as young Chucky grows up keeps you hooked, and will entice you into reading through the whole series to see what Chucky Ducky and the \\"crazy O'Malley's\\" will do next. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"I debated four stars or five but gave the author the benefit of the doubt for a compelling novel and interesting characters and settings. The narrator's (Charles O'Malley's) shifts from present to future to past were disconcerting and tempted me to remove one star. As usual, Greeley is a skilled chronicler of Irish-American Catholic life. In this book we also see something of the early postwar period in Germany with its misery, black market profiteering, and progress toward democracy. The relationship of Charles (or Chucky)and Rosemarie (or Rosie)is not really resolved and may be fodder for another novel."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"A Midwinter's Tale is the beginning of a new series for Andrew Greeley, and the main character, Chucky O'Malley is one of his best ever! Chucky literally comes of age during the Depression and WWII, and his growing up in an Irish Catholic famiy in Chicago is a fine tale indeed. His bright wit and charm are irresistable to women, particularly his sister Peg's best friend, Rosemarie(Rosie)Clancy-who are more or less taken in by the O'Malley's due to her own mother's drinking problem and her investment banker father is rarely at home. But the real fun and action begins when after high school graduation Chucky serves in the Army Constabulary in post-war Germany. The story is one you will breeze through, anxiously awaiting the next installment of the series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"A Midwinter's Tale is a good read, however it doesn't have the same spell-binding , can't-put-it-down quality of Greeley's previous books. His main character, Chucky, is not as believeable as Blackie or Nuala, and nowhere near as loveable. Chucky's disclaimers don't ring as true. Compared to other authors' efforts, a wonderful book but compared to Greeley's others A Midwinter's Tale falls short."},{"Title":"A Midwinter's Tale","review":"If this is your first McGrail novel-STOP.

Most introductory texts have a flavor of having been written by geniuses for idiots; in this book, Courant treats the student as being his peer in intellect and interest, lacking only knowledge. This makes it an excellent book even for somebody reasonably familiar with the calculus. Although it covers the material from a strictly classical viewpoint, the text and the examples provide enough thinking material to help the student understand the motivation that led to measure theory, Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration, and algebraic topology; the wellsprings of these in classical analysis are seldom explained in modern math courses. So I can recommend it to any senior planning to do graduate work in math, or to any first-year graduate student in math. And of course, it can be well used as a first calculus text for students who are prepared to think and put in effort on the subject.Courant himself, of course, was a great mathematician, although I don't personally consider him one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century; he was a better leader and inspirer of others than a creator of new mathematics. But among other things, he served as David Hilbert's personal assistant for two years, and this gave him superb judgment about what's important and what isn't. This shows throughout the book.It also helps that the translator into English was E. J. McShane. McShane is less well-known than he perhaps deserves to be, because he was a truly first-rate mathematical researcher (in analysis) himself. This, together with the fact that McShane spent a year or two at Gottingen while Courant was still leading the Mathematics Institute at Gottingen, and came to know Courant well, allowed McShane to translate Courant's text with great understanding ofCourant's way of thinking.My own copy of this text, bought more than 50 years ago, is in tatters, because I still haul it out and re-read pieces of it to connect my thinking when I'm groping."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"Courant knows the art of writing a good preface. He attacks \\"diffuseness\\" and \\"pedantry\\" and aims at \\"exhibiting the close connection between analysis and its applications\\" and \\"to give due credit to intuition as the source of mathematical truth\\". The book also has a tone that is unusual today: Courant speaks to us the way a dignified, open-hearted professor speaks to an intelligent student. No rambling pretensions; just to-the-point, good mathematics. This is the perfect solid-as-they-come, timeless book on the calculus, and most likely it will never be surpassed in this domain. One must be warned, however, that this is a very serious book and reader-friendliness has lower priority than technical coherence and brilliance of formal organisation. The likely reader will know calculus already and use Courant for masterful, concise exposition of standard topics as well as a wealth of topics that have been watered out of most current calculus curricula (e.g., evolutes, involutes, envelopes, curvature, geodesics, centres of mass, the gamma function, the catenary, the cycloid, the lemniscate, the brachistochrone problem, Kepler's laws, Maxwell's equations, the zeta function, etc.). Everybody knows that all the usual calculus books, \\"reform\\" or not, are pathetic. But what is even worse is that there are no good alternatives even if one is prepared to dig deep into the library shelves in hope of finding an author who has not sacrificed his intellectual dignity at the altar of royalties. Take for example Serge Lang's books \\"A First Course in Calculus\\" and \\"Short Calculus\\". Lang is of course the virtual definition of the mainstream of respectable mathematics. Nevertheless, these books are soaked with the common formalistic attitude. In fact, as if his books had not finished the job, Lang adds an appendix to both books called \\"Physics and Mathematics\\", which very explicitly drives a wedge between physics and intuition and mathematics. Courant is a good antidote to such modern nonsense."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"This work has an honored place on my bookshelf. A colleaguerecommended it to me when I was in school and I bought a copy afterlooking at it in the school's library. It sits next to my copy of\\"The Feynman Lectures in Physics\\". These are works you go to forinsight. I like Courant's mixture of physical examples with themathematics.After encountering Courant's book for the first time, I rememberwondering why the first volume wasn't used as the textbook for thetypical year and a half of basic calculus. Then, as now, I can onlyconclude that teachers probably think it's not watered down enough forthe students. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise to come acrossCourant after you've been taught calculus from an uninspiring \\"modern\\"text.Everyone's needs are different, so take all reviews with a grain ofsalt. As a working scientist/engineer, my primary use of the calculusis as a tool to get things done, so I'm typically more interested inlearning the mechanics than getting a deep understanding like amathematician would. Courant works for this, yet still allows oneto dig in deeper when desired. It's still an awfully good book, evenif it is 70 years old."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"This is the best book on calculus that I have ever seen. However, it can never be used as a text for first year calculus students because they lack the mathematical sophistication to understand most of the material in this book. The book is not about the HOW TO, but instead it's about the WHY. There are lots of proofs and some interesting examples. This would be a good alternative book for Advanced Calculus.I read certain parts of this book when I have to teach a complicated topic to my calculus students (e.g. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Taylor Series) and then I streamline the material so that they can understand it.My main complaint is the absurd price! Try to find a cheaper used copy. It's outrageous that a book this important is so expensive."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"I bought this two-volume set my freshman year at university, in 1973, and I still consider it a superior introduction to differential and integral calculus to my actual textbooks. I am still fond of the set, and my only reservation is that the notation can be unfamiliar at times than what is more customary to American users, following older Germanic forms less-seen today, but it was a work that encouraged me to think."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that's taking the calculus sequence in college. At my school, proofs are not explored in-depth until intro to analysis which comes much later in a students college career if at all. I'm the type of learner that does poorly with rote memorization and better with rigorous explanation, so I felt like I needed to give myself an edge. That's where Courant's great book comes in.By supplementing in-class lectures with this book I have been able to keep my head above water, and felt like the material was coming to me much more naturally as the professor was presenting it. I find that reading a few pages of this book and then working his examples is the best strategy for consuming the knowledge contained within. I'm fairly certain I'll refer back to this specific tome for years to come.A final note: this book is not an easy read. If you're looking for a quick read and introduction to the subject of calculus without getting too deep into the nitty gritty details, I un-sarcastically recommend the calculus for dummies book instead."},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus : Volume 1","review":"This is one of the best calculus books ever written, I bought my copy in 1960 for $6.95. For a while recently the price had gone up to an unaffordable $150+. Now it is back down to a reasonable, indeed bargain level, of around $30. Everyone serious about learning calculus well, should buy this book at that price. While teaching from Spivak's wonderful book, I became convinced that he himself had probably learned from Courant.After over 50 years I have never forgotten the beautiful explanation of how to faithfully represent real numbers as infinite decimals from pages 8-10, or the amazing algorithm given in a footnote! at the bottom of page 27, for deriving an explicit formula for the sum of the kth powers of the first n positive integers.The explanation of how essentially all absolute convergence tests for series work on pages 377-382 is similarly succinct andclear. I.e. they all proceed by comparing the size of the given series with another one whose convergence is known, typically either with a geometric series or with a convergent integral. That's it!Pages 386-398 make absolutely clear the behavior of uniform convergence of functions and their properties with respectto differentiation and integration of the limits.Volume 2 even introduces complex variables and calculus of variations. The indeterminacy of the complex logarithm is made absolutely clear on page 543 of volume 2.Material is so clearly explained in this book that I have basically never forgotten any of it. I cannot recommend it highly enough. But notice I did not say it is easy, just clear. You still have to think hard about it. But you will benefit. Unlike most modern calculus books, there are no useless or wasted pages or words here. I also agree with other reviewers that even the preface is inspiring and useful."},{"Title":"Cloud of Death","review":"Mack Bolan is back,tough and cool,in the second book of the Four Horsemen Trilogy.

This book has all the workings and trappings of the previous epic spread out over 348 long, dry and generally boring pages. Bolan treipses all over the west pursuing this cult of UFO believers. He guns down modest target quantities, and then tries a Mideast terrorist faction, but only gets some. The theme here is a sadly continuing one from the first book of the trilogy. I was glad when I finished it, because I instantly fell asleep from all the excitement that the book generated. Pendleton is losing his edge and should give up the ghost as far as trying to write any epic sagas. This one is another dismal failure. He and Gold Eagle have conspired to remove more money from the consumer by putting together a 1000+ page saga about a cult of UFO believers. This is just plain junk. I can hardly wait to read the third 340+ page book. I was bored to tears with this second offering and I breathed a great sigh of relief when I finally finished the book.

Also Chapter 9 explains 23 Promises from God for every individual. (There are 10 additional Promises in the book \\"Divine Partnership\\" by Jean K. Foster.) Chapter 10 explains the history of mankind on earth - it was difficult to read that we keep creating the same circumstances over and over. The Brotherhood of God in Chapter 12 tells how they came to be one with God and work from the next plane of life to help those who want teachers or comforters or counselors that Jesus promised would help all who called upon them.

It was an enjoyable read nontheless."},{"Title":"Prisoner 1167: The Madman Who Was Jack the Ripper","review":"While author James Tully presents a rational and logical argument for James Kelly as Jack the Ripper, most of Tully's arguments are based on circumstancial evidence, inductive reasoning, and details which easily could be merely coincidental. That's not to say the arguments fail to persuade -- in fact, Tully presents a great deal to consider. However, for this story to gain acceptance as the definitive solution, a great many more unanswered questions and possible alternative explanations would need resolved. It's food for thought he's trying to construct as a full explanatory meal. I'd recommend borrowing it from the library before buying it, if you are considering adding it to your collection."},{"Title":"Prisoner 1167: The Madman Who Was Jack the Ripper","review":"Described as the &quot;overwhelming case&quot; against James Kelly and as the &quot;definitive answer&quot; to the Jack the Ripper mystery, James Tully's &quot;Prisoner 1167--The Madman Who was Jack the Ripper&quot; provides nothing of the sort. Undoubtedly, Tully has done his homework. The debth of his research is clearly revealed in the tedious and often laborious recount of the life of James Kelly and the chronicle of the &quot;Ripper&quot; murders. But the author recites so many irrelevant and extraneous facts, one wonders if they were included only to impress the reader with the knowledge of the author.In the final analysis, Tully grasps at anything, real or imagined to implicate Kelly as the culprit, relying upon &quot;coincidences&quot; and logic which even he describes as &quot;tortuous.&quot; His basic premise is that Kelly &quot;was the only convicted insane woman killer at large in the East End during the period of the killings.&quot; But this premise fails miserably. First, who says the killer had to be previously convicted? Given the deplorable economic and social conditions in the East End during that time, undoubtedly there were numerous depraved individuals roaming the streets who had not yet been convicted of a crime. Second, Tully presents no hard evidence that Kelly was insane. People of that time were often committed when not actually insane. Finally, even Tully admits that Kelly was not in the area, but in France when the last two murders were committed. He glosses over this flaw by supposing that Kelly shuttled across the channel to ply his trade as if he were a diplomat.Tully's theory also relies upon the supposed similiarities between Kelly's personality and the profile of the true killer. But the similarities are more feigned than real. Kelly's crime was one of passion, committed in a fit of rage, after which he was filled with remorse. The Whitechapel murders, on the other hand, were viciously premeditated and sexually gratifying to the true perpetrator. The similarities between Kelly and Jack the Ripper are tenuous at best.Finally, Tully relies upon a compendium of circumstantial facts to buttress a weak argument, such as the fact that Kelly had an excellent knowledge of the area and had access to sharp knives as the tools of his trade. In that case, every cook, tanner, butcher or doctor in Whitechapel must be suspected as well!Surely it must be frustrating to conduct forty years of research and be unable to find conclusive evidence. Under those circumstances, the urge to draw unsupported conclusions must be temendous. Obviously, Tully fell victim to that urge, because he comes no closer to solving the mystery than those who tried before. If only he had admitted the limitations of his evidence instead of overstating it, he would have at least succeeded in establishing more credibility with this reader. Perhaps then he could have concentrated on writing a book that was more readable and less boring.John Hanbury"},{"Title":"Prisoner 1167: The Madman Who Was Jack the Ripper","review":"There is so much mystery and unknowns when dealing with Jack the Ripper that nearly any theory should at least be listened to before criticism is made. In this turn of suspects, James Tully proposes one James Kelly of being Jack the Ripper apparently on the basis that Kelly killed his wife, Srah Brider, by stabbing her in the throat and then cutting it open. He was tried for murder but got off on insanity charges and placed in Broadmoor, a mental institute. Kelly then escapes from Broadmoor a few years later and lives out quite a long life travelling the world before willingly returning to Broadmoor to die. That's pretty much the first three chapters of this book. This is the last we hear of James Kelly more-or-less until the final chapter.From there, Tully takes us on a trip through the Ripper Murders, of which he includes Martha Tabram, \\"The Canonical 5\\", Alice McKenzie, and Francis Coles but he then excludes Liz Stride from the \\"5\\" suspecting her pimp Michael Kidney killed her. Tully also suggests that Mary Jane Kelly may possibly have been James Kelly's sister-in-law who was living in secret from her family. Tully describes the murders but goes into much more detail regarding the death inquests of the coroners and the testimonies of 'witnesses' of the victims. Tully then wraps up his book with a chapter entitled \\"The Cover-Up\\" in which through self speculation and a bit of conspiracy, the author places James Kelly as the Ripper with fairly vague circumstancial evidence at best. This seems largely based on some file about Kelly being sealed until 2030 AD. There is also an appendix chapter on \\"Things to Ponder\\" in regards to some of the events.While intriguing and worth reading, I'm not truly convinced of anything from these arguments. There's little to no evidence supporting these claims. Unfortunately, the text tends to drag on and I became uninspired while reading it. It's a decent text dealing with a mid-level suspect but there's really not much supporting it at this point other than conjecture."},{"Title":"Prisoner 1167: The Madman Who Was Jack the Ripper","review":"If your a definite Ripper buff this book is worth reading.

For Baja California, which I know very well, many of the place names are out of date and many of the most important geographic features are inaccurately placed or even non-existent. I give it a star for the fact that it is the best thing going for the mainland traveler without spending a lot of money.

If you find the Wicca and Pagan methods of manifestation too complicated or contrary to your beliefs, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Candle Burning Magic With the Psalms","review":"I have purchase this book over 2 years ago and I cannot understand those who say it is a waste of time. I am a hardened skeptic myself when it comes to so many of these self help, new age and magic books.. Very few perform the promised results but this one delivers 200%.. Every time I have used the candle rituals in this book, the results came extremely fast. This stuff really works.. and unlike other books of it's kind.. it doesn't send you out to purchase expensive oils and special made candles that cost a fortune in specialty shops. All you need is a bottle of olive oil and a 99cent candle if that's all you can afford.. and your ready to see miracles happen. No kidding, I take my spiritual life and rituals very very seriously.. and this book absolutley works. Don't be put off by the people who wrote the bad reviews, I have no clue what they are so down about.. Did they even try the rituals in this book, or did they just read it and decide, \\"hey, this can't work?\\" Well it does work.. and if you desire positive magic that will bring great results, please do buy this book. It's simple and inexpensive to use the rituals and you will be amazed at what happens!!!!"},{"Title":"Candle Burning Magic With the Psalms","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books on candleburning. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the art. Very thorough explanations on candleburning, and my favorite thing about this title is that the book of Psalms is completely reprinted, making it extremely easy for one to conduct this type of magic (especially if you are like me and do not own a separate copy of the Psalms!). As a non-Wiccan Witch who values her experience as a Catholic-turned-Christian in her youth, and still has respect for the religion, this is a very pleasant and refreshing look at a practice that is so often dominated by Wiccan/New-Age opinion and practices."},{"Title":"Candle Burning Magic With the Psalms","review":"I agree with other reviewers who liked this book, by far one of the best buys I made at the time, it is very powerful when used correctly and you'll see results very quickly if not right away, not to be taken lightly though, this is a serious book ! recommended"},{"Title":"Candle Burning Magic With the Psalms","review":"I want to open this review commenting on a review another reader left. First let me say that I fully respect his or her opinion, and that actually I agree that, if you don't feel good about anything at all on this world, the best thing always is to follow your heart, but there is a misunderstanding there, it's not that you have to call the names out loud, the author advise is TO NOT DO THAT, unless you are too familiar with Hebrew language and it's pronunciation. What he advises instead is to carve the name on the candle and let it work that way.The book itself is well structured, psalms page, applications page, depicted in this way:Psalm Page: from the actual book of psalms.Applications Page: Psalm X to do X thing, Use X candle and use X name.So it's very simple and easy to read. Still, a pre-existing knowledge about this kind of work is a must, not only to avoid confusion but to make full use of the book because further on it gives very briefs explanations for best times to work and planetary hours etc, etc, etc...As a closing comment, I didn't see anywhere the part where the author states that the names he uses came to him after meditation, I could have missed it, but if that is so, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING SUCH NAMES unless you know what you are doing, instead find yourself a *superb* book about the kabbalah and instruct yourself on the holy names of God and the use of the Tetragrammaton."},{"Title":"Candle Burning Magic With the Psalms","review":"I found this by \\"accident\\", ordered it, used it and am amazed by the results.

William Oribello take the reader through beginning to end. In the introduction the author urges the reader not to try to hard to believe but just to go through the motions of the rituals. The presentation starts off with the preparation of candle method. Is the practitioner attracting or repelling. The next part tells the divine name of God that one needs to use. The third part tells the reader the purpose of the psalm.There are certain times that are most beneficial for candle magic based on your birthsign. The planetary hours are based on the hours after sunrise. Since I am a Gemini and I was born under the planet Mercury the hours given to the day are as follows.Sunday 3rd, 10th,and 17th hours : Monday 7th,14th,21st hours. : Tuesday 4th,11th ,18th hours : Wednesday 8th, 15th and 22nd hours : Thursday 5th,12th,19th hours. : Friday 2nd 9th, and 16th hours. Saturday 6th,13th,20th hours. Wednesday is the best day for Geminis.Colors are very important for candle magic. Red - Energy or Love , Pink - Love, Green- Money and Good Fortune, Blue- Healing and psychic development, Purple - Power over enemies, -personal power or spiritual attainment.Preparation of the candles is based on purpose. To attract put some oil on the bottom and rub toward the top stopping at the middle. Next put some oil at the top and rub toward the bottom stopping at the center. To repel you put the oil in the center and rub toward the bottom. Next you apply some more oil in the center and rub toward the top.After anointing the candle you carve in the divine the name.

It's an adorable and fun little book. When I stumbled across this book on candleburning and the Psalms I thought it might be similar to that. It's not. This book gives 5 or 6 candle colors and labels each psalm in a very narrow manner. For instance Psalm 1 is used for pregnancy. PERIOD. End of story.Even the most simple prayer can cover many needs. This book can't even be considered a starting point. It's like a stepping stone TO the starting point. The Book of Psalms included with the book SHOULD be included in a single section. Instead it is sifted in and the pages are turned. One page, portrait, one page, landscape. It makes for some very annoying reading.Add to that some of the \\"Divine Names\\" \\"linked\\" to each psalm aren't even names at all but letters of the Hebrew alephbet. (that's not a misspelling.) With all the beautiful names for God, why use letters?Lastly, there is no mention in the book about creating a sacred space for your prayer time.

On a personal level, it is about sadomasochism, gender asymmetry, and abuse of power. On a social level, it is about institutional blindness and complicity. It is ironic that the church may be one of the last locations in which sexual harassment can be practiced without serious repercussion. It is a riveting read.--Margaret R. Miles Dean and Vice President for Academic Affairs The Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA"},{"Title":"The Cannibal's Wife: A Memoir","review":"If we indeed believe that people &quot;called&quot; to religious service should strive to be paragons of moral vigilance, reading this book will lead one to inescapably conclude that the wrong person, in this case, was compelled to give up their religious responsibilities, in favor of letting a church retain a vain glorious womanizer as priest.The &quot;cannibal&quot; in this instance -- a priest who sexually and emotionally abused author, Yvonne Maes -- is still a so-called &quot;man of God&quot; while his victim is no longer a nun. Out of an apparent jealous need to squelch whatever in her noble service record reflects negatively on his deficiencies as a priest, Fr. Frank declares his sexual passion for Sister Yvonne, rapes her and then snidely belittles her protests until she is silenced into dazed compliance for a time.When she finally emerges from years of depressed submission to Fr. Frank's misogynistic take on &quot;God's will&quot; for them, Yvonne next suffers secondary abuse from a kangaroo ecclesiastical court, only convened to respond to her complaints in a proscribed and condescending way. (And fancy finding out later that the bishop acting as the diocesan equivalent of a district attorney is himself a sexual predator)The charade of justice includes one in-court confrontation between Yvonne and her former tormentor that is most awkward and wrenching for having been played out before moral arbiters who are themselves as much in conflict with their own sexuality as the nun and priest on trial. The priest admits he broke his vows of celibacy, but remains oblivious to the damage he did to Yvonne as a human being and colleague in religious service. For him, ultimate accountability is only an issue of admitting to a moral lapse, receiving absolution and continuing on as a priest. While Yvonne, who tried to take a moral stand, in exposing the abuse done to her leaves the church that failed to back her in that stand.When I was eight years old, I saw the movie &quot;Song of Bernadette&quot; and became enchanted with the idea of becoming a nun. But after reading Yvonne's heart-rending memoir, I know that as long as the Church retains these wolves in sheep's clothing who call themselves priests, I'd rather take my chances walking down a blind alley at 2 A.M. in a drug-infested part of town than play guessing games with wondering who's really a good priest and who's not!"},{"Title":"The Cannibal's Wife: A Memoir","review":"For me, this book showed clearly that it is children who are abused (sexually or emotionally) who are most vulnerable, as adults, to suffer similar abuse again--and remain silent. Unfortunately, I know many similar stories of sexual abuse by clergy and counselors who abused power over while pretending to serve those in their care. An example is a psychiatrist in a West European country, running an isolated clinic for women with psychosomatic problems, and &quot;helping&quot; his patients by forcing them into sex!The most horrible part is that, in all the cases I know, the victims of abuse called for help many, many times before anyone even believed their stories. It is the failure to find even a single suitably &quot;enlightened witness&quot; (in the words of Swiss psychiatrist Alice Miller) that in the end shocks me more than the instance of abuse. (Don't we all suspect that an abuser like Fr. Frank was himself victimized as a child?)It seemed to me that Fr. Frank's supervisor was also an abuser: he was hardly likely to have reported Fr. Frank. And also Fr. Stamp, before representing Sister Yvonne, had perpetrated sexual abuses on children... The web of abuse is very vast; many people in the clergy have a stake in keeping victims silenced.Sister Yvonne was deeply troubled that so few people believed and supported her when she finally told the story that had caused her to lose spirituality and optimism. I believe her; I know that her story needs retelling many times before healing can occur. It is for us to listen, again and again, even when the listening hurts us or the story seems old. This is the least we can do to break the pattern of abuse.For anyone with a similar history, I can recommend the books of Anne Wilson Schaef and those of Alice Miller (in translation from the Swiss German). For the Catholic Church, I wonder when it will notice the harm done in its treatment of women and children..."},{"Title":"The Cannibal's Wife: A Memoir","review":"I don't generally like nonfiction/biography books, but The Cannibal's Wife is a sensitive, moving read.

Just ask the person this: \\"When you found out you were or knew so-and-so... how did you deal with the shock and the fear?\\" If they don't know what you're talking about, you have a genuine, garden-variety phony.Real ones do what most of us would do in their situation: look in the mirror, think 'how could I have been THAT?', feel surreal and worry that maybe they are just crazy. When considering telling anyone, they worry about their reputations, their jobs, their relationships. They know about the phonies, the weekend Cleopatras, and they know what they will be called. They sometimes wish their memories would just go away.We hear only from the most courageous of them._Loving Mozart_ was ten years in the making; ten years for the author to gather the information and the courage to publish. Wishful thinking simply doesn't take that long, and lusts after perfect experiences, not the painful, ambiguous, messy ones portrayed. Besides, if the author had the total freedom of fantasy, why not go the whole hog and claim to have been Mozart himself?This book isn't about fame and glory anyway; it is about music, and about love. It is about loyalty, joy and a passion for creating beauty that transcend poverty, rejection and death. It is about the nature of souls and their multi-life connections and missions, and about how inspiration is drawn from the Divine.If you firmly disbelieve in reincarnation you don't want to read it; it will just seem like airy-fairy nonsense, and the details that differ from history (as is inevitable, since people often remember the same events differently) will peck at you. If you can accept reincarnation as fantasy, you will be both moved and uplifted. If you accept reincarnation as reality, you will find much that is confirmatory -- and still be moved and uplifted. If you are undecided but open-minded, there is a lot to learn, and this deeply beautiful book will stay in your mind and heart for a long time after reading."},{"Title":"Loving Mozart: A Past Life Memory of the Composer's Final Years","review":"When I read this book four years ago it haunted me for a long time. The beauty of its prose and the lucidity of the author's memories lingered in the back of mind and in the recesses of my heart, adding a dimension to the character of a young man few people can say they understand. There are no portraits of Franz S&uuml;ssmayr, no eye-witness accounts of what kind of person he was, or what his relationship with Mozart was really like. This book fills in those spaces to reveal a gifted, generous, tender-hearted man, who was a loyal friend to the end-and beyond.Books that claim to have their basis in past-life recall are always met with ridicule because people who don't believe in reincarnation are not educated in the field and thus cannot comprehend all the profound implications of it, or the myriad beautiful possibilities that go along with it. Immature souls see life as black and white. Mature souls see life as an ocean of limitless color, light and shadow, tone and texture. This book is a creation of all these qualities.I recently re-read Loving Mozart and I received more from it than I did after my first reading. Only when something contains the truth can it affect us this way-it touches our hearts again and again, regardless of how many times we pick it up, dust it off and allow it to take us into its private world. When truth is that palpable, we know it deep in our subconscious whether we recognize it or not, and assumed historical details lose their grasp. Ask any police detective if any ten people will remember an event the same way and the answer will be no. Mozart knew a great many people, some of whom were never allowed into his private life. Many of those people went on to write about him, and even they do not always agree on just what happened at the end of Mozart's life. We remember events from our own experience and inner reality, and history is written by the winners anyway. Franz S&uuml;ssmayr was not one of the winners. The winners went on to create a Mozart that would appeal to charitable organizations and individuals-an eternal manchild, a composer who never struggled over a piece of music, but composed as easily as writing out a grocery list, an apollonian god.Some critics of this book don't recognize that Loving Mozart is not a book about Mozart, but a book about the spiritual path of someone who simply loved, and acted out that love in a beautiful, selfless way. If that's not Truth I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Loving Mozart: A Past Life Memory of the Composer's Final Years","review":"for anyone who has ever stopped to wonder WHY one has these memories that just do not fit in one's current life.

WRONG! This couldn't have been farther from the truth. The book hinted that Suzy and Clifton had a 'friendship' where in truth they barely knew each other, and the only sexual tension that existed between the two was when she had hit puberty and Clifton had caught her peeking at his crotch. Basically what happens is Suzy and her best male friend Jem do not have a sexual relationship, Suzy has a crush on Jem's father Clifton who is still married to Alice, Clifton has a secret love that Suzy wants to know about, and Clifton turns out to have an Identical Twin Clayton (identical in size and desires) who wants Suzy and Alice wants Clayton. Confused yet? What follows in the story is pretty predictable and I was severely disappointed in the erotic scenes. I would only reccommend this book if you are interested in mild dom/sub play. I will hint that there is one threesome scene in the book that's only mildly redeeming, but other then that, I want my money back!! oh and the heroine has dark curly hair while the cover of the book has a blonde woman... that tells you there what it's going to be like."},{"Title":"Hot Gossip (Black Lace)","review":"Super Black Lace book that at least gives me the feelig of confidence that although the Victorians are gone, the alley cat sex that they perfected continues in the sedate English countryside today..... At least I hope so anyway ....Suzy Whitebread, (cute name or what) decides to pack up her job at the downtwon beauty salon to work in a rural mansion as a caregiver to Clifton, a country squire bound to a wheelchair after a riding accident. And care she does give him, as she manages to 'woman handle' him slowly back into reality. As the story continues one would say there was a fly in the ointment, but in this wonderfull story there are A LOT of flies in the ointment. Clifton's wife is insatiable and finds no difficulty in getting her itches scratched, his son on the other hand is hanging with travellers, otherwise known as trailer park people or gypsies ... and ... Clifton has a twin brother name Clayton that returns from overseas to check out his brother ....Although the book is called 'Hot Gossip' I would say that the author takes the reader into the lives and antics the family rather than looking at it from the point of view of the 'village gossip' ..... Actually the impression I get is that they could care less about any gossip as long as no one interferes with they very active 'social' life ....Loved it ...."},{"Title":"Investment Mathematics","review":"*Investment Mathematics* is the best (and perhaps only) book that deals with financial mathematics in a serious and useful way without requiring much in the way of math prerequisits (pre-calculus/linear algebra math ... actually a little bit of calculus knowledge would help, but it isn't absolutely necessary). With the potential audience for such a book, I'm surprised that this is the first review of this book.Unlike other books that don't quite live up to the hype in its backcover descriptions, this book does live up precisely to the descriptions on the cover (and in Amazon's info section). I won't repeat what is written there. To sum up the book very briefly, it covers a wide swathe of issues in financial mathematics that range from basic issues like interest rates and the time value of money all the way up to advanced topics like modern portfolio theory, option pricing, ARCH/GARCH, and Value at Risk.One thing to note in particular is that this is one of the few finance/investment books that I have seen that goes into detail about downside risk calculations (i.e., \\"semi-variance\\"). Most other books, even books that are on a more advanced level, often neglect to deal with the subject or just does some handwaving about it. The authors actually give you the mathematical gist of it in the book.One of the more useful aspects of this book is not given in the descriptions: It has several sidebars that gives some tips on how to use Excel to implement the models discussed in a practical setting. There are other books that go into more detail (such as *Advanced Modelling in Finance and Investment Using Excel and VBA*) but the authors ought to be commended for putting information about Excel just in case people don't own those other books.A much more important reason for why I am impressed with this book is that the authors do an excellent and mathematically accurate job of going over the mathematics of finance that doesn't require calculus or linear algebra. I can't think of any other book besides this one that I am familiar with that actually deal with the underlying mathematical logic of finance. Most other books on finance deal with the math on a cookbook level. It is truly refreshing to see a book that helps the reader to see inside the 'black box' of mathematics to see WHY financial formulae and methods are constructed the way they are.In connection with the point made above, I also appreciated the useful prose, descriptions, pictures, and sidebars that dealt with potentially useful mathematical details and tidbits - like the mechanics of geometric series and the relative positions of the mean, median, and mode, in various distributions - that are not included in most books on finance that I'm aware of. Some of those details may seem basic and trivial, but it is nice to have that information in one place (and/or not have to run to a non-finance math/stat book) and is very instructive for people for whom such details are not trivial.The only weakness of this book is one of the book's strength: It's lack of calculus and linear algebra. E.g., even when it talks about stochastic models, it really doesn't get into stochastic calculus. On advanced topics such as MPT, option pricing, ARCH/GARCH, etc., the goal seems to be to build intuition. However, this is a rather limited goal. One cannot truly grasp the complexity of those advanced topics without delving into calculus, linear algebra, and advanced probability and statistical theory. For people who are interested in getting a relatively accessible intro into those topics, I would recommend books by people like Paul Wilmott.So, in summary, I believe that this book will be a useful introduction to financial mathematics pre-calculus/linear algebra. For those looking to get into more advanced topics in financial mathematics, I would highly recommend this book because it gives an excellent overview of those advanced topics and can serve as a bridge to more advanced issues.In fact, I would recommend this book to some people who consider themselves to be quants dealing with financial math on a higher-level than does this book. Why? Because I strongly believe that many people - even highly sophisticated people - often received cookbook training in financial modeling. Therefore, many people don't understand the basic logical underpinning of what they are doing! *Investment Mathematics* remedies that situation by doing an excellent job of dealing with the mathematical logic of 'basic' financial mathematical models.Further recommendations: The only other book that I know of that comes close (but is not quite as comprehensive) to dealing with the logical underpinnings of financial formulae/methods and provides useful tidbits on financial math is *Puzzles of Finance* by Mark Kritzman. Another book with a similar zeitgeist (and target audience) as *Investment Mathematics* - but focused in on financial risk - is *Fundamentals of Risk Measurement* by Marrison."},{"Title":"Investment Mathematics","review":"It just like a series of unreadable words with equations. Poorly presented with not much explanation. Waste of time."},{"Title":"Tales of the Witch World 2","review":"Ms. Norton didn't write *any* of the stories in this volume.Bell, Claire: \\"The Hunting of Lord Estalian's Daughter\\" Megarti, a witch-maid raped by a drunken noble, has asked to be shapechanged in her quest for revenge.Curry, Ginger Simpson: \\"Sea-Serpents of Domnudale\\" - The Wise Woman prophesies that twins will be born, one of the Dark to conquer and rule as overlord of many Dales, and one of the light - one evil, the other the true-born son of Lady Zvetta and her lord. But which is which? The 'bad seed' idea may not appeal, and the manner of presentation may distract you at first, but a good story.Gravel, Geary: \\"Old Toad\\" - Ander and Berry, young brother and sister, dwell in Mountain Gate on the Estcarp border - but *he's * the one with Witch power, while she has a talent for asking questions - like why the Council has transferred their resident Witch, and why the Borderers seem to be pulling out of the mountains bordering Karsten...Lewitt, S.N.: \\"The Judgment of Neave\\" - A tale of the Fane of Neave in Arvon and its search for a new guardian.Lichtenberg, Jaqueline: \\"Through the Moon Gate\\" - Remora, a tough youngster fed up with being laughed at for her dreams of the Old Ones, has struck out across the Waste to find Arvon. Instead, she finds a gate - and Dorian St. Just (\\"Good God, this isn't Denver, is it?\\") But he's not as out of place as one might think...Linaweaver, Brad & Cynthia: \\"Dream Pirates' Jewel\\" - After the destruction of Sulcarkeep in the Kolder War, leaving radioactive ruins, a small expedition finds a bay in southern High Hallack (separated by mountains from the chaos of the Invaders' War) that seems eminently suitable for a new keep. So the Sulcar have a settlement again, including some flotsam from the war, such as the witch-gifted girlchild Myrna, and her strange dreams of the sea.Major, A.R.: \\"La Verdad: The Magic Sword\\" - Gunnora sends an emissary to Abbey Halstead, furthest north of the convents of those who worship Those Who Set The Flames, asking alliance against the toads at Grimmerdale, to open a gate and bring forth a champion. (See _Lore of the Witch World_ if you're not familiar with Grimmerdale. Its chronology in the Invaders' War and that of the sword's origin don't seem to mesh at first, but the author has it covered.)Mathews, Patricia Shaw: \\"Darkness Over Mirhold\\" - Rovagh of Mirhold became lord by being a berserker fighting man in a hold desperate to have someone take over and start running the place. Derris, the narrator, is his newly-wed lady - one of the many orphans in the care of the Duke of Karsten, in these days after the war, chosen because she seemed the only one strong enough to help rebuild a ruined hold.Meier, Shirley: \\"Peacock Eyes\\" - Shallon, the narrator, was once human - she speaks of the days when the road through the Dales to the Gate, now crossing part of the Waste, was new, not old.Miesel, Sandra: \\"The Salt Garden\\" Orel, last survivor of Estindale after Alizon blasted it into slag with Kolder weapons, and after his father fell to ambush days ago, has fled into the Waste, determined at least to die while exploring new things. (His father's killers have their maps, so there's really nowhere else to go). The lifeless city he comes to reminded me at first of Charn (in Lewis' _The Magician's Nephew_) - a city where only one woman, apparently an Old One, still lives, crafting flowers out of metal and gems where no water flows to give real flowers life. But is she the destroyer of the city, a victim, or neither?Miller, Ann: \\"The Stones of Sharnon\\" - A Mineral and Energy Scout from a high-tech civilization strays into Estcarp on an innocent survey.Paxson, Diana: \\"Heroes\\" Aelvan, only living son of a refugee from Karsten and her Borderer husband, follows the House of Dhulmat when they answer Kyllan Tregarth's call into Escore.Schwartz, Susan: \\"Rite of Failure\\" Aurek, marked as the successor to the Pack's shaman, has undertaken his ordeal early, in these first days of their exile from Arvon. But what will happen to him now that he's failed?Snodgrass, Melinda: \\"Futures Yet Unseen\\" Sytry, the narrator, can't be a conventional warrior, with his malformed hip; he's that rarity in Escore, a student of chemistry, who turns it to practical use.Swallow, Lisa: \\"S'Olcarias's Sons\\" An old grandfather of the Sulcar tells a story of their origins over the evening fire.Wind, David: \\"The Sentinel at the Edge of the World\\" - Set before the Kolder War. Vadim, the narrator, is a blank shield of Estcarp, offered service by a man seeking, not a mere mercenary, but a hero, to accompany him to the end of the world - eastward.Wolf, Rose: \\"Tall Dames Go Walking\\" - A story of Jorge Petronius, the mysterious Guardian who opened Simon Tregarth's Gate into Estcarp, on an archaeological dig between Glastonbury and Tintagel in Britain. The references to how Petronius came into his guardianship don't seem consistent with the little we know from _Witch World_. The narration is somewhat awkward, as the author isn't content to let the reader do some of the work of understanding the story, e.g. \\"...her interest was at least purely (again, in a literal sense) academic\\", providing explicit literary allusion wherever possible rather than more subtle references.

This large volume is filled with amazing insights. It combines the author's own life-long search for the deeper meaning of the Bible with the discoveries of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the founder of Anthroposophy (The Wisdom of Man). The book unveils what people have had to believe only through faith.

I opened it up, and saw chart and table after chart and table and they all had this kind of magic power. Based on the pictures alone, I bought the book, excited. And then...I read the book.There is a huge amount of information here, for anyone interested in Steiner or anyone who is not satisfied with what they have learned in regards to Christianity. Here, Smith takes Steiner's Biblical insights, and presents them with both sharpness and depth. For me, certain things that I was taught never added up. After reading this book, I discovered a richness and depth I never knew were present in the Bible, or the world.Five years later, I have read many works by Steiner (all of which are amazing) and, looking back, I must say how truly blessed I am to have had this book appear in my life. Another reviewer noted how this book will one day become a classic in Christianity, and I agree wholeheartedly.All in all, I was blown away at the penetrating lucidity for such complex topic....and then I read David's Question!"},{"Title":"The Burning Bush : Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures : Terms & Phrases","review":"This book is an impressive work by a passionate autodidact. It helpfully organizes many of Rudolf Steiner's insights into the Christian Bible. Since these are widely scattered through Steiner's writings and lectures, it is a great service to have them available in one place. Until the complete works of Steiner are translated into English and available digitally, Smith's commentaries will be a useful resource for any English-speaking reader interested in Steiner's interpretations of the Bible and of Christianity in general. And if Smith's work leads others to read more of Steiner, that seems a tremendous benefit, too.The difficulty with Smith's approach, from my perspective, is that it comes out of an incorrigibly literalistic, fundamentalist approach to scripture and to texts in general. His chapter-and-verse approach to the Bible, using Steiner to finally unveil the line-by-line mysteries of God's inspired word, seems to me discordant and even antithetical to Steiner's own approach. Steiner delivered his insights in the course of lectures and writings meant to transform the members of his audience. He would have been profoundly adverse to assembling discrete bits of data into a nearly cybernetic system to output the hidden meanings of the Bible.I grant that there is a place for Smith's type of systematizing work, but I wish it were more deeply informed by Steiner's own broad-ranging curiousity and profound imaginative insight. Smith's doggedly literalistic approach leaves out so much of Steiner's vitality that his commentary seems to me nearly unrecognizable as anthroposophy, despite its sub-title.I see Smith's commentaries as the personal monument of a indefatigable, self-trained scholar. Smith has done his work in virtual isolation from broader currents of cultural discourse about biblical texts and less broad but still vital interpretations of Rudolf Steiner. I wish Smith had spent less time compiling notecards from every translated Steiner work he could find and more time in intellectual conversation with, for example, recent work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other early Christian texts. Smith's obsessiveness as a writer extends so far as to citing definitions from English-language dictionaries, as though he refuses to assume a mutual cultural literacy with his readers, much less a shared imaginative or spiritual faculty.I've ended up sounding too harsh. Smith's work is valuable, if often maddening. Perhaps it will inspire someone with broader reading and deeper theological insight to present and interpret Steiner's radical approach to the Bible and Christian religion."},{"Title":"Guide to Zanzibar","review":"I used this guide as well as the Lonely Planet Tanzania one 6 months ago for my trip. I was in Zanzibar for only a week. I found it hard to use and ended up using only the LP Tanzania guide because it had enough information for my short stay.If you're just going to Zanzibar and staying longer than 2 weeks, then it may be more useful. However, if you have less than two weeks on Zanzibar, this book is too overwhelming. If you're traveling on a budget like me, just get a Tanzania guidebook that has Zanzibar in it.

It gives guidance to those of us who want to travel responsibly, and points readers to some of the best locally owned and operated companies.I was pleased to see that the book mentions one of the local tour groups that my husband and I visited in Zanzibar (Eco & Culture Tours), and other groups that go beyond the standard spice tours and provide a deeper understanding of the culture, economy, and environment. These types of resources make this Zanzibar Bradt Travel Guide really stand out among travel guides.I also enjoyed the details of the history section, with easy to read text boxes on Zanzibar's colorful and sometimes thorny past. I especially loved learning about Princess Sayyida Salme, the author of Memoirs of an Arabian Princess from Zanzibar.This book is the one to get -- well written, sensitive, packed with helpful tips, and insightful about how you can really get to know and enjoy Zanzibar, even if you only have a few days there.I also recommend it as a research guide for folks studying responsible tourism -- even if they don't plan to go to Zanzibar."},{"Title":"Guide to Zanzibar","review":"Zanzibar, Pemba, Mafia by Chris and Susan McIntyre is the guidebook we chose for our recent trip to Zanzibar Island, off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa.

Mr. Franklin's autobiography is a short book which covers only some of the events of his life, stopping well short of the years where he solidified himself not only as a founder, but also a key framer of the U.S. Given it's brevity and lack of breadth, it's not all it could have been. This book does make for a wonderful treatment of a man creating the template of someone living the American Dream.I read it now in spite of having also read it in high school like so many other public school students; that's because I thought thirty-plus years later I'd have a different perspective and hopefully be prepared to better appreciate some life lessons that escaped my prior adolescent reading.What I recall then was the template for fulfilling the American dream, which resonates every bit as much now as it did all those years ago. What I learn in this go-round is how much systemic effort Franklin put into becoming a better person. He didn't passively coast through life encountering events in a way that had him reactively attempting to meet some ill-considered standard of virtue. Instead Mr. Franklin used spreadsheets to track his defects in character for a given virtue, where he focused on a one or a handful of virtues at a time to become a better student of each. For example, on page 97, he reveals his focus on practicing temperance where he notes the times he fails in a columnar table of days where each row is a virtue.One gets the sense reading this book that perhaps more than any other founding character, we'd be a very different place if Franklin never existed."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Very hard to read and understand.

At once you realize you are reading about a time written by someone living in that moment, not from a modern perspective with attendant bias. You don't just read about history, you live it with Franklin as his life unfolds along with the birth of a nation.Reading this book made me want to learn more from an autobiographical perspective.

It has influenced countless successful people, not withstanding Mark Twain's criticism of it as the cause of misery when held up as an example to children.Franklin originally wrote it as a letter to his son, and I've always wondered if it was part of their falling out. (I'll have to ask my friend Chris Lewis [...] who does a wonderful recreation of Ben and is a real expert.)Sometimes children are resistent to the wisdom of the parent, and this was certainly true of Franklin's son. Even in this Franklin sets an example for us, although in this area it's about what not to do.This revised edition has a wonderful new introduction by Edmund Morgan, who wrote one of the 300th aniversary biographies of Franklin. (My favorites were H.W. Brand'sThe First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklinand Walter Isaacson'sBenjamin Franklin: An American LifeOne thing that bothers me about this revision is a missing footnote. If I'm not mistaken, the original said Franklin's original Franklin Circle, which he and his friends called the Junto, was the inspiration for Goethe's Friday Club. That reference seems to be missing, and I wonder why.But that question aside, this is a book that should be on the bookshelf of every American, a book to read and re-read and discuss, perhaps at your Franklin Circle as we move into another election cycle."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I often lament the fact that we as humans are constantly reinventing the wheel, and if we were to read more biographies and learn from our forebears -- we would avail ourselves of much of their wisdom and knowledge. That being the case, \\"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\" should be considered as one of the finest and best sources of autobiographical material upon which to build.In fact, Mr. Franklin's autobiography is considered to be one of the very first \\"self-help\\" books by some personal productivity gurus today (and often referenced by them in their works). His autobiography is really a guide to proper living, industriousness, and of obtaining wisdom -- and I think it should be required reading for anyone who wishes to overcome bad habits and obtain good ones.In addition, his principles of obtaining wealth through hard work should be mandatory reading for many in our financial sector today who brought about such calamity to the global economy through their greed, excess and obfuscations in the housing and stock markets.Written as a book addressed to his son, Franklin tells an interesting story of how he rose from very modest beginnings in Colonial Massachusetts -- decades before the United States even existed -- to become one of the most highly respected people of his day. It is a remarkable life that he describes, and it is to the great benefit of the reader that he interweaves into his tales many nuggets of wisdom that he has learned the hard way.One style of his writing that I particularly enjoy -- and which in some ways models the parables of Jesus -- is that he will often offer some bit of wisdom, and then explain and reinforce that wisdom with a story from his life (or vice versa). I have found especially helpful his advice on how to avoid being argumentative, while at the same time being more persuasive. Mr. Franklin also prescribes a set of Thirteen Virtues -- of which good moral habits can be systematically obtained and incorporated into our daily lives.I've read a few reviews that criticize the latter half of the book as meandering and less interesting than the first half. This was not the case for me, as I found the second half of the book to actually be even more interesting than the first.Unfortunately, the autobiography ends in the 1760s -- which is well before his death or the events that led up to the formation of the U.S. However, you do get a sense of some of the reasons why the American colonists felt aggrieved by the actions of the British crown in Franklin's description of the decades prior to the American Revolution. Also, I should warn that this work was written in the 18th century, so his style of writing reflects that. It's not in any way a problem, but you might want to have a dictionary nearby for some of the less commonly used words today.Overall, \\"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\" is an excellent read for anyone seeking to overcome bad habits, gain wisdom, and be prosperous in life -- or for anyone interested in American history."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I have to say this is the most inspirational book I have ever read in my 51 years. Franklin's efforts to improve himself through his 13-week plan is a brilliant blueprint for success. Just the way he thinks. It is like being in the company of a great man...the greatness rubs off a little. This book has a permanent place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Like so many people I only know Benjamin Franklin from school and history books where he comes across as someone stiff and formal. But here in the first half of this book we find Ben Franklin the boy. We hear him complain of his parents, his restrictions, quarrels with his brothers, and of course things that all boys do. He steals from a construction site to build a fishing pier -- and gets caught. We see him finally breaking away and moving to Philadelphia where he arrives with very little money and must subsist on bread. He describes his youth and his gradual maturity as he builds his life and fortune. Interestingly this book leaves some doubt as to whether he was actually married to Deborah Read or had an \\"arrangement\\". I particularly enjoyed his description of General Braddock and his defeat by the Indians. Although this was only briefly touched on this and other similar references to the English gives you insight into why the colonists rebelled. Clearly the English completely misjudged the American Character as most Europeans do even today.Unfortunately the second half of this book was written after the war and when Franklin was an old man and clearly not terribly interested in finishing this book. It reads as an after thought and really doesn't provide any insight into his role or the extraordinary people and events of which he was a part. But it does show the close relationship he had with his son so when the estrangement came it must have hurt him deeply although this is a subject not mentioned at all in the book.However, the editors have kindly provided a marvelous timeline in the appendix, which really gives you a summary of the Revolutionary War as it places various key events into perspective. You see the impact that John Paul Jones's victory over the Serapis had on events in Paris. It shows how Franklin's diplomatic skills had a huge effect on the ultimate outcome of the war.Franklin was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. He writes about himself rather modestly and really doesn't touch on his activities during the war in any detail and for this reason I only gave this book four stars. Still this is an interesting book about a truly fascinating man."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The greatest resource into understanding Benjamin Franklin, and perhaps one of the best sources for understanding the times of the Revolutionary period and the years preceding it. Due to Franklin's unique position in society in his time, we see the world of science, politics, and revolution from one of the key players in each of those areas.His honest approach to his life can be somewhat unsettling, smashing our often idealistic ideas of this great American hero. But his honesty will be appreciated, as it colors the scene of his world and his contemporaries in hues that are unmatched by modern scholarly investigation."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"After reading Walter Isaacson's, Ben Franklin, An American Life, the Autobiography of Ben Franklin by Benjamin Franklin was a huge disappointment. Written in the original, King's English, it is not an enjoyable read. If you want to experience the character and personality of Benjamin Franklin then read Isaacson's biography."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Written over a period of nearly thirty years and covering his life only until 1759 (he died in 1790), the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin nonetheless established the lore associated with the man. While many biographies of Franklin penned since his death have attempted to officially correct the record and convey a truer picture of him, a sense of the old Franklin endures in no small part due to his autobiography.In this book, we encounter Franklin the reader, printer, civic leader, writer, inventor, diplomat and so much more. While perhaps the depths of his knowledge in his chosen fields are insufficient to classify him as a genuine renaissance man, he is, all the same, versatile, engaged, and devoted to self-improvement. Franklin is ambitious and desirous of seizing the day and enjoying all that life has to offer. He is also someone who is clearly proud of his accomplishments. Pride seems to be one contemporaneous arrow of criticism against him that found its mark. So much so, in fact, that he later added humility to his original list of 12 virtues. He writes that \\"there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride.\\" Franklin is also quite forthcoming with respect to his own failure to acquire humility, although he admits to success \\"with regard to the appearance of it.\\" It is, of course, possible that this introspection is all carefully constructed artifice designed to endear Franklin to the reader and to help secure his place in history as an enormously talented, but forgivably flawed man. While Franklin was certainly capable of shaping his public image, I think he reveals enough of himself for us to ascertain that there is truth amongst whatever tall tales or exaggerations exist in this brief volume.The first part of this book, considered by many to be the best, exists as a letter to his son. It is here that we learn something of Franklin's early life. We find a 12 year old, bookish Ben Franklin indentured to his brother James as a printer, despite his yearning to be at sea. Eventually, Ben manages to extricate himself from this arrangement by \\"asserting\\" his freedom and counting on his brother not to force the issue. While this was a success, he later believed it was somewhat unfair of him, even though his brother occasionally delivered blows to the young man. Franklin's maritime proclivities eventually wane and he makes his way to Philadelphia. It is here that Franklin comes into his own. The establishment of his printing business, invention of the Franklin stove, formation of the first \\"circulating library\\" in the U.S., and the first fire department in Pennsylvania is recounted. We are given accounts of his time in London, dalliances with women, and some of the \\"errata\\" of his life. Lest we forget, there are also the virtues which he intended to make a part of his character: Temperance, Silence, Order, Resolution, Frugality, Industry, Sincerity, Justice, Moderation, Cleanliness, Tranquility, Chastity, and Humility.While the remaining parts of the book may not be as strong or cohesive, they still impart interesting information and insight into the man. The Touchstone edition of the book contains a short introduction by Lewis Leary that is a worthwhile preface to the autobiography despite his disapproval that part of the book is \\"burdened with morality.\\" And yet, it is this morality and quest for \\"moral perfection\\" that is, above all, the driving force of Franklin. However future generations judge Benjamin Franklin, his contributions to the burgeoning United States of America and the reputation thereof are as undeniable and appealing as he himself is."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography creates a portal into the mind of one of America's greatest minds. Not only did Franklin play a pivotal role in the development of our nation but he also made huge advancements in the field of electricity. His descriptions of experiences such as the famous kite experiment grant some understanding of just how remarkable these revelations were in the mid-1700s. His subsequent invention of the lightning rod, something taken for granted today, is fascinating to read about in his own words. Learning about the electrical innovations that Franklin made, written in his own words and in the language of the period offers a unique approach to the subject of electricity. The fact that Franklin managed to accomplish all of these feats in addition to playing the role as a Founding Father is astounding and only adds to the significance of the his individual successes."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ben Franklin details his interesting life in his own words. If you want an investment guide, self-help book, historical read, business primer, and a look into the life of an American original, this is it, all in one medium length book. Some readers will find the phrasing antiquated, and sentence structure longer than normal. A small quibble that reflects more upon our modern age than the work itself. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I was surpris'd to find myself so much fuller of Faults than I had imagined . . . &quot; says Ben Franklin, upon entering a quest for moral perfection. True and yet somewhat humorous. This book constantly &quot;surpris'd&quot; and amused, particularly with its pithy observations delivered in a mildly humorous good natured tone.Included are his candid confessions of &quot;errata&quot; in which he tells how he propositioned his best friend's wife and was rightly rebuffed by her. When she told her husband, he refused to pay debts he owed Ben Franklin. (BF decided to forget about the money and move on, sans former friend.) He also recounts his chagrin and dishonor at spending money entrusted to him.For me, the most interesting part was the quest for moral perfection in which he listed 13 virtues: Temperance; Silence; Order; Resolution; Frugality; Industry; Sincerity; Justice; Moderation; Cleanliness; Tranquillity; Chastity; and Humility. He worked on one of these per week, and gave himself a black mark in his book each time he became aware he committed a violation. While this sounds grim, BF's approach was so laden with humor and acceptance of human frailties, it was delightful. For example, he says regarding Pride: &quot;For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my Humility.&quot;There are so many good points in this writing I can only list a few:Want of Modesty is Want of Sense: Early, BF was fond of argument and disputation, but he observed that men of good sense rarely engaged in it. He struck the words &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc., and used words such as &quot;I should think it so&quot; or &quot;I imagine it so&quot; or &quot;If I am not mistaken&quot;. He retained the habit of speaking with &quot;modest Diffidence&quot;. He says this has been of great advantage to him in persuading men. He says &quot;I wish well-meaning sensible men would not lessen their Power of doing good by a Positive assuming Manner that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create Opposition, and to defeat everyone of those Purposes for which Speech was given us, to wit, giving or receiving Information or Pleasure.Croakers: &quot;There are Croakers in every Country always boding its ruin.&quot; BF's point was that one should not listen to unfounded pessimism which seems to be rampant and discourages constructive activities.How to Solicit: When BF was soliciting donations for his library, he first said he had the idea for a library, but met with resistance from potential donors. He then switched to leaving himself out of the picture as much as possible, and said others had this the idea for a library. Solicitations then went much better. He said &quot;The present little Sacrifice of your Vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the Merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be dispos'd to do you Justice, by plucking those assum'd Feathers, and restoring them to their right Owner.&quot;Morale: BF was assigned to build a fort in hostile country, and observed that while the men were working hard to build the fort, which they did very quickly, they were happy. However, once it was done and they were idle, they quickly became discontented and mutinous. He said this is why sea captains keep the crew busy, even if it is only to polish the anchor.Much of the book's charm comes from it's very clear use of language and subtle humor, which is difficult to capture without a great deal of direct quotation. A case in point is the speckled ax anecdote - which is wonderful, but needs to be read directly from BF.I see some of the other reviewers noted it was boring - which is true in places, particularly at the start. I urge everyone to read this book, but skim the first ten or twenty pages dealing with family history, and also skim or skip other places that may bog down. I still find things of interest that I skipped over previously, even after reading this several times.I give this my highest five-star rating but for reasons other than one might think. The historical significance is substantial, recounting and communicating of feel of the times of the formation of America is outstanding, and the political significance of BF is undeniable. However, I gave it its highest rating because the book speaks to me on a very personal basis, I loved reading it, and delighted in its humor and wisdom."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I thought this book was much more than a humorous or adventerous account. I am reminded of the book of Solomon and the wise adages endowed by God therein. Bejamin Franklin's memoirs cover an array of wise maxims that all men should learn. Franklin especially concentrates his philosophy in the way of frugality and financial responsibility. Too many young men waste their lives in ignorance. If more men sought out wisdom, the world would be a better place."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Benjamin Franklin, no matter which way you look at him, was a great American. I love the stories and folktales about him, his life and his wonderful words and sayings. This autobiography of his life was written by Ben Franklin when he was sixty-five. It was written in letter format to his son, and it he reminiscences about his eventfull early life. Throughout we see Benjamin's powerful literary style and his great humour. This autobiography is well worth a visit if only to get a first-hand look at a very colourful historical American."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Well, it has been nearly 30 years since I first read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and one can still gain some insights after a good second reading. Both the American Icon's wisdom and insights are time honored and worth repeating no matter what your age. As one must chose their heroes and mentors well, Benjamin Franklin serves all well in both roles.This edition has copious footnotes on every page unlike traditionally at the end of the book. The authors may have felt that the reader would be interested in the quick reference aspect versus paging to the back. Though this can be a little strange at first, I get their point and maybe it was better this way.One aspect that I would have liked; however, would have been if they had added some of his other selected writings like \\"The Way to Wealth\\" and others.

I found the experience to be very pleasant."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"\\"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\" was a book I had read long ago in high school. Now that I found the Kindle edition, I just had to go back and read it again.Benjamin Franklin was observant and insightful. From him, generations may learn. Even now, I find myself picking up some helpful tips regarding the art of persuasion or working in groups.Franklin writes in an older English style, which only adds to the experience. I did not find it difficult to read at all. His boyhood is most interesting. That he rose from humble beginnings to such greatness is a testament to the man himself. He explains many of this beliefs and how he arrived at them, the many methodical ways he worked to improve himself. I would have liked to see more about his role in the revolution and his thoughts about the constitution and other political events around that time. Those things are lacking, but it is a most interesting autobiography, nevertheless.There are some problems with the Kindle version. I can't navigate to the chapters from the table of contents (not that he named any of the chapters, but even numbered chapters would be helpful). Also, the footnotes were not done well. I see a number and read through it thinking it's a mistake in printing only to see after a page that it was a footnote. However, for a free book, it can't be beat; and it was more than worth my time."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"When I was a boy, my father told me to read the &quot;Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.&quot; Of course, I didn't listen to Dad but now, decades later, I have finally read it. This book is not a comprehensive memoir of the historical events that made him famous. Indeed, the book ends when he is in his early 50s, long before his activities in the Continental Congress, as delegate to the constitutional convention, and as Minister to France. What this book does is to give us the flavor of this remarkable man's personality.The first part of this book was really letters to his son and the latter part continued the narrative. He writes with a subtle humor that at times had me in stitches. He writes about his scientific achievements and inventions such as what has become known as the &quot;Franklin stove,&quot; and his experiments with electricity. Evidentally, there were some in the scientific community who did not believe that lightening was electricity and he took delight in proving them wrong (he very briefly mentions his kite experiment).He writes about virtues and his cultivation of them. He reflects upon religion yet he was not dogmatic. He was civic minded, starting, among other things, a fire department and a public library. In short, he was a reflective, intelligent, industrious, remarkable man and we realize this best by reading his own words. My father was right; I should have read this years ago."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This is the story of one of America's smartest men. Written in a seemingly desultory manner, Franklin tells about his life from his beginnings in Boston to his contributions to science and the enlightenment. I was a little disappointed though because there was no writing about the American revolutionary war or the drafting of the American Constitution-two things that Franklin is known for. In addition we don't get a detailed account of his discoveries in electricity (at least in the Dover edition, other editions might include other writings by Franklin). However, this book does shed light on the American spirit. He talks about how he came one day to Philadelphia with only enough money to buy some bread, and ended up years later as one of Philadelphia's most respected man.This books is colored with enjoyable stories and anecdotes from Franklin's life. Every page is full of little aphorisms and maxims in witty tales about events in Franklin's life. I'd recommend this book for the quality of Franklin's wisdom. Even if he wasn't so important to the birth of the United States, this book would still be cherished by the American people."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Fantastic Kindle version of this book!

And, not in the comfort you would find cruising the Atlantic these days!

The myriad of various snapshots of Franklin's life were, to me, fascinating. It was not a complete historical review of the mans life ( he omitted his being a part of free masonry and the part he played in the war,) yet it helped to understand who he was. It was nice to see his imperfections displayed unapologetically, and to know he was simply human, full of vice and of course deep caring in some respects. In grade school, they portrayed him as a near saint, and I appreciated the fact that the book showed his many humanistic characteristics which for good or bad, he was just a man. I think this should be mandatory reading in at least high school, as it is an easy read which shows the reader how life was at the period."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography is one of the very few books that all Americans should read, and virtually everyone else should also. Its greatness and importance can hardly be exaggerated. Aside from being a great autobiography, the book cuts to the very heart of what it means to be American; it is indeed hardly hyperbolic to say that Franklin created the American dream, and this details it. The work thus has strong inspirational potential, not least because it is a great and unusually practical ethics primer. In addition, it is a fascinating glimpse at late colonial America, and we get plenty of Franklin's wit and wisdom.The book would of course be invaluable if it were only an autobiography, as Franklin is one of the most notable and interesting people to ever live. His life was long, and he accomplished more than almost anyone in history; a simple list of his achievements would almost be a book in itself. That he did not come close to completing this is thus extremely regrettable; it goes only to 1758, when Franklin was in his early 50s, well before his famed public career. Those wanting coverage of this important era will thus be disappointed and must rely on later biographies. However, Franklin's long list of accomplishments even at that point does much to atone. It is also important to realize that this is not a formal autobiography but was written in four stages over nearly twenty years. The first and probably best-known part was as a 1771 letter to Franklin's son. The much shorter Part Two was written in 1784, continuing the former narrative for the public. Part Three was written in 1788 and the very short Part Four, which breaks off somewhat abruptly because Franklin was near death, in 1790. The book - no part of which was published until after Franklin's death, and then only in French, and which did not come out in full until well into the nineteenth century - as it stands was thus not meant to be cohesive and is indeed far from it; there is a little overlap and no real transitions. No one should expect polish, but there is no arguing with what is here, though Part Four is clearly less substantial. We learn about Franklin's family background and early life, his near-literal rags to riches rise, his printing career, his writing, his scientific exploits and inventions, his early political actions, etc. This encompasses an astonishing number and variety of important and worthy deeds. The sheer number of things that Franklin began or pioneered is simply incredible - and almost unbelievable considering the circumstances. We see everything from the founding of the first American fire department and library to the founding of the University of Pennsylvania to the famous electrical experiments to the invention of the Franklin Stove and other devices - and far more. It is an excellent story well-told, and anyone at all interested in autobiography will be endlessly intrigued.Franklin's rise from humble origins to world fame and acclaim is endlessly amazing and ever-admirable. One of the first truly self-made men, he had the kind of can-do optimism, resolve, and perseverance of which few people can even conceive. Franklin details how he did it, thus delineating the American dream that has attracted the down and out but hopeful from all around the world for over two centuries. The book's influence is simply profound - and quite direct in that it is still widely read, though indirect ramifications are even more enormous. Hundreds of millions have imitated it whether they know or not - and many have known -, but probably none have equaled it, and few have even come close. Yet it shows no sign of ceasing to be inspirational; Franklin shows, as no one else has ever come close to doing, that hard work and determination really can pay off. It is remarkable enough that his story is real, but the truly remarkable thing is how little it owes to luck. Many have of course been disappointed, often tragically, in trying to emulate Franklin, and it is undeniable that monumental intelligence and a plethora of other assets gave an edge that only a very small number of people can ever come close to reproducing. For all this, though, his story's bare reality is the best kind of inspiration one could ever hope for.As if listing his accomplishments were not enough, Franklin also relays his truly noble self-improvement experiment; knowing his faults all too well but determined to be virtuous, he developed and rigorously applied a near-mathematical improvement system. He did not fully succeed, but the degree to which he did is highly noteworthy. There is much to be learned here as elsewhere; many have used his system, some with considerable success, and nearly everyone can get something valuable from it. On top of everything else, the book is thus a great ethics introduction - the kind that simply has not existed for some time. Franklin combines the best aspects of Spartan, Roman, and Puritan ideas of virtue - a combination that cannot be found in the innumerable tripe now littering self-help bookshelves. Unlike those wretched works, this is intellectually and even aesthetically pleasing - and more importantly, is eminently practical and supremely accessible.Franklin was great in nearly every sense - full of virtue and true nobility as almost no one has been. He has rightly been an American hero for centuries, revered around the world. That said, he has always had critics, and it is easy to latch onto negative things. Some - famously including D. H. Lawrence - have condemned Franklin as hopelessly materialistic, obsessed with what the latter elsewhere called \\"the way to wealth.\\" There is definitely some truth here, and it would be quite hard to deny that perversion of Franklin's scheme has led to significant harm. One can of course say this is not his fault, but more to the point is that it is hard to criticize considering Franklin's circumstances - and only the envious will begrudge his success. This in any case sells him very short; Franklin after all refused to patent that would have made him unspeakably wealthy or accept money for public office. It is also very unfair to claim or even imply that he cared only for wealth. We must not forget that Franklin was one of his era's greatest scientists and intellectuals and an extremely well-read polyglot - all his own doing, as he had almost no formal education. However, he may be otherwise criticized - not least for the book's profusion of barely-disguised vanity, which he admits many times. In the end, though, this is hardly worth mentioning. Being Franklin, the only surprising thing is that he was not much vainer still; nearly anyone else would have been, and who can deny it would have been almost entirely justified? An arguably more substantial point is Franklin's infamously innumerable sexual trysts, including many with prostitutes. He refers to this himself, including what he calls \\"low women,\\" but some may disparage him for not being more open. That said, it is only fair to note that he is often surprisingly honest - not only in mentioning such dalliances at all but in many other ways, not least the blunt description of his failed marriage proposal. Some will value this, while others will think Franklin honest to a fault, and still others will think it does not go far enough. We must remember in any case that this part was written to his son and that the book was meant to be practically applicable rather than confessional.Practicality is indeed Franklin's core trait and the one that should get the most attention; it goes a long way toward erasing any doubts. Regardless of how famous or rich he became, Franklin was never highfalutin or pretentious, always retaining the hard common sense that served him so well. This led to great improvements not only in his life but in countless others; for example, despite a fearsome intellect, vast self-education, and highly impressive accomplishments in nearly every field, Franklin could still concern himself with things like reducing street dust and making street lights brighter. How many in his position would have even noticed such things - except perhaps to complain? Flawed as he clearly was, only a handful of people even compete with him for widespread benefits to humanity. We can - and should - admire and appreciate this, whatever else we think of him.His wisdom also comes across in many other ways, benefiting us further. Franklin had great insight into human nature and has much practical advice about virtually every interpersonal relations aspect, including how to advance agendas without making enemies and even how to turn enemies into friends. His observations on everything from literature to religion also have great value; simply put, he could hardly write boringly, and what he has to say is very far from boring in any case.Additionally, it must be pointed out that the book would be of great value even if it did not deal with someone as important as Franklin because it is an excellent primary source about a very important period. We get a very vivid idea of what it was like to live in early to mid-eighteenth century America socially, economically, politically, and otherwise. The work's historical value is probably impossible to calculate.Finally, one must not neglect to mention that Franklin is a prime American prose stylist. He deliberately wrote in a very simple style that was clear, concise, and generally accessible - a distinct contrast to the mainstream writing of his time. Some may doubt this, but it is easily proven by comparing the book to other late eighteenth century ones - or even many from less than a century ago. How many can be easily read without footnotes and other glosses or extensive introductions? Spelling and punctuation have of course changed significantly, but anyone can still pick this up and get into it quite quickly and easily, which is not its least notable feature.All told, this is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in Franklin, American history, self-improvement, or any of the many other topics on which it touches despite being under 150 pages. The world would undeniably be substantially better if everyone read this and took its most inspiriting aspects to heart, and there can be no higher praise."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Though it can be a bit of a drag at times, this excellent autobiography is threaded with the best of humour (though probably unintended by it's author).

I was particularly struck by his chosen method of convincing someone to change their position to one that would concur closer to his. I resolved that I also must master this method of Socrates. To wit, just ask polite questions that direct them to where you see a fallacy in their thinking. My past method was always to convince others that my position was correct.

And it is good. It does provide a wonderful snapshot of early colonial America (and for that it is an interesting read.) You begin to see that what we have today (jump in a car or plane and travel) is really luxurious even if you get stuck on the plane for five hours (he notes at one point where passengers were held on a ship for at least a month without going anywhere.) But this also is the downfall of the book. Certain sections are extremely detailed (down to the streets he used to get to where he was going.)There was some interesting information about some of the organizations he was part of. One of the other reviewers states that he neglects to talk about his role in the Freemasons, I believe that he just refers to it by a different name as there was a Freemason like group that he described in great detail.Additionally, though a small part of the book, he writes about the virtues that he considers important and why they are important.In conclusion, good read, but just remember this is not the complete autobiography as he chose not to write about the revolution in this book though he did write part of the book after the revolution."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"As Franklin acknowledges at the start, autobiographies tend to be laudatory and his is no exception.

It is an interesting book, particularly because it was written by Franklin himself. But the breathless praise that is everywhere showered upon it seems a bit over done.

For the better? That is yet to be seen. The style was much more eloquent and straight forward. Reminded of a book I read in college (the title eludes me) where we studying the diverse opinions of the various colonies attempting to hammer out the new constitution. When a speaker disagreed with a colleague, instead of calling him out, they would lavish praise upon the individual. Think that approach would work today? It would more stimulating and intellectually poignant then the mud slinging we are constantly bombarded with today. Franklin was right without saying it, \\"kill them with kindness and they will relent.\\"It is obvious Mr. Franklin was a true diplomat and humble man in the different ventures he struck-out on. The one message I picked-up on which kept repeating itself was never give up. You never know when a new opportunity will appear. Yes, you will have problems and encounter obstacles, regardless, one must keep their nose to the grindstone. In the long run, it will pan out.Mr. Franklin did some excellent works for the people in Philadelphia for his time. The formation of a police force, fire brigade, militia, and library. But someone had to pay for these services. In the case of the police and fire brigade the inception of property taxes came into being. At the time it appeared to be a fair price for the service. What has happened since then? Franklin, like his fellow brothers Jefferson and Washington, when one takes office to propel his own wealth (that has seen this in Europe countless times) nothing good will surface. I believe we can see that very plainly today.One area I found interesting is the opinions (two to be exact) about the Native American; \\"Savages.\\" It is apparent he held no qualms with pushing the Indians farther west so the peoples of Europe could settle the Western lands of Pennsylvania. I haven't read enough of him to know if his ideals changed any before his death or if he continually supported the movement against the natives.In short, this is an excellent look at the man considered one of the: Founding Fathers, Great Statesman, Learned Individual and humble human.\\"Waste not, want not.\\""},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"What a great book!

While I've always considered Franklin to be an interesting and accomplished man, after reading his autobiography, I've added amazing, phenomenal, enterprising, and energetic to the list of adjectives. The youngest son of 17 children, he left home at an early age and set off on a life of adventure and hard work.Although by today's standards he was relatively uneducated (in his early years), he was remarkably capable and determined. Among Franklin's various pursuits were writer, printer, statesman, inventor, and businessman. Civic-minded, he formed the Junto Club, organized the postal system, founded the Pennsylvania Library, aided in organizing a hospital, and drafted the Declaration of Independence.Even though the book was free on Kindle, reading his list of virtues and the commentary on each would have been well worth the price of a book. I especially like that he added humility as number 13 and admitted that it was something he needed to work on. Obviously very intelligent, Franklin advised against being perceived as a know-it-all, good common sense advice over 200 years later.The best description of the autobiography is inspirational. If more of America's citizens would aspire to be as hard working and diligent as Franklin, perhaps the country could regain its promise and prominence as a leader among nations. The only minus to the autobiography is that it doesn't cover all of Franklin's life.

Thanks for the tips."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ben Franklin's autobiography begins, in 1771, as a letter to his son. That son, William Franklin, was becoming something of a disappointment. He, for someone born a bastard in the 1770s, was becoming something of an aristocrat. William had been climbing the social ladder to the point of kissing the ring of King George III. It was not always that way, once father and son had been extremely close, they were only twenty years a part in age, and they shared many a common interest. William, for example, would often act as an assistant in many of Franklin's experiments. However, the similarities seem to have ended there. Ben Franklin had always proud to part of he called the \`middling people,' what we would call today middle class, while his son wanted to be part of the ruling elite. One the first things Ben Franklin points out to his son in his \`letter' is that he (Ben Franklin) is the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations. In a time-period where the old laws of primogeniture** are still the law of the land, this is quite a strong point to make on his son. Franklin tries to forcefully point out to his son that he and his family are of the most humble origins.In this work, Franklin revels a good deal about his life using the wit in humor that he is famous for. It is very reveling that he sums up his life by stating that if he were offer the chance he would gladly do it all again.\\"That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some of the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not expected, the next thing most like living one's over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.\\" p.1Some of the most interesting aspects of this book are the little things that Franklin talks about while going over his past. As someone who knows quite a few vegetarians, I found Franklin explaining his \`all vegetable diet' very entertaining. Franklin was apparently an on again, off again vegetarian.\\"I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from Boston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider'd, with my master Tryon, the taking of every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter. All of this seemed very reasonable. But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between principal and inclination, till I recollected that when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, \`If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't each you.' So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then to an all vegetable diet. So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do.\\" p.28As Ben Franklin guides of though the journey of his life, engaging us in useful entertaining tales, he then begins to discuss matters that are far more serious. As the book reaches its unintended conclusion, he remembers a conversation that he had with Lord Grandville, the President of the Privy Council, in 1757, on the nature of the relationship between Great Britain and her colonies. This is a conversation that would have a great deal of consequences over a decade later.\\"'You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and you think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at you own discretion. But those instructions are not the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in the Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the LEGISLATOR OF THE COLONIES.' I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be make by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assured me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings.\\" p. 138-9Reading Benjamin Franklin telling his own life story is a wonderful and fascinating adventure. In this book, the reader gets advice how to live his or her life to fullest by a man who actually did. Ben Franklin is funny, informative, and opens up a great view into the eighteenth century. The only sad part is he was unable to finish the job, a small disappointment in very successful and productive life.*Since this work was a project that went on and off again from 1771 to 1790 and not published until years after his death, I just put the last year of his life as the books date.**Primogeniture was an old inheritance law that gave the oldest son all the parents property and gave the other siblings nothing."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Overall an interesting book that details the first fifty years or so of Benjamin Franklin's life. As one of America's most interesting and charismatic founding fathers, this book does outline nicely the methods and reason that formed the personality that he is. Unfortunately the book cuts off in approximately 1755 and does not cover any of the American revolution at all. There really is no fault to be had of that because of how and when this was written, but I would advice to any reader that, that content is no in this volume.The only other major complaint of the book is that it can be at times difficult to read since there are no chapters. The book is one continual exposition of Mr. Franklin's life which at times jumps around in content. I often found myself lost or confused as to what was being discussed if I took long periods of time between readings.Overall though this is a nice book to read if you are looking at some background into the life of Benjamin Franklin."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I consider myself a bit of a history buff.. and not the conspiracy theory sort of history.

As a result, you won't find anything in it about his illegitimate child(ren) or the Hell-fire Club. You won't find much about the Court of St. James. You will find a reasonably good account of his youth and adolescence, but when it gets to his adulthood, he--how do we put this?--he told the truth but not the whole truth. Possibly he told nothing but the truth, but I say again, he didn't tell the whole truth.

You get to know that he has a special character and that he will have success in the future. There are some nice anecdotes about the life in the 18th century as well. But as the book continous to outline the life of Franklin there are more and more descpriptions of military decisions made by him. The book looses the soul of an autobiogrphy (no more info on how he felt, on what was on his mind during that time). It even seems to be put together in a hurry (which is believable, due to the fact that Franklin had a very busy life).However, it is still worth reading because of Franklin's positive attitude towards life which everyone should be able to copy."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Excellet service on receiving this book and it is perfect!It was received very quickly and in excelent condition.Pricing was also great.

As he was a printer, and a person that prided himself for having a lot of &quot;follow through&quot;, I was suprised to find the autobiography irrelevant, mainly because of the lack of thought devoted to the constuction of the work.Also, I found it stoic, and hard to get to know Franklin as a man."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ten years ago, I purchased the paperback and could not get past the first few chapters. Five years ago, I bought the cassette version and could not get much further. After finishing and enjoying Walter Isaacson's Franklin bio immediately prior to this third attempt, I was finally able to enjoy &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot;. Fredd Wayne brings Franklin to life with what seems like a perfect portrayal. He *performs* rather than narrates.Without the insight from Issacson, or, I suspect, from any decent biography of Franklin, the autobiography is disjointed, as he wrote different sections at different times of his life, and some time periods are eliminated completely. And it seems to have multiple personalities, struggling between the subjects of self-help, biography, history and simple meanderings and ruminations of an old man.As a companion book - 5 stars; as a standalone - 2-3 stars"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Enjoyed reading this book and learning more about Franklin.

Read on HTC EVO 3G."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"My wife recommended this one to me, and she was absolutely right to. I loved it. Ben Franklin is probably my favorite figure from that period in American history, not just for what he did but for his character, wit, and humility. All of those shine through in this book.His autobiography covers his life from his birth in 1706 through the mid-1760's. It was written in four sections. The first was written as a letter to his son William in 1771, and it reads very much like one with personal asides and mention of family. The next was written in Paris in the early 1780s while acting as ambassador, and it was more formal, aimed at someone who at read that earlier letter to his son and encouraged him to continue the record. The third section was written after he had returned to Philadelphia after the Revolutionary War, and the fourth was a very short section that appeared to be an attempt to continue it towards the war.I detailed the sources of the writing because it impacts how it is read. The early section (perhaps the first half of the book) reads as an Englishman speaking to his son, both to fill him in on the family history as well as to remind him of some of their joint experiences. It reads fairly sweetly and humorously. The Revolutionary War is not yet on his horizon. At best, he expresses occasional distress as the some of the decisions by the crown and the decisions by the William Penn's heirs back in England over the management of the Pennsylvania colony.The later sections were written during or after the war, and hints of family are gone. He does not say so explicitly, but it is known that he and his son took different sides in the war, and neither forgave the other. He makes occasional mentions of his son, as they actually took some joint actions during the French/Indian war in the 1760's, but gone is that sense of affection. It's noticeable in the language, but that much more striking when you know what happened between them.Also at this point, the war is behind him, and his frustration with England's management of the colonies shows strongly. It is not merely that he feels they were wrong or greedy but that they were predisposed to act unethically or to at least act so as to protect themselves from the assumption that the colonists would act unethically. This was especially offensive to him as he had taken great pains over his life (as outlined in some of the text) to develop a strong ethical code.Obviously, he writes about the many of the projects he undertook in life, the accomplishments he made, and the relationships he forged, but rather that hoist them up to brag, he details his decisions around them and how he was able to succeed. It seems as though his main goal in this is not to preen but to instruct, as though he wants his audience to learn from his mistakes and methods to go forth and do even greater things.It's as much history as it is instruction on the art of polite debate. As such, I think this is a book that every American should read, less for its factual content than for its lessons on how to behave in a political society. As for the rest of you, it's actually quite a bit of fun, so give that poor Yank a read anyway."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I am buying copies for my dad, my son, my niece and my bestfriend. You can read the other reviews for more details, but this little book is surprisingly easy to read, given the time it was written. I keep quoting Ben Franklin since I read it, and I am still affected by his writing since I read the book. \\"What good will I do today?\\" as how Ben started his day, after he began keeping his virtues journal. \\"What good did I do today?\\" was how he ended his day. That practice alone could change the world, if everyone practiced it. Many other reviewers call him a deist, but Ben continually states that he believes in a supreme creator, who he prays to. He just didn't believe in the dogma and ritual of organized religion of the day. You will see that he actually sought to go to church but would be so disappointed by the sermons he ceased to attend. Perhaps he should have written sermons? Religion aside, you'll be fascinated with his Forrest Gump-like part in the eighteenth-century. Street cleaners, street lamps, \\"Franklin Stoves\\", what a practical guy he was."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The purpose of the book is difficult to pin down, primarily because Franklin never completed and cohesively tied his biography together. The purpose, it seems, is then left to the effects that it has had upon history. Although difficult to follow and often a confusing narrative, Franklin composes a portrait of the prototypical American success story, perhaps even the first. His emphasis on personal virtue and industry is a sermon not only to his son, but also to Americans throughout time, on the formula for success. His descriptions of life in the colonies and the nature of self-teaching seem to set the standard for history's view of pre-revolutionary America.The ethics of clean living and a hearty work ethic that Franklin sought to impart upon his son are still alive as ideals of the \\"American dream.\\" Although it can be argued how much of a dream this really is, the value given to hard work and personal responsibility are very much a part of the American rhetoric that is indoctrinated through political and nationalistic institutions. It seems undeniable that Franklin hoped to have a lasting effect on future generations, as he certainly did not succeed in living the virtue of humility.While vanity certainly must play a part in the drive for any public figure to pen to paper and detail their life, part and parcel with that is the desire to be a good role model to a wide audience. Franklin seems to have prided himself on being a good role model throughout his life, from his time in England until returning to Philadelphia, assisting others in setting up businesses and becoming self-sufficient.We can only speculate what Franklin's reasoning must have been. Indeed, it may be that assuming history will have well recorded the time period, a personal account was unnecessary. It may be that Franklin simply never finished his Autobiography and certainly intended to return to the subject. Whatever the reasons may be, this is certainly the most jarring and notable deficiency from an otherwise detailed record of the life of one of our most important statesmen."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"While the book gives some interesting insights into Franklin's life, it is really a disjointed diary kept during his early days and during his very late life.

Largely self-taught, he became a respected scientist whose experiments on electricity received international acclaim. He invented the lightning rod, the Franklin stove, bifocals, the glass harmonica, an odometer and more. He was a self-made man who became wealthy as one of America's first commercial printers. He was a respected civic activist, a leading author, a politician and a political theorist. Many of the wise maxims expressed in his immortal Poor Richard's Almanack remain relevant and routinely quoted. Franklin is considered one of America's most accomplished diplomats. He served as minister to France during the Revolutionary War. In that post, he engineered a vital political alliance with the French, winning crucial military and financial aid. We think that anyone who loves history will find this spellbinding autobiography a rare delight. Franklin was on intimate terms with many of the most famous individuals in prerevolutionary America. Indeed, he seemed to have personal dealings with virtually everyone of merit in the New World. His autobiography, written in the best of the archaic language of the time, is a literary classic. Don't deprive yourself of this singular opportunity to learn what the American colonies were like during the prerevolutionary era, as reported by the extraordinary genius who first conceptualized the idea of the United States as an independent nation."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Franklin's genius extended to many different areas. No doubt one of the most important was self - promotion .He was the first great American advertising man. And the product was hard- working honest, frugal, modest, virtuous Ben Franklin. His letter to his son is a letter to the world in which he explains and justifies himself. He also provides a kind of ' how- to- do - it ' success guide and is in this way a pioneer, an inventor of this genre also.Franklin tells us how through hard- work, and virtue he rose from nowhere to great prominence. He perhaps does not tell us however enough about the source of his extraordinary inventiveness and energy .The autobiography covers only a certain portion of his life does not include the work of later years including his key role in the American revolution, and his remarkable work as Ambassador .The work is without question an American landmark and classic which for seem really defines the ' American money- making and success- obsessed society' at its best.But the work also deliberately conceals much, and certainly does not touch upon other sides of Franklin including his not very modest behavior with the fair sex. Franklin was a far more complex character than this biography suggests. He in a sense simplified himself to make himself more saleable .

He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a &quot;Mrs. Manners&quot; column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite &quot;truisms,&quot; Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher. If you're really interested in getting to know Ben Franklin, check out a scholar's biography--if anything, you get to learn all the juicy stuff about his disgustingly promiscuous sex life."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Earl P's gone now. 38 years sober.

Not so this autobiography. Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience.

What young kid can have personal contact with a governor, find jobs so easily, squander a friend's loan and go all over the place in his occupation? Also, I couldn't figure out whether certain times he spent in Europe or in the States. He did not write much about his family life. At the end, it jumped from place to place. Since there was nothing then, everything seemed to be an invention. Were there not libraries in Europe or post offices?

Telling about the life, accomplishments and thoughts of one of the most important people in American history. Good for Kindle too."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"These are Ben Franklin's own words about himself. It's a miracle this book even exists. If you read the beginning, he explains that someone wrote a letter that convinced him to write his autobiography as an inspiration to young people. As you get deeper into the book, you realize that Ben lives at an entirely different level than the average or modern person. He is intimately involved in the evolution of his community--from fostering a fire department to arranging for the streets to be kept clean. People respect him so much that they put him in offices without his vying for the job. This causes him to have many different responsibilities at once according to the needs and desires of his community. Also, I believe he was self-aware enough to sense that the act of writing an autobiography, when you are a great man to people, could seem vain or arrogant. I think it took the encouragement of an admirer, (writing a letter), using the argument that young people needed to see how one may become a Ben Franklin to get him to sit down and do this. I read the neg reviews and was surprised. Ben often says he's not the best writer of his time. He's not trying for literary merit, fame, or sales. This isn't actually a story. It's his life from his view of why and how he accomplished so much. He's not trying to excite or impress you with his achievements because, at the time, people were well aware of what he accomplished. It isn't finished and doesn't get into the creation of the United States because he was too busy helping with the creation of the United States. He doesn't write about his family life because that's a different level of private. Ben writes about his evolution and takes pains to show his naivete, flaws, and bad judgment as a young man. He takes pains to speak of the ideas that transformed him and his great need to be a better man today than he was yesterday. He explains that his life has been a process and that it has been hard work with many disappointments and worries. He also establishes how important it is to set up and build friendships. If you read carefully, the JUNTO was a spur for the growth of great men and the center in a web of mutually beneficial connections in a world where the great can be envied to the point of being despised. HE even goes to great lengths to explain how he had to develop his character and persona so that he didn't alienate people. Some are upset about him breaking his apprenticeship with his brother without bearing witness to the fact that his brother was beating him as if he were just anybody, with little brotherly regard, even though Ben, by all accounts, was a great, skillful, and energetic worker. He was temperate and multi-talented, even familiar with many different skills and tools. He took matters to his father on several occasions, his father having a reputation for being just and fair, and his father agreed that Ben was mostly right in the situations in which he thought he was being mistreated. He didn't agree that Ben leave, but who would stand their brother to beat them as people beat their servants/slaves back then? I thought this book was fun, interesting, and inspiring. I thought he had a subtle, sly sense of humor. I think you have to read between the lines to really get it. (Did you, by chance, piece together that this guy was a vegetarian, avid/accomplished/athletic swimmer who seldom drank and was twice as strong as many men who thought they were pretty strong? He also had greater endurance and kicked it up a notch if he didn't think he was working his body hard enough. The young Ben Franklin was probably hot. I'm just saying:).)"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ben Franklin lived a busy life with a plethora of interests. Two or three times during his life he sat down and wrote a couple of chapters of autobiography.As other reviewers have mentioned, this produces an incomplete autobiography. The later part is more like a collection of blog entries than a thorough book. Still, I enjoyed it, because Franklin's writing reflects the exuberance of his life.

Glimpse into the charm and character of one of the leading early Americans. And, a lot of talk about other characters too, with maxims that still hold true today. The best one being about posing provocative statements as questions, \\"Gee, isn't it possible that it could be like this...?\\", rather than as already baked statements, when you want to engage someone in a sincere discussion to change their mind. Ben told his son it would always work, and it has every time I've remembered to try it!He doesn't of course know the significance of his life's work at the time he writes this book. The French Revolution is still raging, he is stuck there, and all the Constitutional Conventions hadn't begun yet. Ben Franklin of course made sure the Enlightenment Principles of equal rights for every individual were upheld in our Constitution, Southern land- and slave-owning aristocrats worried a democratic rabble would take away their \\"property\\", and New England Puritan Theocrats who wanted Church and State united as one, didn't all get their way to recreate something that already existed somewhere in a bloody Europe. That would be \\"Atlantic Cousins\\" by Jack Fruchtman Jr to explain all of that.Also, a look at the guilt of an ambitious, maybe self absorbed father late in life toward his alienated and distant son.

The \\"autobiography\\" has been lauded by biographer Richard Amacher as \\"The First Great Book Written in America:\\". The book is an up-by-the-bootstraps story representing the fredom to create and prosper that is the essence of American morality. Franklin's background was puritan, and culturally he remained one of self-examining and self-improving. Franklin saw humans as a black slate designed for success. The famous example of Franklin's self-help ethics is what has become known as \\"The Art Of Virtue\\" in which he listed 12 qualities he aimed to possess, inter alia: (2). SILENCE: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself, avoid trifling conversation; (4). RESOLUTION: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve; (6). INDUSTRY: Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary action. This book has had a major influence on self- help writing. Anthony Robbins recommends these questions as part of a daily success ritual.

Dr. Franklin tells his story up to 1771, and a most unusual story it is. Franklin's intelligence, general sagacity and energy are almost unmatched anywhere or any time. His accomplishments are so many and so varied that they would be unbelievable if not documented. A surprise to me was that he was very strong and athletic in his younger years. Being a printer, he regularly had to take carriers of type to the press. In a long stay in London, where he hired out to a printer, he would carry two rack of type up the stairs to the second floor, one in each hand. All the other employees carried one rack in two hands. They couldn't understand how he could do such a thing when they always drank \\"strong beer\\" and he only drank water. Franklin was a master swimmer who could swim for great distances and do many different strokes and tricks in the water.His major accomplishments hardly need detailing although the vastness of them will come as a surprise to people who have not previously seen a description of all of them. Dr. Franklin shows a certain amount of pride and conceit in this book even though he seems to try not to. It really doesn't show that much ego however, considering what he had to be proud of. The language used in this book is quaint to 21st. century people, but interesting and completely understandable. It's a pity that he never completed his autobiography, covering the Revolution and afterward. Considering his immense efforts for the new country during that time, it's no surprise that he didn't have time to do it. I think that no one should miss spending a little time with this extraordinary, unique and fascinating man through this book."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Franklin's timeless words echo through the centuries in this wonderful autobiography.

Plus, since his is a great mind, I was interested in his autobiography. Things I thought worth taking note from reading it are....1. He founded U. of Penn and became a trustee for 40 years.2. His parents lived until they were 89/he and 85/she. Born in Boston in 1706. Died in 1790.3. He was a member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 was dispatched to France as a commissioner until 1783.4. Believed in the education of women.5. Went to London in 1724 and worked in a printing house, then as a tradesman and became an expert at selling.6. Became a deist - rarely worshiped in public, but paid subscriptions.7. Was convinced truth, sincerity, and integrity were of utmost import for dealings between man and man to bring felicity in life.8. Part of JUNTO, a group formed for mutual self-improvement.9. Wrote in the necessity of a paper currency - was well-received except for the rich - got a job printing money.10. Opened a stationery shop.11. 1730, married Rebecca Read. Described her as a good partner - industrious and frugal.12. His first public nature project was a subscription library and eventually formed \\"the mother of all subscription libraries.\\" Thereby, increasing the public conversation of Americans.13. A very frugal person - his \\"table plain and simple, no idle servants, cheap furniture and for a long time just had bread and milk for breakfast' - tea was expensive.14 He has a personal project, to live at moral perfection - had a book with each page for a virtue - temperance - no gluttony or drunkenness, silence, speak only what benefits others or yourself - no trifling conversation. He never reached such a perfection, but felt he became a better person because of the project.15. 1737, published \\"Poor Richard's Almanack,\\" to be entertaining and useful, for 25 years.16. 1733, began studying languages - French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.17. 1736, his 4 yo son died of smallpox - Franklin felt guilty that he hadn't had him inoculated.18. First to form the Union Fire Company.19. Offered to become Colonel of Philadelphia regiment, but declined because he felt he was unfit.20 He felt few in public affairs acted with a view to the good of mankind. He thought there should be a \\"United Party of Virtue,\\" of virtuous and good men from all nations and meet as a regular body.21. Others got patents for his inventions, but never contested them since he had no desire to profit from them.22. Spent 10 years as a legislator in the Assembly, was commissioned to meet with the Indians, forbidding selling liquor to them then made a treaty with them.23.He felt that human happiness is produced not so much by great pieces of fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day.24. He projected and drew up a plan for the union of all coloni9es, with one government.25. Organized wagons and horses, modeled a bill for the establishment and disciplining of a militia, accepted charge of a frontier infested with enemy - chosen colonel of the regiment.26.

Some are so so, but for me, this was a great trip back in time with one of the most gifted minds of the enlightenment."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This autobiography provided an interesting look at a fascinating life. I came away from this book with a deep respect for the way Benjamin Franklin approached his life and sought to improve himself through hard work and careful study. What struck me the most was that he acknowledged shortcomings and made a deliberate effort to overcome them. As an example he recognized that being argumentative and forceful with people carried many long-term disadvantages. So he changed his methods and was better for it, both in terms of \\"winning\\" disputes and in developing lasting friendships. As an additional note, some would point out that Benjamin Franklin did not live up to his stated \\"life philosophy\\" and may even go as far to call him hypocritical. For me it doesn't matter so much whether or not he successfully lived up to his stated principles, rather what matters is that the principles are valid and a worthy goal for anyone to strive for.In addition to the life, and life philosophy, of Benjamin Franklin, this book provided an interesting look into life in the 1700s British Colonies. Several things came out in the book that gave me pause. For example, I was not aware that boys were signed on as apprentices to a trade at such a young age (around 10 years old). Learning about the hardships of traveling from Boston, to New York, and on to Philadelphia was also interesting. Additionally thinking about the dangers involved in a sea voyage, from weather and pirates in particular, made me thankful of the ease and safety in which we travel now. In a similar vein, this book provides some great insights into the colonial politics of the time period. Even though it stops short of the American Revolution, the disputes between the colonies and England are clearly present and growing.Again, this was a fascinating book. It had been on my to read list for some time and I regret that I had not picked it up sooner."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"There are any number of reasons to read Ben Franklin's autobiography.For the fetching language and wit. As when he deviated from his vegetarianism to eat some fish that \\"smelt admirably well,\\" saying, \\"If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you...So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.\\"For his keen insights into human nature and his own flawed behavior. Such as his youthful lust for the paramour of a friend who was out of town: \\"I grew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious restraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted familiarities (another erratum) which she repulsed with a proper resentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour.\\"For the panoramic view of this Renaissance man's interests and accomplishments: his work as printer and pamphleteer; his founding a state militia, a hospital, and a school; his work as military leader, scientist, inventor, and politician.But for me the most compelling lure of Franklin's tale is its depiction of English-speaking America in its infancy, when still a British colony. When the country was raw and manners polished, when our institutions and culture still lay unformed and malleable, and opportunity lurked around every corner.Franklin seized those opportunities, seemingly by default in some cases and, in others, by dint of discipline and determination. In the process you see how he helped shape our culture and institutions at a time when they were still mere clay.On the surface, this ascetic, cerebral, and industrious businessman seems an unlikely rebel. Abstemious, sober, principled, cautious, civil, and civic-minded, he spent his early days in long hours at the press and his nights discussing philosophy and politics with serious-minded members of a discussion group he formed. \\"About this time,\\" he writes, \\"I conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.\\"But we also glimpse his independence of mind--both as a religious skeptic and as a colonial who chaffed under British rule--and his contentiousness. A man who seemed to cherish conflict and won his way with preparation and persistence, whether in the marketplace, the legislature, or in the field against the French. We see in Franklin, the uniquely American characteristics that would help a lean, under-populated, and vulnerable colony grow into the world's great religious refuge, military power, and economic Mecca.Along the way the reader of this truncated autobiography--which concludes in 1765, long before Franklin gained his greatest fame--is, by turns, intrigued, charmed, and seduced by Franklin's wiliness, warmth, and wit.For example: As a young man he set out from Boston to seek his fortune in Philadelphia. Even though fatigued and hungry after a difficult journey, he presses his last shilling on folks who ferried him up river in a row boat, musing: \\"A man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little.\\"Time and again, both on Franklin's part and that of colleagues and strangers, you witness generosity, kindness, and blind optimism. These, too, seem American virtues, and make you wish for more trusting times.You also see his glee in making mischief. As when he convinces his early employer, Keimer, to join him in his vegetarian regimen: \\"He was usually a great glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving him.\\"And his ever-present if subtle humor and iconoclasm: \\"[Osborne] and I made a serious agreement, that the one who happened first to die should, if possible, made a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state. But he never fulfill'd his promise.\\"But his serious and responsible side dominates Franklin, a man always trying to squeeze the most out of himself and others: \\"I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived.\\"He helped form a militia for self-defense, led men onto the field of battle, and warned an arrogant General Braddock against marching into Iroquois country to face the French--advice that, if heeded, would have saved hundreds of lives. Also, twenty years before the coming of the Revolutionary War, Franklin saw its roots in the British mistrust of American militias, London preferring the presence of British troops supported by resented tax levies.Franklin was a frank man, plain spoken and self-critical, as we see in his portrayal of early London indiscretions: \\"...[T]hat hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way, which attended with some expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which of all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it.\\"So in the end we see Franklin not as a printer, politician, or statesman, but as a man--fallible and forthright, and still alive and breathing in his own words."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"It's a little presumptuous to write a \\"review\\" of a book as historically important as this, so I'll just give a few reasons why you should read it.It's well-written and engaging, even 200+ (nearing 300+; Franklin was born in 1706) years later. It stops in 1760, well before his involvement with the Revolution, but it covers in detail his youth, apprenticeships, the formation of his philosophy and ideals, and his path from poor roots to business and social success -- the first telling of the American Dream, the idea that a poor young man could Find His Fortune in the New World through enterprise, wisdom, and work.There is a high degree of self-hagiography here, and it would be amusing to tally up (for example) how many times Franklin praises himself vs. how many times he advises on the virtue of humility. He smooths over controversial topics like his illegitimate son, he doesn't mention his membership in the Freemasons, etc. The construction is also a bit rambling (\\"Then I did this thing. Next, I did another thing. Then I did a third thing\\"), but Franklin simply did so many interesting things -- even in this short slice of his life -- that the book is interesting despite that. There's a great deal of discussion on his scientific and inventive accomplishments, and he talks at length about his development of his own personal moral code and how he achieved business success (along with Franklin's Personal Method You Can Use for Self-Improvement -- in some ways, this is the first self-help book!)All in all, this is very much worth reading, and gives a compelling picture of Franklin's life and times. I particularly liked the picture Franklin draws of contemporary American society -- free, open, and small, with most people in most towns all knowing each other, and business opportunities are wide open for anyone with industry and pluck. I'm not sure how similar modern-day America still is to Franklin's Philadelphia, but it's certain that Franklin -- and this book -- helped set the image that we still *want* to believe America conforms to. And for that alone, it's worth reading.If you like this book, you might also be interested in reading Alexis de Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_, for another view of colonial-era America, or any of Mark Twain's nonfiction (_Life on the Mississippi_, _Roughing It_, etc.), for similar accounts of America's growth and development a hundred-odd years further on. Any of those should be available as a free Kindle download."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This \\"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\" does not contain the type of finished material one has come to expect in a finished coherent autobiographical writing covering the whole life span of the individual written by single author over a continuous period of time. This is really source material partially written over distinctly separate periods of time wherein the author, Benjamin Franklin, wrote on two different continents without access to the other parts of his text. With that said, I still think that this book is a wonderful and enlightening piece of work. It should, in my opinion, be considered for placement in every high school and college library, and it should perhaps be wise to consider it for required reading in those institutions. The book tells of the life and times in which Mr. Franklin lived, the attitudes of the colonists and of the British and the ways that things were accomplished in colonial America. It is truly amazing to me to hear first hand how a single individual with only two years of formal education can educate himself as this man did and to rise to make such truly great contributions to society, science, engineering, and politics. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Franklin wrote this autobiography as a letter of instruction in the ways of the world to his youthful and illegitimate son of 40. It only covers the first half or so of his incredible life, so the things that really made him well-known are not covered, but there is plenty here anyway.Franklin recounts his family's modest life in England and the circumstances that brought them to Boston. He was among the youngest of a very large family, ultimately finding his way to Philadelphia to find work as a printer when an apprenticeship with an older brother turned sour.We always think of Franklin as being a slightly older statesman among the Founding Fathers, when in fact he was a full generation older than Washington or Jefferson. Unlike popular perception, he was an athletic and vibrant youth, who rescued a drowning Dutch companion and taught swimming to children of London's elite.Philadelphia in the 1720's and 1730's was a small town, never sure if it would really take off as a settlement. Franklin quickly befriended key politicians who felt Philadelphia had grown sufficiently to have a world-class print shop. He played a key role in the town's development, leading civic groups in establishing libraries, fire companies, meeting halls, and street cleaning services. Of course, he was also the consummate politician, serving in office, and networking his way to his first fortune by publishing government documents and printing the first paper currency. He also had a knack for working with the several important religious sects of that time and place, especially the pacifist Quakers, even though Franklin was a deist.Franklin was a clever businessman. In today's lexicon, he effectively franchised across the colonies his concept of the publisher/printer who would provide both the content and the ink on paper. By age 30, he had set up his business affairs so that his printing businesses in several colonies were operated by partners and he received a share of the profits, allowing him to pursue other interests.The autobiography is unfinished, so we don't hear his account of his pursuits of electricity, which made him as famous and well-known as Bill Gates is today, nor his thought on the Revolution. Franklin did play a key role in establishing logistical support to the British during their fight with the French in the New World. At that time and during his years in Europe, he was generally perceived as a Tory supporter.Read this book to learn how Franklin devoted himself to self-improvement by establishing clubs, lending libraries, a sober lifestyle allowing time for study, and his methods for measuring his personal performance against metrics he had established for a proper lifestyle. One will also gather a new appreciation for the fullness, utility, and richness of the English language when put on paper by a master."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The book is divided into four parts, and is ultimately unfinished; that is the largest disappointment you will find as you read the last sentance. However, the book gives you a true feel for the life and times this great man lived through. The writing is very arbitrary, almost (but not quite) stream-of-conscious, and anecdotal, but enjoyable. Another disappointment is the lack of discussion of the American Revolution and his role in it. But it did give me the desire to read more of this amazing individual, and renewed my sense of pride in my country, as well as its interesting history. Read this book as a beginning, with expectations of it taking your mind to a different level of interest..."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"While reading \\"An Incomplete Education\\" I read that this was the greatest autobiography ever written. Out of curiosity I purchased it and read it and the recommendation was right on. This book was very intriguing and captivating.The only disappointing part was that the American Revolution and Benjamin Franklin's part was not detailed.Benjamin Franklin's list of virtues and his application to his life were amazing. Oh that young men today would seek to be so virtuous!Great read."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This book is actually less an autobiography in the traditional sense we see today and more of a story told in two sections. The first is a letter to his son, while the second part he seemed to have been encouraged to write by a friend. The first letter is the story from his birth to his arrival in PA, while the send part picks up where the first leaves off and continues until just before our Revolution. But the result is the same - enlightenment about how important this man was.The prose in this book is, as you'd expect, 18th century so you get plenty of \\"thee\\" and \\"thy\\" but not to distraction. It is a compelling read and difficult to put down but the language gets tedious. As you can tell by my rating this does not diminish the quality of the book but may affect some potential readers.In all it's definitely worth your time and effort to understand one of the founding geniuses of our country. Really, this man is a true American hero. Where would we be without a free press, libraries and many of his other contributions? He was a skilled negotiator very much in the right place at the right time.Still, it would be all the more satisfying to hear his side of the events of the Revolution. I wonder at the gaping hole presented by this. Perhaps he was afraid of arrest or worse? One is left imagining whether there would even be a United States were it not for BF.It would be interesting if other readers might share other biographical recommendations, if any, that could shed light on the latter part of Mr. Franklin's life. This book is an essential first step towards a complete understanding of one of our founding fathers."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This book came to me based on a recommendation by Anthony Robbins in his book &quot;Awaken the Giant Within.&quot; And upon reading it, it occurs to me how many gurus have built on, or simply stolen, Ben Franklin's ideas for living a life with purpose, on purpose. (Cheers to Robbins for identifying his mentors and sources so openly.) &quot;The Autobiography of Ben Franklin&quot; is a quick easy read with many rewards. Learn about the man, discover the seed of modern self-help ideas, and see America though a unique set of eyes.About the writing. . . When Franklin took pen to paper his motivation was to share ideas with his son. In other words, he was writing a letter, and what a joy that it survived as a letter to each of us. Enjoy this book as insights offered by a dynamic individual. And, have the flexibility to enjoy writing that certainly isn't in the pop-culture mold of our century. I myself found this refreshing! If you like ideas and value the role mentors can play in our lives, then read this book today."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ben Franklin is the most amazing figure of American revolution. The essence of American life, a hero, a political figure, a self-made man, a scientist, a diplomat - turns out to be just a guy next door, a neighbor.I got this book on audio from a local library - and spent 6.5 wonderful hours listening to a friend, a teacher, a wise man. He is entertaining - but serious at the same time, he goes into great details of his dealings with people, business partners, politicians - but is never boring.Anyone who wants to learn how to connect with people, to become a better person, to grow a business and wealth, to be a good friend - and more - should read this book.I would recommend an audio format if you have choices - it really turns it into a conversation with Ben Franklin."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Well, Ben Franklin's life was not incomplete, but his autobiography is. This is partly because Franklin never intended his book for publication.He was writing it for the benefit of his son - partly as a guide for life, and partly as a family history. Indeed, on the first page, Franklin writes that he has always enjoyed hearing stories about his ancestors, and hopes his son will be as interested to learn of his father's life. However, after Franklin's break with his son, he continues to write, but now it is for the benefit of all of his ancestors. Franklin's disagreement with his son William is just one of many details that are missing from this book.I was always interested in Franklin and it had long been a goal of mine to read his autobiography. Had I known that the years 1758-1790 were not covered, which were probably the most important and influential of his life, I might not have read it. And that would have been a mistake.For although the major events of the 1770s and 1780s are missing, like the American Revolution, the Treaty of Paris, and the Constitutional Convention, there is so much material about the early years of Franklin's life here that it is still a worthwhile book. Who knew Franklin was practically a champion swimmer, for example? We often think of Franklin as the elder statesman of the Founding Fathers, as indeed he was. Franklin was born 26 years before George Washington. But in this book we see Franklin as a boy and then a young man, whole periods of his life that are forgotten when one thinks of his later, great contributions.Thankfully, Franklin documents much of it, and it makes for terrific reading. His battles with his brother, his early struggles with established religion, his bold jump to Philadelphia, and then to London, when he was still so young. He even mentions that he was a regular patron of the local prostitutes in Philadelphia! This is not something you'd see in Poor Richard's Almanac, of that I am sure.Even though the book is lacking the major events of Franklin's later life, it is still rich in anecdotes and instruction. There is much to be learned from Ben, whether he was founding the first fire department or library, or making monetary contributions to every religious denomination in Philadelphia, or his attempts at achieving \\"moral perfection\\" - actions that demonstrated his industriousness, his tolerance, his wisdom.Franklin was an incredibly fascinating character and he remains one of the giants of American history. You wouldn't know it from reading this autobiography, but it doesn't matter; the historians have safely documented his legacy in other books. In these pages, in his own words, you learn what made Franklin tick, what he believed in, and why. And that's more than enough.Five stars."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Far from a &quot;boring read&quot;, Franklin's work gives an unique insight into the 18th century working class people. Much that has been written about Franklin is absolute rubbish. His autobiography puts the man in real perspective. Granted he was a bit self centered and, at times, self congradulating, but his accomplishments were many. His wit is often stinging. I was surprised to read about his military activities and yet he was influenced by the Quakers. It's also significant that he talks of his belief in the deity and the fact that he was a presbetyrian. Many &quot;revisionist historians&quot; claim that Franklin was an atheist. This certainly suggests otherwise. Franklin will always be controversial, but never &quot;dull&quot;.

Views on life, love, sin and virtue, and how to survive on a pittance. One caveat: this book ends well before the Revolution. It hints at what is to come, but never touches on the war, Washington, Jefferson, etc., at all."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"A really great journal that anyone who finds interest in American history and common sense should take the time to read. It took a little getting used to the Old English style of his prose, but eventually I found myself enjoyably wrapped up in Benjamin Franklin's extremely long winded sentences, his graceful manner and humble attitude towards his impressive collection of achievements, and this all documented before the American Revolution.He speaks with intellectual wit and humor as he describes the characters he interacts with more colorfully than himself, again, always politely no matter the truth of it, from the embarrassing behavior of the Quakers to the rude selfishness of the British crown and army that ultimately drives them to their defeat.His virtues, his discipline and his calm manner are all described from his learned youth as a pressman, to his forming of the Junto in adulthood and a short reluctant military leadership (yet no mention of battle, perhaps to his own relief) and his esteemed career as an Assemblyman of Philadelphia.On a side note, however short, the Dover Thrift Edition of the book has the text packed together very tightly in the pages and can make for difficult reading. The Touchtone Edition's typesetting looks a bit easier on the eyes now that I've compared both online."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The joy of reading this autobiography comes from the personality of its writer, as Franklin discusses Franklin. His style is delightful and he feels present, here, now. His body has been dead for over two hundred years, but not his ideas and not his voice. The core of what he writes is strong, but his ideas and rules for living are alive and speak to the present. Before reading this book, I read a few harsh comments on both the book and Franklin. Writers said that Franklin falsely portrays himself as a fine guy and that he really wasn't so fine. I cannot believe that the writer of this autobiography was anything other than the voice that comes across the centuries. Such a strong and vital voice, such a story, such deeds, these could only come from a great man. Not a perfect man, but a great man. I enjoyed so much the library checkout that I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the book for my own library, to read and reread, learning and connecting with the author."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"In what began as a letter to his son in 1771, Franklin decided to share the \\"anecdotes of [his] ancestors\\" and impart some of his own wisdom learned during his life. But the crisis between America and Great Britain would soon put a halt to his autobiographical work. It would be more than a decade later, at the pleadings of his friends, that Franklin would again take up his pen and complete his memoir.The first section, the letter to his son, is the best part of the book. Here, the plot drives the story with some divergences into his philosophy. He describes his modest childhood in Boston and his gradual ascent to civic leader in Philadelphia. He shares his many disappointments (friends who had deceived him) and his many accomplishments (establishing a secret philosophical club, a successful printing press, a public library, and the list goes on and on).In the next half of the book, taken up at the requests of his friends, he delves deeper into his personal philosophy and describes his system to work on the 13 virtues he needed to perfect to arrive at \\"moral perfection.\\" He notes the impossibility of this project but believes the pursuit in itself made him a better person. He also gives more details on his public works and his role in Pennsylvania's government. Despite divulging his thoughts on religion and ethics, Franklin seems more distant than in the first section, and I didn't get a good grasp on his life in his later years.But what's most remarkable about Franklin's autobiography is his unpretentious writing style. He strikes a conversational tone, coasting through one anecdote to the next, or what he sardonically describes as \\"rambling digressions.\\" Only toward the end does this charming tone flags a bit.I strongly recommend this autobiography to people who've a strong interest in the Founding Fathers. People with a passing interest should try reading at least some background information on Franklin, because you won't get the full portrait of the man here. You learn little about his family or inventions, and the autobiography stops (quite suddenly) when he's in England for a dispute between the Pennsylvania Assembly and governor. Overall, though, the readability of the book for its time is astounding."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The autobiography of Franklin was a worthwhile book to read. I suggest ignoring the footnotes as you read his autobiography since it distracts you from reading Franklin's work. It was a good book that details how industriousness results in a wonderful, useful public life at an older age. Franklin is the type of public servant that we are lacking today."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"As everyone else has noted, Ben was a brilliant man and an entertaining writer.

He also experimented with electricity. He was Postmaster General under the Continental Congress. It is said he also invented the lightning rod, the Franklin Stove, and bifocals. I can think of no American who has done more in a lifetime for so many generations of Americans. Therefore, this book is important. It's also quite enjoyable to read. Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The purpose of the book is difficult to pin down, primarily because Franklin never completed and cohesively tied his biography together. The purpose, it seems, is then left to the effects that it has had upon history. Although difficult to follow and often a confusing narrative, Franklin composes a portrait of the prototypical American success story, perhaps even the first. His emphasis on personal virtue and industry is a sermon not only to his son, but also to Americans throughout time, on the formula for success. His descriptions of life in the colonies and the nature of self-teaching seem to set the standard for history's view of pre-revolutionary America.The ethics of clean living and a hearty work ethic that Franklin sought to impart upon his son are still alive as ideals of the \\"American dream.\\" Although it can be argued how much of a dream this really is, the value given to hard work and personal responsibility are very much a part of the American rhetoric that is indoctrinated through political and nationalistic institutions. It seems undeniable that Franklin hoped to have a lasting effect on future generations, as he certainly did not succeed in living the virtue of humility.While vanity certainly must play a part in the drive for any public figure to pen to paper and detail their life, part and parcel with that is the desire to be a good role model to a wide audience. Franklin seems to have prided himself on being a good role model throughout his life, from his time in England until returning to Philadelphia, assisting others in setting up businesses and becoming self-sufficient.We can only speculate what Franklin's reasoning must have been. Indeed, it may be that assuming history will have well recorded the time period, a personal account was unnecessary. It may be that Franklin simply never finished his Autobiography and certainly intended to return to the subject. Whatever the reasons may be, this is certainly the most jarring and notable deficiency from an otherwise detailed record of the life of one of our most important statesmen."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"An interesting book only if you enjoy learning how people in earlier history thought and lived.

For anyone wanting to know exactly who he was and how he managed to accomplish so much, this is a mine of reliable information. However, the beginning and latter parts of the book are like a pile of notes published without even being divided into chapters. They do not reflect well on his capabilities as a printer/publisher. He seems like a self-absorbed person but one who is very anxious to share everything about himself that he can in order to help others. His is a model of a productive and surprisingly normal life. His adventures as a young man read like a historical novel. The book is an extremely valuable social history, with anecdotes stretching back to his ancestors who lived during Charles II's reign and had to conceal the fact that they read the Bible. I was disappointed that the book stops short of covering the period of the Continental Assembly and writing of the Declaration of Independence. It is not an easy read but it is unique and worthwhile.

This autobiography pushes the reader to see and do these things, while providing insights to Franklin's actions and great accomplishments."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I was surprised as how good this was. I was not looking forward to reading it but there's a LOT under the surface. The was he manipulates the reader with subtlety at times and openly at others is, quite frankly (no pun intended), charming. It contains well written autobiographical stories and contains a lot of interesting and useful information for readers today.This is a great historical book to read. It exposes both the positives and negatives of early American/colonial history. I would definitely recommend this to readers interested in history."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This review refers to \\"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\"How lucky we are that these writings still exist. For history buffs, and really, any American, Benjamin Franklin's words about his life and the American way of life during much of the 18th century is truly a precious history. He wrote his memories of his life, late in his life, to his son. I say memories as many of his papers did not survive the war(as he states), and much that he relates is from memory.From early boyhood through the 1750's he records his thoughts of - with amazing details - the people who affected him, various writings, including some letters he still had, Indian wars, his various jobs and government offices, and important moments and events in history. He is not shy about noting his accomplishments, many that there were(lucky for us), but also the times when things did not exactly go well for him. Sadly, he died before he finished his memoirs.It is an absorbing and a remarkably easy read. I thought I might have trouble following this great mind, but his writings are straight forward, open and candid. He touches on a great many subjects, as well as some very personal thoughts. I would have liked to read a bit more about his personal life with his family, but he does touch on this as well.The Kindle edition - 2513 locations which includes an Introductory Note as well as Chief Events in Franklin's Life in chronological order. For the most part it is a pretty smooth read. There were occasionally typos, which changed words(bad, should be had), and also there are footnotes and the explanations for them appear right in the middle of a page instead of at the bottom. None of which takes away from this great history lesson and absorbing read. There are no \\"chapter\\"-type breaks or table of contents. The events flowed from year to year, event to event.A wonderful read of a precious history....enjoy....Laurie"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I am very dissappointed in a hero for our country being such a sad example of an American.

If his life was so great, it seems it would be alot more interesting than this book shows. The only good, somewhat inspirational part was that part about moral perfection. Unfortunately, it did not change my life. (Of course, I had to read the book for school, so that may be part of my anger towards it)"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Old Ben Franklin is a household name. Ask a child why they know if him and you will find that he is remembered, perhaps, because he penned such enduring bits of sage wisdom as \\"Little strokes fell great oaks\\" or \\"No gains without pains\\" in his Poor Richard's Almanac. More likely you will find he is remembered as the man who flew a kite in a thunderstorm and proved that lightning is merely electricity on a grand scale.What he is not remembered for is his defense of the American frontier against French and Indian incursions. He is not remembered for establishing one of the first city wide fire departments in America. He is not remembered for inventing improvements to lamp lighting and heating stoves and refusing to patent them so all people could make use of them. He is not remembered for starting his own publishing business from scratch, without a penny to his name. He is not remembered for fighting for colonial rights in both the American and British political systems. He isn't remembered for this, but he did it all and more.What is further, he accomplished all of this while being constantly taken advantage of by friends, family, politicians, generals, the British, and his fellow countrymen.He is often called a Founding Father of America, or the epitome of the Self-Made American Man. After reading his story through his own simple writings, I am not inclined to argue. There is wisdom to be found in his autobiography and encouragement too. If Mr. Franklin can accomplish all of this in a portion of his life, surely I can accomplish more than I am now!"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I'd always wanted to read Benjamin's Franklin autobiography as the private school where I taught, and was later headmistress, used his character-building chart for our students and staff. Every day the students checked themselves off on character-building qualities that Franklin had on his own chart. I'd hear mothers say that when they would take our students to parties with other children from other schools they could tell which were our students as they were so well-behaved and had such good character. Thanks to Benjamin!I had also read in Stephen Covey's best-sellerThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peoplethat he studied Benjamin Franklin's autobiography for part of his doctoral thesis to learn what makes for successful and effective people. And Franklin was certainly one of those.Although I'd read Walter Isaacson's biography of FranklinBenjamin Franklin: An American Lifeand Stacey Schiff's award-winning history of Franklin's time in France as an ambassador for our countryA Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America--and both were excellent and highly recommended--there's nothing like reading Franklin in his own words which this autobiography allows us to do. It was great to see his life in America through his eyes, and view the streets of Philadelphia and Boston and even London.His good humor and intelligence sparkles in this autobiography. This book will enrich your life and create appreciation for our amazing Founding Fathers of whom Franklin may have been the most eccentric and unusual. It will make you proud to be an American. Be prepared to be dazzled by Franklin's ingenuity, wit and charm!"},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I think most people (certainly nearly all in North America) have heard the name Benjamin Franklin, knew he was an inventor, and was an important character on the political scene in the early days of the USA. However, this story paints a much clearer picture of the man by his own script.He was an adventurous young man whose mind was bigger than his person (position), and so he made his person bigger to fit. I think every young person should read his autobiography to be inspired to work towards their goals, as Franklin himself left his home to seek his fortune at the age of 17. He was a man who got ideas, and then simply made them come to fruition, no excuses. I was inspired by Franklin to grab life by its horns, and I hope many others will be too."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This is a wonderful abbreviated version about a great man of his century that could take up volumes and volumes.

Benjamin Franklin was a tremendously interesting fellow. Furthermore, he was a very complex person and, if you have read a great deal of what others said and thought of him (e.g. John Adams), then you have had presented to you an incomplete picture. Much of what we read of Benjamin Franklin's later years are pervaded with a kind of humanistic downfall into decadence, or that Franklin's mouth had to be put under lock and key, at times, because of carelessness and his penchant for frivolous confabulation. In this work, Franklin explains much of his background and explaining how he climbed up the social ladder. Franklin aptly puts into perspective some of the misconceptions people had (and have) of him. His autobiography is one that I think helps us see Franklin as a human who did fantastic things and lead an adventurous life, and not the indomitable marble image that we see in D.C. or in popular representation. For these reasons, I think this book really begins guide us away from the extreme views of who Franklin was and why he was that way, thus moving us toward a very realistic view of the man.I had two complaints, which are really just unsatisfied hopes I had going into the autobiography. The first was that I hoped he would discuss some of his mental pathways when he was pursuing his science. The second was that there was no inclusion of tales from his time as plenipotentiary in France.I think this book needs to be the basis for anyone's understanding of Benjamin Franklin."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"In this candid autobiography, B. Franklin unveils his vision and tactics in business, political, social, religious and sexual matters. His colonial viewpoint stands in sharp contrast with his \`moral' attitude.American DreamB. Franklin is the perfect example of the fulfillment of the American Dream. Working from the age of 10 in his father's business, he goes to New York, \`a boy of 17, without the least recommendation or knowledge of any person, with very little money in my pocket' and becomes a wealthy and influential businessman.Character, colonialism, protestant influenceHe was a ferociously independent mind with a huge aversion for arbitrary power. He was a generous, good-hearted man, who refused to patent his inventions, because \`as we enjoy great advantage from the invention of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.'(!)But he was not so generous with the aboriginal US population: \`rum may be the appointed means to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth.'He was a perfectionist, wanting to become completely virtuous. He even composed a catalogue of moral virtues (13) with temperance (eating, drinking), frugality (no waste), industry (useful job) and chastity (sex only for health and offspring).Business, general tacticsUnder the influence of his father, he became a writer (of almanacs) and a printer and later launched his own newspaper.He never published pamphlets or proposals in his own name, but under pseudonyms like \`some publick-spirited gentlemen', thereby avoiding \`the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.'Another tactic was: \`I shall never ask, never refuse, nor never resign an office.'Politics, religionHe sees through the political game: \`while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his particular private interest in view. Man primarily considered that their own and their country's interest were united.'In religious matters, he was a deist, but never became a member of a sect, because he saw their blatant hypocrisy: \`each sect grievously calumniated other sects' and \`every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth.' Even the Quakers got easily rid of their principle \`that no kind of war was lawful.'Sex, marriageCandidly he confesses that \`that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women, which were attended with some expense besides a continual risque to my health.'For marriage, \`the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one.' \`I was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable.'These sincere autobiographical notes are a must read for all those interested in US history."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Franklin himself called it his Memoirs, and it is, sadly, incomplete. Not this book, but his autobiography. When studying nonfiction in school, particularly the autobiographical genre, the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is often the benchmark. Held to the highest esteem (with the notable exception of Mark Twain's review, which was somewhat colder than most), it his likely the most read autobiography to date. Franklin, for all his faults, was an influential man in ways that politicians today can only aspire to be. In fact, his 13 virtues are just as poignant and pertinent today as they were when he devised them.This copy is LARGE PRINT, which makes it a wonderful gift for those with poor eyesight."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I have been a fan of Benjamin Franklin all of my life. The old story says that he discovered electricity by doing an experiment where he flew a kite with a key tied to the end, during a thunder storm. Where would we be without electricity? But Benjamin Franklin did way more than that, he was a true renaissance man. He was into literature, and writing, and science and humour. Many of his witty sayings from Poor Richards Almanac are still with us today. But what he was truly gifted at was politics. In fact the only reason Franklin was not our first President instead of George Washington was because he was 83 years old at the time. If it wasn't for his charm and diplomatic efforts (he was the Ambassador to France) we wouldn't have won the revolutionary war. He was a great man and a great American and if you didn't already know these things then you need to read this book."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Good read if you are interested in how a early patriot, writer, inventor lived.

Not only was he an accomplished politician (sounds like an oxymoron- accomplished politician, anyways I digress), he was a scientist, inventor, philanthrophist, etc.One important aspect of his autobiography we can benefit from is how he was able to become a better person despite being temperamental and foolish in his youthful years. He concentrated on overcoming one character flaw such as his temper and worked on it for a month. Then, he moved on to overcome another character flaw. He made minute but measurable progress to become an accomplished and fine individual.His autobiography should be read by all.

I love history and it was fun hearing his side of life in that time."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This book is a kind of time machine that puts you straight into the Eighteenth Century. Benjamin Franklin comes over as a fearless and open character, although he is at pains to present himself as a solid and successful businessman in the printing industry. He is very much a man of his time. He concerns himself with God and self-improvement, then after he marries he says how glad he is that he did not catch VD from 'certain low women' beforehand. This, certainly consciously, echoes St Paul's advice on why people should marry.Within the text are probably whole layers of meaning and allusions to contemporary events and news culture that are lost on twenty-first century readers. He is certainly working within religious and classical traditions of what an autobiography should be: a conversation with God, carried on in public? or moral examples and advice to the young.Sometimes he is having a laugh at the autobiographical and literary form itself. For example, it is a commmonplace of Eighteenth Century Literature that you-the writer-had no intention of publishing your book until you were prevailed upon by your friends or the public. Franklin opens the second section of his autobiography with a letter purportedly from a Quaker who says that a life of Franklin would be worth even more than 'all Plutarch's Lives put together.'This must have raised a laugh in his local club, his 'junto' as he calls it.However, within the same pages, Franklin describes, clearly with pride, how he swims from Chelsea to Blackfriars in London-which is quite a physical feat, it being two or three miles. He is also at some pains to place much of his financial success on hard work, simplicity and the avoidance of alcohol. These aspects of his life would bequite important for his Low Church readers.Interestingly-as negative examples- he reports that his London workmates routinely down six pints of strong ale a day, both at home and in the printing office. For his contemporaries, this was unusual from the point of view of the English printers being not just drunkards, but -for his audience- very old fashioned. English people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuroes -including babies hence the phrases 'tiny tots' 'small beer' etc.- drank beer and ale as drinking street pump water was correctly suspected to cause disease.Here, through the implication that beer drinking is old fashioned and unhealthy, especially when compared to American coffee drinking, Franklin is presenting his American readers with the idea that-once again- the Colonies, rather than being a backwater, are more modern that their British counterparts in the Imperial Capital of London.At the heart of his political thinking seems to be the moral rather than political idea that with moral virtue-and thus God- on your side, you are unstoppable, and sees the United States' future greatness to lie in this.He takes pains to connect political greatness with the moral quality and education of individual citizens, laying particular emphasis on literacy, and reports with pride how he helped to establish the first lending library in the United States, in Philadelphia.As a moralist rather than a politician, his republican beliefs do not seem as universal as, say, those of revolutionaries like Robespierre or Tom Paine. For him, the American Republic seems to be uniquely American. At one point he is pleased to report, and say that it is an aspect of his success in life that he has dined with a king, and names him as the King of Denmark. Tom Paine would never have dined with a king, unless it were to poison him!Now the non-PC bit as bang go his green credentials.

I was greatly disappointed by the neglect of his wife and family while he was partying in France.Now that I've read Dr. Franklin's own words, I have a clearer idea of his thought process. He had a brilliant mind; and yet uncovered simple solutions to life's large and small inconveniences.I loved rereading his plan for self-improvement, focusing on one character flaw each week for a week at a time until he had improved 13 character traits; and then repeating the process every 13 weeks, 4 times a year.I found it interesting that 'orderliness' was the one habit that he had the most difficulty in achieving.There were many times during the reading that my thoughts drifted and I didn't remember what I had read; but it was still worth the time for what I did learn."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Being the grand son of a Philadelphia Rittenhouse and a University of Pennsylvania graduate, Ben Franklin always has been a favorite.

He was probably the first from what eventually became a current of great minds from the US that have placed us in the forefront of our modern Euro-centric civilization. The biography tells us a little about his feats in this regard. He also gives several lists as to how he lived a successful life. To a liver by lists, his use of lists is almost as important in examining his character as the substance of those lists.

NobleI was watching \\"Book Notes\\" and this famous author was talking about the fact that as a youth he was forced, as were all grade-schoolers of his day, to read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. He hated it, the book being so \\"dull, pompous and laden with platitudes,\\" he said.I've just finished reading the Autobiography of Ben Franklin, and I have gotten a belly laugh out of just about every chapter. The man is hilarious. I really haven't decided whether the whole book is an outright tongue-in-cheek put-on, or that old Ben is just such a practical, unemotional fellow, that his guidelines for living a virtuous life sound like a biology professor trying to explain to a slow student how to rationally distinguish his left hand from his right.The story of his courtship with \\"Miss Read,\\" his eventual wife, I'm sure, is not something that \\"Miss Read\\" cut out of her husband's book and hid away in a trunk of loving memorabilia in an upstairs attic, along with her first love poem and a piece of her wedding cake. She was \\"deserving ... pitiable and a good and faithful helpmate,\\" says Ben. And, believe it or not, she nearly lost Ben's attentions by her inability to get her parents to cough up one hundred pounds as her dowry. In fact, she did loose Ben for a good period during the negotiations, and in the interim Ben being left hot to trot explains that; \\"In the meantime, that hard to be governed passion of youth had harried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way.\\" He goes on to explain his thankfulness at not catching \\"distemper\\" or something worse.His battle with being a perfect, virtuous individual he compares with a man attempting to buy a shinny ax. After a few hours and some time at the hard work of turning the wheel for the blacksmith who is trying to get the man's desired ax to shine, the customer decides that a speckled ax will do just fine. This becomes even funnier when you remember that Ben is talking about his own moral character here. So when put next to the hard work of becoming moral and virtuous, Ben's decision is that he would just as soon have a speckled soul to carry to his Maker. Oh, my goodness!And this has got to be the best one of all. Ben is going into his shop on Craven Street one morning where upon he finds a \\"poor ... very pale and feeble\\" sickly woman, sweeping the walk in front of his door. He asks her who hired her to sweep his walk and she replies; \\"Nobody; but I am poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle folks' doors and hopes they will give me something.\\"Oh, my, doesn't that nearly break your heart? So what does old compassionate Ben do? Why he offers the feeble, poor, pale, very sickly woman a shilling to sweep the whole darn street. When she comes for her shilling he presumes that a woman in her obviously poor condition couldn't have done a very good job, so he sends his servant, out to check her work.

Franklin was never a very good writer, but he was a genius nonetheless. His writings about self-teaching can inspire anyone to want to learn. He spent the majority of his life searching to learn all that he could, and it certainly paid off.

It lets you know how one of our American icons dealt with the ups and downs of daily life. Curiously, there are a number of typos (\\"h\\" for \\"b\\" and vice versa)."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"The prevailing conception of the American character found its apotheosis in the persona of Benjamin Franklin. In early American culture Franklin was considered the typical American whose life philosophy exemplified American attitudes towards life, wealth, and happiness. The proof of this philosophy was found in Franklin's life and both are interwoven in his autobiography.Certainly Franklin became omnipresent in American history (the greatest president who was never president, as I recall) partly because of his own efforts at self-promotion, of which \\"The Autobiography\\" is a prime example along with the constant reprinting of \\"Poor Richard's Almanac\\" (see the preface to the last edition in 1758 entitled \\"The Way to Wealth,\\" which presages the autobiography). Franklin was first and foremost a moralist concerned with the personal, social, and civic improvement of his fellow citizens. The book opens with a letter, written to his son William in 1771. Of course, William, the Royal Governor of New Jersey, is forty years old, so the advice being offered is not to his literal (illegitimate) son but rather to any and all \\"youth.\\" The book is intended as an exemplar for moral action and virtues.Part I has Franklin describing his ancestry and lineage, covering his precocious childhood where he learned the virtues and morals that would serve him in good stead as an adult. Indeed, the story of Franklin becoming a successful businessman and important citizen in Philadelphia is a series of anecdotes in which he uses his intelligence and wit to solve any and all challenges. As autobiography we know this account to be flawed, for Franklin recreates his life to suit his purpose, but as rhetorical exemplar it is impressive. Part II reinforces this point by beginning with a pair of letters from Abel James and Benjamin Vaughn, who praise Part I for having celebrated the frugality, industry, and temperance necessary for a man's character to develop as a prelude to success. This section was written ten years after the first, when Franklin was in France. Here Franklin discusses moral perfection and the importance of industry and frugality in achieving success. Part III was written when Franklin returns home to Philadelphia in August of 1788, and continues the detailing his long career of public service, from publisher \\"Poor Richard's Almanac\\" to becoming Postmaster of the United States. Part IV is something of a fragment devoted to an episode in London in 1747 when Franklin became an early proponent of American rights. Ironically, this section, which would have contained the autobiographical information we would most want to hear with regards to the fight for Independence, is the briefest.Ultimately, what becomes most important about \\"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\" is that it serves as the genesis of the aristocracy of merit in the United States. Franklin's life is the model for the stories of Horatio Alger a century later and instantiates the idea that America is the land of opportunity where it is by merit that we can earn success. That idea has been expressed in countless ways since this book was first published in all its myriad forms, but the life of Franklin is the font from which it all springs."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Interesting stories straight from the horse's mouth.

Franklin was a husband, friend, printer, inventor, scientist, writer, educator, diplomat, and a politician. Franklin's style of writing was cheerfully humorous (how his friend sucked at writing poems was my personal favorite part) and was made even better by the fact that he was able to laugh at himself. I enjoyed his take on the public's opinion of his papers on his experiments with electricity. He did not get defensive because of his cool, confident personality. I loved the part about the other scientist, Abb&eacute; Nollet, who 'could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system.' Overall the book was entertaining and a classic story, but I do not think that I would call it a favorite."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Overall I felt it was worth the time to read. I especially enjoyed reading about the man, his upbringing and bout life in those times. He was certainly a multifacited individual who had his hand in much of what exists today in Philadelphia. Library, university, fire department, paved roads, etc. I have to admit that I skipped some pages when he rambled on about something political or had letters from other people. This was the second book I've read on a Kindle and the ability to look words up in the dictionary was a handy feature."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"We all know who Ben Franklin was. I think of our Founding Fathers, Franklin is the most famous one who *didn't* become President, with the possible exception of Alexander Hamilton. Franklin was a very interesting character, something of a libertine and a rake in his earlier days, and something of an inventor, successful business man, and philosopher in his day. This book largely consists of material he gathered at a couple of different times, intending to compile an autobiography for his son. It rambles on at times, glosses over things, and is incomplete, but it's interesting anyway, as the author tells you why he thinks himself a successful businessman. He also recounts incidents from early American politics that are interesting, and his wit at times shines through, just a bit.I enjoyed this book, for the most part, though the rambling nature of the writing (and the lack of chapter breaks of any sort) sometimes made it hard to read. Recommended, though, as this is one of the few books from the era that explains one of the leading personages from his own point of view."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"It didn't keep me engaged and wanting to continue reading it.

The World Book Encyclopedia says Franklin was \\"a printer, author, publisher, inventor, scientist, businessman, philosopher, statesman and diplomat,\\" adding that his memoir \\"is considered one of the best autobiographies ever written.\\" This reading is from The Harvard Classics, edited by Charles W. Elliot. According to Elliot: \\"The first five chapters . . . were composed in England in 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at which date 'he brought it down to 1757. After a most extraordinary series of adventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printed by Mr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of its value as a picture of one of the most notable personalities of [American] Colonial times, and of its acknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographies of the world.\\" George Washington once wrote to Franklin: \\"If to be venerated for benevolence, if to be admired for talents, if to be esteemed for patriotism, if to be beloved for philanthropy, can gratify the human mind, you must have the pleasing consolation to know that you have not lived in vain.\\" The reading is about seven hours long on six Audio CDs.

So, if you're looking for something from the great man about that, you will be sorely disappointed.As for the rest, it's not poorly written but it covers different parts of his life in different detail: there is a huge portion devoted to his apprenticeship to a printer and Franklin goes into great depth about several debts that he incurred and struggled to pay back, but as his political career begins with the Pennsylvania legislature the level of detail fails off dramatically. It's not entirely the author's fault--he apparently lost some of the personal document he'd expected to be able to use for later parts of his life--but the reader who endures pages closely describing the character faults of his several coworkers and subordinates, expecting to be rewarded with similar depth for topics of historic import will be frustrated when the second section begins.All in all, the Kindle version is worth getting because the price is right, but otherwise I wouldn't be inclined to bother."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I wanted to see if my iPhone would still work with the Kindle app having it's in app shopping removed by Apple.

As a few other reviewers have said, it also falls far short of being definitive.

I cannot appreciate the literature and writing style. That is my disclaimer- now, on to other thoughts.This book is an interesting look at one of the founding fathers of our great nation. If you know nothing about Ben Franklin then you have been living under a rock. The stuff you find in this book though is not going to be the stuff you usually read about. Some of it is interesting and some of isn't. Some of it was written with much thought and some is just dry and describing a step-by-step account of what was happening.Here are the things I liked: His ideas on virtue were interesting. There was suppose to be a different book but when he wrote the second half of this he knew he never would get around to it. How he made his money and went from being poor to rich was also something to acknowledge. These men where the American Dream, which is the Capitalistic dream too. The last thing was he was obviously an innovator and I enjoyed this quote:\\"That is as we enjoy great Advantages from the Inventions of others, we should be glad an Opportunity to serve others by any Invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously.\\"Franklin was against patents it seems. One time he was offered one from the Governor and said no. He wanted people to innovate beyond his innovation. This is important and is an issue still today. Will people innovate without patents?I also enjoyed the part where Franklin got the community together to pay the poor to sweep the steps of the businesses and housing. This is mutually beneficial trade, while being a public good without government coercion. This helped the business owners because dust would get in their shops and drive customers away. It would get the homeowners shoes dirty when he left for work in the morning and the people that did it didn't have jobs before now they do.The bad stuff in the book was that sometimes it was dry and didn't give you a wide view of what was going through Ben Franklin's mind. There was also no Revolutionary War material which would have been nice to see what his exact thoughts were.I do not feel like it is appropriate for me to give it a rating but let's just say I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"I am a history lover and was excited to read this autobiography by Ben Franklin. I found it to be a great disappointment, since Franklin's writing ability did not shine in this book. He gave lots of details about trivial (and at times boring)circumstances and events, yet gave no information about other things of great interest to me -- for example his wife and family life and the entire American Revolution. The book suddenly ends, as if the author was tired of the project, and simply closed up shop."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"Ben Franklin recalls his earlier life from a later vantage point in this skillfully-written walk back in time. As is often the case when reading the words of those from other ages, this most human and brilliant of Founding Fathers seems simultaneously utterly modern and distinctly Colonial as he tells about his life as a printer and inventor in 18th-century Philadelphia. It is the small moments that grant this book so much flavor. Franklin's description of chasing a \\"whirlwind\\" is a prime example of that. This is history at its most approachable, penned by a man whose wit and self-confidence make him fine company for the duration of a most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin, The","review":"This is a autobiography of his early years. He actually finished the second half of it thirty years later when he claims he has enough time &amp; before he became too old. The two halves have been edited seamlessly. In this we see just hints of what England's future relations with the colonies will be. Franklin has considerable business relations with the British military &amp; makes his fortune in business by the time he is fifty. He is just getting his feet damp in politics being one of the framers of the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. There is much in this of the Franklin we do not know. It is informal &amp; personal.

The book features fresh reports from worlds we are only beginning to explore, including new findings on twins and synchronicity, mind-and-body studies and scientists' attempts to quantify accounts on the power of prayer.\\"The book is divided into multiple \`mysteries', all including various sub-topics on extreme paranormal activity, hoaxes, and myths. The sections are based on marvels in History, Nature, Space, Mind and Matter, Spirit, and the World Beyond. From the stories of Atlantis and the Amityville Horror, Stigmata and Demonic Possession, Roswell and Crop Circles, Stonehenge to Easter Island, the book clearly demonstrates truth behind speculation. After reading the book, I quickly scanned over my favorite sections to re-read the parts that I could not engorge enough of. Hearing about most of these stories in my life at sometime in my life, I was thrilled to find a book that covered so many of them. Written and published by the editors of Time magazine, this book is definitely legitimate.\\"It is curious to note the old sea-marginsof human though. Each subsiding century reveals somenew mystery; we build where monsters used to hid themselves...\\"- Henry Wadsworth LongfellowSection one covers the \`Mysteries of the Past'. Beginning with Plato and his story of Atlantis, the book quickly escalates to legends of King Arthur, King Tut, the Oracle of Delphi, and Newgrange. Seeing the remarkable photos to go along with the stories inside allows the reader to become invoked with a mystical and magical realm of surrealism.Section two is about the \`Mysteries of Nature'. This section is all about the Loch Ness Monster, Dowsing, the Fate of Dinosaurs, Bigfoot, Feng Shui, and Auras. The book depicts the story of the hoaxes behind Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, but also fails to explain the Bermuda Triangle and Auras. \`Mysteries of Nature' is by far the most interesting section in the book.\\" I believe that the extraordinary should be pursued. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\\"- Carl SaganThoroughly covered in the \`Mysteries of Space', Editor Kelly Kuaner unravels the famous story behind Area 51, and Roswell, New Mexico. Eight pages are dedicated to aliens, UFOs, and dozens of pictures of those infamous little green men. The section also explains mysteries on Mars: the Martian Face, water on Mars, and the Martian Canals.The last three sections cover Mind and Matter, Sprits, and Ghostly Experiences. All three share similar interests with one another, and could all be combined into one category. Angels, Faith Leaning, Nostradamus, Seers and Psychics, Vampires and Zombies, Miracles and Saints are all very interesting topics found in the late part of the book.To conclude, (and being a student in a Pseudo-Science course), I strongly recommend this book as a teaching companion for teachers, students, and those who have a heart for the unexplained.

The nervous system generates electromagnetism. Mechanical processers, such as breathing and the beating of one's heart, emit sonic vibrations. And since every one of our cells is a miniscule energy plant, our bodies also radiate heat. Each of these emanations can be measured (by galvanometers, sonograms and infrared cameras, respectively) and used to create a spectral - looking image of the body. But none of the resulting visions are even remotely mystical. - Kelly Knauer's Exploring the Unexplained.If you can get rest and wake up refreshed, a big if, then you have 100% of your energy. Many of us begin to waste that energy physically preparing for some job that we hate. After that we have to mentally prepare to spend 9 hours completing tasks that produce nothing. Once we get to these jobs we waste energy pretending that we are doing something beneficial to someone. After all we are receiving money to barter for goods. I suggest that we begin to use our energy on each other. If you know anyone who is still intellectually sound you should build relationships with them. Bind together with like minds in order to focus your energies on life sustaining projects. This will attract more people, more energy, we can built more productive communities."},{"Title":"Exploring the Unexplained: The World's Greatest Marvels, Mysteries and Myths","review":"I am amazed by objectiveness and clarity of the material presented in the book: I am using this book in my classroom for two months already as one of the most professional introductions to the problems of the Middle East I have seen in years of a teaching of the topic.

To this publication Middle East means Afghanistan and Turkey, not central Asia, nor Sudan, nor Yemen. The book is divided so that every two page spread is a different pictoresque topic. Topics include: Islamism, various nation studies, Christianity and various wars such as the Suez conflict, the birth of Israel and other conflicts.But this is where the decency ends and the tragedy begins. Every country study has pictures of people and leaders, except Israel whose picture is the security fence. There isnt one picture of an Israeli or a Jew in the entire book. The second page in the book is entitled the \\"splendor of Islam' and includes a long sycophantic diatribe about the greatness and beauty of Islam. But somehow those other religions that began in the Middle East, such as Zarastrianism, Christianity and Judaism, don't exist, they have no 'splendor' in this book, they are treated to dull uninteresting factual descriptions.The last page of the book gives an idea to the real political view of the book with a long ode to 'tearing down the wall' in Israel, the book claims this wall is 'symbolic' of the unstable middle east. For a long book that ignores the Sudanese genocide, Africans in the middle east, slavery in Saudi arabia and the Yemenite civil war where hundreds of thousands were gassed by Nasser, and of course the Lebanese civil war where another 100,000 died, it is strange that the 'symbol' of the middle east is a concrete wall.

This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well, justice, at least).But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par with Moore's &quot;Watchmen&quot; - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting - against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations, against ... well, enough said.

Beside explaining you that NN are built upon nodes and links and that nodes have values and links have weights, which you can probably figure out by yourself, it present NN rules and techiques without a word about why this is so. For example the formulas used to modifythe NN values during the training process are gives \\"as is\\", sothat you you must just copy them and use them without having a clue at what is going on. So why do I give it 4 stars? Becauseit does have working source code, and not in some weird languagelike Lisp but good old C++. C++ gurus might indeed have more than a grumble with the quality of the code, as it has someglaring faults, both in style and concept (like attempting to inline virtual functions and poor distribution and organization of code among header and source files) but hey, it is very simple to understand, and it works! And that is already something especially for someone who is a beginner both in NN and C++. The NN described are ADALINE, Back Propagation NN, Self Organizing NN and Bidirectional Associative Memory, (in case this tells you something) but with a little work and study you can reuse part of the framework to create new architectures. I definitely prefer a book with working, explained code than a tome full of abstraction and algorithms whose implementation is left as an exercise to the (clueless) reader. At least with this book you can play with the code and see NN in action. To really understand what is going on though you will need a theory book.

The description and name of the book is pretty much what you'll get. The book begins by giving a background in C++, from there they build the basic objects and theory needed for neural nets in general. Then Rogers proceeds to give a quick overview of each of the four neural nets that he covers in the book, in terms of mathematical definitions of those networks. Then the next chapters are dedicated to his implementation of each one of those four networks (Adaline, Backpropagation, Self-Organizing, &amp; Binary Access Memory), including examples of how each one could be used.If you are looking on a book that goes into a large variety of neural networks, or that goes into the in-depth theory behind neural networks, then this might not be the book that you are looking for. Although Rogers gives a sufficient background and a firm basis of neural nets and C++ (you shouldn't get lost in the reading), his main purpose in the book is the actual programming implementation. The books main function (in my view), is to provide the reader with the tools on how to actually approach PROGRAMMING neural networks.My only complaint for this book was the extent of the examples that Rogers provided. The examples were limited in scope (and he mentions this) and detail. It would have been a little more helpful if more &quot;application&quot; information had been given; instead of just &quot;programming&quot; information. Still, though, the book is worth it if you want a strong basis on coding a neural network.All in all a great book, if you take into consideration the book's purpose.

It doesn't go into much depth, but it's easy for a beginner to pick up. If you're trying learn object-oriented programming and/or c++, _don't_buy_this_book_. The code is buggy, bloated, poorly designed, inefficient and just plain bad. To list some of the problems I encountered with it:___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1) The Base_Link::Save function corrupts object and writes corrupted data to a file. 2) No const, *anywhere*. 3) Repeatedly attempts to inline virtual functions. Virtual functions *can't* be inlined because they aren't evaluated until runtime. 4) Most function implementations placed in header files. Maybe due to the use of those magical &quot;inline virtual&quot; functions. 5) Never uses STL containers even where they would be optimal. Creates arrays with new where std::vector would work better, and defines custom linked-list class (very ugly). 6) Uses ofstream/ifstream where ostream/istream would be preferable. The whole point of c++ streams is to have a single set of interfaces for handling io from any origin. Using the fstreams just creates an unnecessary restriction. 7) Creates an array in base class interfaces for use by subclasses as a variable container, as opposed to just creating variables in the subclasses. In my opinion, this is his most egregious offense. It defeats the whole purpose of inheritance. 8) Use of static data in classes. Don't bother using this code in a multithreaded app. Neural nets are usually well suited for multithreading, but certainly not this implementation. 9) Non-virtual destructor in interface classes. Doesn't matter in this case, because he stored all implementation-specific data in the interface class, but is generally poor practice because it can lead to memory leaks. 10) Too few comments that aren't completely redundant, for example: &quot;Base_Link(); // Constructor&quot; 11) The classes are unnecessarily general. Just about every function is virtual, even ones that should never be overridden. The inheritance heirarchy of his objects also suggests that nodes and links can vary implementation within a single network, but never do. In fact, link, node, and neural-network (link/node container) objects all make explicit assumptions about each others' implementations. The examples will crash if you try to use objects of varying implementations together. 12) There are functions in the interface classes that vary *usage* depending on implementation. This means you cannot use them without knowing the exact implementation you are dealing with. The whole point of virtual functions is to provide a single function with a consistent usage even though the implementation may vary. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ To sum up, if you want a simple overview of a few neural network types and love a fixer-upper, this is the book for you.

The author leaves out some of the more advanced material. He DOES NOT go into too much detail about all (or most) of the uses of each neural net -- he only presents a limited number of applications.

The applications of neural networks are enormous and include fields such as financial engineering, network modeling, computational radiology, medicine, and brain modeling.For readers who know C++, this book gives a thorough overview of neural networks from the standpoint of the source code used to represent them. It is expected that the reader has had some exposure to neural networks, for no detailed discussion is given of their history or properties. The author attempts to stick to a purely object-oriented framework, and refrains from giving what he calls a &quot;coarse-grained&quot; approach to an object-oriented implementation of neural networks. The later according to him is merely a collection of C++ wrappers around existing C code. The base objects are the nodes and links of the neural networks, called the Base-Node and Base-Link classes in the book. The author admits this approach degrades performance, but design and development of complicated neural net architectures is enhanced, he argues.After a brief review of object-oriented programming in chapter 2, the author treats the neural network base classes in chapter 3. He defines a neural net as a 3-tuple consisting of a pattern set, parameters, and topology. The ADALINE, backpropagation, Kohonen self-organizing, and BAM neural-network architectures are treated throughout the book in chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. The XOR problem is discussed as an example of learning with a backpropagation neural network, along with an example from lithology. Also, for those readers who are using compilers that do not support template classes, the author creates a generic backpropagation neural-network class. This class is constructed to make the creation of a back-propagation class more transparent.The only major problem with the book is the lack of examples illusrating the Kohonen and BAM neural networks and the lack of in-depth discussion of neural networks.

This comprehensive research was written from scientific-historic point of view. The main question of this great book is what can be learned from the bible books, what is being reflected in the old stories. Kaufmann is trying to prove that the Israeli monotheistic belief is an original creation from the days of Moses. From those days the monotheistic belief was the ruler power in Israel and gave this nation a special course in the history of the world. The readers will be deeply thrilled and expressed by this book, even if not everyone would agree with its conclusions."},{"Title":"The Religion of Israel: From Its Beginnings to the Babylonian Exile","review":"Kaufman's study is a masterful introduction to the religion of ancient Israel. Because it was published in Hebrew and in multiple volumes no less, Kaufman?s work was generally overlooked when it was published. However, once Moshe Greenberg abridged and translated Kaufman's study into English, more scholars discovered what Kaufman has to say.In part, Kaufman?s book is an argument against Julius Wellhausen?s &quot;Prolegomena to the History of Israel.&quot; Wellhausen had championed the documentary hypothesis that the first five books of the Bible were composed from several distant sources and Wellhausen dated P, the Priestly source, as the latest and in fact post-exlic. Kaufman accepted the documentary hypothesis, but challenged Wellhausen?s claim that P was post-exilic. Kaufman argued that in fact P contained some of the oldest strands in the Bible.However, Kaufman's book is far more than a debate about dating the sources. Kaufman sought to demonstrate the originality and uniqueness of ancient Israel's religion in the context of the ancient world. Moreover, Kaufman reviews the entire Bible and seeks to demonstrate how the core concepts of Israel's religion developed over time and were shaped in different ways by the various authors and prophets.Sadly, Moshe Greenberg's masterful condensation and translation is now out of print. I say &quot;sadly&quot; because over time scholars have begun to appreciate more and more Kaufman's genius. There are many modern scholars today who have been greatly influenced by Kaufman - Jacob Milgrom, Israel Knohl, Richard Friedman, and Moshe Greenberg himself, to name only a few. These days one frequently notices references to Greenberg?s abridgement of Kaufman in footnotes but, unless one already has Greenberg's translation, looking up the citation is hopeless. One can only hope that Greenberg?s abridgement and eminently readable translation of Kaufman's masterpiece will someday soon be published again."},{"Title":"The Religion of Israel: From Its Beginnings to the Babylonian Exile","review":"This book contains essays about a wide variety of Torah topics. Although Kaufman presumes the validity of the Documentary Hypothesis (the idea that the Torah has been written by several human authors) his primary thesis is that idolatry was rare, and that Hebrews had been predominantly monotheistic for as long as anyone knew.Kaufman begins by discussing the Bible's attitude towards paganism. Kaufman begins by focusing on the nature of paganism, and how it differs from Biblical monotheism. Paganism assumes gods are like humans, and have private lives. They are subject to natural forces and thus can be coerced by magic. The all-controlling Hebrew God shares none of these characteristics.He also notes that the Hebrew Bible never references pagan mythology (which treats their gods as deities with life stories of their own). Instead, it merely treats pagan gods as names (\\"X, god of nation Y\\") or as impersonal blocks of wood and stone. Kaufman apparently interprets this apparent ignorance of paganism as evidence that true paganism (as opposed to vulgar superstition) was so rare that Jews really didn't understand it very well. He acknowledges that the Bible repeatedly refers to idolatry, but argues that such idolatry was typically confined to small circles. For example, he notes that when Jehu massacres \\"all the servants of Baal\\" (II Kings 10), this group was small enough to fit into one temple.In the middle of the book, another essay focuses on the Israel/Canaanite relationship. Kaufman argues that the Biblical story of Hebrews ethnically cleansing Canaanites is mostly true, and that there is no evidence that the two peoples merged or that the Hebrews were just a faction within the Canaanites. To support this view, he notes that there is no evidence of early Hebrews using chariots (a form of military technology used by Canaanites) or adopted the Canaanites' city-state form of political organization. Although Canaanite settlements did survive Joshua's conquests, they were separate from the Hebrews (and presumably hostile).Kaufman's last few essays focus on the prophets; he argues that the prophets differed among themselves. Amos focused on everyday social sins, especially those involving exploitation of the poor. The most unique feature of Isaiah's prophecy is less his attack on sins as his vision of redemption: Isaiah envisions Divine salvation not just for Israel, but for all mankind. Micah, by contrast, is more nationalistic, focusing on the risk of national destruction and the hope of national revenge upon Israel's enemies. Habakkuk acknowledges the worldly success of paganism, but argues that it is only temporary. Kaufman's discussion of Jeremiah explains why it was so difficult for the Jews to accept his prophecies: while Isaiah had (correctly) counseled resistance to foreign invaders, Jeremiah urged submission to Babylon, and asserted that if the kingdom of Judah failed to submit it would be destroyed as punishment for its sins- not just the sins of the rich against the poor (as in Amos) but a wide variety of everyday sins. Ezekiel's prophecy was directed towards exiles rather than towards residents of Israel, and was more mystical in nature than the others."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Perusing books in a second hand store I came upon Michener's Journey and remembered how much I enjoyed it. Very little of my reading these days is popular fiction, but ten and more years ago things were different. A few such books stand out in my memory, books that were pleasantly consumed in poolside chairs during family mini-vacations. The context of my reading this book could hardly be more dissimilar to the often severe conditions described in \`Journey'!Most of Michener's books are of the thousand-page variety, by comparison to which Journey is rather brief. For the reader that hasn't read any of Michener's works of \`historical fiction,' I suggest that this atypical volume is a non-daunting and rewarding place to start. The obvious follow up being \`Alaska' (it was for me)."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"This was my first Michener novel and I found it to be extremely entertaining. I too was disappinted that almost everyone dies off, but this isn't supposed to be a warm &amp; fuzzy book, it's about a difficult journey made more difficult by the person in charge.Michener originally wanted to include this story in ALASKA, but that novel was already quite long. This is a perfect lead-in for Alaska and a great Michener book for the beginner or someone looking for something a bit shorter while between Michener classics."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"A story told by a well experienced novelist. A pseudo historical novel that kept me very interested from start to finish. However, a notable weak spot for me was the treatment of the deaths of the two gents from scurvy (sorry to sound so grisly) that I thought could have been better handled.The strength of Lord Luton's character was well handled, including his own eventual realisation that he probably made a series of major blunders leading to two deaths. Nevertheless, Luton goes on in typical Aristocratic way to survive and thrive: becoming a senior politician in his home country.The Irish skivvy comes across well, too.I'm not a fan of poetry, so the poetry section at the end left me cold.I'm in two minds as to whether I appreciated the history of how the story came to be written: many will like this section though, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"I found this to be a good story, and it's definitely one of Michener's shorter titles. Unlike most other Michener books which take a locale or topic and follows it through generations and eras, this takes one group of folks on an expedition during the Gold Rush and sticks with it cover to cover. It might be a good introduction to Michener in the sense that it's a shorter read. On the other hand it's a bit different than the approach Michener usually takes, so I can't say that it's a great representative for Michener's status quo. I do think there is a bottom line of... If you like the story, you'll probably enjoy other Michener titles as well. For those already familiar with Michener, this is one that you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"My copy of Michener's Journey has a blurb on the back calling it his best novel ever. Well, you shouldn't always trust blurbs, and you shouldn't trust this one. I am a Michener fan, and I have enjoyed many of his books, but this novel attains neither the depth of The Source, nor the sweeping nature of Hawaii nor the eloquence of Tales of the South Pacific. Journey is not a bad book. It's just not his best.In fact, Journey is a reworking of a portion of Michener's book Alaska, which was threatening to go over the 1000-page limit. As Journey's entire story actually occurs outside of Alaska, it was a logical excision.The story starts with a news event reaching the world: that a ton of gold has been \\"harvested\\" out of the Klondike. Michener does well at the book's opening and his description of how people around the planet react. He's also excellent with much of the preparation for the journey - and, of course, his descriptions of nature.The characters, however, do not function as well. Although a reader might consider it all too realistic (unfortunately) that a man with a title is permitted to make decisions that are downright foolish, what strikes me as unrealistic is the lack of rebellion against the leader. Everyone is too calm - perhaps Michener meant for them to all remain dim-wittedly dignified - but lives were being wasted. Even the protagonist's realization of his foolhardiness at the end seems insufficient for the magnitude of his errors. Perhaps this is what Michener intended, because, this is what happens all too frequently in real life - but as a novel it is not as satisfying."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Michener usually does excellent research and gives a great taste of an area/time. 'Journey' was a complete disaster in this area - there's a decent description of the train (the TRAIN?), nothing describing Montreal, almost nothing Edmonton or any of the stops en route, and zero description of the Klondike or Dawson. There's no 'story' of the prospectors or other travellers (save a few paragraphs on Irina). The Edmonton description prepared me for bleak descriptions of a 90% death rate, or a trail littered with frozen bodies - but nothing.OK - so Michener didn't do a book I was expecting on history or a travelogue or a technical description of anything. It was a character study of the 5 men. Well, the character development was truly shallow and incomplete. None of the characters seemed believable - they were cardboard stereotypes. The &quot;hero&quot; led his very well-financed group of hardy men into a deadly course that every single expert advised against. He contemplating KILLING Irina because he thought her presence would make the over-winter camping harder? WOW! It's hard to imagine that the others would offer virtually no arguements when their lives are litterally in the balance. How can anyone believe they would suffer 8 months in a tiny len-to cabin when there's a fort 50 miles away, 1 more day on the boat or 3 days walking after the freeze?I enjoy adventure stories. I like tales of hardship. The book maintained my interest (I was expecting something interesting once they reached Dawson - Alas!). So it gets 2 stars. But had I not read MUCH better books by Michener I would never glance at a 2nd one if I had to decide based on &quot;Journey.&quot;"},{"Title":"Journey","review":"This is a book for those who love the frozen north.

THis is a gripping tale and I found it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"This book documents an expedition to Alaska to find gold and dreams of riches.

I had a couple, but the one I will never forget was my history teacher, Mrs. Murray. She had a way of telling a story about historical events. Even now, thirty years later, I still recall her with fond memories.

So you can imagine my disappointment at finding a book that had so much potential that went absolutely no where. What a basis for a story. A small group of adventurous, proud Englishmen; the harsh and lonely Canadian wilderness; and gold fever. Unfortunately the gold was never a topic. The Canadian wilderness with its extreme weather, beautiful landscapes, and abundant wildlife, was only passively mentioned in very small detail. And as for the characters- the only ones you really liked died, with very little discussion ( this did not bother me because I know reality has to play into a book of this sort). And the one character you truly begin to despise lives long enough to cause one of the worst endings to novel I have ever read. One mans pride- excuse me, stupidity- killed the most admirable characters in the novel, then went home as soon as he accomplished the task. I have never been so frustrated in my life with a book."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Michener was drawn to stories of the Klondike gold rush whilst researching material for his voluminous Alaska, and thought this story, set dominantly in Canada, too good not to publish.It is a fictional story of a few gold seekers of the Klondike gold rush, and seeks to capture the romance, the exhilaration, the recklessness, and the overall madness of the time. It is an invigorating adventure story, however if I had just one quibble, the characters for me were a little one dimensional, and the story told in a less complex manner than it probably deserved.Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable expose of the spirit of adventure, capturing much that is part of the northern spirit of romantic escapism and self discovery."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"If you like Michener this is short and sweet, but musy be read with Alaska, preferably afterward.

A vivid action packed novel that is easy to read and hard to put down. Five men struggle in the Canadian wilderness while enroute to the Klondike gold fields in 1897.

Without a new frontier to face him, he creates one with his insane limitations. Oblivious to fear and depravity he goes thousands of miles out of his way to prove what that he will preserver no matter the adversity.I bought this book in 2004 for years it sat in my library waiting for me to discover what type of men built the British Empire, the very same type of men who would later loose it."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"This is one of the more entertaining books I have ever read.

I have so high of expectations for Mr. Michener that when he doesn't hit a home run I'm disappointed. This book is OK, it is short compared to all his other books. He only used his old trick once where he reintroduces a character, the one feamle of the book, then brings her back. She was introduced, forgotten, then found stranded in literally nowhere, and rescued by the heroes. Also something different in this book was a chapter of reflection by the author. Many claim the book is about Canada. I sensed very little Canadian, except for the fact that they were traveling through Canada. I believe Mr. Michener could of detailed the Canadian characters a bit more, showing how they came to and adapted to this rugged country."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Michener's books are always interesting quality historical novels.

I would have given this book a lower rating, but there wasn't an option for a half-star. You would get more enjoyment out of reading the dictionary than you would from reading this book. Absolutely Terrible!!p.s. They never find any gold!"},{"Title":"Journey","review":"I have read several James A. Michener books. For a book that is very short for Michener's usual fair, this is very good. Why? For this one, Michener sticks to one plot. No, you don't have his usual descriptive settings or his lengthy battle of some animal trying to survive. This book just tells the story. A very good story. The plot involves five men from Britain who go to Canada to get to the gold rush in 1897. There real mission is to get there by traveling only on British territory. No one has ever done that. As any one knows, traveling in Canada over mountains is not that easy. These five men will soon discover that the idea of adventure for the sake of honor may be a high price to pay. One of the reviews I saw for this book listed on Amazon, didn't like the idea of killing off some of the characters. One wrote that this book was depressing because of that. James A. Michener doesn't write anything without history backing him up. Killing off some of the characters proves how hard this journey really was. And, I am sure that some men did see this as an adventure not a suicidal journey. Some men just don't see the big picture. If you have never read a James A. Michener book, this could be a good one to start with. But, you have not read anything until you've read a Michener epic. Try Texas, Hawaii or Caribbean."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"You can tell James Michener does his research. His knowledge about the peoples, wildlife, climates about Europe, Canada and the USA during this time is top notch and I certainly learned many things.However, the story itself leaves much to be desired. Five guys go for the gold and find much trouble along the way. That's it in a nutshell. Now to my main problem.Michener tells us over and over again that the lead character was going to make a decision that would be tragic for the members. He tells you this almost every other page, so that when it does happen, you aren't moved or anything. You're waiting the whole book for things to fall apart and you know they will. So the book is a test of patience, with little to make the wait worthwhile. The characters themselves are not all unlikable (particularly Harry Carpenter) but they are unbelievable.Lord Luton is too stubborn in his decisions without reason. He obviously really wants to get to the Klondike his way. Everyone tells him it's the worst plan and would likely kill them all. Yet he refuses alternate plans. Why?? Michener never tells us why he is so stuck on this one route. Luton doesn't want to cross through American territory for some reason, but even when presented with options that would be easier and meet this criteria he refuses. Simply unbelievable. And Harry Carpenter, knowing that death may be in store for all of them, goes along with it out of some sense of loyalty. Maybe that's how people were. If so, then these characters that you are going to be spending the whole book with are either incredibly fake or incredibly irresponsible. Either option is incredibly unenjoyable.I finished it, and while his command of the English language is stellar, the book is not. Pass on this one and read his others (Alaska, Chesapeake)."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"It's 1897, and people from all over the world are heading for the Yukon gold fields. Most follow the grueling overland route from Alaska after arriving there by ship. Lord Evelyn Luton, though, wants to prove that it's possible to reach Dawson without straying out of Canada. The 32-year-old younger son of the Marquess of Deal gathers three fellow noblemen (including two members of his own family), plus a trusted Irish servant, and sets out for Canada at mid-summer. Although they're well prepared for their trip down the mighty, wandering Mackenzie River, unlike far too many others making the same perilously late start, they have no chance of reaching their goal without wintering along the way. This they do with remarkable success - the first year, anyway. After that it's another story entirely.What can it cost us humans to cling pigheadedly to our preconceptions, even when those around us know better and try to persuade us of our folly? What can blind loyalty cost those who follow such a leader? JOURNEY addresses these themes with some poignance, although it's hard for a modern reader to avoid wanting to shake Lord Luton silly. What I found most interesting and enjoyable wasn't the novel itself, though. I was intrigued by Michener's \\"Reflections\\" at the book's end, in which the author describes how he conceived the characters of JOURNEY and first told their story as a chapter in his novel ALASKA. When his editors rightly pointed out that it didn't fit well there, and made an already long book longer still, he put the material away. Only to take it out and rework it, even adding scenes that he hadn't bothered to write when he thought it would form one chapter in the longer work, after the characters he'd created refused to leave him alone. \\"Reflections\\" provides a fascinating trip into the creative process of a prolific and highly successful writer."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"I think James Michener has a good story going here. I was impressed by some of the irony and allusion, especially Luton's stubbornness when it came to Americans, as well as taking advice from anyone after he'd already made up his mind. I think more detail and suspense could have been added, but that's strictly reader preference. The deaths of some of the characters left me feeling a bit lost as well. It was as if their death kind of snuck up on you and then wasn't talked about after about a page or so. However, the overall storyline pleased me very much. I think it personified cultural stubbornness as well as gold rushes in general. I nearly laughed out loud when reading about some of the inexperienced travelers that were trying to make their way through the Arctic (i.e. the man with the modified tractor). I was also very satisfied by the ending. It was unexpected, but complete and understandable. Also, I liked the fact that Luton stated from the beginning that he wasn't after gold and by the end he hadn't changed his mind at all. After all, the title of the book, Journey, certainly implies that the adventure and travel is the fun part of the book, not a quest for gold or a search for pride. Overall, I liked the book and thought it was a very entertaining read and believe it deserves four stars."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"The novel is the story of the adventure of a group of English aristocrats and an Irish servant travelling to find gold across Canada. It describes two harsh winters spent out in the wild and makes for a riveting read.The descriptions are vivid, characters are well-developed and word pictures compelling. Michener also writes a section at the end about how he came up with the idea for this book, as well as the research and process underlying the writing of this novel. This gives a good insight into how a book is developed and a glimples at the thinking process of a remarkable writer. This also makes for a good read.

I had trouble starting &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Centennial,&quot; two books with apparently slow introductions that I shelved for later perusal. Journey was the best of all the Michenor books I've explored, with an engaging adventure story and great wilderness background.The tale is set in the period of the Yukon Gold Rush from 1897 to 1899 and follows the endeavors of five men; four Englishmen and their Irish servant, to reach the gold fields of Canada through a British-only route. The leader of the group, Lord Luton, is bound and determined not to venture through the United States due to his priggish snobbery and stubbornness, a misguided decision which proves to be painfully costly. The descriptions of Canadian life, its wonders and dangers are vivid and enthalling. The pitfalls of the expedition had me turning the pages rather enthusiastically, and some of the characters were quite likeable.However, I had some real problems with the protagonist of the story, Lord Luton. I disliked him so intensely that it served as a detriment to the book. Michener did a splendid job depicting this thoroughly unlikeable man in the context of the English lord with cherished rules and customs (no matter how ridiculous) but I still found him so insufferable that I found myself hoping the character would be removed from the story, and the tale would focus upon the remaining survivors. Certainly he had some good qualities such as bravery, a good work ethic, and concern for his fellow travelers, but the negative aspects of his character overwhelmed the positive. I despised the way he (and the book) referred to the Irish servant, Fogerty, the best of the bunch, as &quot;his gilly.&quot;Throughout the tale Luton apparently learned nothing about the foolishness of his decisions and actions, nor does he reform any of his mannerisms into more reasonable modes of behavior. The sacrifices made on the journey are ever more poignant because the person responsible for them never even finds remorse for his actions."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"I love James Michener, and I have since I read Centennial when I was a kid.The Journey is a great adventure story, and a great lesson - of how NOT to do it.I wanted to write that this was the worst book I ever read, but it wan't the prose - it was the characters. Michener really nails the arrogance possessed by Lutton, and the sheep (follower) mentality of the others.I think it was great poetic justice that the 'servant', an Irishman surrounded by bombast, appears to be the real winner at the end. In a metaphor for life, he demonstrates that colonialism can be beat, if one uses their head and is patient.Kevin"},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Although this was the first and only Michener novel I have read, I think it was a poor choice. My expectations going into reading were quite high, but by the end of this novel I was very disappointed. The story was decent, however the plot was very thin. I had alot of trouble relating to the characters. I could not figure out if Luton was just a snob, or a real caring person that was afraid to show his emotions. The deaths were very predictable, and to be quite frank the ending just sucked! What a let down, Luton just leaves the same day he gets to Dawson like he is supposed to be some kind of hero or something. Luton just made me angry the whole story especially the way he treated Fogerty, at the end I am very surprised he paid for his telegram. Definitely not the greatest book in the world."},{"Title":"Journey","review":"Let's call a cat a cat. It is a weak Michener. If it is the first you read, it will probably your last. Michener, in the afterword, tells us that The Journey was originally in his book Alaska but was cut by the editor. He then took that section and made a book.The premises are good. A party of adventurers, including a snob British Lord, a poet, a retired Colonel and a cunning Irishman go on a journey to the Yukon River during the gold rush. This is too little to make a book.There is some good characters interraction, some good moments but they are drowned in the long repetitive parts of the journey, to the point where you keep thinking something will happen and...If you want a good Michener, look at my review of the Covenant or Poland, forget The Journey"},{"Title":"Matrix Algebra: A Programmed Introduction","review":"An excellent book covering basic aspects of matrix operations.

Garnett depicts the reactions of husband and wife to this event with incredible psychological depth and realism. The husband is beside himself, but is primarily concerned for his wife's safety, shooting his furious dogs and sending away the servants. His wife is heartbroken, and desperately tries to avoid walking on all fours or appearing unclothed, and the couple attempt to live their lives as normally as possible; the husband plays waltzes for his vixen, they take tea together, and even play cards!As time passes, Mrs. Tebrick becomes more at home in the body and mind of a fox, and her husband's whole concept of the boundaries between man and nature is repeatedly shattered as his beloved wife devours her pet dove, runs and plays like a normal fox, and yearns to kiss him with her muzzle still stained with blood from a \\"savagely\\" killed small animal.Mr. Tebrick is trapped in an excruciating tug of war between the world of men and nature as he confronts his wife's \\"adultery\\" and \\"bestiality\\" with a dog-fox, yet finds his greatest happiness in playing with his wife's kits, and his wife, who delights in his company and his attention to her offspring, even though she now prefers to chew playing cards rather than use then in human fashion.Sadly, Mr. Tebrick's unshakable love for his wife and his litter of godchildren causes even greater suffering, since as a human he is hideously aware of the dangers that await his family during the coming hunting season, and how tenuous their short moments of happiness are.Truly a remarkable study of the close kinship we have with animals, and the ways our abstract intelligence and imagination will always keep us at a distance from their world. It is also an incredibly moving love story."},{"Title":"Lady Into Fox","review":"Lady Into Fox, by David Garnett, harkens back to the early Twentieth Century when book covers (one of the best things about this book) were deliciously simple and the real treat was contained in the pagese between them. Also enchanting are the wood engravings that illustrate the book. Originally published in 1922 and out of print since 1966, McSweeney's brings this classic tale of transformation and unrecognizable self back to the forefront of literature. This opulent tale will surely be talked about and enjoyed for years to come. This is a great gift."},{"Title":"Lady Into Fox","review":"So I just stumbled upon this bizarre and delightful work: Lady into Fox by David Garnett (available for free at Project Guttenburg), written in 1922 and it's exactly what the title would have you believe, a story about a lady who is transformed into a fox. It's a short read and I finished the novel (novella?) in a day. The love that the married couple has for each other despite the difficult situation they find themselves in is something to behold, but I can't help but notice the somewhat antiquated ideals about marriage and gender that are emphasized in a book about a female who is turned into an animal. Especially when there are passages like this peppered throughout the story:\\"Now he had many little things which busied him in the house- getting his meals, setting the room straight, making the bed and so forth. When he was doing this housework it was comical to watch his vixen. Often she was as it were beside herself with vexation and distress to see him in his clumsy way doing what she could have done so much better had she been able to. Then, forgetful of the decency and the decorum which she had at first imposed upon herself never to run upon all fours, she followed him everywhere, and if he did one thing wrong she stopped him and showed him the way of it. When he had forgot the hour for his meal she would come and tug his sleeve and tell him as if she spoke: \\"Husband, are we to have no luncheon to-day?\\" This womanliness in her never failed to delight him, for it showed she was still his wife, buried as it were in the carcase of a beast but with a woman's soul.\\"As you can see there are some definite social assumptions about the place of men and women and their role in society. I guess one could argue this about most any novel, but it is interesting to reflect on the social attitudes that were being espoused during the time of this book's release, it's just that much more apparent because of how long ago this book was written.It's not all gender and sexual commentary though. As I said earlier, there is a bittersweet relationship at the heart of this story, the devotion that a man has for his wife. And the struggle of a woman fighting to retain her humanity in a beast form."},{"Title":"Lady Into Fox","review":"Really well-written, and quite knowledgeable about what foxes are like. Best of all is the moral & emotional complexity of the protagonist, as steadily the situation unfolds that his wife is truly a fox&#8212;a wild beast, no longer human."},{"Title":"Lady Into Fox","review":"David Garnett (1892-1981) was a British writer and publisher who received literary recognition when his novel Lady into Fox was awarded the 1922 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.This particular work is as enigmatic as its writer and this particular reviewer failed to understand the work. The plot is simple enough: Sylvia, the 24-year-old wife of Richard Tebrick, suddenly turns into a fox while they are out walking in the woods. The rest of the story is the tale of Richard dealing with the transformation and his struggle to accept his wife's ego as she slowly loses her humanity to the fox form she inhabits.Is the story a morality play? Fictional essay? Eccentric novella? The last gasp of scandalous English yellow literature? Each reader will have to judge for his or her own."},{"Title":"Lady Into Fox","review":"Originally published in 1922 and out of print for years, *Lady into Fox* by David Garnett has recently been republished by McSweeneys in a beautiful jacket-less hardcover. It is illustrated with wonderful woodcuts by R.A. Garnett. It is a well written novella with a fanciful tone.This is the story of Mr. Tebrick and his wife who, in the first few pages, turns into a fox. Mr. Tebrick, though taken aback by his wife's new condition, still loves his wife even through her adulterous affair with another fox and her [...] kits from this affair. Even more complicating the story is that they live an area of England where fox hunting is a daily pastime - one that Mr. Tebrick has enjoyed on many an occasion in the past.So, why, you ask, did I only give this book 3 stars? Unfortunately, I knew exactly where the book was going and exactly how it was going to end within a few pages of Mrs. Tebrick's transformation into a fox; and, the story played out as I expected leaving me no joy in the discovery, no surprises, no pleasure in the reading.This doesn't mean that others won't enjoy *Lady into Fox*, only that I didn't even though this a nicely packaged and well written book.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"The intellectual life","review":"Hamerton's uses the word 'intellectual' in the circa European sense. With careful attention to that word and the 1873 authorship, this book's subject matter itself is perhaps the best book of its kind. For those intellectuals seeking guidance or mentors who seeking guidance for their mentees Hamerton's elegant writing style circa 1873 is a delight for all those who are so intrigued.Hamerton presents his thesis and personal concern using many short stories about the experience of his friends, acquaintances, and his own life. These individuals had very different beginnings in life yet found themselves on similar trajectories. Many if not most of us might (have) find this book life-changing if read seriously while young and yet edifying at any age. Hamerton gently reminds us throughout that life is short and smart people amidst their dreams often underestimate what they can do in a lifetime. Hence they often make a mess in subsequent shortfalls. As a good example of someone avoiding this consequence of haste in living thoughtfully, I found very instructive Hamerton's recounting the wisdom of his father's approach to life. Also as he wrote using the male pronoun Hamerton should be given credit as he writes for both genders (if you read carefully) explaining British culture (~1873) did not recognize female intellectualism since few young women were able to get support for such an orientation. Hamerton then observes there was no reason why women could not seek development of a higher intellect. Several of his stories were about young women.On the topic of the welfare of unmarried men, who as men found it easier to develop as intellectuals in 1873 circa Britain, he laments their frustration with finding suitable marriage prospects. These women would understand and accept their husbands' psychology and be undaunted by their often uncommon personalities. He notes the unliklihood of this type of match might lead to poor choices. Happily for Hamerton he did find just the right woman although late in life. Hamerton wrote several other equally prescient books.The type font chosen for this publishing, perhaps for economy, has a very thin letter style (ie font weight) and for me is somewhat harder to read. Otherwise this soft cover version is well-made. There are the online versions however as a bookshelf destined gift this book is a classic. There are hardcover reprints. Thus the paperback is a bargain. Otherwise it will be rare book prices for the 1873 printing. Beware there is another book of very similar title but different author. My five star rating is for the original literary work and does not reflect the quality of this particular publication."},{"Title":"Peterson First Guide to Astronomy","review":"Thanks to this book, I am now an amateur astronomer.

Additionally I found the mythology behind the traditional western culture naming of the constellations interesting.Only criticisms include 1) as previously mentioned, no star charts for the Southern Hemisphere and 2) wasted pages printing illustrations of the characters the constellations represent.

First, in a few places they did a poor job of updating the 1988 edition to this 2006 version. For instance, we are told to expect another exciting Leonid meteor shower in 1998 or 1999 (page 62).

Recognizing that the ways to unity with Jesus and others are many and varied, Focolare has enumerated seven main points about love.

Pan Am wanted to have deluxe hotel accomodations in the cities that their expanding airline served. Many countries, especially in the third world, simply did not have hotels at the level of quality that rich Americans expected. Thus Intercontinental Hotels was born. Initially called International Hotels, it was changed to Intercontinental because consensus was that sounded more classy.This 240 page book is a heavy over-sized hardcover profusely illustrated with colour and black and white photos. There are period photos of Intercontinental hotels around the world as well as vintage advertising from the early days of the intercontinetal travel.Today long distance airplane travel is a mundane and often harrowing experience. This book provides a window to a time when \\"jet-setters\\" were an exclusive group that expected to be pampered even in such exotic locales as Nairobi and Muscat. The \\"can-do\\" and \\"think big\\" attitude that made America great said that \\"if you build it, they will come.\\" Trippe and Pan Am created a hotel chain offering worldwide luxury accomodations where before none had existed. In some countries existing hotels that lived up to Intercontinental standards took on the brand. The famous Carlton Intercontinental in Cannes is one such place where a century old grand hotel became part of the chain.Great book about a fascinating topic that is unfortunately OOP and hard to find.

I was very excited to get started on a project for my daughter. The instructions were very basic and did not include sufficient detail to avoid making mistakes. Also, the project was far too small to turn it inside out without pushing a hole through the fabric. I will most likely stick to embroidered items and will avoid the doll projects in the book."},{"Title":"Embroidered Treasures for Children","review":"I found the instructions, both the project and general techniques and tips, to be detailed and helpful.

Patterns to be enlarged and transfered are printed on the pages.At first glance one might think that the projects would only be suitable as a gift for a young child, but I imagine using the embroidery designs on other projects too. In fact, I plan to make gifts for adult friends who would enjoy some of the themes included in the projects, such as the ocean.I like the cute designs the author has created, and would probably have given this book five stars if I didn't find the size type a bit small for referring to while crafting.

Far from a dry text, I found this book to be an enlightening view into the roles of women in Renaissance society, the social mores and opinions that restricted them, and the many ways in which some circumvented society in order to express themselves (there is a lot more there than you think!). It is full of primary data, some of which is only available in Italian and other original languages, and translated for this book by the author. One who reads this book will come away with a more complete and well-rounded view of Renaissance women's lives, (at their best and their worst) and a greater respect for those who lived them. In response to the previous reviewer, and as a warning to those looking for an &quot;easy read&quot;. This is an excellent source of fact-based material on the time period and its inhabiants, not a pre-digested, dime-tour of the Renaissance. But for those who are open to a little intellectual stimulation will find this a powerful, eye-opening experience worth their time."},{"Title":"Women of the Renaissance (Women in Culture and Society)","review":"I was overwhelmed by the volumes of historical information in this book, but not so impressed by its organization. It would have benefited from a more chronological organization or some other means of keeping track of who was who and when and where they lived. The book is packed full of information, historical interest and the &quot;voices&quot; of women of the Renaissance. It is a great source for research, but give yourself lots of time to read it. The chapters are over long and the flow is not exactly the &quot;page-turning&quot; variety. Still it is a must read for students of women's history or the history of the Renaissance."},{"Title":"Women of the Renaissance (Women in Culture and Society)","review":"It's a real treat to come away from being compelled to read a book feeling that you got more, much more, than you had expected. This was a required text for an upper division college course I took.Margaret King knows her stuff. I've studied the Renaissance in other classes, so had touched upon gender issues already, but King's work filled in many empty spaces. Her thesis is that although socially women didn't gain much (or even lost ground), something important happened within women's minds during the Renaissance.Options were limited for women during fourteenth through seventeenth centuries. Roles were generally defined by men or faith (ostensibly controlled by men); wife, mother, celibate religious, spinster, witch. But even these categories, King shows, were full of complexities. Women, other than nuns, shouldn't be taught to read, rather spin and sew. Women couldn't be trusted with too much knowledge. Even the Greek term for \\"womb,\\" hysteros, gave a clue to a woman's basic \\"hysteria.\\" Often, women bought into this paradigm and were their own worst enemies.But King shows that the scene was more complex than that. Some fathers taught daughters Latin, Greek, philosophy. Heretic nuns wrote private treatises from within the shelter of their cells. Men marvelled at living Amazons, such as Joan of Arc who walked the thin line between deification and devilment. Before Joan burned, Christine de Pizan wrote about a \\"City of Ladies\\" where femininity would be protected, and no man could cause hurt.This is a beautiful book and should be read by historians, feminists, and anyone who loves to see flowers grow through cracks in inhospitable terrain."},{"Title":"Women of the Renaissance (Women in Culture and Society)","review":"The title of this monograph well describes its subject: the lives of women during the Renaissance. However, Margaret L. King pays close attention to the roles available to women in the family, church, and high society. This text's intended audience is the general academic community. This book's purpose is to clarify the nature of women's lives during Renaissance.King's primary thesis is that women did not have a Renaissance. The realms of family, church, and high culture all relegated Renaissance women to subservience in some way. In the family, women were essentially their husband or father's property. In most cases, the church viewed women in a similar fashion. Conversely, in high culture, Renaissance women had a chance of wielding power and receiving education. King relies on diaries, religious texts, trial transcripts, medical literature, and several personal letters to support this argument.This book examines the Renaissance, defined by the author as the period from 1350 to 1650. Subjects discussed include the cultural, economic, and political circumstances of women. The first chapter is titled \\"Daughters of Eve: Women in the Family.\\" Here, King asserts that Eve's punishment in Genesis epitomizes the lives of Renaissance women. According to this story, the punishment for Eve's sin is that all women have to endure labor pain and remain subservient to men. Similarly, a Renaissance woman's worth is dependent on her ability to produce several children in succession and remain submissive to her male family members. King goes on to discuss a woman's progression from daughter, to wife, and eventually to a widow. She ends this chapter by discussing the woman as a worker. Here, King's main argument is that women's public labor was mostly menial and became increasingly restricted as time went on.In chapter two, \\"Daughters of Mary: Women and the Church,\\" King examines Renaissance women's role in the church. Unlike women in the family, the lives of women in the church do not revolve around bearing children. However, women of this realm still remain nominally subservient to men. In discussing women and the church, King starts by examining women who live in convents and those who live in autonomous and uncloistered female religious communities. King also spends a moderate amount of time discussing women and the reformation. She argues that while Catholicism provided an alternative to family life in the form of a convent, Protestantism provides no such choice. King ends the chapter by discussing witch-hunts, which she likens to genocide.In chapter three, \\"Virgo Et Virago: Women and High Culture,\\" King examines the role of Renaissance women in the upper class. These women enjoyed better access to education and some attended school. King also mentions a few rare Renaissance examples of female rulers. All of these educated and powerful women upset the gender roles for women in Renaissance society. Some of the words used to describe these women include Amazon, armed maiden, and crone. At the end of this chapter, King examines primary sources created by Christine de Pizan, Modesta de Pozzo, and Mary Astell. Using these sources, King finishes her book by examining the way women's ideas about themselves changed during the Renaissance. Specifically, they began seeing themselves as equal to men.This book does carry out its purpose of clarifying women's lives during the Renaissance. Some of the strengths of this book include extensive use of primary evidence and the author's knowledge of the existing literature on this subject. It also has an extensive bibliography and index. Nonetheless, this text has significant faults. The most significant fault is the complete lack of a proper conclusion. King's entire summary consists of two paragraphs on the last two pages of the third chapter. King also continually jumps from one side of Europe to the other. Occasionally, she even discusses women in America. This disorients the reader and inhibits the academic usefulness of this text. Due to these shortcomings, the reviewer is hesitant to suggest this book as a good resource."},{"Title":"Vegan Cooking for Everyone","review":"This book is FULL of recipes for all courses--from the appetizer to dessert (even including ice cream!!) I thought I'd cleared the shelves at [local store] of all their vegan cookbooks, so I was so happy to have found this book, I almost yelled aloud right in the store! No vegan cookbook has been so complete and at the same time had easy recipes that anyone can put together (you might even have alot of the ingredients in your kitchen already!) I like to cook when I have time (and there are special recipes in here for when you do have the time), but when I come home late from work, my stomach often can't wait an hour or more for me to prepare something. These recipes are great, and alot of them are not time-consuming. There are some grains that the average person might not be used to in a few of the recipes, but most are filled with ingredients familiar to most palates.

Houston, which calls itself 'the first book to chart surfing's Pacific origins in the context of Polynesian culture,' has its juiceless roots in Finney's mid-Sixties master's thesis at the University of Hawaii.Written without enthusiasm or verve, the book plods along, its undistinguished text style flattening what should be a colorful, vital, and fascinating history. For the 30th anniversary addition, the authors state that they have decided not to revise the text, a strategy which might have worked had the original been stronger. But Surfing: A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport, at a slim 117 pages, could badly use some lively additional material.Though the book contains a variety of prints of traditional Hawaiian surfing practices and customs, there are surprisingly few historical photographs, and less than a handful from the post-Forties period. Though most of the photographs included are excellent, a vivid photo documentary of one of the most colorful sports in history the book is not.Surfing: A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport may be useful to students or novice researchers, but most of the information contained here can be found elsewhere, and in brighter, more stimulating form.The book does include interesting maps of the most heavily-used surfing areas in ancient times, a pronunciation guide, an appendix of Hawaiian surfing terms, and firsthand observations by Mark Twain and Jack London as they witnessed the sport in 1872 and 1911.A far better book in every possible sense is Drew Kampion's exceptional Stoked: A History of Surf Culture (2003)."},{"Title":"Surfing: A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport","review":"I have this book in front of me and for the life of me I can't figure out why Mr. Barnes found it so repulsive that he gave it a one-star review. It's a perfectly good history, well-illustrated and well-written, of an ancient sport, part of an ancient culture that has all but disappeared. It's not a breathless \\"WOW, DUDE\\" account like the title \\"Stoked\\" that he seems so enamoured of, but it's a perfectly good and readable history. The illustrations range from pre-photographic era engravings to early photos up until the mid-fifties. The appendices, including essays by Mark Twain and Jack London, are fascinating.I guess if you can only read only words of one syllable, it might prove daunting (especially the Hawaiian terminology), but for the rest of us, it's just fine.

Since reading this book I've read his others as well. This is one of the finest books of poery I have read in the the last fifteen years.

American poetry lovers should arise en masse and demand his work be properly collected so we can read it easily.Until that day, buy this and his other books, and live with them for a while. You will be satisfied.And, hey, you two other poetry lovers in America (I define a poetry lover as someone who reads but does not write it), when you are ready to storm the modern bastille, call me, and I'll grab my Goban and smash it on some publisher's head. That will be fun."},{"Title":"Ruth-Esther (Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 9)","review":"(These comments apply to the section on Ruth, I have not read the section on Esther). This commentary is absolutely superb, not only for its exegesis and conclusions, but for its method. Bush makes full use of discourse analyses and modern linguistics, along with recent archaeology and the traditional canons of biblical criticism. It is easy to read and well argued . . . fun to read (if you could say such a thing about a technical commentary!). The author also hints at very good theological application for the modern preacher and christian. I wish more NT commentaries would carry this level of linguistic awareness."},{"Title":"A literature guide to The book of three: By Lloyd Alexander","review":"When i started this book i had no idea that it would lead me to read the next four. two thumbs up."},{"Title":"A literature guide to The book of three: By Lloyd Alexander","review":"The Book of Three is the first of the Chronicles of Prydain.

I used to believe that poetry was supposed to be un-understandable [stuff] with strange cadences, stupid rhyme schemes and bizarre capitalization. Tony's poems are deceptively easy to understand and they hit with the force of a punch to the gut. However, the ease with which they can be grasped, should not lead to the conclusion that there is not a hell of a lot more going on under the surface of these poems. There is.

Gordon has come to the orphanage where Maggie works to claim the young daughter he never knew he had. Maggie's innocence and distrust of the non-Irish and of new worldly situations are amplified to a point where I almost wanted to shake her and yell:\\" Get some courage, girl, and move on!!\\" But Eschenburg balances Maggie's fears and worries with honest reassurance in the form of Gordon, a man who has made serious mistakes in the past but now with Maggie's help, and that of his daughter Clare, hopes to make a new, full, peaceful life. I really, really enjoyed this book, even though it moved slowly. I loved Maggie and Gordon's relationship but secondary characters like Mother Bernadette and Father Fitz were brilliant and almost deserved stories of their own. The spurned girlfriend, Becca Hays, was a nasty piece of work and very well characterized. This book is highly recommended and offers no end of possible sequels: How about a story for Gordon's bachelor friend, Drew, who adopted young orphan Alice? Or perhaps a story of Jamie O'Connor, Maggie's brawny childhood friend? Or Clare? Gordy? It doesn't really matter what she writes - new author Kathleen Eschenburg will be an author I will keep my eye out for."},{"Title":"The Nightingale's Song","review":"New author Kathleen Eschenburg has penned a novel that is proof positive that her work is a superb addition to the romance genre. Ripe with emotion, complex characters, and a poignant love story, Ms. Eschenburg \`s debut is a read to be savored.In 1874 Baltimore, Maggie Quinn is a twenty-six-year-old teacher at St Columba's Orphanage. Orphaned at the age of twelve, when her mother died on board a ship from Ireland to America, Maggie found shelter with Father Fitzhugh at the Orphanage. Gordon Kincaid, a Virginia southern gentleman, visits St. Columba's to claim the child he never knew that he had. Five-year-old Clara is a special favorite with Maggie, who has nurtured the young girl since she was an infant. And Maggie is an enigma to Gordon, a man hardened by the brutalities of war, who sees a unique combination of naivet&eacute; and Irish backbone in Maggie.When Gordon asks Maggie to marry him and accompany him and his daughter to his Virginia estate, Maggie is completely unprepared for what she must face. There is Gordon's difficult twelve-year-old son from his first marriage, bigoted neighboring landowners, and their prejudiced society wives.While adjusting to her new life, Maggie is forced to face her past . Remembering that her real father never married her mother, ostensibly because of class differences, Maggie wonders if she can ever fit into Gordon's world without hurting him in the process.The complex pasts of the hero and heroine add depth to their many-layered personalities.

Fourteen years later, Maggie is mentor and teacher to the orphans there, contemplating becoming a nun -- until the day Dr. Gordon Kincaid comes to St. Columba's and turns Maggie's world upside down. One look at the debonair Dr. Kincaid confirms the parentage of Maggie's favorite orphan, five year-old Clara.Gordon Kincaid arrives at St. Columba's with a bequest from his late father only to find out that he fathered a child five years previously while involved in a brief affair. Gordon has been in limbo for ten years since losing his wife and receiving a severe injury in the Civil War. His body has healed, but not his soul. Then, he meets Maggie Quinn. Her gentle spirit, deep and abiding faith, angelic singing voice, and innocent sensuality call to him. As Gordon acquaints himself with his daughter, so, too, does he re-acquaint himself with his heart and soul.Maggie and Gordon are two melancholy people as different in class as any two people can be in that trying time of restoration after the Civil War. How they meet may be by chance, but the reader feels that fate definitely has a strong hand in bringing these two together. Clara is a delightful five year-old sprite who somehow knows she belongs with Gordon, but is not willing to give up &quot;her&quot; Maggie. Due to the evil gossip of a jealous suitor for Gordon's attentions, Gordon and Maggie marry and move to his estate in Virginia, where a whole new set of problems arises. However, these characters weather the storms, and their relationship develops to a whole new level. Secondary characters, from Father Fitzhugh, Maggie's rescuer all those years ago, to Gordon's twelve-year-old son from his previous marriage, all come together to enhance this intense love story.

However, a guardian angel arrives in the form of Father Hugh Fitzhugh, who gently takes the lass with him so she can live at St. Columbia's orphanage. Hugh promises to teach Mary how to play the harp if she provides him lessons on her fiddle.Fourteen years later, Maggie still lives in the orphanage, but now helps with the children. She especially feels an affinity to a frightened Clare. Civil War veteran Gordon Kincaid arrives at the orphanage looking for his lost daughter. He only recently learned that he had a child. The girl turns out to be Clare, who he wants to bring home with him. He pleads with Maggie to accompany them because she is the only person to connect with Clare. She agrees and soon Maggie's compassion reaches inside Gordon, who once disavowed love, but now struggles to tell her all that he feels for her.Using a powerfully vivid backdrop of the Reconstruction Era, THE NIGHTINGALE'S SONG is a wonderful historical romance starring three incredibly developed individuals who each steal apart of the reader's heart. The story line sings as the audience finds they want this couple to make it and for Clare to obtain happiness. Because the cast is so human, sub-genre fans will want to see Clare's tale told too from Kathleen Eschenburg.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Nightingale's Song","review":"I did enjoy this book, but it was very slow moving.

The member nations must decide whether Japan deserves a seat on the Security Council. Though most countries including the United States leans towards yes, strong opposition led by long time employer Toshio Hatanaka oppose Japan obtaining a seat.First Deputy in the Secretariat's Legal Affairs Sam Windrush feels pressure from his boss Patrick O'Connor and his girlfriend Jennifer Dale, aid to the American Ambassador to the United Nations. Both ask Sam to persuade the influential Toshio to drop his opposition. Not long afterwards, former NYPD official, now deputy of United Nations security Mike Jardine, informs Sam that Toshio lies dead in the basement of the United Nations' &quot;Turtle Bay&quot; building. NYPD cannot enter the facility to investigate the crime so Sam and Mike are assigned to do so. However, Sam's boss and other VIPs want Toshio's death declared a suicide, but the two intrepid sleuths think otherwise and continue to investigate with no support.DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY is an exciting look at the United Nations from a legal and police procedural story line. The tale is exciting and insightful as readers obtain a glimpse inside those &quot;eighteen acres&quot; of Manhattan that is not United States jurisdiction. Sam is a brave individual fighting to do the right thing against overwhelming odds that threaten him with his job, his life, and even through his daughter, a United nations guide.

Intent on catching the killer, Sam moves into action, even though his superiors want him to abandon the investigation.Since the murder has cast an uncertainty on the outcome of a high stakes assembly vote, the UN does not want anymore controversy, thus making Sam's investigation impossible. Battling various roadblocks set by everyone from his supervisor, and foreign ambassadors, to his lover, Sam realizes he is in way over his head, racing a clock that one wrong move could cost him his life.Not willing to give up, Sam continues on a maze of deception - where everyone is a suspect, every suspect has a hidden agenda, and all are protected by diplomatic immunity.

Creative plot with plausible yet surprising twists, and a peek into a place few have experience with. The downside is the style. It's all written in 1st person narrative, which is ok, but Sutherland writes the whole story in the present tense (with a few exceptions, which I assume are oversights). One has the sense that it was a 9th grade English assignment to have a whole story written in present tense to teach the kids about tense, or maybe it was done on a dare. In any case, it was very annoying, and I would have put it down early on if the story wasn't so interesting."},{"Title":"Diplomatic Immunity","review":"In his first novel, Grant Sutherland has produced a well-written, highly suspenseful (albeit slow-building) thriller about a murder that takes place at the United Nations. In addition to its well-developed plot,which is packed with twists and surprises, Sutherland's characters are believable and multi-dimensional. In many ways, Diplomatic Immunity reminds me of the early works by Robert Ludlum, which, to me, is a high compliment.

I'm very much looking forward to Sutherland's next book."},{"Title":"Diplomatic Immunity","review":"This is a supposed \\"thriller\\" that is actually a dull, dialogue ridden yawner with little action and uninteresting characters.

I read the descriptions on every box and bag in my cupboard before I resorted to complete the reading of this book.

And his lack of coding examples, typically 4 or 5 brief lines, shows this.As for his \\"complete\\" examples, e.g. of a calendar project, he waxes so obtuse with his OOP coding that, not only does the project not work, good luck in trying to fathom it! (I spent two fruitless days at this task and finally gave up. And I have already written and sold a commercial calendar/scheduler to various companies.)So, unless you are a programmer at the near genius level and you can extrapolate from coding samples like an Einstein at the chalk board with calculus & and a slide rule, the average programmer out there is going to need something much more basic than this book -- if he or she wants to explore the advanced topics it trys to present."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"This is a fairly long book at 858 pages.

Each chapter, 33 in all, is just long enough to be read in a day, and covers its topic extensively.I would call this an intermediate level PHP book. It goes beyond your beginning PHP books. Yes, it covers PHP and MySQL basics in the first two sections. And then, it gets into the meat of why your learning PHP and MySQL with major sections on \\"Planning Web Applications\\", \\"Implementing you Web Application, and three \\"Sample Projects.\\"What I thought this book added that the basic PHP books do not cover was a constant attention to web security. If security could be a problem in each section of the book, the security issue was explained, and the example showed you how to protect your application from the potential security problem. It also covered areas that are usually glossed over in beginning books, such as cookies & sessions, secure (encryped) layer, user authentication, error handling, form validation, and regular expressions.You can hardly go wrong with this book, it will give you a solid foundation for whatever you want to do in web development.

Hope have time soon to continue it."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"\\"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL\\" is an intermediate to advanced-level guide for programmers and developers. It bills itself as \\"everything one needs to know about building robust database applications\\". That is a bit of puffery but this is a comprehensive practical guide for designing and building production-quality, database-enabled applications.The author is an open-source platform expert and software developer. He comes from a background of working with standard desktop Windows-based applications and made the transition to building dynamic web applications. His experience in making the transition informs this book as a comprehensive explanation of how to use the various technologies that go into writing web applications. For those making similar transitions, this is a very fine presentation done by a thoughtful, systematic designer. For those already busy in the PHP/MySQL area, the advanced level of instruction is likely to be valuable.The emphasis is on open-source applications, particularly PHP5 and MySQL in an XHTML/Javascript environment. But, beyond technologies, the author's focus is on the strategies and systematic approach one needs to design and implement successful web applications. He writes for an advanced audience which is already basically familiar with programming and XHTML. Those writing or planning dynamic web applications will benefit most from the book.There are 33 chapters in five parts - basics of PHP, database basics, planning web applications, implementation, and sample projects. There are three appendices covering installation and configuration of PHP, MySQL, and other related open-source applications like Apache, a set of charts of database function equivalents among the leading database types - MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and a short list of recommended reading.This is a large format book of 912 pages, including index. My reviewer's copy is a prepublication version containing grayscale graphics and much white space, especially around the code snippets, making reading easy and comfortable. Although the material is high-level and technical, the writing seems light and casual. Wandschneider's writing style flows easily, never bogs down even with technical details, and the book reads much faster than one might expect.Although the best part of the book contains the three start-to-finish sample projects at the end - a calendar system, weblog engine, and e-commerce store, the lead-in chapters are nicely done, too. Chapters 1 and 2 are about getting started in PHP. There is a brief comparison to perl and C++, but the bulk is about PHP terminology and programming concepts. Much is made of PHP5's new object-oriented features, but the discussions of that here (and in Chapter 4) was about the only parts which I feel needed more clarity - the rest of the chapters are very clearly stated and contain plenty of good examples.Chapters 3 - 7 continue with scripting concepts like functions, classes, arrays, strings and characters. The discussion is not designed to instruct comprehensively about PHP itself but works on a higher level of showing how PHP interacts with MySQL and other technologies on an overall basis. You can get detailed PHP coding instructions elsewhere. Chapter 6 contains an unusually good discussion of character sets, usable for global applications, and provides instructions on configuring Unicode and multi-byte support for high-level applications.Part 2, Chapters 8 - 12, take the same approach to MySQL and databases in general. They include discussion of basic terminology and concepts, designing and creating databases, storing and retrieving data, PHP-to-database connectivity, and advanced topics, like use of \\"transactions\\" and advanced querying.Part 3, Chapters 13 - 17, deal with the server-side matters. Again, the level of presentation is not on comprehensive details of PHP, MySQL, and web services, but present a comprehensive overview to guide planning, design, and implementation. Here the author states overall design considerations of a website noting how to incorporate CSS, HTML, code libraries, user interfaces, and web services into a working dynamic website.User management and security concerns are noted throughout the book and Chapters 14 - 17 deal specifically with validation, and software and hardware security, including tips on how to secure your server. These passages on security are some of the better and clearest written I've experienced in this area.Part IV continues the systematic approach to website construction discussing error handling, debugging, cookies, and sessions (again some of the clearest explanations I've read), authorization, and data validation with regular expressions. Chapter 21 is entirely about globalization and localization that is, dealing with the fact that the Internet is global and that there is a need to deal with foreign language sets. There are tips on how to determine users' locations and how to script to account for different language sets, including Unicode.Chapters 23 and 27 are about XML and are especially useful now that XML and XHTML are becoming the reigning protocols of dynamic web activity. There is an extensive sample of using XML to work with the Google API. Using XML with PHP is an advanced topic and it is only generally covered here, together with XML web services and SOAP. Other chapters cover the use of extensions to PHP, like PEAR, developing a coding \\"style\\", creating test suites, configuring PHP.ini, and more. The three working examples are extensively commented and contain complete code examples.The book comes with a comparison CD-ROM containing all of the sample code, and versions of PHP5, MySQL, and Apache HTTP server."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"I had a blog reader email me today and ask if I knew of any good books on PHP and MySQL. Being that I'd like to learn more about both of those subjects myself, I recently had requested (and had sitting in my review pile) a copy of Core Web Application Development With PHP And MySQL by Mark Wandschneider. If you're focused on *application development* (rather than just learning how to create a dynamic page), then this book works pretty well...Contents:Part 1 - The Basics of PHP: Getting Started with PHP; The PHP Language; Code Organization and Reuse; Object-Oriented Programming; Working with Arrays; Strings and Characters of the World; Interacting with the Server - FormsPart 2 - Database Basics: Introduction to Databases; Designing and Creating Your Database; Using Databases - Storing and Retrieving Data; Using Databases - Advanced Data Access; PHP and Data AccessPart 3 - Planning Web Applications: Web Applications and the Internet; Implementing a User Interface; User Management; Securing Your Web Applications - Planning and Code Security; Securing Your Web Applications - Software and Hardware SecurityPart 4 - Implementing Your Web Applications: Error Handling and Debugging; Cookies and Sessions; User Authentication; Advanced Output and Output Buffering; Data Validation with Regular Expressions; XML and XHTML; Files and Directories; File Uploading; Working with Dates and Times; XML Web Services and SOAP; Using PEAR; Development and DeploymentPart 5 - Sample Projects and Further Ideas: Strategies for Successful Web Applications; An Appointment Manager; A Blogging Engine; An Ecommerce ApplicationAppendixes: Installation/Configuration; Database Function Equivalents; Recommended ReadingIndexI differentiated the type of learning at the start of this review on purpose. It's pretty easy to go into learning a new language focusing solely on the nuts and bolts of the syntax. That's really not the pattern that's followed with this book. You don't just learn how to add some PHP code to your page in order to display the time of day to the user. The goal here is to learn how to build an *application* instead of just a single dynamic page. The layout and flow of the book supports that goal well. You start with basic PHP concepts and syntax. Then you move on to basic database concepts that are used in MySQL (and in fact *any* relational database system). Once those two basic skill sets are covered, then the blending occurs. You start learning how to use PHP to read and store data in MySQL, and those concepts are then used to build an end-to-end application. Throw in the essentials of securing your application and making it bulletproof for users, and you have a pretty encompassing guide for a development professional to use.If PHP and MySQL were going to be something I used on a regular basis, I'd follow up this book with two specific titles for PHP and MySQL. Even though this Core title is large, there's no way it can cover all the details on either subject. And in reality, I don't think you'd want that if this is your first exposure. A practical volume such as this one will get you thinking correctly as far as design and techniques go, and then you can decide if this is where you want to commit your time and resources.Nicely done book, and one I'd recommend for your first PHP/MySQL experience. I'll be revisiting this book myself in 2006 in order to pick up a few more skills..."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"As a beginner seeking to develop as much beginning-to-intermediate knowledge and information about PHP and MySQL as possible in the coming two months, I went to local book stores to see all the titles offered on these two topics -- and to select the best.\\"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL\\" by Marc Wandschneider was the book I bought. -- [Jump down to later portions of this review if you don't want to read about how terrific the page layouts are.]This newly published title offers the perfect blend of depth, high readability, quality writing, and outstandingly handsome and clean page design and layout -- a significant attribute in the face of so many computer books on store shelves with layouts that are so cramped, ugly, cluttered and dense.Many computer books offer wasted galaxies of white space wrapped around text which itself has been reduced to microscopically small unreadability. In contrast, this book utilizes white space in perfect elegance and moderation. The typeface is never too tiny, and it changes frequently in helpful and readable ways. The author owes the editor and designer a high debt of gratitude for the rare and incredible job of page design.OK, Yes, the Contents: As a motivated beginner I cannot fully address the technical content itself (since I have yet to master it), but I recognize good books -- and well-written books -- when I see them. This is one. -- [Another review located here provides a detailed breakdown of the contents, chapter-by-chapter.]In my estimation, this book is targeted to the motivated beginner through high intermediate user, and I only say high intermediate because this generous book of 787 pages does not strive to be the super overly-complete master compendium bible on PHP and MySQL, but only a highly accessible and informative one, while still offering the reader a very nice learning curve for growth, challenge and involvement.The essence of this book is captured in this phrase: \\"Challenging content; invitingly written; easily digested.\\"The author is to be thanked for the wonderfully clear and straightforward foundational explanations he provides in the text before bringing readers into the heart of each chapter. Those central parts of each chapter are momentarily beyond my capacity, but the outstanding introductory material at the start of almost every chapter is an immensely useful service to the motivated beginner.Soon as I give myself a brush-up on X/HTML tags and some generic programming/coding concepts like functions and variables and calls and loops and conditionals and arrays, this beginner will be nicely prepared to dig most productively into this terrific new offering of a book.PS -- If the beginner is not striving to be \\"super system administrator supreme,\\" then by adding the above book to these several others below, he/she will have a great beginning collection by which to get a confident handle on MySQL and PHP programming concepts and skills:-- Learning PHP 5 by David Sklar (O'Reilly)-- PHP 5 in easy steps by Mike McGrath (Barnes & Noble!)-- MySQL Essential Skills by John Horn/Michael Grey (McGraw Hill/Osborne)-- MySQL Complete Reference -- Vikram Vaswani (McGraw Hill/Osborne)Yes, I do know what the super-comprehensive \\"bibles\\" on MySQL/PHP are, and some are very successful and I may use some of them in future, but I find that I usually NEVER read \\"the big bibles\\" all the way through.In contrast, you (if a beginner) will definitely enjoy reading the above five volumes ALL the way through, especially this delicious title at hand: \\"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL\\" by Marc Wandschneider."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"I am an experienced web developer.

Not only is it a complete guide to PHP and MySQL, but it's written in such a clear way that someone who has never programmed before, could write a mature and robust web application, using this book. I have read a lot of technical books and this one is top notch. The code snippets and diagrams are first rate. Marc writes in a clear conversational style, with a great sense of humor, that makes the concepts very easy to understand."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"Divided into five sections this book attempts to cover pretty much everything you need to know to develop web based applications with PHP and MySQL. Part one goes over the basics of PHP including data types, variables, functions, object-oriented programming, arrays, and forms. The second part the looks at databases including designing, creating, and using a database. It includes a very good section on the basics of database design. This part ends with a chapter that brings these first two sections together by examining how to use PHP to access your database. Now that you understand how PHP and MySQL are going to work together the author turns to how to design web applications including the user interface and user management. Of course he also looks at code security and other security issues for web applications. This is the part of planning that should occur before any code is written. It helps tremendously if you know what you are trying to achieve before writing code and this part of the book covers how to do that very well. The fourth part examines how to implement your web application and covers error handling, cookies, authentication, buffering, validation, regular expressions, XML, XHTML, working with files and directories, and deploying the application. Finally the last part is filled with sample projects including an appointment manager, blogging engine, and an eCommerce application. All the source code from the book is included on a CD-ROM so you can cut and paste and adapt to your needs. An excellent guide for programmers working with PHP and MySQL enabled web sites, Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"I have had bad luck with the core series of books in the past, they are in desperate need of both a copywriter/spellchecker, and technical fact checker. However this was a very pleasant surprise - it suffered from neither of the above mentioned problems . the author covered topics most other books cover i.e., Unicode handling, Security, and his explanation of OOP in PHP is the best I have ever read.I would recommend this book to anyone planning to write PHP."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated \\"no-experience\\" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"The reason for the book's length is that the author is attempting to cover a lot of ground. There are comprehensive and separate descriptions of PHP and MySQL. Keep in mind that each has multiple books devoted to it. The PHP section has a good emphasis on object oriented coding. This can be vital if you have a large PHP code body, for using OO helps code scale to larger sizes.The MySQL section of the text is also nontrivial. Amongst other things, it describes how to design and create a database. Ideas that are largely independent of MySQL, though they can be, and are, implemented in it, in the text.Of course, the main attraction of the book is in combining PHP and MySQL. Here, the book goes into how to make a multitier architecture, from the client side to the database. Chapter 14 on writing the user interface is a little skimpy. But other chapters on the server side issues have more detail on their subjects. Which includes a chapter on XML. Quite aside from PHP or MySQL, knowing how to use XML can be important to you.The book even finds time to cover Web Services and how you might implement and interact with these, using PHP."},{"Title":"Core Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL","review":"All computer books should be written like this.This is a very conscise, well written book that leaves no stone unturned on the subject matter and is presented in short, complete chapters that allow you quickly build up useable modules of knowledge on PHP & MySQL while building up to a complete understanding by the end.This is a great place to start on PHP & MySQL and will serve as a great ongoing reference for a long time to come."},{"Title":"El Amante Perfecto: Tao del Amor y el Sexo (Spanish Edition)","review":"Felicitaciones al autor por una excelente obra!Estramadamente coherente y bien concebida, esta obra ense&ntilde;a los pasos para llegara ser el amante perfecto."},{"Title":"The Corrs: The Chord Songbook","review":"I thought it's a score book, just like &quot;The Corrs / The Corrs&quot;, but I am totally wrong."},{"Title":"The Corrs: The Chord Songbook","review":"This book is perfect in every way.

Mr. Butler insightfully applies Darwinian theory to paradigm changes in the growth of technology. It provides seminal material on the question of artificial intelligence and precedes the work of Turing. Without this book Frank Herbert could not have written the Dune series. (Obviously, Frank's son and publisher of the posthumous work have never read it...)Butler's critique on the utility of the Anglican clergy while preceding the revival fostered by C.S. Lewis continues to haunt us today on the general need for religion since the Enlightenment. His prescient critique of the general failure of doctrines such as \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" reminds one of the questions of freedom and vice that Ibsen relates so viscerally in \\"Hedda Gabler\\" and the problems inherent in hypocritical positions.A short, entertaining, and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Erewhon, as a satire and/or essay, is interesting and has some thought provoking ideas. Erewhon as a novel has a fairly thin but still interesting plot line in an intriguing environment. Unfortunately, meshing the two of these together makes for a difficult book to swallow at times.I enjoyed the thought provoking elements of the satire that Butler presents. He turns the world upside down in order to have us explore just how \\"civilized\\" we truly are. He maintains the same basic structure...that a society should have a government with laws that people can be punished for, education to help them in society, religion to help with their conscience. However, he turns all of these \\"normal\\" conventions on their heads to get us to think not about the conventions themselves, but about the way we approach them.For example, instead of being punished for what we crimes (theft, murder, etc.), the people of Erewhon are punished if they fall physically ill...sometimes being imprisoned or even sentenced to death. And conversely, if a person finds himself in the throes of robbery or some other 'crime', he is instead consoled and properly treated for the recovery of this behavior and looked on with sympathy from friends and family. In this satirical move, Butler asks us to examine our treatment of criminals. The Erewhonians provide rehabilitation for liars, thieves and murderers while simply shutting away those who commit \\"crimes\\" of physical illness. While we profess to offer rehabilitation for our criminals, what good does it do to stick them in an 8x8 box for years and then throw them out on the street with a black mark on their \\"permanent record?\\" Which system is better for helping with crime? As to illness, the Erewhonian treatment of illness is definitely ludicrous, but to a small degree it has logic in that it quarantines the truly ill and it also cuts down on people feigning illness or complaining over small headaches. In Erewhon, there is truly very little illness and no 'calling in sick', or making an excuse of \\"I've got a headache.\\"Butler also satirizes religious devotion (he alludes to religion in terms of the different types of money in the kingdom...the \\"religious\\" type having no earthly value yet being esteemed as of great personal worth...and yet citizens of Erewhon barely go through the motions with the 'religious' currency and have a completely different value system for each type of currency).His lengthiest satirical discourse is with regards to the idea of consciousness. He takes it to the absurd (at least for his day) by suggesting a world in which machines would become self-aware and potentially overthrow mankind as the dominant race (a la Terminator or others). We're not there yet, but I think Butler would have a coronary if he saw how today's technology compared of that ~120 years ago. While the discussion on consciousness has some holes, it's also intriguing, especially when looking at the advancements of the last hundred years. He makes some good arguments and it's interesting to transition those arguments into the natural world and look at the advancements of mankind as a race or of other animals out there. The rise of consciousness or self-awareness is a very interesting topic. I'd be interested to read more of his thoughts since in the book he basically opens the can of worms and sets it on a shelf.So in terms of the satire, Butler brings forth some interesting ideas.In terms of the plot, it's a fairly basic adventure novel of the nineteenth century...a man in a distant British colony seeks fame and fortune through exploration and hopefully finding either a place to gain more wealth or to find savages to convert to Christianity or both. The first 50-100 pages contain standard Victorian descriptions of the landscapes and the travels. While poetic and pretty, they did drag on and I wanted to skip beyond them. As our narrator finally gets closer to Erewhon, his travels actually have some drama unfold. Once he finally arrives at the city, he's initially thrown into prison and has some moderate adventure.The \\"adventures\\" he has in the country of Erewhon are very lightweight in terms of adventure. The level of excitement is pretty bland since it is often broken up by dozens of pages of satirical essay exploring strange elements of Erewhonian culture. Again, this is moderately typical of 19th century literature, but I was hoping for a bit more in terms of action within Erewhon itself. The \\"story\\" of the book could probably take ~1/3 of the pages (with probably a third of those devoted to description of the countryside and his initial travels) with the remaining 2/3 being devoted to thoughtful discourse on the various absurdities of society.All in all, this was an interesting and thought provoking book...but I would've preferred the abridged version and/or simply reading the \\"essays\\" as essays rather than having them interjected into an adventure novel.***2 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Erewhon, like Butler's other (magnificient and far more effective) novel The Way of All Flesh, is rife with social satire. The optimistic and devout explorer trots out all kinds of European imperialist platitudes and, as with most satirical characters, is almost totally one-dimensional. Most other characters- noble savages, squaws, and other racist or bigoted archetypes, are fodder for the author's wit more than flesh and blood. This would be fine if the satire were as proficient as, say, Voltaire's, but it is not.As others have mentioned, the \\"justice\\" system in Erewhon whereby the sick are punished and criminals rehabilitated to health is the main punchline. In a short story this concept would have been brilliant but the length of the book grinds the joke into the ground well before the narrative draws to a close. It's a joke with a punchline that doesn't justify the extravagant buildup."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Aside from the possibility you will find this online, it is great to have either way. I wouldn't consider it better than Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (which is entirely different in structure,) however for a utopean novel it is pretty good. You should be able to sit down and read it all at once, as it is not only pretty short but also reads very quickly. The flow of the novel is sometimes very aesthetic and more visually oriented in discription. The author also writes from his experience in New Zealand (with story involving description of sheep, etc.) It wasn't necessarily a brilliant book, though it was more enjoyable than many books you'll find."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"\\"In this privately published work (1872), written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, English novelist, essayist, and iconoclast Samuel Butler (1835-1902) describes an imaginary visit to a topsy-turvy country called Erewhon (an anagram of \\"nowhere\\"), where it is a punishable offense to be physically ill, but where criminality and immorality are looked kindly upon as treatable diseases. The English church is pilloried in the system of 'Musical Banks,' whose currency nobody believes in but which everyone pretends to value. Universities teach courses on how to say nothing at great length, and all machines have been banned for fear that they will develop through evolution and enslave the citizens. In this and other classic works, including The Way of All Flesh, Butler delighted in attacking the complacency and hypocrisy of Victorian manners and religion.\\""},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Originally published in 1872 and now billed as the \\"second great satire of the nineteenth century,\\" Erewhon is a critique of Victorian society. In it, a British man comes across a never-before discovered society (which he is convinced is the lost tribes of Israel).Erewhon has no plot to speak of. Here is its pattern: Butler gives us a bizarre scenario that seemingly makes no sense, takes us through it, and finally explains its parallel to Victorian life. Then this repeats. This is the whole book, book-ended by forty pages of setup (most of which is unnecessary) and a convenient and tidy ending. As such, the reader may feel like he is reading a work on nonsense philosophy rather than a work of fiction.This is not to say that there is nothing worthwhile here. Occasionally, there are flashes of brilliance, and there are some thought-provoking elements. Erewhonians, for example, treat the sick like criminals and treat criminals like they have diseases. In a modern-day version, perhaps, those who have self-inflicted poor health, like some of the obese and diabetic, would be considered criminal.On the whole, working through the philosophical meanderings of Butler's scenarios is tedious. It certainly does not help that many aspects of Victorian society are now foreign to us. Erewhon hasn't held up. Stick with Swift.NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"'Erewhon' has all the makings of a great book. Written during the stifling Victorian era, 'Erewhon' is about a fictitious land where society and government behave in ways counter to (the then) modern thinking. For example, machinery of nearly all form is viewed with contempt. And being physically sick is a criminal offense. Etcetera, etcetera. Too bad this 'Brave New World' predecessor wasn't produced by a more a capable writer.So what is wrong with 'Erewhon'? For starters, almost no effort is spent on character development. The leading character, who narrates 'Erewhon', is a young British man .. and that's the extent we know of him. And there is scant plot development. After our young Brit finds himself in Erewhon he really doesn't do much other than lecture the reader on the odd Erewhonian customs. After a short while it gets a bit boring. Mercifully, 'Erewhon' is a short novel.Bottom line: its creative premise is wasted by poor writing. A miss."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"A novel similar in concept to \\"Gulliver's Travels\\", this novel leads us to the unexplored country, for Europeans anyway, of Erewhon. Through the eyes of the unnamed English protagonist, Erewhon serves as a satire to the Victorian society in existence when this book was penned. Erewhon delivers harsh criticisms of certain valued institutions, yet it lacks the pertinence and timelessness of a truly great novel.Granted, \\"Erewhon\\" was written in the 1870s, at the height of Victorian society in England. The protagonist wanders into the undiscovered country of Erewhon, which at first glance seems to be a utopia. However, the true nature of Erewhon is revealed, where a set of perverse and absurd laws govern the citizens and keep then in a static state of existence. Illnesses are crimes, whereas \\"moral\\" sins (such as embezzlement) are treated sympathetically as a sickness. Although they had been technologically advanced, all \\"modern\\" (think steam engines) machinery has been outlawed lest the machines will evolve and eventually rule the world, a la \\"The Matrix.\\"Butler leads the reader into an alternate vision of reality in his land of Erewhon. The Church of England and religion in general are ridiculed by the Erewhonians beliefs, or lack of, in their own deities. The idea of imperialism and colonization for the benefits of the natives is rendered absurd, as the protagonist dreams of enslaving the Erewhonians to a \\"religious\\" sugar plantation owner for their own good (at least, I hope Butler was not serious). The aristocracy and treatment of the poor are indirectly ridiculed in the Erewhonian emphasis on aesthetics and wealth above all else. Vegetarians are satirized in a prophet's misguided treatise on how animals are similar to people. The anti-machinists and anti-progress activists are dealt a blow in the rambling, non-sensical diatribe on the diabolical humanization of machines. In addition, higher education is criticized as a bastion of singular thought where original ideas are discouraged and pompous professors profess to know everything (some things never change).Unfortunately, many of the criticisms are too obsolete for the modern reader. A central parody, the \\"Musical Banks\\", refers to an outdated process of money-changing in the English church, a reference sure to allude most readers (I needed to research it myself to see what the #@*&! Butler was alluding to). The idea that the Erewhonians are the \\"lost tribes\\" of Israel also seems to repute logic, as this country is presumably in New Zealand. The last third of the book, save the conclusion, contains a lengthy treatise on the anti-machine movement, followed by another on animals, and then plants. The anti-machine essay, in particular, is convoluted, contrived, and seems to never end, a sleep inducer if there ever was one.\\"Erewhon\\" certainly would have been provocative and controversial in the era it was written. However, it has lost some potency over time. Yet, if you can gloss over the \\"Book of Machines\\" chapters, then \\"Erewhon\\" provides a delightful andlight-hearted look into the window of the Victorian mindset and one author's attempt to bring awareness of the ills of his society."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"It is interesting to read the &quot;Terminator-esque&quot; fears of 19th century scholar/writers like Butler.

On this note and this note only, Butler is not dated at all."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"I have just reread Samuel Butler's Erewhon, a book described by Lewis Mumford as having 'a sunny malice'. Personally I don't find anything malicious in this tale. He does stand just about every taken for granted convention of Victorian society (and the world still) on its head, and has great fun doing it, but the end result is to force the reader to think long and hard about much that is usually accepted without thinking.In Erewhon, criminals are considered to be ill and are 'treated' by 'straightners' who make them well, whereas those who have physical illnesses (or suffer bad luck) are considered criminal and are tried and punished. Thus an embezzler will be treated for his 'illness' and the party who was robbed will be tried in the Court of Misplaced Confidence. The consistency with which Butler carries through with this conceit is impressive and consistently entertaining, and this is only one of the 'curious' conventions of Erewhonian society.My favorite part of the novel is the section that purports to be a classic text from the College of Unreason, 'The Book of the Machines'. Modeled on Darwin's writings, this text explains how machines are on an evolutionary track that will surpass and then come to dominate their human creators. The detail of the argument is impressive (the discussion of 'vestigial organs' in machines is hysterical and accurate), and no matter how far fetched it must have seemed in 1872 when the book was published, it seems much less a satire and more a serious fear today.This is a book of great intelligence and wicked humor. As a simultaneous mind stretching exercise and laugh generating experience I can think of few novels of any age that are its peer."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Samuel Butler does a neat balancing act with &quot;Erewhon,&quot; a novel that is equal parts fictitious travelogue, philosophical tract, social/political/religious satire, and adventure story complete with a romantic subplot. The protagonist, a young Englishman named Higgs who is unsatisfied with employment prospects in his home country, moves to a distant colonized land where he takes a job as a shepherd. Beyond a mountain range there lie some mysterious lands that he would like to explore, and, setting out one day with a timid guide who later abandons him, he eventually gets to the other side of the peaks and finds himself in an isolated country named Erewhon.One of the first things Higgs notes is that Erewhon is a few hundred years behind the times technologically. They have no modern mechanical conveniences, and when Higgs is discovered to own a watch, it is confiscated and he is put in prison. Later released and placed into the custody of a rich man named Mr. Nosnibor, Higgs learns all about the bizarre customs and beliefs of the Erewhonians.In Erewhon, sickness is punishable by law and criminal acts are treated medically by people called &quot;straighteners&quot;; so, stealing a pair of socks is analogous to feeling a bit under the weather. The Erewhon banking system is a facade, as their money is worthless. The Erewhonians believe in an ethereal prenatal world where babies are given the (preferred) option not to be born into the mortal world. Their institutions of higher education, the Colleges of Unreason, teach conformity and resist originality and progress. Most importantly, they condemn technological advancement because of the fear that machines will continue evolving so rapidly that they will eventually develop a consciousness, out-evolve man, and take control of the world. Imagine how the Erewhonians would have despaired over the realization of artificial intelligence!How have the Erewhonians arrived at all of these beliefs? Higgs concludes that their belief system is a result of gullibility -- they tend to put their faith in anybody who comes up with a convincing argument for whatever agenda he's trying to push. They don't analyze, question, or challenge; they just accept the status quo until somebody with a big mouth (but not necessarily a big brain) decides the status quo needs to be changed. In this way, one man who thinks killing animals is wrong convinces the people to become vegetarians; another man who likes meat convinces the people that killing plants is an even greater sin.This book has a lot of targets, some not all that obvious, but I think Butler was prophesying a world in which demagoguery takes the place of common sense and reason, a world through which he was satirizing organized religion, sentimental notions of familial sanctity, and the complacency of the Victorian middle class. I've also read &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; but I find &quot;Erewhon&quot; to be a better representative of Butler's skewering cynicism and sly humor."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"I felt honour-bound to review this Victorian English Book as it surely must have been an inspiration to later authors such as Kafka and Orwell. A 'gulliver-esque' tale is told wherein a traveller chances upon a strange world where the conventional rules of our society are turned upon their head - the ill are sent to prison and criminals are given pity &amp; understanding. Despite the age of the book, it is not a difficult read, and is very underrated (or perhaps just overlooked?)"},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Following in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels,&quot; the English novelist, essayist, and iconoclast Samuel Butler published &quot;Erewhon&quot; privately in 1872. The title is an anagram of &quot;Nowhere,&quot; which is the literal translation of the word &quot;Utopia,&quot; the title by which Thomas More's 1516 work has commonly become known. &quot;Erewhon&quot; is arguably the first anti-utopian or dystopian novel, anticipating the later and better known works such as Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; Whereas More and other utopianists are primarily interested in attacking society's ills and making the world a better place, the anti-utopians engage primarily in either satire of the society in which they live or in making dire predictions about the dismal fate that awaits humanity. Butler is most decidedly in the former category, since he proves in not only &quot;Erewhon&quot; but also his more famous work, the semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; that his main concern is in attacking the complacency and hypocrisy he saw infecting Victorian society.Like More's island of Utopia, Butler's Erewhon is a remote kingdom, not to be found on any map, which is discovered by the narrator of the novel (biographers of Butler have assumed it is modeled on a part of New Zealand, which anyone who has viewed the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies can attest has some spectacular landscapes). Cut off from the rest of the world, the citizens of Erewhon lives according to their own rules and dictates. Butler breaks from the tradition of creating an idealized world that goes back from More to Plato in favor of a more realistic society. In Butler's world there is still money, and both the rich and the poor still exist; there is even a monarchy in charge. It is when we notice strong parallels between Erewhon and the members of Victorian society that we start to see Butler's true purpose.Hypocrisy is rampant in Erewhom, where citizens think nothing of agreeing with things they do not believe in and their friends know that they are doing so. While the citizens pretend to worship deities that are the personification of lofty human qualities such as love, justice, and hope, they really worship a goddess, Ydrgun, and the Church of England is transformed into the sytem of &quot;Musical Banks.&quot; As Butler hits his stride in this novel he creates a topsy-turvy world where illness is treated as a crime (there are no physicians in the country) and criminal behavior, such as theft, are seen as minor weaknesses in character.Unlike Francis Bacon's utopian work &quot;The New Atlantis,&quot; where science was seen as the salvation of humanity that would correct all ills and provide all necessities, Butler's world has outlawed machinery because they might one day become the masters rather than the servants of humanity. Clearly Butler was no more enamored of the Industrial Revolution than he was of Victorian society. In many ways this is the section of &quot;Erewhom&quot; where Butler makes his most cogent arguments. It is also the point where the book's narrator, whose initial attitude of admiration turns to one of surprise, now beocmes one of condemnation as the eccentricities of the citizens of Erewhon are fully revealed. Ultimately, the shortcomings Butler sees in them are the same of which he accuses British society, politics, and religion.Because Butler is satirizing Victorian society his value to modern readers remains inferior to that of Huxley and Orwell, not to mention Edward Bellamy (&quot;Looking Backward 2000-1887&quot;) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (&quot;We&quot;). However, in many ways &quot;Erewhon&quot; is a pivotal novel in the history of utopian literature, not only because of how it follows and breaks away from More's original work and how it sets the stage for what other forgotten writers of dystopian fiction, such as Alexander Bogdanov (&quot;Red Star&quot;) and even Jack London (&quot;The Iron Heel&quot;). &quot;Erewhon&quot; remains one of those novels where its historical significance outweighs its literary appeal."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"This satire still has all its teeth, despite being over 125 years old. The plot has its protagonist setting out to explore regions that have not yet been explored - i.e., explored by Europeans, i.e. explored by anyone who counts. He finds the remarkable country of Erewhon, with its many odd ways.Most of those odd ways exaggerate the social ills that Butler saw in his own society. The Erewhonians are overtly fascinated with physical beauty and health, to the point of treating ugliness or disease as criminal offenses. (Our own fascination with looks differs not in kind but in degree, and maybe not such a large degree.) Theft and embezzlement are treated as minor quirks, more like habits to be broken than real crimes. (Well, our business pages read like a police blotter most days.)Butler skewers the church, by redrawing it as a sort of bank. It's an odd bank, though. Everyone feels they should do business there, but very few do except so they can be seen doing it. It has its own currency, but a currency that can't buy anything and that even its own cashiers treat casually. The Erewhonians all hold it to be the most wonderful of institutions, but hold it in complete disregard in their day to day activities - does this sound at all familiar?He also takes on vegetarians, an anti-machine sentiment that seems to have gone out of fashion, and especially higher education. That last, or UnReason as he calls it, is his primary target of ridicule. I'll let you read the details for yourself, but the points that Butler attacks are still a part of modern academia. In fact, those malfunctions of purpose have spread out of the universities and into our grade schools.Butler's worst exaggerations are saved for the protagonist himself, however. The last chapter has the hero escape from Erewhon. He intends to return with a team of missionaries who will convert that nation of heathens, to the greater glory of god and gold. He is quite specific in the armament that will be used to ease the process. He also details how the Erewhon nation would be turned over to slave-holders for enforced religious instruction (and to turn a quick buck). Butler takes on the very worst of The White Man's Burden, and sinks it under its own miserable weight.This is a brief book, but very worthwhile. It stands well next to Gulliver's Travels as a partner in satire. It also works well against utopias like Shangri-La, by taking the same premises and working them in the opposite way. I recommend this classic to any thinking reader.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"This can be considered probably the first \\"modern\\" dystopian novel. It is about a European settler in a faraway colonial country who stumbles into the yet-unexpored mountain range to find the civilisation of Erewhon. These are very strange people who have knowingly cut themselves off from the world. In the tradition of Swift (in terms of the satirical picaresque-like novel), Butler describes the amazing society of Erewhon and the narrator's interations with it.There are many features but two main ones are anti-technology and ethics. In terms of technology, the Erewhonians have deliberately destroyed all machines over a certain level of development because they see machines as the next evolutionary stage, one that will take over (or even already HAS), albeit in a very different form to intelligent life as we know it. In ethics, they reverse the moral status of crime and disease, with interesting consequences.Many would find Butler's style overbearing. It does seem like the tell-and-not-show prose of Swift without enough literary merit to make it work. However, it shows that even prose we'd otherwise find ridiculous can be great if part of a novel of ideas. Part of the reason for this being a frustrating read is that we're never sure what side Butler's on - the society of Erewhon is meant to be a satire on the alleged illogic of our own institutions, but then he turns around and satirises the new society as well, as well as his satire of it all etc etc. This however keeps the perspective interesting, whereas if the novel pinned down Butler's opinion easily, we would just disagree and put the book down.This is a very interesting, thought-provoking and important book. It's not great literature (in fact it grew out of several of Butler's articles and letters to the editor!) but it is an amazing artifact. This is because the things it is about (technology and intelligence, meta-ethics, the rights of people/animals/vegetables, the purpose of the education system) are ones that have been pertinent throughout this century and will continue to be so - which isn't bad for what's quite managably a one day read!"},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"I bought this book expecting strait social satire. It turns out that the first five chapters are more of an adventure story through a jungle, and are really quite boring. If I could re-edit the book today I would cut them out. When we finally enter Erewhon, the story and the satire pick up, and the read is much more pleasant. Then, unexpectedly, about two-thirds of the way into the book, it becomes a very interesting science fiction tale of why the Erewhonians abandoned technology for fear that the machines would evolve into intelligent, conscious, thinking machines able to reproduce and replace man at the top of the evelutionary ladder! I was pleasantly surprised by this because science fiction is my favorite genre, and in all my reading I've never heard of this concept being thought of more than 130 years ago!If you can get through the first five chapters, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"As all good social satirists do, Samuel Butler turns the world on its ear as he lambastes the hypocrisies of his day, inspired by a close reading of Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. The narrator Higgs, discovers a previously unknown country beyond the mountains, in which live an unusual race of people. Jailed as a trespasser, he is tended to by the kindly Yram, who only becomes displeased with him when he says he feels ill. It's shortly after this that we learn that in Erewhon illness is considered a crime which can be severely punished (doctors prescribe flogging instead of medicines). Crime, however, is merely an annoyance that should be tolerated and pitied. These people believe that man goes through life backwards, that the soul is most mature before birth. In school, only useless things are taught. Machines are evil and have been outlawed, while animals, as living things, can never be killed, not even for food. Vegetables have this same inherent right, but since this would mean starvation for the Erewhonians, they have bent the rules a little not to include vegetables (all morality is relative). Higgs finally plans his escape in a hot-air balloon, which he does, with Arowhena, one of the native women, in tow.The trick in a book like this is to make the satire, the craziness, as believable as possible, while keeping the point of attack sharp and biting. Butler pulls this off admirably. The Darwinian connection or the hypocrisies that existed in Victorian England might be lost on some, but the images of being flogged for an illness or being thought suspicious for having a watch, among others, are hard to forget. Worth checking out."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"Samuel Butler's 'Erewhon' is a tale of a simple shepherd who travels too far in his foreign country, (unnamed, but based on New Zealand), only to find another, hidden Country where the sick are imprisoned and the criminal are 'healed'. This previously unknown society is described in detail as to its workings, and seems irrational in its execution.People you will meet in the travels and travails of this poor lost fellow are of various interesting sorts; including the straighteners, who are doctors for the criminally ill. Our shepherd, visits the musical bank, the College of Unreason, and in detail describes how the people of Erewhon dress and act.The book was written, in part, to be a criticism of Victorian England, but really stands as a literary classic. Certainly provides amusing entertainment, it is also an interesting look at society in general. Highly recomended for C.S. Lewis and Tolkien fans, this book is indispensable as is the sequel, 'EREWHON REVISITED'."},{"Title":"Erewhon","review":"I decided to read Erewhon because we were going to New Zealand, and I thought it appropriate to have read some its (outdated) literature. (This being said, I still have a couple of others NZ books to read.)Erewhon is the \\"second great satire of the nineteeth century\\" (followingGulliver's Travels). It follows Higgs as he travels to and meets the Erewhonians and their bizarre double-standards and lack of reason. It is meant as satire against Victorian culture. The only problem with this is that much can be lost on an unsuspecting and unknowing reader (I think in particular of The Musical Banks--something that did not resonate with me).Butler humorously treats religion, education, technology, diet, crowd mentality, criminal justice, currency, health, pregnancy--all skewed through the light (dark?) of a culture that sees logic in a backward way, against typical western mindsets. He crafts grand mythologies and prophets, provenances for the strange ways. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on machines, vegetarianism, and unreason.I will admit it took me a fair amount to slog through it (my ancient mass market paperback with minute and fading text may partially be to blame).--- ---Select quotes:Diet:-- \\"What is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it, and tend it, and lull it into security, for the express purpose of killing it?

The translation, the glossary and the introductions are what make this edition great. As to what makes this book great... it is a very telling story of the history of the time in Turkey. The characters come alive and pass us by as we turn the pages and the reader becomes a part of the epic. While reading the story I felt like I was in Turkey and was turning my head to see where the noises were coming from only to be included in the daily lives of so many very well developed characters...."},{"Title":"Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse","review":"Writing poetic prose and prosaic poetry and allowing the reader to discover the joy of reading such writing is the sign of a good writer. The ability to load humble every day words with so much meaning and emotion is the sign of an exceptional writer. The ability to do this for a long epic poem without losing the interest and attention of the reader is the sign of a great writer.Usually only the names of good poems are remembered or some stanzas, a line or two, or four, an interesting name like Madame Sosostris, or sounds that tintinnabulate, a general meaning or such. Here we remember a gamut of characters, normal, standard, everyday people who come to mind and disappear again to be remembered once more on another day of introspection or remembrance or association. They are not that special, their names are not strange or funny. They board a train, travel and leave. They remember, reminisce, talk, complain, brag, lie, cry like all people do. But they are sometimes you and sometimes others that you already know although the time is 1941 and you were possibly not even born then.It has been so short since Nazim hikmet wrote his epic, just as it has been very short since the tragedies of Aeschylus were written or the comedies of Aristophanes, or the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare. Time stands still for the common man as it does for kings and cabbages. But Nazim Hikmet's train continues on its never ending journey and will do so as long as a single copy of this book remains for someone to read.And a special note of thanks for the translators. I have read it in both Turkish and English and must say that I enjoyed it equally. They have done a great job."},{"Title":"Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse","review":"Nazim Hikmet's great Epic Poetry is written in simple lines that carry more than they seem.

Human Landscapes is a masterpiece of his humanist side."},{"Title":"Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse","review":"Are you ready for a 465 page poem? So much are readers seemingly put off by poetry that most of what you get these days are collections of short poems in thin books that cost more than a novel and have spines so thin you can barely read the title.Actually, this English translation of Turkey's world writer, Nazim Hikmet, wiitten in free verse splayed across the page likeNaked nude, is no more a challenging read than a novel of the same length.Hikmet wrote this poem while in prison, where he was tossed after it was learned that Turkish soldiers were reciting his poems. You get a panoramic look of Turkey from the 1880's up to World War II, and a picture of humanity that is universal. The structure of this epic novel in verse is a train ride across Turkey with passengers telling their stories, Some of the passengers are prisoners being transferred.The multitude of stories told have an earthiness a bit like Chaucer's epic, the Canterbury tales, and the structure of a group of people traveling and telling stories is the same. War is a major subject, as with Homer and Virgil. In Hikmet you hear the stories of both the rich and the poor. An American friend of mine who lives in Turkey tells me he can discuss poetry with waiters in a restaurant. Poetry is still important to that culture. You get that sense reading Hikmet. Unlike Pound's unfinished Cantos, which he could never get to cohere and which tend to be elitist, Hikmet's epic lives in the salt of the earth."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"This book (originally published in 1900) is split in two sections. In the first 100 pages, the life of Chopin is discussed by Huneker in a very colorful and poetic style, although unfortunately very few biographical facts are revealed. When I finished this section I felt I had hardly learned anything new about Chopin.The next 150 pages deal with Chopin's music, in which Huneker comments briefly on every one of Chopin's compositions (with the exception of several pieces unknown to Huneker), categorized by type (Ballades, Preludes, etc.). This section, like the first, is amusing but not very helpful. The author never really goes into great depth about any single piece. Instead he simply says a word or two on mood or style, often quoting authorities such as Kullak and Niecks, and compares several major editions of the work. I would recommend this to someone very interested in editorial details... anyone else could probably do without most of this section.People familiar with Chopin should find Huneker's writing somewhat enlightening, though far from substantial. Those looking for an introduction to Chopin may find the first section very helpful, if they can tolerate the author's verbosity."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Huneker was an aspiring concert pianist (as well as a brilliant writer), and his analysis of Chopin's music and poetry are simply amazing. Like Chopin, Huneker expresses from the heart and hears the music at a whole new level. His interpretation is raw and as full in energy as the music itself (especially for etude op.25 no.11 and the ballade no.1)."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Who can count themselves learned in Chopin who has not read Huneker's wonderful, purple-prosy, unabashedly romantic examination of the Polish Master's music? If the musicology is a tad dated, the enthusiasm, the sheer love of music present on every page, are more evident than ever. This is absolutely essential reading for the Chopin lover."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"The biography is very disappointing, the musical descriptions are poetic but don't get into much detail. If you want a general feel for Chopin's music but don't want intricate musical detail, the descriptions of the pieces may suit your need. That's the only reason I didn't give this book the lowest possible rating.For biographical info, \\"Chopin in Paris\\" by Tad Szulc is much more informative and accurate. Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \\"analysis\\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \\"The melody seems literally to wail..\\", \\"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\\", \\"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \\"Volcanic mutterings these!\\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \\"The Chopin Companion..\\" which can be found \\"used\\" at Amazon, is a much better choice."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"Loved the documentary about Mozart.

(Tad Szulc's book,Chopin In Paris: The Life And Times Of The Romantic Composer, is perhaps the best existing biography, in addition to Jim Samson'sChopin (Master Musicians Series)and Jeremy Siepmann'sChopin: The Reluctant Romantic; Chopin's friend Franz Liszt also wrote a \\"SORT OF\\" biography of himLife of Chopin (Forgotten Books).) Consequently, I would suggest that this book by American music newspaper writer and critic James Gibbon Huneker should not be expected to be more than it is.Huneker offers many interesting observations on Chopin's life and personality: \\"For the dissipations of the 'average sensual man,' he had an abiding contempt.\\" \\"Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries...\\" Chopin \\"did not care much for German music except Bach and Mozart. Beethoven ... was not sympathetic. Schubert he found rough, Weber, in his piano music, too operatic and Schumann he dismissed without a word.\\" With regard to Chopin's famous development of the rubato style of playing, Huneker writes, \\"The Chopin rubato is rhythm liberated from its scholastic bonds, but it does not mean anarchy, disorder.\\"Concerning Chopin's fateful meeting of author George Sand, \\"Sand was antipathetic to Chopin but her technique for overcoming masculine coyness was as remarkable in its particular fashion as Chopin's proficiency at the keyboard.\\" Her ardor for Chopin cooled as he became ill: \\"for an active mind and body like hers, it must have been irksome to submit to the caprices of a moody, ailing man.\\" In his final days, Chopin \\"begged his sister to burn all his inferior compositions. 'I owe it to the public and to myself to publish only good things.'\\" Huneker notes that \\"This wish has not been respected. The posthumous publications are for the most part feeble stuff.\\"Huneker concludes that \\"Chopin is the open door in music.

This book is the tour de force on the music of Chopin, expressed in the most descriptive and vibrant language imaginable. It was written in the late 19th Century by a man who enthusiastically explored every nook and cranny of Chopin's genius.The book is meant primarily as an overview and examination of Chopin's music for pianists and lovers of Chopin, written by a man who was a respected music critic and pianist himself. It's full of information on how the great pianists of the time performed Chopin and invaluable as a fascinating read and historical document. The book was never intended as a dry encyclopedic biography of the composer, and much has been discovered about Chopin's life in the last 100 years that can be found in other biographical sources. Those who expect Huneker to be literally correct in every respect on Chopin's life are badly missing the point of this fascinating examination of Chopin's life and music. Huneker adored Chopin, and his writing brims with passion, enthusiasm and incredible insight into each piece Chopin produced, though his words were never intended for the piano pedagogues only.Anyone who deeply loves Chopin will find this a unique and wonderful read. I have marked many passages, referred to it countless times, and there is nothing like reading Huneker's descriptions of a Chopin work while you are actually listening to it performed at the same time. Huneker's language simply reflects the florid language of his age and is truly fantastic in its descriptive detail.Zero stars on the misguided negative reviews on the book; and 5 stars on behalf of Huneker's little Chopin classic that has been in print for over 100 years. This is a book to be savored, and there are no other writings on Chopin that can match the boundless enthusiasm that Huneker felt for his musical god. Each page brims with Huneker's exuberant spirit and his fervent love of music itself. A treasure from another age."},{"Title":"Chopin;: The man and his music,","review":"James Huneker made an praised essay around the different stages of Chopin's life as well an extensive, meticulous and detailed analysis about every one of his compositions.

Lish had previously published a \\"Celebration of Jack Gilbert\\" in his magazine Genesis West in 1962 shortly after Gilbert's famous Yale Younger Poets book Views of Jeopardy hit the stands. Gilbert had worked as poetry editor for Genesis West until Lish had to let him go because he wasn't being nice to the other poets submitting poems for publication. Gilbert soon escaped to Greece. During their correspondences, and without Gilbert's permission, Lish began publishing a few of his poems here and there, and before you know it, Lish had a new book to publish with Knopf in 1982 called Monolithos. Lish borrowed from Views of Jeopardy to reintroduce Gilbert to the public and construct the opening segment of the book, and then followed with the brilliance of the Greek island poems called Monolithos. This book, in my opinion, makes for the very best poems America has to offer. Although Wallace Stevens and Emily Dickinson have given us many great poems to enjoy, Gilbert beat many of them with his very best from Views of Jeopardy, which are found in this book.

The poems, which span a period of time in which Jack Gilbert got a divorce and moved to Greece, are extreemly emotional and expertly crafted."},{"Title":"Monolithos Poems 1962 and 1982","review":"Monolithos is a moving and enigmatic series of poems. Divided into two parts, the first largely written in the 60s, and the second, far larger part, written in the intervening years; the two sets of poems contrast each other. The second part appears to be a long mediation on the failed aspects of the poet's life, including his marriage. There is an ever narrowing quality to the themes, as the expectancies of the narrative voice grow less secure as time passes. The scenes change from place to place: Denmark, Northern California, Japan, Greece, as if the voice of the poet has been set lose upon the world, to scavenge its themes here, there, everywhere. The collection ends at a beginning of sorts, with the poem \\"Threshing The Fire,\\" where the poet is back in the Pittsburg of his youth walking \\"the mean streets of Pittsburg/ knowing their leafy summer. Let him make sure the dreams are loose before the fire gets it all/ And I am hammered into the sun.\\""},{"Title":"Monolithos Poems 1962 and 1982","review":"I had the privilege of taking a class with Jack Gilbert in Spring of '04, and I can honestly say that this book is a better representation of his professed views than the newest book, _Refusing Heaven_. He talks about poetry like someone who is continuously falling in love with it for the first time, and this book conveys that more than any of his other ones. There is something more charming and interesting about the fresh look this book represents that makes it more accessible than later works. For fans of his later poems, this book provides a wonderful insight into Jack's beginnings, and it allows you to complete the arch of his journey as a poet. Not that many of us have access to his first book, _Views of Jeopardy_, but this book takes that work to the next level, cutting out the amateurish wordplay poems in _Views_ and leaving the real meat behind. Jack knew what he was doing with this book: it is passionate, concise, insightful, and gorgeous. If you can manage to get your hands on a copy of this book, HOLD ON TIGHT!"},{"Title":"Johann Strauss, father and son: A century of light music","review":"Reprinted by a British firm that specializes in such things, this is a well-written, well-researched book on the Strauss family and other contemporary musician-conductors. Without being pedantic, it provides pertinent [sometimes little-known] facts in a reader-friendly fashion. I hadn't known until recently, for example, that performances of the Waltz King's waltzes and polkas are based on orchestral arrangements of 1- or 2-piano reductions--all the original orchestrations having been lost for years. The only clue that one is reading a high-quality photocopy-based reprint are the very rare check marks and other marginalia that someone forgot to expunge before the copying was done.

As of the last update of this review, Amazon had mashed together Kindle reviews with those for the print edition. With most books, combining print and Kindle reviews isn't a problem. In the case of Bibles, however, the problem is that many customers visiting this product are trying to determine the qualities of this print version (e.g. binding; paper quality; size). The text of the ESV (or any other translation) is the same regardless of format, so those reviews won't be helpful for those evaluating the print edition.--What I was looking for:I already have other study Bibles, cross-reference Bibles, and study software so I didn't need any notes or extra features. I wanted an ESV thinline Bible to use as my main Bible that I read daily year after year. The ESV is a wonderful translation (readable & very accurate; others have commented on that) and I like thinline Bibles that aren't too bulky.--What I got:Thinline?When I read some of the reviews while making my purchase, I thought some of them were being overly picky about the thickness. I had seen another Crossway thinline ESV Bible in the store (ESV Thinline Bible, TruTone, Charcoal, Celtic Cross Design, Red Letter Text) and found that to be a nice size and definitely what you could call thinline. I figured this item would be the same Bible just with the brown cover. But when I took it out of the box I immediately saw that this is a different Bible and had to agree with other reviewers that this really isn't at all what is normally considered thinline. On a bright note, it is thinner than a \\"standard\\" sized pew Bible or typical gift Bible. While a little thicker than I hoped for, I don't consider it bulky and it is very comfortable to handle. All in all it is a very nice size.Cover:The TruTone cover looks very nice in this natural brown cover. I wasn't crazy about Crossway's other covers with designs on them. I like the understated yet nice appearance of this. Also, this cover feels durable. I have a couple other TruTone Bibles and they are holding up quite well (plus you can always get them rebound when the time comes). I think this looks and feels a lot nicer than bonded leather, which always seems cheap in my opinion. Also, the binding is sewn rather than glued and should contribute to its durability.Pages & Print:Given that this Bible is a tad thicker than true thinlines, the paper isn't exactly the \\"onion skin\\" variety. But it's nice - thick enough that bleed-through isn't at all a problem but thin enough to avoid extra bulk. The font is average magazine/newspaper size and is very readable. Happily, the gold edges haven't caused excess sticking of the pages even though it's brand new.Extras:While I didn't need them, there are a few nice features such as reading plans (I was pleased to see their 40-day plan for reading the key passages of the whole arc of God's plan; great for new believers), a 1,700 word concordance, etc. Maps and diagrams are printed on the same paper as the biblical text rather than on thicker glossy paper as is common, again reducing extra bulk. Interestingly, the maps are located between the OT and the NT. I hadn't seen that done before - they're usually in the back. Now that I have this, I have found it to be very convenient. And maybe people will actually look at them!--ConclusionThis is almost exactly what I was seeking. In the end, minus one star because you really can't call this a true thinline Bible. However, it is a nice size, it isn't too bulky, and I am very happy with the other aspects of this Bible. I am very pleased with what I got and I have truly been enjoying opening this Bible and spending precious time in His Word.--UPDATE 8/21/2012 - Just over two years of using this Bible and it is holding up very well with daily use and the cover has softened nicely. This will be my primary Bible for years to come.I hope this helps you in your Bible shopping!"},{"Title":"ESV Thinline Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, Black Letter","review":"About a year ago, I began using the English Standard Version (ESV) after using the NASB for over 20 years. I consider the ESV to be an excellent translation with unparalleled accuracy. A few months ago, I purchased this TruTone version and I absolutely love it. The leather is soft yet durable. I looks fantastic, and the craftsmanship of the binding is impeccable. I plan on giving this Bible as gifts to family and friends. The margins are not big enough for me to use as my study Bible, but this is the Bible that I carry every day in my briefcase."},{"Title":"ESV Thinline Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, Black Letter","review":"The quality of this handy bible is actually pretty good, although I only use it for travel.

Even while pressing this Bible firmly down on the table it measures 1 3/16 inches thick. If, like me, you bought this because you really liked the size of a previous thinline Bible you might be a bit disappointed. Also, I have a few other trutone covered books that I like much better (the Greek and Hebrew Reader's Bibles). Those are softer to the touch and a bit more grippy than this cover which has a pebbled finished. Additionally, I did not realize that this has no cross-references (although the description doesn't say it does).On the plus side this Bible does have a few extras that are helpful such as generous map section, and pictures of Jerusalem (Old and New, ect), the temple, tabernacle, etc. And of course, the ESV is a pretty solid translation."},{"Title":"ESV Thinline Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, Black Letter","review":"[...]It is a black, genuine leather, ESV Holy Bible Classic Thinline Edition, made by Crossway, with Red Letter. Note: I'm very suspicious of the Bible because there is listed two ISBN numbers. Maybe there's a legitimate reason for the dual numbers, probably not. The ISBN on the box the Bible comes in is 1-58134-503-8. The ISBN on the back cover of the Bible itself is 1-58134-650-6. I don't know what is going on, but I don't like it.Anyway, hopefully you can tell which Bible I'm reviewing.I'm not an expert on leather, but the genuine leather on the Bible isn't very high quality. It's definitely different than my bonded leather Crossway ESV Bible (same except color and leather) that got stolen (yea i know, who steals Bibles?), but I don't know if it's worth paying 40% more than the bonded leather for...The pages are very thin, which is fine, but they are of a cheaper paper than the bonded leather Bible I had before this one. I don't know why they would use different paper, or maybe I just need to get used to it, but my old Crossway Bible paper seemed much stronger with the same thickness. Definitely has to do with the type of paper used.Lastly, I'm pretty annoyed that there was excess glue dots on the edges of the paper. I scratched them off and some of the gold edge came off with them. Grr..So generally, the ESV is great, but this particular Bible is not. I would recommend getting a cheaper one (bonded leather) or shelling out the bucks for a higher quality Bible.Albert"},{"Title":"ESV Thinline Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, Black Letter","review":"This Bible is great!

It is much thicker than the \\"less than 1 inch\\" claimed on the box in which it came. I measure its thickness at 1.25 inches.Amazon says it has a 9-point font text, but this Bible actually uses an 8.2-point font, as stated on the box. Too small for my eyes.The paper used in this \\"premium\\" Bible is cheap and some of the pages were badly wrinkled when I received it. The cover is made of such cheap, stiff material that the book will not lay flat enough on its own to comfortably read the text if you are in the first or last 300 pages. And once you open it, the cover does not lay flat when you close it. Having had my copy open for only a few minutes and then closing it, the front cover is standing up from the rest of the book at about a 30 degree angle.The Bible supposedly has a smyth-sewn binding, but it behaves more like it has a glued binding (probably because of the very cheap cover that Crossway used).I previously owned a less expensive thinline ESV with better paper, a larger font, and a much softer TruTone cover than this Bible offers.

The quality of this particular Bible is outstanding. The Thinline creates a manageable size for everyday use. I preach from this Bible and find it opens easily and stays flat. It has held up to daily, use and abuse (briefcase, study, meetings, etc). And it tolerates writing well. Any Thinline will have some bleed, but I'm not overly distracted by the bleed in this edition.

I've had thinlines (NAS and NIV) that lost pages, but no problem so far with this one. (Used for about a year now).The paper is a little more yellow and thicker than most thinline Bibles, making the whole Bible thicker as well. This is not a problem for me, but looks a little bulkier than other thinlines. I compared it to a earlier Crossway ESV thinline and the ghosting is about the same, so the thicker paper didn't seem to make much difference there.The cover is very nice, and is about the best, most \\"leather like\\" look of any true-tone edition I've seen. However, it is stiffer than leather Bibles I own. By comparison, I have an ESV Literary Study Bible with a true-tone cover which is more flexible, but I expect the thicker true-tone on the Premium Thinline to hold up better."},{"Title":"ESV Thinline Bible, Genuine Leather, Black, Black Letter","review":"I really really enjoy this Bible!

Three stars for content, presentation, red letter, and size. It does suffer two negative stars for binding.

For a two person play, which takes place in real time, it is a moving decent into the demon world of two women, mother and daughter, co-dependents, best friends, enemies, like no other.Jessie, the daughter is a woman deeply in pain, so much so that her capacity to live has gone, as has her capacity to love. Thelma is her mother, desperately clinging to the one person she loves, whom she needs more and more, and loses sight of more and more.There were many sobs and sniffles in the audience towards the end of 'night, Mother, and though reading the script is different than seeing it performed by terrific actresses (Edie Falco as Jessie and Brenda Blethyn as Thelma), the story is good enough and in your face enough to do the job.This is a play about when, if, why and how we stop being parents or kids, and start being our own people, or if that is even possible. Somewhat depressing, but serious and true."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"Night, Mother is a play that covers every aspect of human life: love, family bonds, importance and usefulness in society, to a slew of others too numerous to count.

It has only two characters, Jessie Cates, the daughter who lives with her mother, Thelma Cates. These are both simple country women, with Jessie being the quieter and less demonstrative and Thelma being more talkative.Jessie is around 40, epileptic, divorced with a son who is turning into a criminal. She sees her life as lacking in the positive and feels that it will not change.

A woman who has felt abandoned, ignored, physically ill and of no particular use to herself or her family spends one last night with her elderly mother as she prepares to kill herself. Her mother tries every method from begging to logic to humor in order to to try to get her to change her mind.The play, presented in real-time, is gripping. Norman is a powerful writer. She creates great, flawed characters and places them in a fishbowl for us to watch as they swim in circles around an issue no one really wants to talk about -- suicide. This play is sure to spark some great discussions, which is what powerful literature ought to do."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"Convinced she has no control over her own life, Jessie Cates resolves to end it. But this is not an impulse decision. She has spent months carefully laying the groundwork so that when she is gone, her needy mother Thelma will be able to carry on. Now nothing is left but to make sure Mama is aware of what's going down so she can prepare herself for when it happens.Since its first production in 1983, this play has ascended to the ranks of theatrical classics for its almost operatic language, its intimate one-on-one tension, and its shocking denouement. The most stunning surprise in this one-act is its lack of surprise. The crisis point is already past when the play begins; what we're left with isn't conflict so much as conflagration.As tensions run high, Jessie and Thelma lock themselves into a downward spiral of emotional revelation and high-strung confrontation. Personal disclosures come out with a degree of quiet honesty that many current histrionic playwrights would shy from like a branding iron. And Jessie proves to be one of the most strong-willed characters in theatre for the last generation.Though remarkably short, this play is extremely compact. Not one word is wasted. And despite the dense subtext, the refreshingly direct language makes a break from all the recent plays that need to be decoded to be understood. This DPS edition includes updates the author made for the 2004 Broadway revival, bringing some of the dated language into the 21st Century.This play plows a field so unique that subsequent playwrights have fled from this level of stunning lucidity. There is precious little else quite like it in the current theatrical scene. Terse, candid, and powerful, \\"'Night, Mother\\" casts a shadow on every writer currently working."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"\`Night Mother, a 1983 Pulitzer Prize winning play deserves just that! This one act play with simply two characters was unlike something I have read. The play draws on emotional dialogue, an unpleasant subject of suicide and the challenge to convince one not to do it. What is prize winning about the dramatic story is the realistic conversational tones and often painful sounds. It is the exchange of normal everyday dialogue, intermixed with riveting rationalization, pleading, bargaining, and coming to terms with life as it shall be. For the theatrical onstage drama, a clock is visible to the audience that indicates the action takes place in one evening and with no intermission. Time is of the essence.The drama takes place in the early 80's in a small home, and one main character is Jessie, a 40ish woman with epilepsy, was deserted by her husband, and her son is a teenage criminal whose whereabouts are unknown. The only other character is her mother, whom Jessie lives with and Jessie, somewhat, does caregiving.In the midst of Jessie carefully and strategically planning her suicide, she is nonchalantly taking care of last minute obligations for her mother, like doing mother's nails. Included in the planning, is a list of instructions so mother can locate everything needed after Jessie's suicide takes place. As mother tries to reason and rationalize and beg, Jessie conducts herself normally, making the preparations and letting nothing interfere. Here, we learn about Jessie, her dead father, why she was deserted, her son, and much more. Then the author transfers the dialogue with brilliancy..... This is wonderful, sad, emotional and powerful.Movie version with superb acting!See the movie version with Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft. It is rare that I see a version that equals the book! This is powerful.'night, Mother.Another wonderful play about death and dying is by MichaelCristofer, a Pulitzer PrizeShadow Box: A Drama in Two Actsand the film version directed by Paul NewmanThe Shadow Box.

What is hopelessness, and how does it come about? This play looks at one aspect of suicide and its eventual cause: the loss of one's self, one's identity. The dialogues between Mother and Jessie are intense, but yet there is a separateness, a barrier that can not be broken between the two. They are united together by their relation, but it ends there. The mother/daughter relationship in this play is quite believeable -- albeit sad and unfortunate. Night, Mother is a dark, chilling play that leaves a pondering imprint on your mind long after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"\\"'night, Mother\\" is a tour de force conversation between a mother, Thelma, and her daughter, Jessie, who has just told her that she is going to commit suicide at the end of the night. The play is a taut high-wire act that leaves you spellbound as Thelma tries to convince her daughter not to go through with it and Jessie sternly insists. Thelma and Jessie are extremely dimensional, deep characters with an achingly believable relationship. Through the course of their conversation it becomes apparent that there is a yawning chasm between them despite their seeming closeness, and while Thelma thinks that the two can put it right Jessie doesn't believe it -- or want to try. The fierce, emotional back-and-forth between Mother and daughter keeps you on the edge of your seat. The dialogue is very natural and believable, and the playwright, Marsha Norman, displays an extraordinary acuity for what her characters are feeling and have gone through to reach this point. Norman has crafted a devastating portrait of two women that leaves an enormous impact on the reader. I only finished it two hours ago, but I seriously doubt that \\"night, Mother\\" will be leaving my thoughts any time soon. Highly recommended -- but keep the Kleenex on hand, just in case."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"Marsha Norman's 1983 Pulitizer Prize-winning 'NIGHT, MOTHER is frequently described as a play \\"about suicide.\\" Although the play does indeed deal with suicide, this is actually a shallow designation; it is about a lot of things, but most particularly control: who has it, who wants it, and the extent a person will go to obtain it.The play involves two characters: Thelma, an elderly woman, and Jessie, her middle-aged daughter. They have lived together in an isolated house on a rural road for a number of years. Thelma describes herself as \\"a plain country woman;\\" she enjoys life in a fundamental way, not expecting more than she already knows, watching television, knitting, nibbling at sweets, and enjoying regular visits from her son and his family. Jessie, who suffers from epilepsy and is divorced, has become something of a recluse, and her life consists largely of managing her mother's home and thinking on the past. One evening, as the play begins, Jessie informs Thelma that she has decided to kill herself right after she gives Thelma her weekly manicure.Thelma does not take Jessie seriously at first; clearly there have been too many scenes between the two for Jessie's statement to have any real meaning for her. But Jessie is serious indeed, and over the course of an hour and a half the play evolves into a battle of wits, Jessie determined to kill herself, Thelma equally determined to prevent her from it. In the process, we learn quite a bit about the family and their lives and the various emotional and factual secrets the women have hidden from each other over the years.The play is brilliantly constructed, performed in \\"real time\\" without any scene changes or intermission; the characters--and the equally vivid people they discuss but whom we never see--are equally well rendered. There are moments are laughter, even more moments of insight, but the play is progressively intense, progressively dark, with all the power of a noose that slowly tightens around your neck. One of the most fearsome bits of theatre of the past thirty years or so, easily the equal of such legendary works as Albee's WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"What if your daughter or son came into the living room, and she or he told you that he or she was going to end her or his life? How would you respond? What would you do? And the question is what can you do?Mama thinks that her and her daughter are having a normal night at the house until she finds out that her daughter has planned to end her life. At first, Thelma \\"Mama\\" thinks that Jessie is kidding when she says that she wants to shoot herself. When Thelma realizes that Jessie is serious, the conflict begins between the struggle of life and death which is out of Thelma's hands.Thelma stalls and tries to find out why Jessie wants to end her life. In the small amount of time between life and death, Thelma finds out more about her daughter than she ever did in her entire time with while she releases secrets and concerns that she never revealed to her daughter.'Night Mother is a play that unwinds spellbound confessions and displays intense emotions that run through the course of people lives. Jessie and Thelma are powerful characters that makes me feel like I am there with them in the room. Jessie, in the first time in her life, feels like she has a sense of control, and death is freeing her as she sees life imprisoning her. The whole play is intriguing and complex. The ending will make you feel like you have realized that life is complex and question why you exist as a human being."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"Michael RussoThis play only has two characters, has one main plot, one setting, and is one conversation. One might think that this play, just by knowing these facts, must not be good becaue how can a writer capture an audeince's attention for 90 pages of one conversation, especially when the conversation is about suicide. Do not ask how, but Marshall Norman does it. He lets us into the world of Jessie and Thelma, and the reader is hooked on every last word.When Jesse reveals to Thelma that she is going to commit suicide, Thelma does not beleive her. However, once Jessie begins to list her reasons, Thelma goes from disbeleif to realism in a heartbeat. The tone then changes from a mother having a night chat with her daughter to a mother trying to save her daughter's life.Her mother ives her many reasons why she should not kiil herself, which are all reasons that Jesse shoots down. The reader can hear the panick in the mother's voice and the calmness of Jesse's without anyone acting it out or doing the dialogue.The writing itself is poetic and beautiful. He is using death to show the beauty of life, which is amazing. The mother does such a god job at giving her daughter reasons to live that someone contiplating suicide might reconsider.While I am not going to ive away the ending, I will just say that the author does a good job of slowing down the pace for the grand finale. The endign is not forced and the play does not end too soon or too late, it's just right. The small home is also the perfect setting for this remarkable play because the reader can really feel involved in the lives of these two people in a setting that they are similar to.I have to give this play five stars. I read it in less than an hour because the pace of it is fast and smooth. The setting is great and the characters are so realistic they jump off the page and into your kitchen. If you want to know more about the meaning of life, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"My mother called. She is an actress in the national theater in Izmir, Turkey. This is her last year before retirement after 40 years of service. The theater had asked her what play she would like to play. She told them to surprise her. She got \`Night Mother by Marsha Norman in the role of Mama. She seemed excited on the phone and I was very happy for her. I went to Barnes & Noble and bought a copy of the English version. We both read the play and started a discussion. I completely agree with her that this is one of the finest plays ever written.This play takes place in a few hours of a forty-something Jessie and her mother, whom we know as \`Mama'. Jessie has had a rough life: a long time epileptic, which has subsided for the past year thanks to better medication; a troubled son, who keeps stealing from her; a divorce; her father had ended his life, but not before writing a simple good-by message: Gone Fishing; and a mother who has emotionally been distant--if not physically--yet demanding of her to take care of the house they were sharing.Jessie had had enough and she was now declaring, right off the bat as the play starts, her nonchalant determination to die with her father's gun. The dialogue is Jessie's way to make it \`easier' on her mother for what is about to happen. Needless to say the mother goes through an emotional roller coaster ride. At times the play is funny, and other times tragic.Be yourself, I said to my mother. Funny how her last role would resemble so much of herself. I am, thankfully, a bit luckier than Jessie that I still can find enjoyment in life.A few weeks later my mother and I talked again. She apparently had given up on the play because it was raising her blood pressure. I told her she made a good decision.There are seven hours in time difference between here and there. Difference of day and night."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"Marsha Norman, 'night, Mother (Hill and Wang, 1983)What a refreshing piece of work-- a sparse, clear-headed play that examines the ramifications of suicide and (for once) comes up with the right answer. The action takes place in two rooms, with two people, and runs about an hour and a half. The two characters, a late-thirties daughter and her mother, start with the idea that the daughter is planning on committing suicide later that night, and the resulting tension between them allows both an examination of the more stable, understandable reasons behind the desie to end one's life and the soul-baring necessary in any familial relationship (and present in only a few).****"},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"This is an amazingly moving drama. The way in which Mother and Jessie interact is so true to the nature of most relationships of comfort. Things are understood, tho never said. And yet these 2 people still don't really know each other. The nuances of this play are what make it so touching. The end always leaves me deeply moved, and not sure exactly what I should feel."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"This is one of my favorite plays of all time. it's a great discussion on the issue of suicide. There's one line Ive always remebered: When the daughter is trying to justify the idea that she wants to off herslef, and she uses an illustration of someone riding the bus and riding the bus, and they could just stay on and ride it around the block another round, but why bother. It's really well written, and how the mother and dauther get along is interesting."},{"Title":"'night, Mother: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this play. I watched the film awhile back, and since I wanted to change choose different films for my Film Appreciation class, I decided to review the play before adding 'Night, Mother to my list. What a powerful play. It sheds light on a very difficult subject. Jesse, the main character, makes the decision to \\"get off the bus early\\" after careful thought. She shows that some people contemplate this critical experience probably more carefully than buying a house or a car. Her decision is hardly spontaneous or emotional, nothing that I imagined at all. The power of the read helped me to decide to buy the video later on. I also ended up buying a collection of Marsha Norman's other plays, hoping that I will duplicate the insight gained by reading this play."},{"Title":"The Perfect Shot, North America: Shot Placement for North American Big Game","review":"If you are a hunter, you must have this book. Although not cheap, it is worth every penny. The graphics alone are worth the price of admission. Each chapter includes numerous photographs, including photographs of animals in the positions hunters are most likely to see them. Graphic overlays showing the skeletal structure and location of brain, heart and lungs are then shown, with dots showing correct shot placement. Understanding precisely where to place your shot, and most importantly, how point of aim changes depending on the angle at which you are viewing your quarry (for example, depending upon whether you are hunting from a tree stand or are level with the animal) is absolutely essential.But this book doesn't end with fancy graphics. Each species is covered in detail, with discussions of how the animal is hunted, the best equipment for the hunt, and Boddington's personal experiences hunting that animal.This book is an important reference work. It is also extremely readable for the pure enjoyment of General Boddington's stories. All hunters can learn from this book."},{"Title":"The Perfect Shot, North America: Shot Placement for North American Big Game","review":"I have used this book on helping 1st time hunters on elk, and bison make the shot that will cleanly take the animal.

I bought this book because I am about to go on a muskox hunt and wanted guidance on shot placement. I had seen it recommended on a hunter's discussion forum. I didn't expect much, perhaps a few black and white photos and brief text on low grade paper. When the book arrived, I was amazed. This is a high quality printing with all photos in color - both of the animals and of their surroundings. The pictures for illustrating shot placement are better than anything I have seen before. It has illustrations of each animal's skeleton, heart and lungs superimposed on a color photo. In addition there is another color photo with just simple dots showing where to place your shot. This is a must have for big game hunters. The quality is so high that it qualifies as a \\"coffee table\\" book (if your friends aren't squeamish about such things - if they are, you need to find new friends) :-)"},{"Title":"The Perfect Shot, North America: Shot Placement for North American Big Game","review":"For anybody who is presently hunting big game and all those who are thinking about it should make this book a must read.

His book in this case however delivered less than expected. There wasn't near as much stalking, general hunting procedures, and anatomical diagrams information in Boddington's book as was presented in Kevin Robertson's book for Africa in the same vain. I refer to \\"The Perfect Shot\\" by Kevin Robertson, DVM & PH. I think Boddington copied Robertson's idea but really didn't measure up to Robertson. Boddington's book cost about 2/3 the price of Robertson's but delivered only 1/2 the value.

He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets."},{"Title":"Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq","review":"For reasons to numerous to mention, many are detached from the war in Iraq. Where journalists may have failed, articulate veterans like Jason Christopher Hartley are documenting their experiences in books that should be required reading for every American.Hartley is a superb writer and balances his prose between the often-absurd events of the war and his finely tuned personal observations. From the pathos of describing the plight of an Iraqi chicken farmer, to the deep humor of his description of leave in the artificial paradise of Qatar, Hartley's wit and command of language results in a compelling narrative.I first read Hartley's blog (the precursor to the book) on the IAVA (Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of American) website and couldn't wait to read the final product.

It doesn't cover the big picture. It doesn't cover the issues that the news media talks about. It's what the rifle carrying soldier sees, does, thinks as he goes through is deployment.His story sounds a lot like stories of other veterans. In fact I remember a book by a fellow named McBride from World War I. 'I didn't mind the war, but I hated the hell out of the Army.'The book is a good mix of stories of the day to day life, going out into bad guy country, and the view from life at the bottom of the Army. I can certainly say that life in the Army hasn't changed much from my time in it (which was from before the author was born.The web site contains a large collection of pictures.Well written, very interesting.

If you are looking for a book full of combat and killing people, this book is not for you. There is combat and gunfire in the book, but it is much more than that. Hartley talks about things as trivial as getting lost in Humvees to difficult issues such as dealing with the death of a friend. The book is what you would expect from an infantryman but at the same time rather philosophical at times. A good read."},{"Title":"Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq","review":"I say kudos to Jason Hartley for a very fine first book. One reviewer said that he doesn't know what it all means - it means only that here is an honest account of one soldier's experience in the combat environment that is today's Iraq. The author writes with candor and humor. The young Mr. Hartley writes in a way that explains what an infantry soldier's life is like on the ground. (Yes, where the work gets done, not what I would call the \\"bottom\\" of the army.) Additionally, he helps us to understand just how much our national guardsman are doing to help in this conflict. His website compliments the book with lots of great pictures. I enjoyed reading his accounts very much."},{"Title":"Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq","review":"Jason Christopher Hartley was raised in my own hometown of Murray, Utah. His story could have been mine, had I chosen to join the Army. What Hartley has is a sharp wit that transforms his work into something more than just a blog in book form. It is episodic, a mere compilation of his blog entries, but this helps recreate what it might feel like for a soldier. Battle is probably quite episodic itself.Hartley's blog posts are quite eloquently written, laced with a dark sense of humor that can only come from being raised as he was (similar to my upbringing--maybe I found his sense of humor so authentic because it falls in line with my own). His frank honesty, even that which may paint him in a negative light, is refreshing, a nice change of pace from the typical \\"see what a good person I am?\\" self-promoting attitudes that come from many autobiographies.I will say that this is the best of the books I've read from soldiers of the Iraq War. It has the most to say by saying very little at all. It's the simple day-to-day tasks that drive much of Hartley's writing. It amounts to anyone else's blog about their workplace, except Hartley is facing life-or-death on a nearly constant basis. I highly recommend this book if you want an honest portrayal of one infantryman's experiences. Be warned though: Hartley's attitude reflects much of the video-game-generation's detachment. He can view even the most serious of tragedies in a comedic light. For example, he affixed a \\"I Heart Dead Civilians\\" sticker to his laptop. He enjoys the thrill of the fight, maybe if just for a thrill. It's a common personality trait of his generation (and mine).Not to be missed if you can handle it. This is a must read for anyone wanting a peek at how soldiers are living out their tours in Iraq."},{"Title":"Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq","review":"I started reading Jason's blog online, and then through emails when it was taken offline.

Then he told us ('us' being from the mailing list) he was releasing the blog as a book!! Hartley has a magical way of telling a story. His unique style of writing gives the reader a peak into the life as an Infantry National Guardsman. He has a VIVID sense of humor and a remarkable way of painting a picture for the reader. Cut away the Hollywood glamor and flashing stars, Hartley has a true account, his personal perspective, of how he spent his time in Iraq.

Who would have thought?? After having read the blog I couldn't help but feel like I was constantly missing something while reading the book. I think we all were spoiled by reading the blog.

The detective, Godfrey, is similar to Sherlock Holmes but is more realistic, being a newspaper reporter who was formerly a police detective. The Watson figure is Lester, a lawyer, who follows along and reports what Godfrey discovers. The novel is based on a mystery. Vantine, a wealthy friend of Lester's, purchases a Boule table made during the reign of one of the French Louis and owned by Madame Montespan, a famous poisoner. The mystery begins when two people, including Vantine, are poisoned by the table. Godwin assumes there must be some secret drawers in the piece, and spends, with Lester, much time searching the piece.The first section of the novel is first-rate, as Godfrey and Lester figure out the secrets of the table, but after that the work introduces a second major section based on a French grand criminal who tests Godwin's abilities as a detective. The French man assumes several disguises as he attempts the get the table which now contains some hidden jewels.Although not a great mystery novel, it is a good read and shows how at least one early 20th-century mystery writer drew on the British and French mystery traditions in his work.This edition has a lot of odd typos and other errors, but it's good to have these early works available!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"David Lindsey is one of the most underrated authors in the field today. His novels are always intelligent and interesting and most emerge from authentic FBI case histories. MERCY is not so much a routine who-dun-it mystery as an exploration of the psychology of fetishes and sex, particularly kinky sex - that is assuming one doesn't consider masochism, sadism, cross-dressing, and dominatrix luncheons slightly off.There is another story beneath the obvious one and that is the practice of such behavior within the confines of polite society. The &quot;victimes&quot; are upper-class women of a certain type - the country club, suburban, once-a-week therapist type. Lindsey has a real knack for looking at events through the eyes of the disturbed individual, again calling on his real-life experience (FBI profiling).The prose is rich and sweeping, the organization superb, the entire story always a little on edge. This is deeply disturbing novel but an important one."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I read Mercy a few years ago, as did my Mom and about 10 other women friends, and we all loved it, even though it was about certain things we had never been involved in, it is riveting. The best thing about this book is the main character, Carmen, whose life is as interesting in her personal life with the interplay with her Mother as is her exciting life in her job. David Lindsay, if you ever read these reviews, are you ever going to write a book with Carmen in it? I have waited years for a book with her in it. Please, let us hear from her again. Your writing is wonderful, but this book was really the one that women liked."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I read this book years ago and it still ranks in my all-time top 10 list. I shared the book with numerous co-workers and we all agreed that we would like to meet these women (and we're all heterosexual). It's amazing that a man has such insight and sensitivity in depicting the emotions of his female characters. It just goes to show that the rules of love apply to all relationships. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This is a great thriller, its pacing is perfect and the story is riviting. Mr. Lindsey perfectly captures Houston and his writing style is fluid and engrossing. Palma is one of his best protagonists and the story is riviting. I must say that I am a huge fan of Mr. Lindsey's work and have read all of his books, they are all well written and researched, but this is unquestionably one of his best. I hesitated writing a review because 32 is plenty, but the most current review is so shocking, ONE star, and that someone found it helpful was revolting to me. If you love thrillers and appreciate well written and fast paced books then you will LOVE this book, I have read Da Vinci code and all of Patricia Cornwell books as well as David Baldacci, but Lindsey is the best, once you read one of his books you will have to read the rest..he is that good. I also recommend In the Lake of the Moon, Requiem for a Glass Heart, and A Cold Mind, but frankly all of his books are consistantly good. I am so thankful that someone turned him me on to him while at U.T., it's a shame that he does not get a wider audience, but I'm always trying to correct that descepency."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This is set in swealtering Houston where a female police officer is investigating a series of murders. All the victims were upper class ladies who had paid for S&amp;M services. I could not put this down. I've recommended this novel to three female friends and they all enjoyed it very much. A great cast of characters, I can't recommend this highly enough. Do yourself a favour and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This guy is a great writer. Not only is the plot fascinating, juicy and suspenseful, the characters are genuine and interesting, especially the Latin lady-cop. Above all, Lindsey captures the essence of Houston with all its complex problems and diversity that become apparent to anyone who visits that city for any length of time. Lindsey captures the setting best of anyone and certainly better than those at UH creative writing program!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"David L. Lindsey's shockingly brilliant 1990 \\"Mercy\\" must be one of the most under-the-radar \\"great\\" thrillers ever written.I can't believe anyone could be bored by this book. I enjoyed its leisurely pacing and methodical, clinical prose, and I did NOT guess the killer until Mr. Lindsey tells you it is time for you to do so. Don't believe the (two) Amazon reviewers of the hardcover edition who claim to have figured out the murderer early on. Highly unlikely. This is a very clever thriller, and I read a lot of them. You will be very satisfied with the ending of this book.The actual final murder sequence and subsequent \\"reveal\\" of the murderer--very near the end of the book--is unforgettable, and I don't recommend you finish \\"Mercy\\" before you go to bed. I'm not kidding. I almost did, and something told me to hold off the final chapters (beginning with Chapter 61) until the next afternoon.I'm glad I waited. The book haunted me the entire day and into the night. I had to drink several glasses of Johnnie Walker before I could sleep.\\"Mercy\\" is well worth owning, and you will want to read it twice to see if Mr. Lindsey cheats. He doesn't. I can see myself reading this a third time down the road. That's extremely rare for me.Warning: it's gory, and the sexual components of the story are unflinchingly detailed.A real winner. Why this hasn't been filmed is amazing to me. I would call this book flawless. Maybe it was ahead of its time.I'm now a fan of David L. Lindsey. This discovery is why I browse used bookstores (long may they reign)."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"Mercy is one of the best crime novels of all time. The structure of this is so fascinating, you'll want to read it more than once, and there's even a chapter in the middle that stands on its own as a great short story! Bravos to Mr. Lindsey for a terrifying masterpiece."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"A riveting descent into darkness and shocking kinkiness that will haunt you for days after you finish it."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"Carmen Depalma, a Houston detective, searches for a bizare serial killer. The search leads her into the world of bi-sexual women and sado-masochism.I liked this book for the first hundred pages. It seemed like a good murder/suspense tale was in the making. About page 200 I began to wish the action would speed up; at page 300 -- with 200 pages yet to traverse -- I gave up. I won't read a book that bores me.A good editor would have chopped out most of the author's lengthy descriptions of odd sexual practices and societies of bi-sexual women and cut this book down to 300 pages. With a little more discipline and a lot of cutting the author might have produced a good thriller.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"The book is really well written and I might be willing to read another book by this author.... but this book is just too ugly.I had nightmares after reading this book, it bothered me for weeks. Read it at your own risk."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This has to be one of the most over-written books in any genre. I could not believe the amount of space wasted in wordy, directionless exposition. The author should be cited by the EPA for the hapless trees that needed to be sacrificed to print this junk. Police work has never seemed so boring. The events in this book are built on coincidence and the lethargic will of the author; the investigators do nothing except stand around, talk in copspeak and react to the next transition in plot-which seems light years away to the reader. I truly cannot believe the number of people who rated this book highly. In one of Kirkus' other reviews, they equate Lindsey to Le Carre, a comparison that might ring true if Le Carre was drugged and beat about the head with a hammer before being positioned in front of his typewriter. Mercy blows more hot air than its Houston setting."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer, good describer, but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action, in this book at least, is predictable and rendered downright boring. All the lurid details that are supposed to add to the &quot;psychoerotic&quot; nature of the book come off as crude and off-putting instead, like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken. And anyone who can't guess the &quot;surprise twist&quot; by page 25 wasn't reading very closely."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"this book kept my interest from beginning to end. One of the few books that I would read again. Very erotic"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I bought this book from a book club just because I L-O-O-O-V-E suspense novels... and I was hooked! I was fascinated by the society these women have (and I'm not attracted to that sort of thing) I was also shocked to find out exactly how sheltered a life I lead. This was an edge-of-the-seater-I read it all in one night! I haven't read any more books by Lindsey but I intend to very soon!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"Mercy starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final surprise.Lots of fun to read, lots to think about. Mercy was hard to put down. I enjoyed the Palma character.I would recommend to anyone who likes a good detective story. I have passed it to several friends who also enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This is one book that will never end up in one of my garage sales. I have been saving it for years to read again and it's just about that time. I was sitting on the edge of my sofa, chewing my nails until 3 a.m. reading this book. I wish I could find others that engrossed me as much. Any recommendations? Thanks, Mr. Lindsey."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"Mercy ranks as one of the lengthiest books I have ever read (nearly 600 pages in paperback). Because of other committments, I had to stop near the middle of the book, and was not able to resume reading it for nearly two weeks. The characters were so well developed that I had no trouble remembering who and what the plot was about, and where it was leading me. Although the storyline risks offending sensitive readers, it at the same time shows just how little we may really know about those around us, those we think we know well, even perhaps, family members. I cheered for Carmen Palma and Sander Grant and their cautious romantic relationship. This would be a great start to a series featuring these two characters and their &quot;gut feelings&quot;. I would have given Mercy five stars, but the sheer length was a mild drawback. I definately will look for more of Lindsey's books."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"The subject of the book is not for all tastes, the the plot is twisting and the charters are all well fleshed (pun intended) out. Murders of a S&amp;M nature must be solved by Houston Detective Carmen Plama. In solving the murders she is drawn into lifestely complety different for her own. You care for Dectective Plama and share her adventure tracking down the killer who knows no mercy. In this treck she is forced to review her past and make her choices for the furture. I would love to see Lindsay come back to Detective Carmen Palma in another novel"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"One needs a strong stomach and sexual tolerance to read this terrific thriller/mystery, but I recommend it highly if you like well-developed characters and above average writing in the mystery genre. Upon finishing this marvelous read, I have searched for all David Lindsey books I could find and it hasn't been easy. His publisher is missing the boat in not touting this author to the paperback trade. &quot;Silence of the Lamb&quot; readers, don't miss this book"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This was the first David Lindsey book I read and after this one I went on to read many more. This one remains my favorite and it stays in my mind as few books do. It's an absolutely outstanding mystery. You won't forget it. You can't forget it!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose, this book overall was a big disappointment to me. He did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel, and left too many loose ends. Each time I expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence, he didn't bother to tie it in. I think it's possible that he didn't even know how it would end until it did, and at that point he was just tired of writing. If you decide to read this book, be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value, and be prepared to be left wondering . . . &quot;what ever happened with the ______ ?&quot;"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"i picked up mercy and couldn't put it down. it had me on edge and just when i though i knew who it was , something happened and i had to start over again. in my opinion it is the best suspense thriller ever."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"MercyDavid L. LindseyMain Character: Carmen PalmaThis book started off a bit slow. In fact, the first 200 or so pages were rather slow and I wouldn't consider the book as a whole as a page-turner. However, what it lacks in thrillingness it makes up for in creating a nice dark, gloomy atmosphere. I just enjoyed the way the characters were thoroughly and realistically depicted and how it made the reader feel for them. If I were to consider the slow start and if it were possible, I'd probably take off half a star."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I have read this book several times,and it is still one of my favorites. Everyone I recommened it to,LOVED IT."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"This was my first David Lindsey book and, in my opinion, his best. It is so suspenseful and unexpected, right up to the conclusion! It delves into the world of women's S&amp;M and explores the idea that women are just as capable of committing disturbing and horrible acts as men. The suspects and the crimes force the main character, detective Carmen Palma, to really examine and reevaluaute her own attitudes and preconceived ideas about women and the nature of violence. As psychological-murder-mystery-suspense-WHATEVER! novels go, this is one of the best I've read!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"The very best, bar none. It will grip you from first to last page--else, you are incapable of appreciating style, talent, genius, vigorous characterization, and psychological nuance of those who are well (protag Carmen) and deeply unwell in their minds. I won't spoil it. Read it &amp; disregard the idea that dares to suggest an effete, self-indulgent, excruciatingly dull le Carre (in his latest fiction) is better than Lindsey. In fact, Lindsey is better than Thomas Harris by a longshot in developing women protagonoists &amp; Harris is very good at portraying more than monsters. Ditto that Detroit hack Leonard &amp; his formulaic, write-by-numbers novels. Lindsey is always different, always exciting."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"If you loved Edwart Stewart's Privileged Lives, you will love Mercy. One of the best mysteries I have ever read--applies to both novels!"},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"If I wanted a map of Texas I would have purchased an atlas instead of this boring book. The author had a good idea, but despite that, the only reason I even finished the book was because I had 100 pages to go and I was too damn OCD to just leave it at that."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I love gritty suspense novels, but Mercy didn't bowl me over with its suspense. It was quite disturbing and insightful psychologically into sexually-abused women, bisexual women, and sadomasochists.But overall I have to agree with the reader who said, \\"The book is really well written and I might be willing to read another book by this author.... but this book is just too ugly.I had nightmares after reading this book, it bothered me for weeks.

I figured out the plot twist in the first few pages and the murderer as soon as he/she was introduced."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"I believe the author leaves you a little confused at the end because he doesn't tell you who the serial killer was."},{"Title":"Mercy","review":"There are very few books, no matter how poor, that I have been unable or unwilling to finish, but this was one of them. I had to force myself to keep reading until finally, I just had to give up. I thought the writing style was pedestrian and there was just way too much of it. And yet there was no suspense and the pace was so slow, it drove me nuts. I totally disagree with reviewers who claim Lindsey writes good prose. There are so many who are better in this genre. Try John Connolly, Dennis Lehane, Carol O'Connell. I'm sure there are plenty more who can write circles around this guy. (Just to be fair, and as a favor to a friend, I'm giving Lindsey another chance and am halfway through his \\"Animosity\\". It's a totally different style, but unfortunately, no less boring. Ho hum!)"},{"Title":"The West and the World: A History of Civilization from 1400 to the Present","review":"Reilly's book is a quite serviceable introduction to modern world history. It is not a conventional survey text (you know, the kind with 4 authors, 8 editions, and precious little pizzazz), but rather an interpretive study comprising a series of closely linked essays on key historical issues: industrialization, racism, individualism, nationalism, etc. The author's deft explication of political ideas is probably his strongest suit. Still, there's plenty of facts and data here, so it can be used in college courses or read with profit by the educated public. Uncluttered, well-drawn maps help students locate places mentioned in the text, and the illustrations are also valuable. The cost is very reasonable, about $50 less than the average survey text. The publisher has kept the price down by reducing production costs; this shows in the absence of color pictures, and the index is so skimpy that it's not really adequate. A more serious flaw is the overall neglect of gender, and women's history in general. Though the book has been updated since the last edition in 1989, it has a vaguely archaic feel to it now, as if the perspective hasn't changed much since the Cold War despite the added detail. Still, it has many merits, not least an accessible style and the author's willingness to offer boldly-stated opinions. On balance, Markus Weiner has done well to make this new version available."},{"Title":"The West and the World: A History of Civilization from 1400 to the Present","review":"You can tell the book was recently used, maybe more then once.

I first saw the book walking through a store and picked it up only to open up to a page where a golf ball was stuck in a pile of poo.

If you are a golfer or going to be buying this book for a golfer I am sure they will get as much enjoyment out of it as I have.

Walter Moseley's work is a good example. Dashiell Hammett is another example In these cases, the most successful books also teach you something about the people and the time that you did not know before. Sue Grafton has reached into this genre by letting Kinsey's time pass more slowly than our own. As a result, the patina of age is becoming more significant and charming . . . especially in this book. Perhaps the high point here is in expressing sexual and personal mores of earlier times, in ways that resonated for me. I also found that Sue Grafton has gotten better at adding sub-plots, many of which served as good red herrings for what was going on. My biggest disappointment was that it was very easy to figure out who the murderer was, because the plot design meant that few would have the motive and access to execute this exact murder. In fact, I think this book was the easiest one to figure out in the series. My suggestion is that she go back before the second printing and change the murder to make it much more cloudy who the murderer is. I, too, was charmed by some of the new characters and hope that she will write more about her best designed characters in the future whoever they turn out to be in each book. If Sue Grafton was less talented, I would not bother to make these suggestions, but she is capable of lifting us to sublime new heights of ecstasy in future books. We should all encourage and applaud her when she moves in that direction. I also hope that the future books will continue to add that beautiful patina of the periods she illuminates."},{"Title":"Shooting from the Lip","review":"Through the polyester 70's and the tasteless 80's and into the 90's; Katie bops and boogies her way through life in this all singing, all dancing, all eating book.

Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as &quot;Read through it once and then never refer to it again&quot;.There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"},{"Title":"Great Pyrenees (KW Dog)","review":"For the price, this book covers enough of the basics of the breed to give you an idea if the dog is worth a more-detailed research. The 'care guide' section (which takes up about 1/3 of the book) is very general, it can apply to any dog. This book alone is not enough for any serious research.

It argues that wealthtends to concentrate because capital is moreproductive than labor, and so it calls forpolicies to compensate labor with capital insteadof cash."},{"Title":"The capitalist manifesto,","review":"The Capitalist Manifesto was written during the Cold War, when capitalism and communism were competing economic systems. In part one, Lou shows where he thinks Karl Marx made his big mistake and says:The path the capitalist revolution will take faces in exactly the oppositedirection from that taken by the communist revolution. It seeks to diffusethe private ownership of capital instead of abolishing it entirely. It seeksto make all men capitalists instead of preventing anyone from being acapitalist by making the State the only capitalist.Part two of the book is Lou's program for the \\"capitalist revolution.\\" It would help households become owners of corporate shares. They would pay for the shares through bank loans. Dividends on the shares would first repay the loans. After that, the dividends would be a major source of household income.Each element of the program calls for new legislation. One major government program would make credit easily available for households to invest in businesses. A \\"Capital Diffusion Insurance Corporation\\" would be federally chartered, to insure against some of the risks, such as the failure of a business to sell all of a securities offering and the catastrophe to a borrower from multiple business failures. This insurance is intended to lower the bank's interest rate so that the borrower's loan payments would be less than the expected dividends on the shares.To provide cash for loan repayment and household income, corporations would be required to pay out their entire net income in dividends. (Younger businesses could retain earnings for growth and reserves against risks.)Lou and I agreed about the need to broaden the ownership of capital and increase the number of individuals who could receive investment income, as a supplement to work earnings. We had three differences about how that could be done:1. Lou's programs placed an intermediary between the individual owners and the business. DPOs create a direct relationship between owners and management.2. Lou's programs require extensive government legislation and oversight. Direct offerings use the existing legal framework, without any special treatment.3. Lou's programs used Wall Street investment bankers, including Kelso & Co., in packaging and distribution. We have prepared electronic toolkits for use by the business itself in designing and completing direct offerings.Lou believed passionately that each of these three elements was necessary. He told me that the intermediary was needed because the new owners did not have the experience or training to manage direct investments. He said this was a temporary measure and could gradually be eliminated as more people became capable of capital management. In our direct public offerings, over 90% of the investors have never owned shares directly in a business before. Nor do they have an account with a securities broker. Nevertheless, our interviews show that they read the offering documents and perform the same \\"risk/reward analysis\\" as securities analysts and investment managers.Government intervention was necessary, Lou argued, because vast borrowings were required for workers to invest in businesses. The financial institutions would not extend that credit without government guarantees, tax benefits or other incentives. As to our direct offerings, one of Lou's followers referred to them as a \\"Marie Antoinette\\" response. (When told the French people could not afford bread, their queen reportedly said: \\"Let them eat cake.\\") The point of the comment being that households don't have money to invest, unless they can get loans that are repaid from the investments' income. However, we have seen that \\"workers\\" will choose to allocate money to owning shares in a business, rather than spend it on something else. The money is there, if it can be diverted from consumption. Government-supported borrowings are not necessary. (Ironically, Paul Samuelson, Nobel Laureate in Economics, referred to Lou's programs on television's \\"60 Minutes\\" as: \\"It really has a Marie Antoinette-ish ring to it. \`Let them own capital!'\\")Lou's programs are complex and require professional intermediaries and their advisors. The ESOP and all the other \\"_SOPs\\" involve creating trusts and intricate financing negotiations and documentation. There is clearly a role for investment bankers and their lawyers. Direct offerings rely on simple structures that have been used for centuries. We have demonstrated that they can be done without these financial engineers and sales forces.These differences do not detract from the benefits that I and many others have gotten from Lou's writings and examples of his theories in action."},{"Title":"The capitalist manifesto,","review":"This is one of those books that need to be read from front to back.

Yes, there is a heroine (Felicity), buteven she takes a backseat to this incredible man.Rafe may have been a rogue, scoundrel, cad, rake, etc in his previous years, but his is one mature male now. It does not take him long to realize he is on the path to maturity & making his family proud. He doesn't do what he does to make them happy, but it is a sideline benefit. He does what he does because Felicity is everything he has ever wanted, but he didn't know it. He spent most of his life either in the army or running away fromEngland on trips around the world, just to escape his friends &family (but especially his snooty friends).He uses his engineering skills to help out in the reconstruction of Felicity's birth home. He does not just supervise, he gets in there & does the dirty work, right alongside all the other workers, and does not give a hoot that he is the 2nd son of a Duke.His relationship with Felicity is wonderful, and his relationship with her younger sister, May, is great. It does not take long for him to realize that not only is he doing something he loves - carpentry - but that he loves Felicity & 8 year old May as well.I can't believe the chemistry between him & Felicity -- it is awesome -- and the excellent interaction & dialog between him &May. May is a very smart & very funny young girl for her age of 8 years. May thinks highly of Rafe and she does not let anyone say anything bad about him when she's around.Most of the characters in this book had integrity to the max.Rafe, Felicity, May, Rafe's relatives, and some of Felicity'sneighbors, all had loads of it.Now for the villian -- I do wish he had been killed at the end of the book, because sending him off to the constable wasn't adequate, in my opinion. He was the lowest form of low & most definitely a sociopathic character.This book, for me, ranks right up there with The Pirate Lord bySabrina Jeffries and The Duke & I by Julia Quinn as being the best historical (a.k.a. 'ton') romances I've read so far. I can't praise it enough.My only hope is that Suzanne Enoch & Karen Hawkins (who wrote Lady in Red) would get together & write a book for May Harrington & George Baker-Sneed (George is from Lady in Red). I think theywould be a great couple -- in about 10 more years! (Both are 8 years old in their books).I will most definitely read more Suzanne Enoch literature in the future, and I will absolutely keep this book and read it again.This book is NOT to be understated.As May Harrington says, \\"Rafe is 'top of the trees' and 'smashing'\\"."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"After an adventure in Africa in which he almost became the guest of honor at dinner, Rafael Michelangelo Bancroft is back in London gambling, but mostly avoiding his father. Tonight he plays cards at Jezebel's Harem in Covenant Garden when one of the other players, Nigel Harrington, tosses in the deed to his ancestral home, Forten Hall, into the pot. Nigel wins the property and plans to sell it to give him a stake to see the world.The worst that could happen has happened to Felicity Harrington. An arrogant rake now owns her family home. Felicity plans to save her family from the dire straits her twin brother Nigelcaused. However, when Felicity and Rafael meet, sparks fly. Soon love flourishes and plans are being revised. Still can a globetrotting rou&eacute; settle down as a gentleman farmer with a spirited English lass? Perhaps this can occur when love is the catalyst.Readers can not get enough of Suzanne Enoch's Regency romances. LADY ROGUE was simply great. BY LOVE UNDONE was incredible. Now Ms. Enoch does it again with the sequel (to BY LOVE UNDONE), TAMING RAFE. The story line is far from tame as the fast-paced romance will thrill the audience with its battle of wits, retorts, and unwanted love. Ms. Enoch continuously proves that there is plenty of life in the sub-genre.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"OK, I'm only 33 pages into this book, but one glaring error jumped out on pg. 14. Naming characters, especially recurring ones in serial books, should be consistent even if it's only a supporting character. Seems the male lead's mother, the Duchess of Highbarrow, \\"Victoria\\" Bancroft has mysteriously morphed into \\"Julia\\" Bancroft between books 1 and 2. No explanation. Her husband is still Lewis and he didn't appear to remarry. The sons are still Quin and Rafe and they speak of her as the one who gave birth & raised them. It's really poor writing (and editing) to let something like this slip. Maybe I'm just a stickler, but why call it a series, if you can't even remember the names you created for your characters.I'll finish reading the book, but I don't have high expectations. Yes, this is escapist genre writing, but lack of attention to detail prevents me from immersing myself in a story with such a blatant incongruity. Granted it's only one mistake, but I've only read 3 1/2 chapters. It doesn't bode well for the remainder. Glad I didn't buy the book.

After all, she appears to be one of the \\"big names\\" in the business, and has a loyal following.But I will not be counted among that number. This book started off well. It was funny and really grabbed my attention. While it's a well-used plot device, we all find the idea that the heroine, believing that the hero is bent on attack, beans him over the head, only to fall in love with him later, to be an interesting one. I was eagerly reading when the entertainment value of this book just started to fade out to nothing.After over 100 pages, I felt that I didn't know any more about the characters than I'd learned from the first ten. I find this annoying. Characters (especially the main ones) should become more and more real to the reader, so that by the end of the book, they feel like old friends. That wasn't happening here.Also, some of the things in the book just didn't seem to make sense to me. Like, how on earth does a woman alone manage to take care of all that livestock and manage the household tasks of cooking, cleaning and mending all by herself? Wow, she must be superwoman or something. Why on earth did she think that Rafe was insane? I didn't see anything in his behaviour that would have led me to think that he was nuts, yet the heroine decided that he was from the moment she met him, then hung on to that view. This got to be really annoying.I tried to get past all this and keep reading, but the book just couldn't hold my interest. I didn't feel like the characters were falling in love. It just felt like they were gripped in the throes of lust. While sexual attraction is necessary for a good romance, it needs to be handled more delicately than this for it to be satisfying to the reader. In other words, I like it to be a bit more on the back burner, while the relationship develops with tender feelings. Physical attraction should be present between hero and heroine, but it can't ben the only thing drawing them together. That was the case here.I couldn't make myself finish this, as my eyes kept glazing over as I read it and my mind kept wandering. I might read another of this author's books, but only if I don't have to pay any money for it. If you want really satisfying Regency romances that are keepers, I suggest the works of Sabrina Jeffries, Jacquie D'Alessandro, Mary Balogh, and Teresa Medeiros."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"Rafael Bancroft introduced in &quot;Love Undone&quot; is a Rake!

All he has to do is find a buyer and he's on his way.Unfortunately, when Rafe travels to Chesire to inspect his newly won property, not only has it fallen into ruin, but he is attacked and knocked senseless by the two remaining Harringtons -- Felicity and eight year old May - the sisters of Nigel Harrington. When Rafe finally comes to - it is to see the face of an angel - an angel that is going to throw a monkey wrench into his travel plans. How can he leave these two lovely ladies on their own with a roof about to cave in on them? His sense of honor (?) keeps him there - or is it something else - maybe attraction?This has delightful characters, wonderful dialog - fast moving and quite funny. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"When my language arts teacher recommended Suzannne Enoch to me as a romance author, I immediately ran to the bookstore to buy her books. I read By Love Undone first and I loved it, so I eagerly picked up Taming Rafe right afterwards. I loved the character of Rafe, who is still the embodiment of the perfect rake for me. He's so charming, noble, caring, funny, and charismatic that I just fell in love with him. However, in my opinion, the plot was boring and I got tired of the storyline pretty quickly. Even Rafe couldn't speed it along. The characters are quite lovable, including little May and Beeks, the butler. But the heroine, Felicity, didn't appeal to me all that much, perhaps because the story centered around Rafe so much. All in all, the book had great characters, but the plot just plain bored me."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"I don't usually read Regencies but I absolutely love Suzanne Enoch's books. I've read her Sam/Rick series and enjoyed them so much I decided to try her other books. I picked this up yesterday morning and read it in one day. It was very enjoyable. I loved the characters and found myself smiling through out most of the book. May was my favorite! I immediately went out and picked up her other ones and look forward to reading them. I don't think this will totally turn me on to other Regency authors, but I know I will be buying and reading anything the Suzanne Enoch continues to write."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"Julia Quinn, I think it was, wrote that you weren't alive if you didn't fall in love with Rafe Bancroft. Guess I'm living. I wasn't 1/4 of the way through the book before the delicious and delightful Rafe had captured my heart.Felicity is an excellent match for him, who quickly shows his natural talents as a father with her 8-year-old sister Meg, who's a splendid secondary character.The plot did not bore me, despite moments of feeling that we ought to get on with it, because it was so intertwined with the ups and downs of the romantic relationship. The villain's increasing villainy also helped to keep the tension up.This is a definitive feel-good book. It's witty and charming and romantic. And Rafe?...Ah, go ahead and fall in love with him. Everyone else has."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"Lovely book, however I am torn between a 3 and a 4 rating. Let me explain.Rafe is a rakish, dissolute, second son of a duke who is at 28 still rebelling against his daddy. Leaving England frequently on \\"adventures\\" but truely he is really lost for all life fulfilling purpose.Felicity is stunned to find out that not only did her brother leave her destitute in a crumbling estate but he also gambled it from underneath her and the new owner is said devil above.Ok good premise. It is funny, and the younger sister remindes me Diana in The Philadelphia Story. The story takes on mostly the view of Rafe and you get to hear about how he melts everytime our Heroine smiles...which is so very romantic.I have to say that perhaps I read to much into books of this type but I believe that people should have some accountablility for their writing otherwise it shouldn't be written. So here our my examples of things that should be accounted for...#1: In the beginning of the story Felicity sends Rafe out to sleep in the stable. From the previous descriptions of rain and delapidation, and that the entire estate, duties and all repairs are managed by only one woman...who is always mending stockings and such... I can imagine that the stable has no fresh hay to lay upon. It just rained and the stable leaks badly. Do you know what kind of infestations live there? Rotten hay isn't sweet...when was the last time it was even mucked out?#2: In order to fell their attacker (Rafe) May hits him upon the head with a tea kettle and that causes him to bleed. A lot. But next day his about town after sleeping in said stable, totally bloody. YUCK!! He doesn't even bathe til the next day.#3: Rafe lives with her unchaperoned in her own house. Everyone knows they are lovers and besides some gossip that is all that happens. She should be ruined by the mere innuendo.#4: Why the hell doesn't he leap to marriage the moment he took her virginity? He totally ruined her. What if she was pregnant? What a cad...I don't get the rest of the discussion in the entire book, he should marry her ASAP. The loss of her virginity goes completely unnoticed. Perhaps he feels that she is so lowly it doesn't matter to someone of her class.#5: How does one woman keep care of all those cows and sheep? We know of at least 42 cows...some are about to deliver. They need things, how does one woman do it? It just isn't explained and therefore should never be brought up.I am convinced that Enoch is so thrilled by her characters, which are good, that she just types mindlessly until her story is completely with little thought to these practicalities. I liked her book but I am aggrivated at these problems. I had the same problem with the other book Sin and Sensibility...it just wasn't thought out very well beyond what would happen to the characters.You won't be disappointed if you read this book...but may be you will see what I mean and can imagine a bit less vividly that I can."},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"This tale is a bit far-fetched, but I enjoyed it very much. Suzanne Enoch writes with much humor and charm!"},{"Title":"Taming Rafe","review":"Taming Rafeis the second of Suzanne Enoch's Bancroft Brothers books, the sequel toBy Love Undone. I really enjoyed it, but I would also highly recommend reading the prequel - it's the better of the two and one of Enoch's best IMO.SUMMARY:Rafael Bancroft (28), the younger brother of Quin Bancroft (hero inBy Love Undone) and the son of the Duke of Highbarrow is the \\"bad boy\\" of his family. They despair of him ever settling down or taking on any responsibilities (though this isn't really accurate, since he spent 7 years in the military). Rafe, wanting to cut his dependency on his family and find his own funding for his latest adventure - which he'll start in either China or India - is ecstatic when he unexpectedly wins an estate in a card game, figuring he'll quickly sell it and use the money to finance his travels. Unfortunately, upon his arrival he doesn't find what he expected, but instead ... a rundown estate with a house that is falling apart (and a west wing that has literally caved in), along with the two sisters of the man who gambled away Forton Hall who are completely unaware that their home is no longer theirs.To his great surprise, Rafe is inexplicably drawn to Forton Hall - and it's lovely residents, Felicity (22-23) and May (8) Harrington. Before he knows what he's about, he's making plans to tear down the stable and then building a new one, designing a new west wing and trying very hard to get rid of Felicity's far-too-friendly neighbor and would-be-suitor. A delightful hero and heroine with pretty good chemistry (isn't Enoch's best), interesting relationship development with obstacles to overcome that are realistic and well portrayed, *utterly charming* younger sister, and a bad-guy subplot involving a secret loan combine to makeTaming Rafean enjoyable read.CHARACTERS:Felicity is strong and independent; she's only 22 but has a great deal of responsibility, in charge of Forton Hall and raising her younger sister, Meg (one of the *best* characters of the book!). Her twin brother, Nigel, is basically good-for-nothing and only does harm to the family's finances and situation. When the book starts, part of the house has collapsed, they're buying everything on credit in the local village, and Felicity and Meg take care of all of the cooking, cleaning, etc. because they've had to let go of all of the servants.Rafe is a great \\"soon-to-be-reformed rake\\" hero (scar and all); he's intelligent, charming, friendly, and can be deliciously possessive and jealous. As Felicity points out at one point in the book, his problem isn't so much that he's not interested in anything or never has goals, but rather he is never allowed by his family to get fully involved with anything, because they're always dragging him back home, making him feel that everything he does is insignificant (his father didn't want him in the military). His relationship with Meg is absolutely adorable and one of the highlights of the book; she's so entertaining - especially when she's using slang and later starts imitating Rafe and using curse words.COMPLAINT:The living arrangement of the hero and heroine throughout the book is *completely* unrealistic - it's bad enough when Rafe, a complete stranger, sleeps in the stable (while the unmarried and unchaperoned Felicity and her younger sister are living alone right next door in the house), but when he then moves into the house with them ... Yes, there is some (very little!) gossip/eyebrows raised, but not really, which doesn't fit at all with the times. It's not even like Felicity is \\"firmly on the shelf\\" - she's only 22! However, I think slightly unbelievable plot aspects can be overlooked if the book is good enough andTaming Rafeis on the whole a great read."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt","review":"Having read a biography of Theodore Roosevelt 30 years ago it's amazing the light years biographies have made. Biographies until recent times had been little more than recitations of their life and times, but now are delving much more deeply into original source documents and completing a much fuller and more comprehensive picture of their subject. Biographers are also taking a much more multi-disciplinary approach pulling in sociology, psychology, history, political science and economics that make biographies a much richer read. You feel like you really understand them in the context of their times.Theodore Roosevelt by Nathan Miller is just such a read. Theodore Roosevelt is already a lively and entertaining figure and his life was like a movie anyways. Sickly child to Wildman of the West, Society Dandy to wily politician, scorned outsider to President. Miller captures it all in style that fairly crackles with life. His writing on the period of TR's entry to politics through to the Spanish-American War was so gripping I could hardly put it down. Miller pulls in a great number of archival and original sources to paint a much more complete comprehensive and engaging portrait of TR. I haven't read Edmund Morris's Theodore Rex yet, but hear it's equally good. The anecdotes Miller throws in showcases what a manic bundle of energy TR was, yet he lets TR live in his era. Too often revisionist historians try and impose today's standards on past figures. Miller eschews that and TR is really seen for the man he is.Theodore Roosevelt is a compelling read for those interested in learning more on him and the Progressive Era. I'd read this book as a companion piece to two courses I was taking last semester, Gilded Age and Progressive Era (HIST 4461) and US Diplomatic History 1890 to Present (HIST 3321) and it tied to both exceedingly well, providing great insight into the context of the times. As far as insight into TR himself I dare say Miller is far more objective than TR was in his autobiography and truly captures TR in most every respect."},{"Title":"Defiant Pose","review":"For those of you who grew up in the late 70's and who can relate, associate and/or identify with the skinhead and punk rock scene in Northern Europe at the time, this book is a must. It's sick, allright, but also very, very funny. Had me rolling on the floor. Rock'n'roll. A riot."},{"Title":"Defiant Pose","review":"Sort of an odd stew satirizing porn novels and English political extremists featuring an antihero skinhead as the catalyst for many things. Loads of over-the-top sex, violence and ideological debate make for a somewhat tiresome book. Not likely to appeal to many people."},{"Title":"Albania (with new Postscript): From Anarchy to Balkan Identity","review":"I had to do a paper on Albania and the only book I could find on \\"Albania\\" was this book. It is very useful because it gives the social and political background of Albania from post WWII era to the recent democratic changes. The book is not a guide but a study of the always changing political situation in Albania"},{"Title":"Albania (with new Postscript): From Anarchy to Balkan Identity","review":"When Lonely Planet named Albania its #1 tourist destination for 2011, I knew I had to find out more about this country. I discovered that there aren't that many books exclusively covering the country.This is a pretty good book for trying to understand what has occurred in semi-recent history in Albania. That's important because a lot of what they taught me in school had colored my viewpoint. For example, professor Donald Kagan (Yale) lectures that the Peloponnesian War started in what is now Durres, Albania. Even before that, there is the possibility that the Trojan War took place there, yet only a minority of historians holds that opinion.The chapters in this book that dealt with cultural topics were interesting to me. Some of the chapters on politics didn't captivate me mainly because there were so many accounts of historical figures that I had a difficult time trying to maintain my attention while reading. Others may experience parts of the book differently. As a whole, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Essential Managers: Achieving Excellence","review":"Since excellence in today's highly competitive workplace demands more than knowledge of your field, people skills are essential.If you want to develop your management skills and achieve your objectives, take a peek at this tiny resource book.
