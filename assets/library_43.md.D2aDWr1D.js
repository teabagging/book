I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \\"acceptable\\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have to say I loved this book. Most of the cogent points about this book have been pointed out already, so I'm not going to repeat them, but add some comments additional to what has been stated already.It's not Austen's best book, it's a simpler book than the ones that come after it, but that does at least make it easier to read - each successive book is a quantum leap in terms of style, narrative, dialogue and plotting over the previous, and Austen was changing the way novels would be written forever.Not that this is a bad book. Personally I liked it because it has something that's not so obvious in her later books, with the exception of Persuasion - the rock hard scathing judgment that comes accross in her letters - her obvious contempt for characters like Sir John Middleton, Lady Ferrars is searing in it's acidity.There are some excellent scenes - the scenes with Lucy and Elinor are classics in their own right, and the coup de theatre scenes when Edward bursts in on Elinor and Lucy, or Elinor throwing open the door after waiting for her mother when Marrianne is desperatly ill, instead finds only - Willoughby!Although the habit of the author colouring the narrative with her own opinions does get irratating at times, (a lesson she'd learnt by the time she wrote Pride &amp; Prejudice, which is neutral and unbiased) this still makes for a marvellous read. Marianne's sensibitility is breathtaking, and the revelation of how individual behaviour is fundamental in preserving the very fabric of society is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Did anyone else feel a distinct sense of disappointment at the revelation of the mercenary, materialistic nature of the otherwise handsome and dashing Mr Willoughby's character? However, I think Marianne's heart-break was eased by the stead-fast and loving Colonel Brandon. I love this novel. I had been forever avoiding experiencing any other Jane Austen novels for fear they would not live up to the high expectations created by the fabulous &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, however, when hearing of the imminent arrival of the fabulous Emma Thompson's adapted version at local cinemas, I decided to take the chance and read this book. I'm glad I did! This is another Austen gem. Elinor and Marianne are wonderful characters, as are all the others. If you are like I was and are afraid of spoiling your first Austen experience with another, don't be. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is another Austen triumph. Marriage, society and class are again given a unique Austen work over!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Being a fan of Jane Austen but never having read Sense and Sensibility, I approached this novel both nervously and excitedly. Reading any work by Austen is a delight, but I was worried this one wouldn't be as good as some of the others I'd read. However, I slipped into the language and time period effortlessly as I was introduced to the Miss Dashwoods and their plights of love and friendship. This debut novel by Austen is light, witty, and charming, and a complete joy from beginning to end.Both Elinor and Marianne Dashwood have fallen in love, but as the story progresses, we discover that both are going to face unrequited feelings in their relationships. Still, though slightly impoverished, the girls are taken under the wing of several friends who introduce them into London society and further the story with many twists and turns. Elinor becomes entangled in secrets she would rather not know, and Marianne plays into the drama of her love relationship grandly. As both girls come to realize what is really important, the story turns yet again and leads us into unexpected events. This is a truly engaging tale, and a terrific introduction to all of Austen's works.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"It took me a lot longer to finish up Sense and Sensibility than it really should have. There are several reasons for this and not one of those reasons is that the book is not very good or engaging- in fact, it is monstrous both. The school year started back up for me on Wednesday which took a lot of wind out of my sails and a lot of reading time out of my days. About a week before I decided to participate in the Austen in August reading even over at Roof Beam Reader's site I had purchased a copy of the Masterpiece Theatre/BBC version of Sense & Sensibility. I simultaneously watched the episodes while reading the book. I believe that this helped me to get a visual of what was going on as well as assisted in deciphering the prose of the time that the book was written in. I had seen this version a few times on PBS and I loved it very much so there were no spoilers for me, though it would have been nice to not know that Willoughby was such a scoundrel and that Elinor was going to marry Edward after all.Mmmmm.... Edward Ferrars....I enjoyed this book immensly, and I am almost ashamed to write this, but it is the truth and I'm striving to be more like Elinor in my life, which in one respect is to say more honest and so I must confess: I prefer the movie version better (the Masterpiece version, as I have not seen the Ang Lee version, yet.). I truly believe I prefer the screen version over the print because it was my first involvement with the story of the sisters Dashwood. If I had read the book first, I surely would prefer it.My favorite thing about this story is the fact that I could have easily been Marianne (or to a lesser degree, Elinor). Even in the 1800&#8242;s in England, girls still fancied boys who are jerks and girls still had a tendency to slight the good guys! When it comes to the opposite sex I have made numerous mistakes in my years of dating. I tend to choose the Willoughby over the Colonel Brandon and then rue the wasted time and the heartbreak caused by my own dumb choice. So, I didn't feel as embarassed and I didn't cringe as much regarding my past mistakes in dudes since Marianne was doing the exact same thing I did at her age: impulsively falling in love, flaunting it all over town, ignoring common sense, getting the short end of the gossip stick, you know, just basically acting in love and then getting dumped for the rich (in modern language: popular) girl and mooning over it for months. However, one part made me feel a little old maid-ish and a little pissed off-ish at Marianne:\\" \`A woman of seven and twenty' \\" (Egads, I am 27 years old!) \\"said Marianne, after pausing a moment, \`can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small\\" (very small, I work in public education), \\"I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.'\\" Gulp!I love Marianne because she is me, but my favorite characters were definitely Elinor and Mrs. Jennings. These two women are as opposite as night and day but I love them both for who they are. Elinor is so reserved and calm and cool and collected and everything that I just am not but that I strive to be. I love her for always keeping her cool and never going nuts and silently suffering heartbreak for MONTHS just to spare her sister and her mother from feeling heartbreak for her. If I'm heartbroken, I'm taking out a billboard and begging for sympathy and pity. Now, Mrs. Jennings, she is a hoot and a holler!! This is a sassy, brash little old lady that I pictured as Sophia Petrillo from the Golden Girls!The brashness, the sauciness, the rudeness, the likability of these two ladies is what makes them the bitchin' characters that they are. Neither of these ladies is afraid to lay on the innuendo and offend those around them, especially when it comes to relations! In addition to the talent of genuinely writing two such different characters that both become so love-able and appreciated and necessary to the rest of the story and the other characters, Austen also portrayed my favorite kind of character: the strong female. In an age of weaklings (see Bella Swan in Twilight) I am of the opinion that showing female characters, especially in this time when so much of their worth was dependent on the men in their lives. Austen blows that out of the water, and as the case with Willoughby shows, the MEN sometimes must be dependent on the WOMEN for money and status! Hu-zahhh Ms. Austen, Huzzah! Though each of her female characters are bad-ass women (even the deplorable Fanny- she knows how to turn John Dashwoods head and get EXACTLY what she wants, when she wants it, and how she wants it) they still find classy ways to tell each other to get bent, especially Elinor when dealing with that despicable Lucy Steele. This is what all women in every country and in all times should aim to be like and I am so thankful when I see these types of characters in books. So, thank you Jane for writing these characters into your works, and like Sophia would say, thank you for being a friend!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries.

It took several chapters for me to really focus on what Ms. Harker was even saying! Her British accent is lovely, to be sure, but goodness it is difficult enough to tune in and comprehend Jane Austen's elaborate style of writing even on a good day. Ms. Harker's inflections were a bit odd.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

With Sense and Sensibility, I finish a read through Austen's work with her first novel. It is a strange genre, maybe, but I think Austen wrote as much for men as women, and there is something in her male characters, good and bad, for us to think about.Why Austen appeals to the Marxist in me, I cannot really explain. Somewhere, on the edge of her books, the world is moving, rapidly, from a feudal society to one the Bourgeoisies. Maybe there is an idea in a rewrite of Austen from the servant's point-of-view. They are, as I read, only inches from the page.Sense and Sensibility is a decent example of Austen. The characters are well drawn and do not suffer the familiar defects. The story is somewhat predictable, but so are all her story-lines. The story resolves a bit too quickly and neatly, and it ends far too abruptly, but, again, it is the same with all her story-lines.With S&S;, I find that I cannot tell if Austen is parodying, as I have always believed, or if she is not, instead, pining for the world she depicts. I think her readers probably wonder that about themselves sometimes.Probably I did not give the book as much attention as I could have, as I read three of her books in quick succession through the spring and summer in order to finish (be done) with her from my reading list.None of Austen's work can really approach P&P; and so, for me, was somewhat disappointing in comparison. I have also since, read Wuthering Heights and I think it somewhat eclipses Austen on all points except, maybe, that of pure language."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have come to appreciate this more and more. I love austen's works and the struggling characters and emotions in this novel is so accurate that it's scary. The opposite personalities or sense of that keeps this book intense.

But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.And the DRAMA! My God! Did people during this time really act like this? With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments. We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts. People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility. It's insane! If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me.

Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, like some of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", has lost none of its charm and ability to entertain over the years. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are thrown on hard times by the death of their father. Living in straitened circumstances in a tiny country cottage, their prospects for marriage are set at risk in an age in which a young woman's first job was to find a good husband. The two sisters will pursue much different methods in searching for a suitable man. The sensible Elinor exercises almost superhuman patience in waiting for the man of her choice to make the right choice, while her emotional sister will throw herself into an impulsive love affair. Their lives will be further complicated by the well-meaning and often humorous interference of friends and relatives.Austen's talent for ingenuous plotting and excellent dialogue carry a superb story to a most interesting conclusion with an ambiguous moral that fans are still arguing about. For fans of Jane Austen, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth reading again; for new readers, find out what you missed; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"When Girlebooks decided to publish a bicentenary edition of Sense and Sensibility, they were faced with the dilemma of how to make it \\"different\\". Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \\"matchless match\\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \\"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \\"what's to come\\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which would have been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \\"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \\"Doctor\\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \\"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\\"Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \\"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \\"Biography and Criticism\\", \\"Authors Having Fun with Jane\\" and \\"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\\". There is also a complete list of Sense and Sensibility films--surely enough extended reading to satisfy even my enthusiasm for the subject!Sense and Sensibility, the Bicentenary edition is available in paperback, as well as Kindle/Mobipocket PRC, Adobe Reader PDF, Microsoft Reader LIT and Epub editions.

I saw it on the clearance rack for $2 at Half Price Books and just had to buy it. I was definitely not disappointed. I have two older sisters myself, and Elinor and Marianne constantly reminded me of them. My oldest sister is full of common sense like Elinor, always thinking of the outcome and how actions will affect her and everyone around her before she does them. On the other hand, my other sister is sensible and romantically charged like Marianne. She lets her emotions get in the way of her common sense and is in the \\"right now\\" instead of looking ahead to the future. Some of the situations they were in and the things they did and said also reminded me of myself and things that have happened in my life. Jane Austen did a wonderful job of making these characters \\"real\\" and easy to imagine actually living, breathing, and doing and saying the things she described. Even though I am only 16 and some of the ideas and language in this book were hard for me to understand and comprehend (I am trying to become more \\"well-read\\" and expand my vocabulary by reading books such as these), I was still easily able to relate to the characters and thoroughly enjoy this book.

Now that I have started downloading audio books to my iPod, I can wear my armband and get tons of things done around the house and go for long walks while having my favorite stories read to me. The best of both worlds! Sense and Sensibility is performed by Juliet Stevenson and she does a wonderful job. Her voice gets a little 'nasal-y' (I'm sure that's not a real word.. lol) and stuffy sounding at times, but I'm not sure if she does that on purpose to suit the characters.

They are vaguely unwelcome at their stepbrother and sister-in-law's home, but they don't have sufficient funds to live easily elsewhere. Luckily, a relative steps forward to offer them a home at a small cottage some distance away.The two older Dashwood girls, Elinor and Marianne, are of marriageable age, and begin scrambling to find appropriate matches. Elinor is attracted by Edward, an awkward man who is her sister-in-law's brother. The match is not approved by Edward's family, who is more well-off than Elinor, and they conspire to separate the couple. Elinor is reasonable and stoic, and bears her hurts quietly.Marianne, an impetuous and emotional girl, falls for Willoughby, a charming man who seems to have good prospects and who dotes on her and the family. But there may be trouble brewing in their relationship as well.I find Austen's novels to be a fascinating glimpse into the difficulty of life in England in the late 1700s. The society is so complex and so rigid, and the characters spend so much of their time trying to navigate their way through the social restraints before they are even free to try to fall in love and choose a spouse.I liked reading about the struggles and triumphs of the Dashwood sisters, although I found the ending of this story to be a little abrupt and not quite satisfying."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"A very difficult slog: this was written by an 18th-century woman, for 18th-century women (not even 19th!) And it was not even popular in its day. Few modern day woman would enjoy this book, and even, far, far fewer modern day men.Basically plotless (excepting cliches) and almost totally irrelevent to the modern reader (who marries for position nowadays?) The only value of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" at all is in its prose, but, here anyways, its quality is not high enough to be a saving grace. This was a stepping stone, but it is from here, next to the Bronte sisters, then to George Elliot before we get something half-tolerable to read, if we are reading for pleasure.Austen's prose is better than average, but it is not the perfect syllable/phenome-diction of some others. And there is nothing -- absolutely nothing else. In one scene, Austen attempts humor by poking fun at some random male character's superficiality, but her only effect is to highlight her own.If you have ever struggled with a Victorian era novel, you will be surprised here, by how much worse it can get. Though published in the early 19th century, this book was basically written in the late 18th century. Some 18th century books are readable, like \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" Some are even, in part, very good, like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" or \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" But the hit percentage was very low back then. The competition of years, of each author trying to do better than his or her influences or predecessors, had not really developed back then. There wasn't much evolution or refinement of entertainment back then because the market had yet to develop.Jane Austen not only never saw a movie, she probably never dreamed of one. She was writing in an agrarian age, before the invention of the steam locomotive or the telegraph. She probably had no conception of an edited, plot-driven story. Indeed, though the world she was living in was more similar to ancient world than ours, I would rate not one but several thoroughly ancient books as being far more meaningful and entertaining.I will be the first to admit most modern popular books are trash, but though this may be slightly better written, it is as superficial and brain-destroying as anything on the NYT's bestseller list. There is not a single scene of imagination, nor one character you can root for.

Yet, I kept reading and reading until I was done. I think I was determined to make some sense out of it. After words and words of whatever, the ending came to a short, brief end. To this day, I'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon, or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best. Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would have fallen for an idiot like Edward.The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous, and made no sense at all. For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense, made no sense. As to the rest of the characters, they were all ridiculous, pompous or stupid, and had no sense or sensibility at all.The film was much better.

Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century. As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it. This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships.

If you are not up to an extremely slow book, do not read Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book. That's because I dearly loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson. Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation. I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.But her style! Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.First, he wrote in \\"Remembered Yesterdays\\": \\"Jane Austen? Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\\"Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:\\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No -- there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen. I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen. I credit them with great patience and intelligence. I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task. Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness. There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done. If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then. If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category. I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot. But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"(Warning!! I do give hints to events in the book) Simply put the book is a romance novel that is very long and some what drawn out. It takes Austen pages to discuss how some woman brings her kids to social events so she can talk about them. Just imaging this going from one social event to another. I personally found the book sort of repetative after about chapter 18 of 50. It seems the only way the book is kept alive is by introducing new characters. If you are a fan of romance novels with one of those cheesy endings, then cheese it up with this four hundred page novel. I couldn't get any furhter than chapter 18, I got tired of nothing happening, specifiically action. Like in &quot;One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, which is an awsome book things happened. Not only that it was funny, but realistic enought to keep my attention. In conclusion if you like books were the entire novel revolves around the realtioships between people (soap opera) then this is the book for you other wise keep away."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Seeing how Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen barely makes any sense, I wouldn't even touch this book again, even if you paid me. Extremely long and mundane, Sense and Sensibility is a book that actually requires effort and stamina to go through the entire thing. To me, the three-hundred-and-fifteen-page book translated to absolute gibberish as I did not understand, nor really cared to understand what was going on.Seeing how the there was no purpose to the plot, I was left bored from the first word to the very last. I really did not see the point of writing a story about two well-off, high society women court other men. There was absolutely nothing interesting about that in the story. No one really cares if the ladies must suffer through heartbreak because in actuality, everyone does. Jane Austen could have done a much better job in piecing a more attractive and purposeful novel together.As I read, the more I learned about the characters, the angrier I got. Why does every character have to be a member of a high social status? To me, everyone was snobby, everyone was self-indulged, and everyone was too one-dimensional. The characters were too well-off to even sympathize with. I did not care or feel emotionally attached to any character whatsoever. Each individual was not self-motivated, and they came off as stuck-up characters. I was just waiting for someone to do something, but no, each character has to wallow in his or her own self-pity. People have worse problems to worry about than worrying about the problems the character has. I kept going through the story and saying, \\"So what? Who cares? Fix your own problems.\\" The characters were too detached to make me feel interested.All in all, the story was just bad. It lacked purpose and meaning. Although you have to admit Jane Austen constructs beautifully crafted sentences, sentence style could only take the story so far. If you have time to actually read this book, I suggest you spend your time doing something worthwhile instead of wasting your life on Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"....&quot;thoroughly unpleasant&quot; was how he found Austen's work, &quot;English in the bad, mean, snobbish, sense of the word.&quot;I wouldn't go that far, but those stilted paragraphs, those arid drawing-rooms, those aristocratic concerns and conceits (how to redo the parlor? How to arrange for the right guests to see it?) leave me completely exhausted. The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models. And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.But then I wonder: perhaps all this is some fantastic satire? Perhaps the pomposity and the Emily Postian fussiness is a deliberate attempt at humor?

If it wasn't for the fact that I had to read the book I would have never picked it up."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"This book is so much fun. It took me forever to read because I was just relishing in all the great stories Watts includes. He just packs them in. There is no fluff in this book, it's all meat, all great stories about the many, many people in wrestling he's come across. His language is really colorful. Watts was a bad, bad ass in his days and tells all the gory and violent details of many a fight. He holds nothing back, and praises the people who earned his respect and buries those who disrespected him. My only complaint is since Bill is another in a long, long line of born-again wrestlers he throws a few pages of \\"glory to Him\\" and \\"He is the light\\" and so on. A little too preachy for my tastes, especially in a rough and tumble pro-wrestler's autobiography. Be forwarned the last 20 or so pages is just Bill preaching a few sermons with no wrestling content whatsoever. Aside from that small blip, this was by far the most enjoyable wrestling book I've read, just inching out the classic by the Dynamite Kid (also highly reccomended)."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but after only a few chapters my disappointment was overwhelming. Bill Watts has a really interesting story to tell. Sadly, he forcibly and REPEATEDLY inserts his religous awakening into every annecdote in this book, thereby ruining the entire tale... Would NOT be a good addition to any library outside of a church or prison."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"Big Watts is a big fat egomaniacal gas bag. This blowhard can't help but come off as a narcissist of the highest order. Even though he is a 'born again Christian' he still can't help but tell pathetic story after pathetic story tooting his own horn about how tough he was, how crazy he was and how WATTS would SMASH, stretch or pluck somebody's eyeball out and you can just see his ego and pride swell. He is a carney. His ego was so big that there wasn't even enough room for his own kids. He ran them off with his obnoxious behavior too.Bill Watts is somebody that I hope I never meet and somebody I think that needs a lot of therapy. I hope he gets it."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"This self-indulged book by one of pro wrestling''s notorious heavy-hitters and egomaniacs from recent pro wrestling history, is a huge disappointment.For one thing, his legendary BIG and LOUD style doesn't transliterate well to the printed page --Watts is sitll obnoxious, too BIG and too LOUD; for another, his recollection of wrestling history during the late '60s to '70s and '80s is too self-interested and too self-serving, especially without documentation; third, if Watts were the clever guy he regards himself to be, why would he now be hard-selling an image of himself (that is so inconsistent with what we all know him to be) and yet another health-care product (not vitamins this time, but JESUS) if he didn't already know as much as he thinks he knows about his audience -- we're still all MARKS!But for readers interested in pro wrestling history during this time frame, Watts' self-interested account should at least be received as another view alongside others. Having studied many of these wrestling books in recent years, I still think that Wilson and Johnson's CHOKEHOLD is the Bible when it comes to describing (and documenting) pro wrestling history."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"For wrestling fans it is obvious that an autobiography by this legend is a must for the collection. But what is missing from his chapter on WCW leaves a big gap that cannot be ignored and ultimately detracts from the work.There was an angle aired during the Ron Simmons v Lex Luger \\"press conference\\" for the heavyweight title match where Lex uses a disgusting racial slur to draw heat (of the cheapest kind). The slur actually made it on the air on cable, but was cut when shown through syndication.Watts spends several pages on why he felt Simmons deserved the push to wear the championship strap, but fails to mention anything about the angle used that perhaps was the worst ever from a major promotion in a business not known for good taste.Simply, did Watts have a hand in creating the script? If he did, why did he feel he needed to fuel the fire of racisim to gain heat for the match? And, if Watts did not have anything to do with the angle, he certainly would have a recollection and opinion the issue.Watts remembers conversations he had with wrestlers like Sting concerning the use of steroids and has opinions on a wide-range of subjects, hence not addressing this issue really questions the validity of the entire book.The most moving section is excerpts of letters from young people when Watts was running the UWF. The words coming from youngsters with oftentimes terminal illnesses is very powerful. It shows the impact that wrestlers back when they worked territories for significant periods of time. They truly were seen as stars like pro baseball and football players & not like the cartoon characters that are seemingly pushed today.I simply wish Watts did not suffer amnesia on an issue that defined not only his management of WCW, but himself as a person."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"I never was able to see Bill Watts wrestle until You Tube. I was a fan from the WWA Los Angeles wrestling territory. I knew of Watts from Wrestling Revue or other 1960's wrestling magazines. Watts made numerous mention of the wrestlers from the 1960's and 1970's. It was a different era vs the 1980's,1990's, and current professional wrestling. If a wrestler became stale, they moved to another territory, then back. Today that really isn't an option for a WWE star. One thing came out loud and clear. The fans had more of a personal relationship with the wrestlers in earlier years. Pay Per View TV has distant the wrestler from the fan. In many ways it has contributed to the emphasis on the wrestler rather than the fan. Make no mistake about it, without fan support there would be no John Cena, Randy Orton, Sting, etc. The book covers both wrestling and promotion during the era well. Bill Watts is a Christian and so am I. Watts clearly delivers the Gospel message. It was though we attended the same Church. See John 3:16 (and not Austin 3:16). Someone said this book could have been reduced by 50 pages. I agree. I ended up skimming some pages or read them quickly. Overall, the book is a good read."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"I liked this book.

I would recommend this book to not only wrestling fans but anyone who wants to hear a truly inspirational story."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"My introduction to \\"Cowboy\\" Bill Watts was say the least, impressive! On KTBS Championship Westling Watts took on one of my favorites, Alex Perez. It was a frustrating match for Perez. Watts countered everything Perez threw at him. The coup de grace came by Watts hoisting Perez to his shoulder, carry him across the ring, then driving him into the mat. What an application of skill, strength, and talent. Watts meet my expectations by claiming the North American title and the the Brass Knucks title. He exceeded my expectations as a commentator. He brought a formal level of analysis and insight. On the surface he was a champion of justice. Now for the revelations of this book.Shockingly, parts his private life is full of horror stories. He airs it all in this book. It is not for the faint of heart. Watt's savagery in barroom brawling is say the least - unnerving! A \\"Hero\\"? Only if the script calls for it.. Opportunist? Well, the boot sure fits.There are humorous antidotes. For example: Danny Hodge, a gentle spirit blessed with Samson like strength, had a flair for practical jokes. I found myself laughing out loud from his pranks.The cliche: \\"You can pick your nose, but not your parents\\" is true. Therefore, on a personal side I identified with Watt's childhood. The abusive trails he suffered. It really struck a chord with me.Then, there were his amature years. Playing collegent football under \\"The end justifies the means\\" Bear Bryant mentality of heartless coaches. The big cowboy notes of thier personal brutality. Later in life Watts confronts a few of these type of coaches in a bar. Yeah, baby! It's payback time! I would have loved this book as a teenager!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"Bill Watts is a man who tells it like it is. He holds very little back in this book on his journey as a wrestler, promoter, booker and man.Watts is quite open in his discussions on his issues throughout hislife with anger, alcohol and marital infidelity.

I mainly know Cowboy Bill Watts as a promoter. His reputation often proceeds him - abrasive, stiff, and not one to mince words. Watts pulls few punches in his book, discussing wrestlers who let their personal demons get the best of them, who he got along with and who he didn't, and his own shortcomings as a business man, father, and husband.Watts talks about his upbringing, his days as a high school and collegiate athlete, his early days in the wrestling business as an active wrestler, working as booker and later as owner of his own promotion and its eventual demise. He also details his conflicts in WCW and working for Vince McMahon in the WWF/WWE.The names you expect are discussed from Bruiser Brody and Stan Hanson to Danny Hodge, The Funks, Gorilla Monsoon, Bruno Sammartino, Junkyard Dog, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Jim Ross, The Fabulous Freebirds, Dr. Death Steve Williams, Sting, Jim Cornette, and Dusty Rhodes as well as other wrestling promotions like the WWWF, the AWA, Florida, World Class, and Crockett's Mid-Atlantic.Throughout the book, Watts talks about his conversion to Christianity and his struggles he had working in a business that paid the bills but was in opposition to his personal beliefs.Good read from one of the best minds in the wresting business. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"Some very good insight, particularly in the early years through the Mid South days. Watts goes into few details about UWF and WCW. There are several chapters and pages talking about his religious beliefs. That's who he is. Overall I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption","review":"I started reading this book because I was a fan of Mid-South/UWF wrestling. My father used to bring me to the matches in Alexandria, La. When I started reading this book I almost put it to the side because I thought it would be nothing but a sermon. I have been having a crisis in my faith since my father died of cancer and I had a sister and nephew murdered.I am SO glad I kept reading. Not only is it a very eye opening story about the world of professional wrestling but the way he explained his Faith was very eye opening.If you are a fan of wrestling this is a great book.

Would you know what to do? Probably not. What falls in our lap with such emotional timebombs is a mixture of struggling with helping our loved one cope, dealing with their fears of the unknown and feelings of vulnerability, managing our own emotional reactions and sense of immortality, and navigating the rapids of historical dysfunction when trying to support a sick family member. This book tackles all of these issues through a diary format that takes us, not only into the heart and soul of the main character, but our own as well. With this book in your hands you no longer have to fret about what you would do. It is like having a best friend and personal guide in your hip pocket. A must read for anyone with heart disease in their family."},{"Title":"Stress and a Healthy Ticker: A Psychological Approach to Healing and Preventing Heart Disease","review":"Highly recommend!

I learned alot about how to prevent heart disease and also how to help my Mom in her recovery from a recent heart attack.

It starts out by having the three main characters, Will, Fritz, and Beanpole, travel to a sort of Olympics to be selected to serve the aliens as slaves in the city of gold and lead. They want to infiltrate the aliens' city to learn information that could help them save the world. Only Will and Fritz are selected to come to the aliens' city. When they feel they must escape, the two boys find a way to get out. They decide that swimming in a river under the city's wall is the best way to exit the city. Fritz tells Will that it would be too risky if both of them go. Fritz forces Will to leave him in the city. Once Will gets under the wall he finds Beanpole waiting for him. In the end, Will and Beanpole make the long journey back to the White Mountains.Critique of The City of Gold and LeadThe City of Gold and Lead, by John Christopher, is a science fiction story about two boys who are trying to save the human race from alien domination. I found that I had a lot of trouble trying to put this book down. As I was reading, I figured out why. It was because I would forget that I was reading and I would think that I was in Will's place. For example, when Will and Fritz were trying to escape from the city, I feared for my life and my friend Fritz's life when Fritz said, &quot;I'm not going to escape. They will suspect something.&quot; I think that this feeling was due to the fact that John Christopher's style of writing brings all of the characters to life. Although this book is not quite in the class of Isaac Asimov's science fiction stories, it is still a great science fiction novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an adventurous mind and likes science fiction."},{"Title":"The City of Gold and Lead","review":"In the second installment, the battle to free mankind continues in an exciting new adventure.

What would happen to the main characters: Will, Beanpole, and Henry? Will we ever learn more about the Tripods? And, of course, will the Tripods ever be defeated?&quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; answers some of these questions. It explains the Tripods and how they came to dominate the world and enslave mankind. It informs us of the new lives that Will, Beanpole, and Henry have in the White Mountains. It introduces us to the characters of Fritz and Julius who become major figures in the struggle against the Tripods.It also answers the question of the fate of Eloise, the beautiful girl who Will befriended in &quot;The White Mountains.&quot; (It is disappointing that the ONLY female characters of any importance in the entire trilogy are Eloise and her mother, the Comtesse.) Personally, my favorite part of the series was Will's temptation by the good life at the Castle of the Red Tower where he met Eloise. In &quot;The White Mountains&quot; Eloise said goodbye to Will forever because she had been chosen to serve the Tripods in their city and would remain there as a slave for the rest of her life. One of main reasons I felt compelled to read &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; was to find out what happened to Eloise and would she ever be freed from that slavery. The reader will discover the answer to that question at the Pyramid of Beauty in &quot;The City of Gold and Lead.&quot;Although &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; answers many questions left from &quot;The White Mountains,&quot; it also leaves the reader with new questions about the fate of a major character, the conflict with the Tripods, and the future of mankind.

In fact, I was a little sad when I finished it, but the cliffhanger for the next book lifted my spirits.This book was the second book in the series, The Tripods. It began where the last book ended, The White Mountains. Friends Will, Beanpole, Henry, and other people that lived in the white mountains were completing their training to try to get in the games. The games are like the Olympics. The winners of the game would go on and serve the master in the City of Gold and Lead. The City of Gold and Lead is where the tripods live. Tripods are evil machines that take control of your mind using caps. Will, Beanpole, and another boy named Fritz were accepted to go to the games. Henry had to stay back because he was not selected to participate in the games. Both Will and Fritz won in their sports category. They now had to serve the masters because winners were considered strong and fearless. However, the real purpose of a winner serving a master is to gather information on the dreaded Tripods. If by chance the winner escapes, he will be able to take the information back to his land. No one has ever been known to escape. I will not give away any secrets and reveal if Will and Fritz escaped. You will have to read the book to find out.I found the entire book exciting. The characters are very well developed. At the end of each chapter, I was anxious to find out what happened next. The book ended with a spectacular cliffhanger. When I read the last sentence, \\"We would come back,\\" I instantly wanted to read the next book in this series.I recommend this book for ages 12 to 101 years old. This is a great book waiting to be read. After you read this book, you should also read the first book and the preface book.

What he finds is some exciting information, but he must find out how to escape the CITY OF GOLD AND LEAD. Gold, because that is what everything is made of, but lead because the gravity is so high in the Master's city that every bone and every muscle in Will's body is dragged down.

The descriptions of the city were captivating and the plot was excellent. I couldn't put the book down. I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"The City of Gold and Lead","review":"The second book (or third, if you consider the prequel the first book) in John Christopher's massive Tripod series. Continuing where, \\"The White Mountains\\" left off, the book follows the adventures of Will and his fight against the Tripods and their alien masters. The book furthers our knowledge about the invaders of Earth and their personal lives. Will and a fellow uncapped boy are given the chance to enter into the home of the Tripods. Once there, Will finds himself a slave to one of the aliens that live in the city and his companionship with this creature leads to further knowledge. This book also marks the point at which Will learns of the aliens' final solution (referred to here as The Plan) for earth's original inhabitants.I found myself enjoying this book far more than \\"The White Mountains\\" itself. Though the first book in the series was far more action packed and filled with gripping chase and escape sequences, the second book is filled with fascinating descriptions of the Masters and their alien lifestyle. This is the kind of book we've been waiting for. Who are these creatures that fit every human with a silver mesh of a cap, making them docile and compliant? Where are they from? How extensive is their knowledge? And, most importantly, how can they be beaten?Christopher has inserted a clever handicap into this tale that keeps Will from doing anything rash or careless. Neither Will nor his fellow uncapped slave can reveal their true intentions. From the moment they enter the city of gold and lead (so nicknamed for its design and intense gravity) to the moment they are supposed to leave, our heroes mustn't reveal to the Masters that they are uncapped or that a resistance has been planned. The writing in this tale never lingers unduly and the narrative is crisp and swift. Even reluctant readers will breeze through this tale, stopping to marvel at the amazing world the author has created within the boundaries of the city.I'll admit it right now. Until this book I never really noticed the similarities between this series and H.G. Wells' remarkable \\"War of the Worlds\\". Certainly both stories rely on the world being conquered by huge tripods from outer space. In both cases, the aliens responsible for earth's enslavement are unwilling to consider human beings' rights. But the final similarity, and the most striking, is the physical resemblance between the aliens found here in \\"City of Gold and Lead\\" and the Wells classic. Both books contain aliens that have tentacles and can't breathe Earth's air. Has Christopher stolen his ideas and made them palatable to children? Perhaps. If so, I've no real objection to his strategy. Slightly more infuriating is his continued dismissal of women in general. If there are female aliens, we're never told of them. As for the girls sent, like the boys, to the city to work as slaves for the Masters, they are quickly dispatched. Apparently Christopher reasoned that while men can handle physical labor and pain, girls cannot. As such, women are killed and the most beautiful amongst them are placed in glass display cases to be observed. Forget trying to search for any symbolism here. It's obvious that the aliens, in addition to being wholly male, are just as sexist as their human counterpoints. While the first book in the Tripod series had a few weak willed females here and there, this book hasn't a single living woman in it AT ALL. This is fairly weird, even for a boy's adventure novel. So on a level of one to five (one being the least chauvinist and five being the most) I'd place this book squarely at 4.7.Otherwise, I've no objections at all. The book is well paced, well written, and well thought out. All in all, a delightful read that makes one even more eager to read the final chapter in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The City of Gold and Lead","review":"WHAT A GREAT STORY, PERFECTLY WRITTEN...RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, IT SWEEPS YOU AWAY LIKE ON A MAGIC CARPET RIDE, AND YOU DON'T WANT THE RIDE TO END!!!!...A GREAT AUTHOR....AND AN EXCELLENT SELLER...THEY SENT THE BOOK AT TOP SPEED....AND I WILL BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!

It is the third book of the Tripods series written by John Christopher. The other books in this series are When the Tripods Came, The White Mountains, and The Pool of Fire.If you have read The White Mountains you have probably noticed that there are many questions that have been left unanswered. This book will answer many of these questions but will also produce more questions that are left for the last book in this series, The Pool of Fire. After you have read the whole series you will find that all of these books go very well together.What this book is really about is aliens that invade the earth. They are in giant tripods that are currently ruling the world. They give anyone over the age of 14 a cap which makes their minds controlled by the tripods. One problem about the earth, to these aliens, is that the earth's air is poisonous to them. Because of this they have to live in cities built for them, in a tripod, or wearing a mask. Right now only their cities are filled with the air that they can breath, but they plan to eventually do this to the rest of the world which would kill the human race and any other living thing on earth.As you would probably assume, there is a group of people who are fighting against these aliens. They have to defeat them before they take over the whole world. Two people from this group, Will and Fritz, were sent into the City of Gold and Lead to find out more about these aliens, but they have to get out and escape before they are too weak and die.I'll leave the rest of the book for you to figure out. However, I would like to say this is a great book and I highly recommend reading it.

When Will accidentally kills his master, the two, however, must fight against all odds to escape or risk being captured by the Tripods.Will they be able to escape the City of Gold and Lead?

Tap doesn't want to get involved and tries to make sure that Tom and his friends, Johnny Lubec and the Cajun, from getting into trouble. But the Munsons, led by the gun-slick Jackson Huddy, catch on to what they're doing and try to steal the herd. It's up to Tap, along with Tom and some trust worthy friends from the war, to keep the herd safe.Louis L'Amour is such a good writer that it is so hard to say which are his best books because all of his books are superbly written. \\"Matagorda\\" is no exception. The characters are all great, with the main character, Major Tappan Duvarney who is handsome, brave, fast with a gun, yet smart enough to know when not to use it.

I will not go into any more detail but this story is a real life version of the Prodigal Son. If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, it has been out of print for many years, it will be worth the price that you will pay for it. The author Father Raymond Flanagan OCSO died about two decades ago and was a prolific author from the forties to the eighties.

This is not faint praise. The question is, how come nobody in America has ever heard of her and you can count her works in translation on two fingers? This slim volume is not enough for me to make any judgements of her worth or talent.Bombal writes stories that border on fantasy or horror. In the first story, actually more a novella, &quot;The Final Mist&quot;, she writes about two cousins who marry each other a few months after the man's first wife has died. He cannot forget his dead wife and she merely married him to keep from being a spinster. So she seeks her satisfaction in other places, meeting a strangely supernatural man in the streets one night. &quot;The Tree&quot; also concerns a marriage. In it, the wife, Brigada, comes to the realization that she no longer knows why she married her husband. &quot;The Unknown&quot; was to me the best story of the collection since it lacked all sentimentality. It was about a pirate ship that gets sucked down to the bottom of the ocean by a whirlpool. When the crew wakes up they find themselves in a desert whose sky is simply a reflection of the sand. &quot;New Islands&quot; shows the conflict between two men as they covet the same married woman even as strange volcanic islands form off the coast.After reading this too brief collection, I want to read more by Bombal. There's just not enough here to get any feel for the writer. She does make you feel uneasy and when she gets the horror elements going it really works. Her relationships do verge into the sappy at times though. I also feel that this collection was manipulated in some way to try to portray Bombal as some feminist champion, as mentioned in the book jacket. I would like to find one of her novels, but I doubt I will find one in English."},{"Title":"Love and Sex in Plain Language","review":"A terrific book that my mother gave to my sister and myself 20 years ago (we were about 11 and 9, respectively).

Another shortcoming of the book is that it deals in 'terms and concepts' only, and does not touch upon personalities. There is not a word about Freud and his contribution to Psychology in this work. Many of the definitions are of broad medical terms and not specifically psychological ones."},{"Title":"Welfare, Work and Poverty: Lessons from Recent Reforms in the US and the UK (Civil Society)","review":"This is a very well written book in the sense of being grammatically correct and very persuasive in the logic of their arguments.I take issue with the overall tone of the book in one particular but fundamental area to which I shall return later.In the case of welfare reform, it is clear that all western industrialised societies are now facing a fundamental truth. The idea that public expenditures can keep on growing, financed through taxation to maintain nationalised industries and socialised programmes is one which is well past it's sell by date. Even today, over four years since this publication was produced, the paragon of socialized provision, Sweden, is learning that they cannot squeeze ever more money out of the private, productive sector or even individual consumers.That being said, social programmes, often despite the best of intentions have repeatedly been shown to have unitended consequences which are far reaching in their impact and which often create increased demands on the welfare state.Others have shown how welfare programmes can enslave huge numbers of the population and create an underclass of people who become disenfranchised from regular society. There has, to considerable degree been a convergence of views between right and left over the detrimental effects of over-generous welfare programmes although I would hesitate to say that there has yet been a meeting of minds upon the subject. Some left-radical figures such as Frank Field have thought seriously about such issues and have suggested reforms to the systems but often those who adminster government recoil at implementing what are often very radical socutions which will have short to medium term political repercussions which will in turn affect those who introduce them.As far as the concern for learning the lessons for recent reforms is concerned this little pamphlet will add to the debate which must continue as there is a long way to go and is a useful contribution to that debate.Norman Dennis' contribution however, brings me to another side of the debate which is less savoury. Dennis takes on the notion of sexual liberation which to me is a fundamental attack on the rights and roles of women in society. The tone of the article is clearly articulated attack on the right of people to form some sort of union with other people rather than form a permanent relationship in the form of heterosexual marriage. Dennis supports his attacks on the inadequacies of alternative arrangements throgh the use of published statistics and anecdotal tales of local events. He sets up the straw man only to knock it down again. He belittles the portrayal of strong women in the media by arguing that these are all women of independent means and who are not typical of the population in general. What he is suggesting is that this is propaganda from those in society who wish to undermine our society and who have no regard for a more conservative view of the evolution of society came about. By doing so he suggests that traditional family values are eternal and have proved time and again to provide benefits to those involved in them and which will be lost in the tsunai of radical change.Dennis is very persuasive here and articlates a vision found in earlier generations of politicians who long for a mythological golden age when women were happy with their lot and did not mind depending on men for their fulfillment. This view permeates across the left and right boundaries of politics.It suggests that women are not capable of holding careers and being involved in family life unless they have independent means and that is the chink in the armour.The answer is to assist women in attaining that financial independence and increasing their ability to participate in society as individuals and not as people who can only achieve that success by marrying into wealth. The notion that only some form of marriage rite endorsed by the state is the only institutional arrangement that can benefit both participants is laughable. A more likely scenario is some form of private, legal contract between the two parties can achieve similar if not even better results. What is at issue here is that we are currently in a form of societal organisation where in some respects women are equal to men but not in others. Equality of opportunity does not need to involve social programmes of housing and child support. It may need to provide some of those things. Women are however, burdened by an inequality of chances to play the game in the same way as men. They are not as easily likely to achieve financial independence which would allow them to compete and it is this which must be dealt with. Sexual liberation is one thing. True independence is another. Reasserting traditional marriages will not help either."},{"Title":"THEN HANG ALL THE LIARS","review":"Great mysteries situated in the south are definetely Ms. Shankman's forte.

Forrest, in her Kate Delafield series manages to present a tight, taut mystery along with a political statement, which she doesn't present in a heavy-handed manner. The two just seem to blend seemlessly and if you want to ignore the message (if you can), then you can simply enjoy the mystery. Kate and her dullard partner, Ed Taylor, investigate the murder of Teddie Crawford, a very &quot;out&quot; gay man. In fact, even he calls himself a queen. Teddie was stabbed about 40 times, which indicates to Kate that it was more than just a simple robbery. The first half of the book describes Kate and Ed cornering the killer. The fact that the killer, himself, was hurt badly is a big help to Kate as well as the description given by one of Teddie friends, Gloria. Watching Kate using her interrogative skills to trap this man is very tense, especially since she knows that without a confession all they have is circumstantial evidence. As good as the &quot;law&quot; part of the story is, the &quot;order&quot; part is really more fascinating and suspenseful. Kate has found out that the killer's attorney is someone she knows slightly but someone who knows her secret. Throughout the trial, she wonders how he will try to bring it out and taint her testimony. Sadly, no matter what the outcome of this fictional trial, Forrest shows that gaybashing is alive and well in these United States."},{"Title":"Murder by Tradition","review":"I read this book in one afternoon.

The author has learned at the knee of many traditional quilters. She carefully studied old quilts in order to discover the techniques that were used. Without our modern tools, quilters of old often had to make do. They folded the fabric and cut it with scissors to make flowers, leaves and stars. They positioned the appliques using their hands and fingers to measure, not washout marking pens and fancy grid rulers. Their quilts are less than perfect.This book contains patterns, with yardages and applique templates, but the shining gem is the extensive instruction on how to work the applique in the old style. The author does all her applique and quilting by hand, and all instruction is geared toward that, but there is no reason a person could not use these same concepts with invisible machine applique. There are other books that go into more detail about needle turn applique, hand quilting, etc. This book is about getting that \\"less than perfect\\" look.

Ms. Wallace puts into words what our culture has experienced in thought, action, and deed since our ancestors came over on the slave ships. The language is raw and very explicit, but so is our torrid relationship with ourselves and others outside of our race. I can readily see why she experienced so much backlash from the Black community back in the day...she exposed our 'ills' long before we were ready to deal with them. So, if you're ready for the facts, read the book; the truth that follows (and what you do with it) is of your own making!"},{"Title":"Believe in Miracles but Trust in Jesus","review":"The central theme in \\"Trust In Miracles But Trust In Jesus\\" is that while Jesus Christ performed miracles while on earth, he did so to direct people to their real need - a personal relationship with Him. The same things applies to us today. While we have certain needs today (new job, restored health, improved relationships, etc.), what we really need is a relationship with Jesus Christ and to look to Him and not just a miracle.The book centers around some of the miracles Jesus Christ performed:1. Changing water into wine.2. Healing a nobleman's son.3. Healing the crippled man.4. Feeding the 5,000.5. Calming the storm.6. Opening a person's blind eyes.7. Raising Lazarus from the dead.In each chapter Dr. Rogers describes the miracle performed and the ultimate message behind each miracle - our ultimate need is found in Jesus Christ for Who He is and not just for what He can do.The book is readable and flows freely like other books by Dr. Rogers.Read, enjoy, be encouraged, and be challenged to not to just look to Jesus Christ for what He can do for you, but ultimately for Who He is - the Savior of the world!Recommended."},{"Title":"Believe in Miracles but Trust in Jesus","review":"I had the wonderful blessing to be under Dr. Adrian Rogers' teaching as he pastored Bellevue Baptist Church for over 30 years. He was truly a man who loved and served his Savior, Jesus Christ. Everything Adrian Rogers was about, whether preaching, writing or ministering was to simply point people to Jesus, which is the greatest thing any of us could ever do. Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven; He loved each and every person who has ever or will ever be born and died on the cross to pay for their sins, so that having placed their trust in Him, they can experience God's forgiveness and gift of eternal life. This book, Believe in Miracles But Trust In Jesus, serves that very purpose - to point us to Jesus. And Adrian Rogers does it with so much love and simplicity. It is my desire, and I know Pastor Rogers', that you come to know Jesus personally. Don't miss reading it. Definitely, my highest recommendation for a book!"},{"Title":"Colonial Printer","review":"If you are interested in the printing trade of colonial America then this book is an excellent starting place.

If you're thinking about jumping into the Malazan series, run (don't walk) to the store, and start with Book One (Gardens of the Moon). Read it twice. Then read it again after getting through Bonehunters, because you'll be amazed at the level of detail and foreshadowing that exists.If you've read the prior books in the series, do you really need a review to influence your decision to purchase ? Steven Erikson is some kind of freak. His ability to churn out absolute mammoth books, filled with unbelievable complexity, imagery and stunningly intriguing characters is unparalelled in modern fantasy, and Reaper's Gale is superior, even for him. While I loved Midnight Tides (especially Tehol Beddict), this volume is great, as it involves the further adventures of all your favorites ... and you begin to see the really big picture that ties everything together.As far as I'm concerned, the only fantasy authors fit to even exist in the same discussion with him are Tolkien and George RR Martin. And as much as I like George, Erikson's ability to churn out 900 page masterpieces EVERY YEAR just gives him the edge. Erikson once again has treated us to a full unvailing of the Warren of Brilliance. In fact, it's frustrating for me that Amazon only allows me to give a 5 star review, because if some sad people out there think Terry Goodkind's pablum deserves 5 stars, then Reaper's Gale needs to at least be given 14,000 stars."},{"Title":"Reaper's Gale: Malazan Book of the Fallen #7: (UK Hardcover Steven Erikson)","review":"Another great addition to the \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" series.Erikson's latest book (the 7th in the series) is set in the locale of Lether; an area that has been conquered by the Tiste Edur but is stilled \\"governed\\" by the Letheriis (with some non-too subtle direction from the Edur).

He has thought out each book in advance and how all the main and side characters interact leaving a breathtaking glimpse into the world he has created. If you decided to go back and chronical all interactions and time frames I am sure they would match up perfectly.

That being said, I thought Reaper's Gale was a fine addition to, bar none, the best fantasy series out there. I did like the way Erikson tied the Lether and Malazan empires together and brought the storylines from Midnight Tides and The Bonehunters together.Here's some of the things I didn't like. The Icarium storyline. I just still cannot see where this is going (though he is one of my favorite characters). The inserting of the White Face Barghast seemed very forced. How did Tool become warleader? Why are they in Lether? The Gray Swords. Huh? Where did they come from?Here's some of the good: The coninuation of the Bonehunters. They actually get to see significant action. Tehol Beddict. Is there a cooler character than Tehol? And the bantering? Inspired. Karsa Orslong's continuing development. Who can't help but love such an arrogant, and rightfully so, character.The death of a some very important characters left me stunned, but that is to be expected. All in all, a worthy addition to Erikson's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Reaper's Gale: Malazan Book of the Fallen #7: (UK Hardcover Steven Erikson)","review":"Erikson will answer all our questions with his next book, he is an archeologist originally, so he writes in layers, revealing the truth. Most of the questions asked by other reviewers are answered in previous volumes or even reading this book more closely-Tool married the Barghast warchief's daughter and he came to help Toc. I'm also sure the mystery of Red Mask will become clear. The presence of all parties will be explained in subsequent volumes. AS FOR THE \\"TRIPE\\" reviewer, Erikson's plots are intricate and built upon magnificent characters and their relationships. One must read all of his books to understand the current book. Unlike Goodkind, his plots don't repeat the exact same formula in each volume- SE's plots expand the story and are filled with surprising developments.Read the Malazan series if you enjoy gritty, heart-pounding action, compelling personalities and character interaction.

Therefore, perhaps I am not a fair judge I haven't read the previous books in this series. Nevertheless, one should be able to pick up in the middle of a series and get more out of a book than I did.PROS:- High word/$ ratio.- Prose flows fairly swiftly, although awkward at times.CONS:- Too many characters (50+) - hard to follow- Too many parallel stories- No main protagonist/hero- Endless filler and unnecessary detailIt's said that good writing involves sharing what the main events, skipping the boring stuff. For example, you don't need to know when the hero goes to the bathroom. Not surprisingly, Erikson, at one point in this novel, shares about a MINOR character desire to go to the toilet and having to take off his armor to do it. Must of the novel consists of random side stories that don't really move the story forward.CONCLUSION: It's said (for garage sales) that one person's junk is another one's treasure. For me, the myriad of details in this book were often useless junk. For others, it might be a fascinating way of fleshing out the world or the characters. I prefer tighter storytelling. At 1,200 pages, this is not tight. With no obvious hero, there is no focus. If you like a fantasy that is written like a soap opera, then you will like this. It is epic in length, but not in quality."},{"Title":"Reaper's Gale: Malazan Book of the Fallen #7: (UK Hardcover Steven Erikson)","review":"Seventh Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, REAPER'S GALE is only for readers already entrenched in the saga. I find the series awesome, but this particular volume is a bit tedious and occasionally confusing because of the numerous changes in viewpoints, and because it does represent the middle of the story where all authors tend to bog down. Fans do need to read it, though, in preparation for promised volumes 8-10. But even with this bogging middle, Steven Erikson still remains one of my favorite authors because of his diverse skill with words, the incredible density of his story-telling, and because of his talent for taking reader emotions through an entire spectrum in just one page.So, what is REAPER'S GALE about? We're back in Letheras (which I finally understand now to be in the same time as the Malazan Empire, just on the other side of the world). Irate Malazans--peeved for the Edur attack on their fleet, and with nowhere else to go--follow the Edur back to Letheras with the intention of repaying the favor. As Malazans attack Letheras, the people of that empire have problems of their own. Numerous subplots follow:1. Letherii Acquitor Seren Pedac, Fear Sengar, runaway slave Udinaas, and Tiste Andii ascendant Silchas Ruin as they search for the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye;2. Destitute resident Tehol Beddict and his elder god friend continue their plot to financially ruin Letheras;3. Many other Letherii are engaged in sedition against their Edur masters;4. While other Letherii and some Edur are working together on their frontier border with a violent expansion project;5. And the Edur emperor Rhulad is oblivious to all but challengers to his throne because of isolating sedition;6. ...can anyone kill Rhulad so he'll stay dead?...7. And of course, we continue to follow Trull Sengar, his Imass friend Onrack, and their new companion Ben Adaephon Delat as they seek something not even the ascendant sending them will describe;8. While Jaghut ice begins to melt (there's something horrifying in there...);9. And treachery between the gods, ascendants, and their chosen wizards/mages/etc as magic finds new, clashing pathways;10. and the usual mix of ghosts, undead, and bloody battles withmany other subplots not even mentioned'The ending--both hilarious and heartbreaking--makes this read worthwhile, and I am already missing my daily dose of Erikson [alas--(in-joke grin)], for no other author can compare. ~kc"},{"Title":"Expository Dictionary of Bible Words: Word Studies for Key English Bible Words Based on the Hebrew and Greek Texts; Coded to the Revised Strong's Numb","review":"This is a decent dictionary, but it's not as good as the complete word study dictionaries.

Indeed, it could have been dry as hay. But Smith crafts a convincing narrative out of his materials, no small feat in a work of this length. In its scope and balance, this work is too impressive to be given just two stars. Instead, I think the following conclusion from a review in The Journal of Interdisciplinary History is more on target: \\"Yet, in spite of the daunting nature of his task, Smith must be judged overall to have written a successful synthetic treatment of his many-faceted subject. The writing is compelling and often sparkling. The thinking is always informed. This is a book that serves many functions: It should be a standard reference, a work that one dips into for the sheer pleasure of reading bits and pieces, and an essential study of the problems underlying a history of the human sciences.\\""},{"Title":"Norton History of the Human Sciences","review":"This is a big, thick, very boring book from a man who nevertheless knows his subject well. It's basically a history of how the \\"human sciences\\" (sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, etc.) got started and developed over the years. There are no graphs or pictures; it's all narrative.Alas! This is a aggravatingly stuffy slog, although, as I say, you can't complain about its thoroughness. The problem, in my view, is neither the subject matter nor the approach: it's Smith's writing style. If you don't actually have the book in front of you, it's possible to convince yourself that it might be worth your time. No. So dry and lifeless is the writing that the book's other merits (e.g., the versatility and erudition with which the different disciplines are interwoven) never have a chance to see the light of day.True, I was expecting a lot from it: the development of the social sciences is a very fecund subject; I guess I was hoping it would be as engaging, as riveting, and as thought-provoking as, for example, one of Boorstin's outings.And what a shame, too, since this could have been written so much better. In a way, I'm hoping hope that somebody here will rush to this book's defense, since the author obviously put a ton of work into it. But even so, that wouldn't make it a better read.In short: a fertile subject, but one that, sadly, still awaits a magisterial treatment."},{"Title":"The Atonement of Mindy Wise","review":"Wanted to correct previous poster.

This book shows how a girl who did not take the short cut to growing up. Her life is just like all the rest of ours. This book is related to a lot of books that I have read dealing with problems in life and sins. The book is told by Mindy and takes place in a church where she is repenting her sins to the Jewish god. The book is telling you all of her problems, and how she deals with them.

After a chapter on the P-36/Hawk 75, it examines the P-40 prototypes, P-40CU and P-40B/C, P-40D/E, P-40F, etc. The chapters on the main production models feature a one-two page summary of that aircraft, two-four b&w;/color photographs and beaucoup pages of color side-views. The P-40N chapter, for example, has eight pages of profiles depicting some 32 P-40s flown by different units and/or air forces. Generally the profiles seem accurate; likewise, the color schemes. There are also sections on P-40 users, nose art, differences between models, Flying Tiger markings, etc.The problem, as always, lies in the text. It's poorly done with typos, poor syntax and, especially, run-on sentences. One sentence is a paragraph long!

Acronyms exist without a glossary listing of them, so the only way to know the acronym is to flip back in the book until you find the location it is first used - fun for a >600 page book."},{"Title":"Medical Neuroscience, Updated Edition: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access, 1e","review":"when I first recived this book it seemed great, it was very colorful, has many diagrams and clinical case presentations that you may see on the USMLA. However, over time, it seemed difficult to read, often mentioning a topic without having previously having discused the topic.

They question whether Connell's theories on masculinities can apply to the African continent. In exploring masculinities, they see four lines of inquiry: 1) the idea of the African \\"big man\\" is changing; 2) colonialism helped to shape African views on manhood; 3) independence struggles were gendered; and 4) the modern era has affected African masculinities.This book brilliantly discusses how Africans are subjects, rather than objects. Though whites, imperialists, and colonialists are brought up often, African wars, unionizing, bravery ceremonies, and other willful actions are emphasized. Though Foucault is never mentioned in this book, the idea that power is never absolute resounds clearly here.Though the editors very consciously view their work as lying within the men's studies field, in no way are women left out of the picture. The desire to find wives, keep wives, and be with wives is a continual staple of African manhood. See my discussion of female masculinity, infra. Further, men are not only distinguished from women, but from children, or what are called \\"junior men.\\" The ability to pay for a child's education or for the building of a school in one's birth village helps to define masculinity often. This is not a unideminsional text: manhood is consistently matched with issues of age, wealth, marital status, parental status, and occupation.Traditional scholars should not be scared away from this book. Many academics may feel that masculinity is a nebulous topic that should be left for babbling postmodernists. However, this book would satisfy traditional scholars. The book discusses history, economics, and sociology in very concrete ways; it merely adds gender into the broader picture.From one-third to one-half of this book focuses on Nigeria. This may disappoint some. However, as the scholars are English-speakers, English-speaking African nations are probably the easiest place for them to study. Additionally, Nigeria is the most populous nation on the Continent. Still too, East Africa and Southern Africa are not forgotten.Only two of the contributors have African names. Forgive my indirect promotion of essentialism. I just think people should know in advance that the writers are talking about \\"them\\" and not \\"us.\\" This work definitely felt much more arm's length than a \\"scholar from within\\" approach would have enacted.Unsurprisingly, \\"Africa\\" means sub-Saharan Africa here. Maybe postcolonial theorists have already agreed to lump North Africa with the Middle East. The surprise in the title comes from the word \\"Modern.\\" Almost no article limits itself to the 1960s and afterwards/independence and its aftermath. Some articles reach back into the 18th century, let alone the height of the imperial age.The editors do wrestle with Judith Halberstrom's reminder that not only men practice masculinity. This anthology includes two entries on masculine women. Nevertheless, I was slightly disappointed that while the editors cite Murray's book on African homosexualities, no other contributors ever once mention African gay men. How sexual orientation affects gender on the Continent is not touched. This book might as well have been called \\"Men and HETEROmasculinities in Modern Africa.\\" Further, though the AIDS pandemic is ravaging the region, it is not mentioned at all. Very odd and disappointing.I probably would have edited this book differently. Let me give an example of my critique. In the chapter on Mali, a phenomenon was described and then its history was brought up. It would have been much more coherent to mention the history and then discuss the phenomenon. This scholarly technique merely excludes people outside of the academy, even though it may help the contributors get tenure.Endnotes take up much space here, so the book reads faster than what one would originally imagine. Still, you must read at a sophisticated level in order to understand what is going on.I liked this work. I hope more scholarship is produced on African men and other men of the developing world. This was an important intersectional work. I applaud the thinkers paving the way in this burgeoning field."},{"Title":"Lost America: from the Atlantic to the Mississippi","review":"Lost America was one of the first books on domestic architecture I ever read. While the homes are in different stages of neglect,some were simply wonderful. Thanks to urban renewal and Americans general opinion of all things old being useless,all of these places are gone. While looking through this book, old house lovers will be saddenned and even angry at what was allowed to happen to our forefathers'architectural legacy. One will also have a slight feeling of relief that some are more preservation minded today than 25 years ago. Any student of architecture or architectural history should be required to read this book.

Beside the \\"Cambridge History of Japan\\" which is an absolute must, I had been told that, in regard to that period, Keiji Imamura's \\"Prehistoric Japan\\" was the one book in English to start with. And they were completely right.Imamura offers a book that is written in a way that makes it understable to people who have no previous knowledge of the subject and/or archeology (unlike many books on prehistory/ancient history I've come across). No long, dry and fastidious presentation of sites: the goal here is to present the reader with an image as complete as possible, given what had been found at the time of publication (1996), of Japan between 12,000 BC and 300 AD (the J'mon and Yayoi cultures), and a glimpse at the subsequent Kofun and the political unification, as well as the situation in the Okinawa and Hokkaido islands, the extreme south and north respectively of today's Japan. He succeeds in keeping it short and straight to the point.Also, what I appreciate is that the author doesn't hesitate to address questions that have found so far no definitive answer, and present the different plausible theories, or himself comes up with one, giving ample explanations and many exemples to support it, and compares it with those presented by other archeologists. Although I still have some doubt on some, it at least gives plenty to think about, and given the fact that there's probably much that must be discovered related to those times when no indigenous written records exist, I am pretty sure the outlines of our image will only sharpen when not get modified, and Imamura knows when to leave the door open to those futures changes.Finally, I would like to address the issue underlined by the previous review: while I agree that some Japanese historians lack an objective perspective regarding some essential issues of their history, it is not the case here, at least not regarding Korea. While I don't know a word of Korean and can't judge the language issue, Imamura repetively underlines that the immigrants come, indeed, from Korea. In fact, he spends several chapters on it, and even refutes the theory that agriculture technics and metalurgy may have arrived directly from China. Never does he mention any other immigrant settlers than Koreans. It sounds clear enough to me.All in all, a very convincing reading, and a great starting point to discover the ancient people of Japan.Edit (02.27.07): I would like to point out that this book still mentions the possibility of Paleolithic settlements as old as 600,000 BC in Japan in Chapters 2 and 3. However, we know since late 2000 that the archeological elements that had been \\"discovered\\" and therefore led to this belief were the result of a huge hoax by archeologist Fujimura Shinichi; that means that so far, we have little to no evidence of any settlement in Japan prior 35,000 BC circa. The book having been published a few years before (1996) the imposture was revealed, it is not surprising that it still takes in account the possibility of Early and Middle Paleolithic settlements in Japan. But that isn't the author's main focus and therefore doesn't detracts much from the value of this book"},{"Title":"Prehistoric Japan: New Perspectives on Insular East Asia","review":"There were a few things which disappointed me regarding the author's position as an expert on some areas.First of all, the author tries to disconnect any relation linguistically from Korean and Japanese by saying that these two languages are just too different in grammar and vocabulary. As a linguist who has specialized in Asian languages, I can tell you that the vocabulary may be different, however, anybody who has studied these two languages will tell you that they are very similar in both grammar and structure, and even semantics (ie-the use and perception of \\"blue\\" vs. \\"green\\").Also, in many places in the book, the author will refer to immigration during the Yayoi period as coming from \\"the continent\\" instead of specifically referring to \\"Korea\\", where most experts will agree is the point of origin for most of the immigration during this period. Although the author does infer many techniques and tools were from Korea, I did feel this point was avoided in many places where it should have been addressed. More and more research is supporting the idea of prehistoric Japanese coming from northeast Asia (ie- Ann Kumar's new book c: 2009).But I will say that the author does make some good connections and expand on some of the relations between Japan and ancient China and Korea. I will give him credit for referring to one of the southern ancient Korean kingdoms of Kaya as \\"Kaya\\" rather than pressing on the controversial \\"Mimana\\".A relatively fair academic book (although brief and not long-winded), in my opinion."},{"Title":"Management Systems and Organizational Performance: The Search for Excellence Beyond ISO9000","review":"Martin's book is an excellent tool for organizations beginning the journey to performance excellence.

I would also recommend the companion study giude Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers.The only weakness of these volumes is that they provide short \\"snippets\\" of commentary by a particular Father on a particular passage, so one doesn't get the complete context from the referenced material, however the series' format makes this unavoidable.

That's exactly how Carly Chambers had been living her life all of her childhood in the book, \\"The Secret Within.\\" And, living became even worse when she moved to Oceanside, New Jersey.Everyday Carly would run mysterious packages full of \\"candy\\" from their family shop, all over town to many clients. She was always up against the little timer that sat on the kitchen table, making sure she wouldn't receive the consequences she would get from her father if late. With no time left for fun, Carly would sneak out of her room every night to be at the beach and boardwalk. She would visit Eddie at his paper stand and often help him out. If she were lucky, she wouldn't run into Frankie Marzano, the bully or Aileen, the chatterbox. She also usually visited Margo (when getting Eddie some food) who ran Margo's Pizza. Margo was very sweet and friendly, and always got around her busy crowd to say hello. But, Carly's reasons for going to Margo's wasn't always just to get Eddie something to eat. It was also to see if Margo's cute son Nick was there. Carly often became shy around him until they started hanging out, and eventually became best friends. As much as Carly wants to tell Nick her secret, she knows she can't for it could ruin her life. But, when Nick gets suspicious about the tall scary man following and questioning Carly about her childhood, parents and odd package delivering he really starts to wonder about Carly's \\"off boardwalk\\" life. Can Carly find it in her heart to do the right thing and admit her secret?I deffiniteley recommend this book to readers who enjoy a good realistic mystery, and a little suspense. Even though it was a change of pace, the plot often left me on the edge of my seat. The topic discussed is great for young teens like myself, and it gives you a reality check of what can really go on within your community today. There wasn't really anything about this story that I disliked. Therefore, I encourage all kids to take a look at this unbelievable adventure."},{"Title":"The Secret Within, The","review":"Carly Chambers may be a shy, abused child at home - part of a family constantly moving to avoid trouble - but on the boardwalk she has her unusual friends who watch out for her and worry about her.

Her and her parents have lived at Oceanside, California for two years and Carly has only made one friend who is her neighbor, Aileen. Aileen is an adopted 16 year old who is quite different from everyone else. Carly only sees Aileen when she is delivering candy boxes to her dad's customers, this is the only time Carly is allowed out of the house. It seems that when she delivers the boxes Frankie always shows up. He makes fun of Carly, how she looks and dresses, but never has laid a hand on her. When she arrived home from the usual delivery her father yelled at her and sent her to get the newspaper. She was gone for at least 3 hours gazing at the ocean. Carly came in the door and realized that she forgot the paper and didn't have the time to go to get it so she faced the consequences, she was sent to her room. That night Carly climbed out the window and went to the board walk where she started working at a newspaper stand with an older man named Eddie. This went on for weeks and her parents never knew. On the board walk she met Nick, a boy that goes to her school and they become good friends. Then one delivery there is a man that is following her everywhere she goes and that makes her wonder what is in the boxes she is delivering? Carly has always just thought that they were filled with candy. Now that she saw him at the boardwalk following her, she knows that it isn't candy it must be something worse. So in the middle of the night she snuck down stairs into the cellar where her dad is to making candy. She gets the key that is hidden in the file cabinet and grabs a flshlight and goes. When she gets down there all that is there is boxes, everything is packed up. She remembered that last night her father told her that they were to move after he got off the phone with someone, he said that they were to move in a couple of days. This was hard to leave her friends that she had finally had and she didn't know why they need to go right off the bat. That mornign her father woke her up and shouted to her \\"what's this?\\" he was holding up the cards that that guy gave her when she met up with him. The guy that had been following her ended up working for the State Treasury Dept. He gave her a lot of cards because it was raining and they might of get wet and they had a number on them that she could call if she needed help. He was angry at her and was coming closer and closer to her so she tried to get out of the room through the window. And before she would use the tree but the night before a big storm hit and lightning struck the tree splitting it in half. Squeezing through the window she goes onto the roof and her dad follows. It was still raining and the tiles were slippery. Carly had been on the roof many times and knew that there were loose ones. She step over them and her dad was coming towards her and she warned him and didn't listen. Running straight towards the loose tiles at her........

It showed how slaves lived and how Amos Fortune grew up. I would remend this book to any reader."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This book was won the 1951 Newbery Medal and I think writing styles have really changed since then. This book is written an omniscient POV which I didn't like. But it is a biography worthy of being told and worthy of being read. The story of Amos' journey as a young African prince captured in 1725 and sold into slavery, taught to be a tanner, and eventually given his freedom where he continued to ply his trade to provide for his family. It is a touching, inspiring story of triumph and the way it is written provides a good glimpse into the Colonial period."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This book was a good book. I am using such a simple adjective because I don't think that it was disappointing but I don't think it deserves anything better. It was enjoyable because it does give you some perception on slavery but it is too smoothed over to give it any great thought or detail. The author skips a lot of the story as in (spoiler alert) when he marries the first two women, Lily and Lydia Kate Evergreen doesn't get into his emotion or feelings. We (the readers) don't even know if he was upset! He is also sold originally to a Quaker who is extremely forgiving and offers his freedom during the first years. This is not at all how slavery was. in fact, it was extremely rare to be sold to such a kind man. When the owner (Mr. Copeland) dies, he is put up for auction again and is sold for 62 pounds and is again sold to a nice man and is freed in four years. I wish it wasn't as candy-coated and was a little more realistic."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This book offended me on so many levels. I bought it as part of a homeschool history curriculum - a fictional biography based on a real person and the real events of their life - and as such, expected it to be an accurate look at American slavery from the perspective of the slave.Amos Fortune, Free Man was written in the late 1940's-1950 by a white woman in New Hampshire. In order to fully understand where this book when wrong, you have to be aware that this time in history was the beginning of the South African apartheid. Many western countries had interests in African resources, politics in Africa were being manipulated by America and Europe, and the people of Africa were still being enslaved and dominated by numerous forces both outside and inside the continent. America was still 15 years away from the Civil Rights Act, segregating communities, businesses, and schools. A large percentage of Americans still believed black people were somehow lesser humans than white people, and those that didn't pitied them. Propaganda about Africa was heavy, fueling the pity of American citizens for the poor Africans, who didn't cover their shamefully naked bodies, didn't speak English, couldn't read or write, and didn't worship the Christian God; because they'd been separated from the world and just didn't know any better. This public pity helped the governments of the world in controlling Africa's resources and politics (to help them, of course), and mission trips were common, bringing \\"civilization\\" to Africa in the form of Christianity and the English language.When you know all of that, it's easy to see why Amos Fortune, Free Man focused not on the tragedy of slavery or the heartache of being ripped away from life and family, but what a great country America is and how lucky a person is to live where there are books and God. The book begins with a description of the barbaric and uncivilized tribe of At-mun-shi (Amos Fortune's home), \\"as pagan as any tribe in Africa\\", and the love for his crippled sister, who would have been drowned at birth if it weren't for the sacrifice of a dog. As a slave, Amos has a few owners who are all kindly with intentions of someday giving Amos his freedom. The message throughout the book is that Amos has a better life after accepting Christianity and the American way of life. Amos has only fleeting thoughts of his life as a king in Africa and the sister he left behind (the murder of his father by the slavers is never mentioned again in the book), and while freedom is always a goal, it's perfectly acceptable to him that a person should have to work every day of their life in order to earn it.Amos later purchases a wife (to be fair, he purchased her freedom and then married her by her choice, but I'd like to see any woman choose slavery over marriage). One significant event centers on a \\"shiftless woman\\" who can't support her children, clearly because of laziness and an unwillingness to work. This enforces the white American opinion of the time the book was written: that there was no excuse for black poverty in a country where success depends on hard work (and if they didn't have the same advantages of whites, they could just work harder).This book is outdated and inaccurate, and completely inappropriate for historical education unless it's used as an example of the priveledged white attitude prior to the Civil Rights Movement."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Amos Fortune Free Man shows that you shouldn't fight the situation that your in, instead you should try to make the the best out of it and not give up.

That is the question I would ask slave owners that lived in the 1700's. Well, if you could believe it, that's what happened to Amos. He received his name from his first owners, the Copelands. When they purchased him in Boston, they had promised him freedom. He worked for many years making clothing for the family to sell. After Mr. Copeland's death, the family was forced to sell Amos to Ichabod Richardson where he made shoes until he bought freedom for himself. Later, he bought Lily, a slave woman he liked. She died free but never married Amos. He later opened a shop in the nearby town of Woburn. There he spotted the slaves Lydia and her daughter. After purchasing them, the three moved to Jaffrey where he opened a shop.I think that this book was mediocre. It lacked action and took a while for anything to happen. For example, Amos had two owners we had to learn about before he was released. To me, nothing exciting really happened that was significant. I would recommend this book to fast readers because they would get through it faster and it would seem like more would happen than would happen to a slower reader. I think that a person interested in the history of slavery would like this book."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I remember reading this book when I was in the 4th grade.

It is an accurate piece of historical fiction, dramatizing the events and people that filled the early days of colonial America. It is compassionate in its approach to the irony and hypocrisy of the times. It is a fitting tribute to all slaves who endured unspeakable hardships from slave to free man.The author begins the story with Amos's life, as Prince At-mun, in the wilds of Africa. The subjugation into slavery and the trip along the Middle Passage is told with accuracy and strength.As an African-American, I was moved by the enduring qualities exhibited by this man, his unwavering desire to be free, his longing to help others, and his pride in himself.All the characters in the book are representative of the citizens of the day. The book is noticeably free of the vilest of the slave owners, but the thought of forced servitude by one man on the other is horrible enough.Descriptive writing of the setting makes the reader feel that he or she is in the hold of the great slave ship, is walking along the busy port cities of New England, and is enjoying the majestic beauty of New Hampshire's mountains.Amos Fortune never really resigns himself to the fact that he is a slave. This constant vigilance for self-rule is the abiding theme throughout. A strong sense of independence is presented in the man's words and deeds.The novel provides the reader with a realistic view of how things really were. By also including the language used in documents of the period, the author contrasts the brevity of modern tongue with the wordiness of colonial times. This enhances the authenticity of the text.The book is a triumph of man over adversity. It is a worthwhile addition to any child's literary background."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This 1951 Newbery winner is a biography, so there is no need to critique the plot or character development. The book reads easily, being the reconstructed life of a proud African youth who was captured at the age of 15 in 1725--reminding us of Haley's Kunta Kinte. Amos never forgot that he was the first son of chief, nor that he must protect and inspire his crippled younger sister (who would assume the role of leader of her village). Indeed, for years he haunted the New England docks seeking her; all his life he exhibited a tenderness and compassion for crippled women and children. Despite the horrors of captivity, the cramped voyage in chains, and being considered the legal property of different masters, Amos never lost his dream of directing his own destiny or his sense of personal dignity.The ten chapters are chronological, thus of varying length, depending on the amount of material during a specific period of his life. The author skillfully recreates Colonial and then American cultures, drawing the reader into the heart and mind of thiis noble African, who lived to be 80. He truly was Fortunate not to have been unloaded and auctioned off in the South, where he would have suffered excruciatingly in the plantation fields. His goal was to live as a free man; then to help other blacks enjoy the same privilege, even if only to die in freedom. He accomplished his private purposes several times, but at great personal cost. Amos set an example of honesty and Christian responsibility, leaving a legacy of peace and a foundation of interracial cooperation. He did what he could to improve the life for all people in his New Hampshire community. Recommended for elementary and middle school students of Black and Colonial history."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Amos Fortune,named At-mun at first, is prince of the At-mun-shi people in Africa. Right before the time of the planting of corn, At-mun and others in his tribe are captured and taken to America as slaves. Amos, now living in Massachusetts, learns to live among white men and eventually gains his freedom. While in Massachusetts, Amos looks at the port for his little sister, Ath-mun. She was left behind in Africa when Amos was taken, but Amos searched to see if she had been brought to America since then, and maybe would come off of a ship at the port some time. Because of Amos' wanting Ath-mun to be cared for, he dedicated himself to helpless people. He helped many people in his lifetime.Amos' last name, Fortune, was given to him by other slaves who saw how fortunate he was. Both of his masters were good to him. He was taught a good trade as a tanner and became very good at it. He was able to earn freedom for himself and his family.This story is very good, but it isn't as adventurous as I like books to be. I don't think it really hooked me as much as I wish it would have. I think a lot of people will really like this book; it just isn't MY idea of a great book."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I brought this book for my 9 year old who is quite good at reading. I wanted her to learn some history of the slaving times from a different perspective. Amos Fortune is a true story and shows the indominable Christian spirit of this man, and the people who assist him in his life. I read it before I gave it to my daughter and couldn't put it down. It's a fairly short chapter oriented book, a two hour read for most adults. Contains some hard words and some historical events that may need to be explained (but are not overwhelming or offensive) to younger kids."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Amos Fortune-Free Man is an inspiring semi-true story of a young african prince named At-mun, who at age 15 is captured from his african village, and crosses through the brutal middle passage. In Boston he is sold to a quaker man named Caleb Copeland, who names him Amos. He learns to read, write, and learns to weave and tan. His freinds nickname him Amos Fortune. Indeed he is more fortunate than many slaves of the day. Instead of doing the backbreaking field labor, he would have done had he been sold to a southern plantation, he finds himself doing more managable work, in the New England states.In addition his masters are more kind than most. At around the age of sixty he bought his own freedom, and eventually the freedom of 3 others. In 1779 he moved to the New Hampshire town of Jaffrey, where he established himself as a sucsessful tanner, and died peacefully at the age of 91. I first read this book 3 years ago, and it is among my favorites. I think it should be required reading for every school (and thats saying alot coming from me). Amos Fortune/At-Mun was a truely amazing man, who tried to sucseed and adapt in american/american colonial society, while never forgetting his african heritage. Some of the words and events may be diffucult for unskilled readers,but in all I think it is one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"As an African- American living in New Hampshire, I was particularly proud of Amos Fortunes' achievements, as he made Jaffrey, NH his home. Amos Fortune's story of pride and determination, in the face of tremendous oppression, is a triumphant tale for all ages, and inspires readers to seek the best within themselves and others."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I've used Amos Fortune Free Man as a powerful tool in building vocabulary and dictionary usage skills for my fifth graders. It is not an easy read, but does open young eyes to the way of life in colonial America. The book develops the character as they read, and I point that out to my students. Advanced readers told me that they thought it was boring at first but got better as they read. The concept that fiction and historical fiction books often develop in that way came through clearer by having them read the book than by my merely telling them. They learned not to give up on a book after reading just a few pages. I highly recommend it for gifted readers."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Amos Fortune Free Man is one of the best books I have ever read.

This book was so good that I had to read it for an second time. All the biography lovers out there need to read this book.

He undergoes a process of dehumanization, including a horrific slave-ship sea crossing, before being sold as a slave into first one and then another Massachusetts family; so we see two complete portraits of slave life. After a while, he buys his own and his wife's freedom and travels to picturesque New Hampshire where he builds a homestead and a legacy for himself. In so doing perhaps he plants seeds that help bring an end to that \\"peculiar institution,\\" slavery.Beautifully told by Ms. Yates, we see Amos learn to read and become a faithful Christian. His childlike dream to buy his sister's freedom grows into a mature buying of the freedom of women he loves. He masters the tanning trade, which we learn about. We experience his strong and majestic character in overlooking a benighted age's slights and building his own freehold homestead, near \\"his\\" mountain, in this free country he loves. Amos Fortune is an outstanding man worthy of imitation. His story will never die or grow old.All American young people should read this book. It, along with: \\"April Morning,\\" by Howard Fast; \\"A Light in the Forest,\\" by Conrad Richter; \\"First Lady of Faith and Courage: Abigail Adams,\\" by Evelyn Witter; and \\"The Autobiography,\\" by Benjamin Franklin; paint a multifaceted view of the particular pains, prejudices and daily life in northern colonial America from the perspective of, respectively, black citizens, traditional revolutionary families, American Indians, women, and a particular famous artisan-scientist-inventor-statesman whose life spanned and intertwined itself with the century of America's birth."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I read this to my children and found it to be very encouraging, uplifting, and simplistic in the man's trust and faith in God.

It really is worth it, though you won't believe me until the end."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I'm white - I bought this book knowing nothing about Amos Fortune or the author, relying mainly on the fact that it had received a Newberry Medal. Sadly, I was offended by this book from chapter one and many times throughout. I had to stop and see who the author was a few chapters in, because to anyone with awareness, it was obviously written from a very slanted and inaccurate perspective.I read the book in one evening and went back to Amazon this morning to read the reviews. It was disheartening to read such praise for the book. As it was written from the perspective of a white woman in the 1950's, perhaps many of the reviewers found the author's perspective easier to relate to than a more accurate one. Having slavery depicted so idyllically may be helpful for some people, who would like to learn about our country's history without having to grapple with feelings of guilt. The book allows a calculated glance at slavery without the reader having to absorb the atrocity of the institution. That so many reviewers had praise for Elizabeth Yates' self serving biograpy is of course troubling, but I'm confident that the 4 and 5 stars will continue as many people do not want to get a clue - if it means upsetting their own sense of entitlement.One of many offensive excerpts: On page 156 Amos is talking to a black woman Lois, whose child has just been sold at a vendue (an auction subsidized by the town where children and elderly are auctioned off to the lowest bidder. The town pays the lowest bidder to feed and care for the person,and the buyer gets cheap labor and/or a profit). Lois, who is described as shiftless because she is unable to properly care for her six children after her husband dies, says to Amos about her newly sold child, \\"Likely his back will be sore with the beatings he'll be getting. 'And perhaps they will do something to his soul.' Amos reminded her, for he knew the boy too. 'Wings can't grow without a little suffering.'\\"It's convenient that a white author used the voice of a black slave to uphold our country's systemic brutality of black people. And it's all done under the guise of Christianity.Another excerpt supposedly in Amos' words printed on the back cover of the book: \\"It does a man no good to be free until he learns how to live.\\"Well if this doesn't make all of us white people out there feel just a little bit better about enslaving others, I don't know what else could. To imply that black people aren't ready for freedom until they've been stripped of their culture and religion is a theme supported throughout the book.I know my review of 1 star will remain in the minority. But hopefully it will help at least one person recognize the hypocrisy that is this book."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I find this book to be extremely inaccurate and that it romanticizes slavery, giving the reader the opinion that slavery wasn't as bad as historians have made it out to be. It was written by a white author during a time when things of this nature weren't really discussed. I think the tag line on the back of the book states something along the lines of \\"You have to work to be free\\". Who says Amos wasn't free when he lived with his family in Africa? So he had to become a slave to figure out what it meant to be free? It gives young children the wrong idea about what really happened during this time. To Be A Slave by Lester is far better than this book."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"I liked the book. I found myself really engrossed in the story and read it straight through without stopping. I liked the character of Amos and thought the book was teaching a good lesson. This was my initial impression of the book.My initial impression is the reason I assume the book was award winning, but upon further examination about the book I began to look more critically at some of the messages the book was sending. I found the book uplifting as it told the story of man who came from nothing and worked hard throughout his life to make something of himself. Then I began to realize that this book reinforces the belief that anyone who believes in American ideals of hard work and freedom can work their way out of poverty.First, the book seems to argue that if Blacks truly want to get ahead the way to do so is to behave and eventually white people will respect them. This is true of both of the families that Amos lives with, as well as the individuals he deals with in business such as the man at the tavern who pays Amos less for his work than what was currently agreed upon. The times that Amos chooses to stand up for himself he is met with more harsh treatment and not the acceptance he is met with in other situations. The one that stands out to me in the book is when he rose up immediately after his capture and was lashed because of it. His continual reference back to his scar from that episode seems to serve as a reminder of what happens when one fights against the systems already in place.Second, although Amos tries to remember his African heritage, he seems fully assimilated in his new society, both in stature and in belief system. Each community that Amos move to, whether it be a white family or a community in which he works, accepts Amos (even if it takes a while some places) and they do so in a manner that ignores race for the most part. This seems to say that blacks who work hard are readily accepted by society. In addition to his position in society Amos also seems to be fully intergrated into the belief system of his new country. He reinforces ideas of hard work and freedom even though so many whites around him have never had to overcome the same obstacles that he did to gain his freedom.The book also seems to reinforce three stereotypes that jump out to me. First, is the argument that many conservative race commentators (such as Dinesh D&#65533;Souza in The End of Racism) that blacks are better off here than they would have been in Africa. Amos comes over and make a name for himself and build a home. He seems happy and the communities he enters seem better for him being there, but there is very little examination of the life he left behind. Occassionally, it is mentioned that he had been king, but there is next to no mention of what that means in the broader picture.Second, the book&#65533;s treatment of the American Revolution seems to mirror the treatment of race in World War II and Vietnam. The American army would allow blacks to fight, but at the same time refused to extend full citizenship status to them. While this is possibly an accurate historical description the part that made me upset was Amos reaction to that. He was not upset that black men were going off and dying for a country in which they were not treated as equals, but instead he was angry that he could not go and fight.Finally, the images of hard work versus the laziness of Polly&#65533;s family seem to draw out natural comparisons to the welfare mother. Here is a woman who has lots of children that she cannot care for and no husband to help her and the more the community helps her the more she wastes those chances. This, especially when compared to Amos&#65533; success sends the message that anyone can succeed if they are willing to work hard.Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I believe that is only because it reinforced all of the ideas of hard work and personal responsibility I was taught when I was younger."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"this book was not the best.

You will learn about how slaves were treated and what they became."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Do you forget how vital freedom is in everyday life? Elizabeth Yates, the author of Amos Fortune: Free Man, informs her readers of how important freedom is. Atamun, the protagonist, was a representation for all of those Africans who struggled up the steep road, full of obstacles, to freedom. He stood for a large mistreated group of Africans who were deprived of their freedom and forced to work against their will.The central theme of freedom began with the concept of slavery. Atamun, who represents all the Africans who were once free in their own continent, was a prince in Africa until he was captured. All along the perilous and excruciating voyage, Atamun wished for freedom. He wanted to be back in Africa. Africa was a place where he did not need to earn freedom. However, the pain of the voyage was a constant reminder that snickered, \\"You cannot escape without receiving more pain and suffering.\\"At last, the voyage ended and Atamun's trials had just begun. He refused to listen to the embarrassing words that echoed from the mouths of those who wished to force him deeper still into the pit of slavery. The Europeans tried to do so by selling Atamun to other Europeans so he would have to work for them. In addition, the Europeans who wanted to buy him insulted Atamun by laughing at his looks and inability to speak English. Atamun was finally bought by a Quaker. He was re-named Amos, but I have chosen to call him Atamun because Atamun was his original African name. The pain of being owned weakened Atamun physically and mentally. Like most slaves, Atamun was re-sold to someone else. Fortunately, he was freed quickly. The burden of being a slave was removed but was quickly replaced with new hardships.Bigotry and injustice seeped into Atamun's life at different times like poison because his lack of liberty was due to his color. Once, Atamun needed land. He had earned enough money to free his own family. Now, he wanted to expand their lives by giving them land. There was plenty of land, which Atamun discovered in a spacious settlement. The constable of that settlement, however, stood against him. Thankfully, the constable finally agreed. Atamun was lent a large plot of land.Having journeyed far in his life and gotten past two obstacles, Atamun was proud of himself. However, Atamun did not have the power to do certain things. Atamun reached other obstacles, such as want for land of his own and lack of business. Atamun received business once his reputation as a tanner grew, but Atamun's color caused limitations. At that time, Atamun was unable to sit anywhere other than the back pew at church or to be paid the proper amount of money. He, however, did raise enough money to buy his own plot of land. Atamun reached a final obstacle. What was he going to do about others who were kept down by slavery? Atamun decided to help others by funding the school for Africans in his settlement. Atamun had fulfilled the dream of the slave. Atamun was truly free in his heart, mind, and spirit!Freedom is a blessing that makes everyone's life better, but most people do not consider its magnitude every day because they have liberty in abundance. Elizabeth Yates did an excellent job of informing you that freedom is essential for a peaceful life and how horrible life can be without it."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This book is about a young African prince who is captured and brought to America and sold as a slave.

I found this book to be a touching account of a Godly man, of how he was protected by God and how he earned his way to freedom with dignity (even though he still had to face the inescapable reality that he was always to be looked down upon because of his color).

All his life (and he lived a long life, living to nearly one hundred) Amos helped others become free, including all three of his wives.With a copyright date of 1950, I anticipated there would be lots of racist elements to this book.

Amos Fortune definitely defines who a true respectful man is and how hard he tries to overcome challenges in his own life to help others.The story begins with At-Mun (Amos) being captured by Caucasian slave traders at the age of 15, who separate him from his sister that he loves so dearly. He then works at a loving and kind Mormon's family for 15 years of his life. After his owner who promised him freedom tragically dies, Amos is sold to the tanner in the town of Woburn. After thirty years of serving his master, he buys his own freedom and finally sees some of his dreams start to come true.This was a very moving story that, to me, was about a man who was dedicated to the fight for freedom. His main wishes only included to be free and have a life for himself and to free others. This book changed the meaning of freedom for me.

After a hard trip across the Atlantic, enduring the pain of sickness and severe cruelty, watching even his own people die, they finally reached America. It had been a long three months. At-Mun was sold at the slave auction to a kind man and his family. He changed hands a few times after the family had to move. Through those many years he learned the English language and culture. He even took up their Religion of Christianity, which he took very seriously. He was eventually given a new name, and was known to everyone as Amos Fortune. When he was in his sixties, he received his freedom and married, then decided to take up the work of a tanner, which he had been taught in his earlier days. From then on, he was known as Amos Fortune, Free man. It meant so much to him to be free, that he began freeing other people too. His love for his God, people, his work, and his family made him beloved to many people. This is an excellent book about a man who never gave up, and who never stopped loving. This is a perfect example showing how every man should be."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"This book was a bit slow starting but then picked up towards the middle and end (so much that I wish it hadn't of stopped.) Even though the print and layout of book seemed kind of juvenile it's content and vocabulary was fitting for up to a 14 or 15 year old.Definitely a different type of \\"slavery\\" book; Fortune was one that we as a society should know more about. Elizabeth Yates' book made me want to learn more about the man, Amos Fortune.I would recommend this book to any age level."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Quite contrary to other peoples opinions on this book I found it engaging rather than boring.

In Boston he is sold to a quaker man named Caleb Copeland, who names him Amos. He learns to read, write, and learns to weave and tan. His freinds nickname him Amos Fortune. Indeed he is more fortunate than many slaves of the day. Instead of doing the backbreaking field labor, he would have done had he been sold to a southern plantation, he finds himself doing more managable work, in the New England states.In addition his masters are more kind than most. At around the age of sixty he bought his own freedom, and eventually the freedom of 3 others. In 1779 he moved to the New Hampshire town of Jaffrey, where he established himself as a sucsessful tanner, and died peacefully at the age of 91. I first read this book 3 years ago, and it is among my favorites. I think it should be required reading for every school (and thats saying alot coming from me). Amos Fortune/At-Mun was a truely amazing man, who tried to sucseed and adapt in american/american colonial society, while never forgetting his african heritage. Some of the words and events may be diffucult for unskilled readers,but in all I think it is one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"Amos Fortune,: Free man","review":"Amos Fortune Free Man by Elisabeth Yates is a very meaningful book, taking the reader on a journy though a slaves life.

The book is divided in two parts: Alphabet and Grammar. If you're totally new to Persian the alphabet part is good, otherwise you can skip it. The grammar part is not bad, but some of the grammar is a little old fashioned. If you work through this book, you will have a good basis for learning more Persian. For learning words and phrases faster and easier, I've found this program to be very useful... 'Colloquial Persian' by Rafiee is a better book if you want to learn a language that is a little more up to date."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"As several other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous faults with this book: the Persian font is too small and cramped, the dictionary is not comprehensive, and the lessons do not necessarily proceed in the most logical fashion (e.g., why do we learn inseparable pronouns before we learn actual pronouns). Moreover, this book suffers from having a non-native author. As someone else mentioned, there are quite a few grammatical errors, or usage of the wrong, or lesser used preposition.The books merits, though, are the careful explanation of how to make the Persian letters. It is also somewhat useful if you have learned Farsi in the classroom, and need some backup as to certain rules (such as how to form plurals). But for the beginner, I'd recommend the Lonely Planet guidebook as a more comprehensive and easier introduction."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"For people who do not know how to read the persian alphabet this is a horrible book!!!

However, it was very disappointing. The text font is too small to distinguish some of the persian letters, and the book does not proceed in a logical format after the alphabet is introduced. In addition, my husband (who is Persian) found many grammatical errors and sentences that made absolutely no sense. I have since had much better luck with Thackston's &quot;An Introduction to Persian.&quot;"},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"Mace does an excellent job of teaching the Persian alphabet. It is worth buying the book just for the alphabet exercises. The correct name of the national language of Iran is Persian. The word &quot;Farsi&quot; is the Persian translation of the word &quot;Persian.&quot; Just like we say &quot;French&quot; in English and not &quot;Francais,&quot; we say &quot;Persian&quot; in English and not &quot;Farsi.&quot;"},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"(My comments pertain to the 1972 edition of the book. My understanding is that the book remained largely unchanged through the 1993 edition, before being replaced with substantially different content by a new author in the 2003 edition.)The best thing about this book is the way it teaches the Perso-Arabic alphabet. It's a teaching method that ought to be adopted by every author of a language text requiring a foreign alphabet.First, a little background: I have a degree in linguistics and generally I learn languages quickly. I know English and French, as well as Spanish decently, and a bit of Hebrew. I have a lot of Iranian friends and learned about one hundred words and a smattering of grammar before ever picking up a book on the language. Finally, I checked out two books from my university's library: this one and Thackston's \\"Introduction to Persian.\\"I have always been put off from learning Arabic or Persian due to the complexity of the script, which always seemed an impenetrable mess of squiggles and dots to me. I had never understood how to get a \\"foothold\\" to begin using it. I started out looking at Thackston's book. It begins with the alphabet, describing the 32 letters and their 70+ forms (initial, medial, final, and isolated) in a brutally brief introduction. A table of letter forms and calligraphic rules may suffice for a computer, but simply can't train a human learner to recognize and reproduce the complex cursive script.So I put Thackston's book down, and picked up this one. Its approach is better by leaps and bounds. John Mace starts off by introducing just TWO letters, and shows how they combine and a few words that can be written with them. Gradually he adds each letter, emphasizing the ways that it combines with previous letters using real words and simple sentences. By the time I had completed the introductory section on the alphabet, after about 5 hours with the book, I could read and write all the words I had learned, although laboriously. A few lessons later, the most common words and affixes are starting to \\"jump off the page\\" when I see them.This way of introducing the alphabet demands quite a lot of ingenuity from the author, but is surely the best method I've ever seen for students hoping to learn a new language on their own.I haven't finished the rest of the book, but am progressing well so far."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"When I first started to learn persian, this book provided the clearest guide for me to follow. It is an extremely useful source for beginner who wants to learn the language, or even for an advanced student who wants to brush up on the language. I definately recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn persian, it is an absolute necessity. It is only because of this book that I am almost completely fluent in persian.However, I do not recommened the new revised \\"teach yourself modern persian\\" by Narguess Farzad, which is more of a tourist language book and has poor coverage of the language. The revised edition is nowhere comparable to the original by John Mace.Also, another great reference of grammar for persian is \\"Persian Grammar- For Reference and Revision\\" also by John Mace. This is another source which I have found extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"Let me put my comment in context. This book is not perfect, it has the faults some other reviewers have pointed out. But it has its virtues too.To learn Persian you will need a knowledge of the formal language and its grammar, the script and the use of everyday language. This book helped me in the first two. Enough to get a first grasp of the language and enough on the script side to later cope with Arabic lessons much more easily. In other words, for me it has been a good basis to start with. That's my experience.Today I ordered a book on the colloquial language. I also have tried the Persian Tutor CD, it helps in certain points in conversation, maybe it will help too in learning the script.I really doubt that a single course (book or CD) can teach you all that is needed.I like this book, don't ask too much from it and you'll like it too."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"I have Mace's older version (1979)and it is better than most other beginning Farsi publications I own. I also suggest combining it with others, although avoid British publications, except for Lambton's \\"Persian Grammar\\", which is an excellent book as well. A warning: I have found some errors in both publications... maybe the newer version corrected those? (I would love to see a comp posted here of both of Mace's older and newer versions.) Both Mace and Lambton have extensive explanations of Arabic usage in Farsi, although a reader really needs a native speaker to correctly annunciate particular Arabic pronunciations.(If there are any Arabic speakers out there who are good teachers, I will trade lessons in Farsi, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese or Hawaiian for some basic pronunciations in Arabic! Just leave a comment and I'll get back to you.)The absolute best points about this publication is its specific structure and use of examples that coherently include the 1) Farsi script, 2) A precise English pronunciation guide 3) English translations (in 99% of examples) and 4) Precise colloquial examples with pronunciation and descriptive backgrounds. It also has great practice reading passages/paragraphs and keys to exercises and in the back! Mace's presentation makes it easy to research and understand the structure of Farsi through many examples to get a real feeling for syntax (word order). The excellence of this book include many examples and detailed comparisons of colloquial vs. formal speech and writing examples throughout the book.Mace does an excellent job of explanations in English for clarification of meanings and context, exceptions to general rules, as well as most rules that govern the language in general.I HIGHLY recommend this book, but I also recommend an extended dictionary for more extensive vocabulary, as well as audio tapes for real beginners who are unfamiliar with the sound of the Farsi language (or you can go to easypersian.com...Hassan has AWESOME Farsi lessons on his website with audio access for proper pronunciation familiarization! And he seems like a very nice man..in his 70's I believe! He is an EXCELLENT language teacher with excellent audio examples of the language!)The glossary in the back of Mace's book isn't bad either.(Lambton's is EXTREMELY limited in the index, but throughout the book actually contains more professional verb examples, although absent of index reference.) Both books are well worth adding to your language/ research library! I also think it would be of some value to native Farsi speakers trying to learn English, except probably for pronunciation, but it would help to teach English tenses, adverbs and other aspects of English to Iranians."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"The reader attempting to learn Persian will understand how few choices there are. Two of the best ones are by John Mace: the one this review is appearing before, from the TY series, is perfect as a first book for a student supplement or self-learning. In this sense it is like Coulson's Sanskrit, rare for the TY series. The other Mace book is his vastly more expensive reference grammar, which need only be purchased if the reader is already beyond the TY book, or does not mind the price.Mace still has the best introduction of any author to the Persian script - the reader learns vocabulary along the way, and will never need to flip back and truly study something; there are good explanations and one just has to read. Because of how easily the writing system is introduced, there are no transliterations in excercises or the excercise key (but nearly every grammatical example sentence is romanized as are section vocabularies but not the end gloss lists)A few important things:- This is basic literary Persian, there is some attention in the latter sections given to colloquial pronunciations however nothing dialectal or idiomatic, and considerably more attention is given to formalisms. Use this book toward an understanding of reading Chubak, etc, not for www.persianblog.com- There is nothing in this book on classical or medieval Persian, look elsewhere for classical grammar(I believe Thackston wrote a book of older Persian though his may be out of print)- I would complain only that while the grammar is very comprehensive, the vocabulary is very minimal, and in a very few cases, old-fashioned. Once the reader has mastered the grammar as Mace presents it, which should not take a great deal of time, rely on a very good dictionary for any hope of translation work (such as ones by Aryanpour)As a beginning text, given the choices out there, Mace is the only one presenting Persian from a popular English perpsective. Those with linguistic backgrounds may buy Thackston's Modern Persian instead, though I have heard both books contain old-fashioned words and examples"},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"I am a student and non-native speaker of Persian language.

His Modern Persian (Teach Yourself Books) is the best textbook I have ever found for teaching Persian in American university classrooms. Unfortunately, the 1962 first edition is about the only one students can clearly read. The other editions, including the last one (2004), get progressively more difficult because of the \\"blurring\\" of the script. I don't know very much about older printing techniques, but I am positive that the initial plates were used over and over to print subsequent editions until in the latest one (2004) the Persian script is almost impossible to read. The 1962 edition is extremely difficult to find and can be very expensive, but for serious students of Persian, it (even with a few out-of-date elements) is an absolute gem."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book is particularly useful for two reasons. First is that it does an excellent job in teaching the Arabic script. I picked it up in a little more than a week. The rest of the book reinforces this, as well as both grammar and vocabulary. Very, very useful."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This is a book that should be retired. There is one good thing that can be said about it: It does offer a decent method of learning to read Persian words. The half of the book deals with the alphabet, introducing a few letters with each lesson, and with it some words and short easy sentences, so that you can complete half the book and feel you're getting somewhere.Unfortunately, the author doesn't stop there. The remaining lessons are poorly organized, full of misprints, and there are a number of reading sections where words are used that are not defined either within the lessons or in the glossary in the back. There was one lesson where I simply had to give up- there were too many words that were nowhere to be found anywhere else. The quality of printing is poor. The book is no help in developing conversational skills. It does not come close to how speakers actually use the language in real life. (I still can't say things like: &quot;Where do I get the bus?&quot; &quot;How are the wife and kids?&quot; There is no tape to go with it, and when I've actually heard the language, I must say that the author's descriptions of how the sounds are made are not much like the way it sounds.Finally, this is an old book, and it's hard for me to imagine that with everything else in Iran that has changed since it was published, that some of those changes aren't reflected in the language.In recent years there have been many new books in the Teach Yourself Series to replace older, out-of-date ones. Even the title of this one is out of date: The correct name of the language is Farsi."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"I purchased my first copy of this great book 33 years ago in London, England. While working at Barclays Bank, I met an Iranian lady from Bank Melli Iran in training classes we attended. I surprised her by being able to speak to her in Farsi. One year later, we married in Tehran, Iran.After 3 years of marriage, I took a formal course at Harvard University. My professor was from Iran and believed in teaching only the finest, formal forms of Farsi. I have been forever grateful for his approach. In later years, native speakers of Arabic have attempted to teach me Arabic via memorizing vast quantities of colloquial expressions I shall never use. John Mace wrote a book on Arabic, too. The results have been very different. I left Harvard University with an excellent understanding of Farsi. Farsi grammar is far easier than Arabic grammar. I used Ann Lambton's Persian Grammar so much on my travels that the paperbound book fell apart.During my career, I have worked in the Middle East, Europe, India, and in Vietnam. From my experiences in trying to learn languages in the Middle East, I have had little success with teachers who are native speakers. The reason is that native speakers from the Middle East tend to believe in memorization.Books written by Western authors have been more useful to me because those authors use the approach of explaining why a language works the way that it does. They stress rules and patterns in languages. The disadvantage of these books tends to be that the authors have not mastered the languages. There will be some errors in these books.As another reviewer has already noted, John Mace used a brilliant technique in Modern Persian that all future foreign language authors should use. As a professor, I am tired of reading the books written by some foreign language professors who seem to write only to impress other foreign language professors. My goal in learning Farsi was to use the language, not to translate documents. At the same time, I do not need to read books containing the latest slang in Farsi any more than I would read a book on the latest American slang. John Mace's technique is to start the reader with the first two letters of the Fari alphabet. With only those letters, he taught readers how to write in Farsi script &quot;with water.&quot; I have no use for books using only transliterations. I want to be able to read, write, and speak Farsi. John Mace continues his book by adding slowly other letters of the Farsi alphabet and by showing words and sentences you can make with only a small number of letters. This is the most pleasant foreign language learning experience I have ever had with the many foreign languages I have tried to learn. John Mace's book is by far the finest self-teaching foreign language book I have ever seen.Other reviewers have made some valid criticisms. The publishers planned for this book to be carried in your pocket. By keeping the physical size of the book small, the result was that the print is small. With Farsi and Arabic, that is a problem. Some letters of the alphabet differ only in the number of dots above or below the letter. With small print, it can be difficult for a non-native speaker to read. However, by reading transliterations, you will be able to determine the correct letter in Farsi script. Some of the examples include translations with which my Iranian wife disagrees. Whether the correct translation is &quot;carpenter,&quot; &quot;mason,&quot; or &quot;worker&quot; in today's Iran, I am happy as a learner to at least be using words that will be understood in the context in which I use them.My experience has been that you can always learn the slang when you hear it in Iran. During my early visits to Iran, some Iranians would comment that I am using a &quot;bookish&quot; version of Farsi. While native speakers would not have been so formal, they understood what I was saying. I was so formal that I used &quot;Aya&quot; to introduce questions in Farsi and &quot;Hal&quot; in Arabic.Another reviewer is correct in noting that this is an old book. I regard John Mace's and Ann Lambton's books as classics. While such books might not be very helpful for translating an article or book in Farsi on the subject of computers or on the Internet, these classics will continue to be my guides during future visits to relatives in Iran."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"I noted with interest that the reviews on this book range from high praise to scorching condemnation. I am one of the fans of this little book. I first encountered it in a bookshop in Karachi just a couple of weeks before I was scheduled to visit Iran as part of an official US Navy visit in 1978. Much to my pleasant surprise I was able to actually speak some of the language on the ground when I got there, sufficiently well so that I could go around town without dismay.The Teach Yourself series has revised most of their original books in the last twenty years, but like a lot of older readers with some linguistic background I must admit to a preference for at least some of the older editions (although not the old Arabic one, which was a masterpiece of obscurity - truly breathtaking). The &quot;old&quot; Teach Yourself Spanish, for example, is still the best one-volume explanation of Spanish grammar I have ever found in English. Like at least one of the reviewers, I think the older books do a better job of providing a grasp of the structure, after which the student can move on to the commoner colloquialisms. While admittedly this book has a number of mistakes, it manages to make the process of learning basic Persian painless and fun. I think the learner would be well served by working through this book first, and then moving on to a more ambitious text. Starting with Lambton can be stultifying, and I found Thackston dry and incapable of keeping my interest, although I own both of these books and consider them to be excellent references.One word about the writing lessons, though. Useful as they are, they present features peculiar to Persian. While this is certainly not surprising, the point is that Iranians and Arabs do not write the same way - in fact, their handwritten script is quite different, and one should not assume that working through the lessons on the alphabet in this book would necessarily equip one to write Arabic."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book, &quot;Teach Yourself Modern Persian&quot; by John Mace, was first published in 1964 and has been reprinted without substantial changes numerous times since. In mid-2004, it was replaced by an entirely different book, but with the same title, by Narguess Farzad. This review deals with the original book by Mace.As the other reviews below note, the Mace book deals primarily with written, formal Persian, from a grammatical standpoint. It does not contain the latest slang, have any conversational practice, or impart any substantial background on Iranian history, culture, etc. Nonetheless, I think it is still the ideal &quot;starter&quot; book for someone working on his/her own, for the following reasons:-- It has the easiest introduction to the Arabic alphabet (as used in Persian) of any book I know. Lesson one introduces only three letters, and six words written with these, and provides practice on reading and writing these words. Lesson two adds two more letters, and another handful of words, with more practice. In all, the first eleven lessons (36 pages) deal with the alphabet, and with a bit of grammar, allowing the learner to proceed forward in small but sure steps.-- This bit-by-bit approach typifies the book; each lesson is from three to six pages, with clear explanations, easy-to-read examples, and practice exercises that go in both ways (with an answer key in the back).-- Although the Arabic script is used throughout, the vocabulary lists and example sentences also include transliteration, so that the learner is never in any doubt as to the pronunciation (which cannot always be determined from the Arabic script alone).In contrast, the latest &quot;Teach Yourself Modern Persian&quot; book, by Farzad, crams the entire alphabet into just a few short pages, leaving the learner to &quot;sink or swim&quot;, and throws so much at the reader in each lesson that I feel anyone without a background in Persian already would likely find it very hard going.In short, although old-fashioned (and with a few small errors as well), this book (the Mace book, that is) in my view provides the easiest way for a truly independent learner to make a good start in Persian. A good follow-up book, with a similar but more up-to-date, more sophisticated and considerably more challenging approach, would be &quot;An Introduction to Persian&quot;, by Wheeler Thackston. (Note that John Mace has also recently published a reference grammar of Persian, which is a separate book entirely; it is very useful for an intermediate student, but contains no lessons or exercises, merely a systematic explication of the grammar.)The Mace &quot;Teach Yourself Modern Persian&quot;, having been in print for a long time, is still readily available through used book sources, and I highly recommend it to those working on Persian on their own."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"I liked this book because it answers all the niggling questions that books written by native Persian speakers answer only obliquely. The book is very organized, proceeds at a reasonable rate, introduces very important concepts in a natural way, and makes irregular verbs easier to understand. Weaknesses of the book relate to its age and to a dearth of colloquial expressions."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book does a decent job of teaching the Persian alphabet in that it takes you through, letter by letter, so that you learn slowly and thoroughly as you go along. However, the Persian characters are actually printed in such a way that they're difficult to see!Also, a lot of the sample sentences grammar points and sample sentences Mace provides are grammatically incorrect Persian! Not a good book to start learning from."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"Okay, the good points. This book proceeds in a good, logical manner, with plenty of attention to each different subject. The dialogues are useful, and are not ridiculously difficult to learn. The alphabet is explained very well. Overall, it's a very useful and enjoyable intro to Farsi.There are three problems with this book: the text size is VERY small, making it very difficult to see how the letters are formed. Secondly, the organization of the vocabulary before each text does not proceed logically, nor does it include the appropriate words for the lesson. Finally, the language presented here is the formal, written language, and spoken Farsi really varies drastically from this. (For example, most Persians cut some syllables out of words)"},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book, went through the persian language slowly and throughly as to allow the reader a challenging read but not an overwhelming one. I recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to see a world never seen before or only dreamed of."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"Farsi (persian) evolves fast. Coloquialisms change as quick as English does. If a spanish speaker wanted to learn English, would you teach him how to read a newspaper first or how to buy groceries and ask the time? One would think the latter. If you wanted to teach someone from Russia how to read the Latin alphabet, would you take it letter by letter each case at a time, and then work on vocabulary, or jump around the alphabet learning a few unrelated words and skipping some of the lower case alltogether. If you want to learn persian using this book, you must know the in and outs of grammar before starting. If you do not, it would be best to look elsewhere. Otherwisewith a lot of work this book will make learning Farsi relatively easy. This book has failed to teach every day Farsi though, and confuse the beginner speaker. Sure the covers have changed over the years as with its size, however I hope (as with other books related to Iran) that the next edition is toroughly revised. None the less the concept (which is used in the book) for learning Farsi is a good one for those experienced with LAnguage terms and or learning other language."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This is a great little book, teaches modernish Persian, and I thoroughly recommend it as a _second_ book for revising Persian (or for learning literary forms if you've studied colloquial). It has a good intro to writing (and tends to use Persian written forms in the text, a good idea as most independent learners tend to copy the print typeface rather than learn a handwritten form). Why not as a first book? Well, only that the language is a bit out of date.So what instead? Thackston's \\"Introduction to Persian\\" is the first choice now for the written language, and for the spoken language either the new \\"Teach Yourself Persian\\" (Narguess Farzad) or the \\"Colloquial Persian\\" (Abdi Rafiee) would be better as these teach you to speak the language and have cassettes. But read the reviews. \\"Colloquial Persian\\" especially has big problems with the use of words before they're introduced, and I don't like the author's confusing use of colloquial forms in the Arabic script - such forms aren't usually written. Mace seems a better teacher than either Rafiee or Farzad, and only Elwell-Sutton's dated \\"Elementary Persian Grammar\\" (written Persian) does as well on script.A hint - if you can get a second-hand copy from the 1960s, the print quality will be significantly higher, the book smaller and (if hard-back) both more robust and lighter, ideal for the traveller."},{"Title":"Modern Persian (Teach Yourself)","review":"This book is a fine little reference grammar, but it is not best suited as the beginner's primary learning tool, and it is because the book is presented in the &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; series that I give it only one star. The exercises are insufficient, and one is left with many grammatical explanations and lists of words that one would very much like to reinforce by reading and writing but cannot.It does have the virtue of providing transliteration in most grammatical examples and it provides a key to the exercises for self correction.

It covers everything from Samba to using Linux as a firewall for Windows networks. The good thing about this book is that the author using a lot of examples.

Concise, to the point, allowing me a quick start with hints where to further each project. Dustin's approach is to offer real life examples of how to install and use Linux applications. He covers every basic aspect of the Linux system. My recommendation is to buy the book, install Linux and proceed page by page in the exact order of his book chapters and try everything. At the end of the book you will know a little bit of everything."},{"Title":"Integrate Linux Solutions Into Your Windows Network","review":"I liked this book. Dustin Puryear takes a good approach to writing this book. Instead of just giving you alot of information he obviously sat back and decided what kind of features an administrator wants out of a server. He then went on to explain how to actually offer those features using Linux. He does this using examples the entire book. If you are a hardcore UNIX user then this book is probably useful for you. It does go over UNIX stuff, and it can be used by UNIX people to configure their stuff. But for Windows NT people this book is GREAT! I feel like I'ma UNIX pro now! However I did have one small problem, and that's why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5. I found a couple of typo's. In most books this is ok, but in a computer book it can be annoying.

In the West, Genghis Khan doesn't seem to get half the attention that European conquerors like Napoleon and Alexander the Great did, even though Khan's accomplishments are much more impressive, both in the sheer area conquered as well as the duration of the empire.Lamb does an excellent job painting Genghis Khan, the thirteenth century warlord, as a survivor, charismatic leader, and brilliant military strategist. The amount of land he took with the number of troops he had is virtually unbelievable. More impressive is that he left something of a dynasty: his sons and grandsons ruled after him without squabbling amongst themselves. Alexander the Great, by contrast, was scarcely in his grave before there was factional conflict.Lamb's style is a bit dated (the book was originally published in the 1920s). His writing is lacking in punctuation. Many sentence fragments. And he doesn't always have a good flow to his narrative. He jumps around at times and doesn't satisfactorily flesh out certain things. More context would have been nice, as would have more and earlier background on the Mongol religion. But this is a short work, and on the whole, it's is a great introduction to a massive historical figure that is being forgotten by the West."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present (Facts on File Library of World History)","review":"Some encyclopedias such as \\"The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers,\\" \\"The Encyclopedia of Country Living,\\" or \\"The Cat Fanciers' Association Cat Encyclopedia\\" are interesting and well-organized enough to be read straight through.

However, we had to wait almost thirty years for a critical edition but the book seems to have been destined for delays from the moment it was conceived. Although the writer completed the first draft in just a few months by 1913, it took him another 46 years of correcting and amending the text before he decided to leave it alone for another decade in a folder marked \\"Publishable, but is it worth it?\\". The novel appeared for the first time in 1971, a year after its author's death. Rather in a hurry to get the last unknown Forster's novel, the editors apparently did not pay sufficient attention to variants of the text. Still the edition remained in print for another twenty-eight years before this corrected edition finally appeared on the market.An average reader may find this volume a bit too much to handle - over fifty pages of detailed introduction and almost a hundred pages of textual notes. Still the text of the novel is worth the money (just as the introduction) even if the extended notes (the editors apparently decided against publishing a separate volume of \\"Manuscripts\\" as they did in case of \\"A Passage to India\\" and two other novels) are addressed only to few specialists.A perfect gift for anybody interested in history of gay literature or Forster. Even if they already have a copy of \\"Maurice\\" this is so much more than another reprint they will be happy to have it."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Born in 1879 England, E.M. Forster attended King's College at Cambridge; thereafter his family fortune enabled him to live as please. He traveled extensively; dabbled in the celebrated Bloomsbury Group, which included the celebrated Virginia Woolf; and strove to conceal his homosexuality from the general public until his death in 1970. Although he was widely read during his lifetime, a series of films based on his novels prompted a major re-evaluation of his work during the 1980s and 1990s, and he is now considered among the finest English prose stylists of the early 20th Century.Written in 1913, MAURICE (prounced in the English fashion as 'Morris') was suppressed by Forster during his lifetime, and was not published until 1971--when it made quite a stir by exposing the author's long hidden sexuality through its story of a young homosexual man striving to find his way in late Edwardian England. As a teenager, Maurice Hall is given rudimentary male-female sexual instruction, but finds himself vaguely repelled. He quickly develops a sense of alienation from those around him, an alienation that continues unabated until he enters university and meets Clive Durham. Their relationship begins as aesthetic one, but soon evolves into a physical romance in which Maurice believes he has found peace with himself.Unfortunately, the pressures of society work to separate the two men: Clive is of a socially well-placed family and is unwilling to reject the social and financial opportunities it affords. He ends the affair and continues on to a respectable yet loveless marriage, leaving Maurice to obsess about their relationship and to seek a way of escape from his own differentness. Ironically, a later chance meeting with Clive not only brings Maurice to recognize Clive's failings, it also has the effect of placing Maurice in the path of a new, more compatible relationship.Forster's works are inevitably centered on class structure and struggle, and MAURICE is no exception: the demands of class force Maurice and Clive apart; the demands of an overbearing and indifferent society drive Maurice to both devalue himself and to seek a cure for homosexuality. In both instances Forster writes with tremendous power grace and clarity of the unthinking brutalities that Maurice must endure and the novel progresses with great power--but only up to a point, suddenly faultering at the end into a series of deus ex machina devices that are abrupt, artificial, and ultimately implausible.Even so, the novel must be read within the context of its era. Forster was working distinctly new ground; English literature had produced nothing similar to MAURICE up that particular point, and it would be another three decades or more until such novels as THE CITY AND THE PILLAR began to paint a reasonably realistic portrait of homosexual men and the pressures society exerts upon them. Given this, and in spite of the flaws these circumstances produced, MAURICE is a truly remarkable book; although it is distinctly romantic and rather discreet in tone, in many respects it is as modern as today. Strongly recommended, but primarily to established Forster fans and those interested in gay and lesbian literature.GFT, Amazon Reviewerstill laughing at the negative voter"},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"A fascinating glimpse into the world of \\"the love that dare not speak its name.\\" The book details the realities of being gay in Edwardian England as well as presenting a beautiful love story. Something to read more for ideas than action, more so than Forster's other works. As someone who grew up in an EXTREMELY liberal household, it was a real eye-opener, putting emotional substance onto my intellectual knowledge about intolerance.

Forster has been enjoying a prolonged renaissance, which is ironic considering the author of such classics as \\"A Passage to India,\\" \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Howard's End\\" never wanted any of his works filmed in his lifetime. Likewise he withheld his novel \\"Maurice,\\" a gay love story, directing that it not be published until after his death.There is a certain duality at work in \\"Maurice.\\" Though set during the Edwardian age, this work has a certain contemporary feeling.

The entire journey of discovery and acceptance is thoroughly and thoughtfully documented, from the initial self-loathing, to the unanswered pleas for guidance and understanding, to the unrequited feelings for Clive and the ultimate embracement of the unconditional love offered by Alec. \\"Maurice\\" is an outstanding achievement."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Really moved me.

Forster's MAURICE, at his direction, was not published until after his death in 1970 although in the \\"terminal note\\" at the end of the novel he says that he changed little of the story over the years. Unless you were a gay man living in 1971 and had been bombarded all your life with how awful homosexuality was, a crime, a sin and a mental illness, you cannot imagine the joy that reading this novel brought since the only person who dies in this novel is Maurice's grandfather. Of course Maurice is beset with self-loathing, fears, depression and loneliness as Edwardian society expected young men who went to Cambridge to marry and repopulate the earth. For instance, when Maurice attempts to discuss his inspeakable problem \\"of the Oscar Wilde sort,\\" with a family friend Dr. Barry, the physician responded: \\"'Rubbish, rubbish!'\\" He further said that the worst thing he could do for Maurice was \\"discuss it.\\" Maurice is able to rise above or work his way around this non-diagnosis, as well as a trip to a hypnotist to be cured, and have a life with another man.Some critics say that MAURICE is significant only in a historical context. Let them tell that to the gay teenager who finds this novel in his high school library and reads the beautiful ending, much more possible now than when Forster wrote it. This novel has universal appeal in that Clive, Maurice's first love, takes the easy way out by marrying and having a respectable career (we all know a couple of Clive's), and Maurice, for all his snobbery, grows to understand that love between men can cross class lines. (Forster's biographers note that he had a lover in 1919 who was an Egyptian tram conducter and fell in love with a London policeman in 1930.)In his fine memoir MISSISSIPPI SISSY Kevin Sessums recalls a conversation with the writer Eudora Welty who made him promise to read Forster's PASSAGE TO INDIA: \\"'MAURICE is not first-rate Forster, even though I understand the reasons why it would be the only work of his you've read.'\\" Being in the same boat with Sessums, I cannot disagree or agree with Ms. Welty. I can only say that this is a fine novel indeed. Forster, himself, said in ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL: \\"The final test for a novel will be our affection for it, as it is the test of friends and of anything else which we cannot define.\\"By Forster's own definition, he has written a great novel."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Well I really haven't heard of anyone ever reviewing a book they haven't yet completed but here I am.

Even Clive admonishes Maurice's decision at the end, and yet we're left with a sense that Clive is envious.

A stunningly beautiful piece of work."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"The book was written and takes place more or less 100 years ago. In doing so it shows the differences in the treatment of homosexuality in the Western world over time. Throughout the book, the characters' \\"affliction\\" scarcely has a name; there is a great silence about the subject; when discussed, it is thought of as the most vile thing imaginable; and attempting to \\"cure\\" it is the only way to deal with it. (Unfortunately, another difference is that more affection between friends was acceptable 100 years ago.) It's worth it to read this book in the past and get a personal account of societal changes.There are many more things in the book that, even if some are to a lesser degree, still apply very much today.*Denial, cognitive dissonance, not-quite-conscious awareness of one's sexual orientation.* It is a challenge to write about something when the character is only partially aware. Forster manages not to explicitly state Maurice's truth until quite a bit into the novel, while still leaving it crystal clear. The parts leading up to his eventual realization were my favorite parts of the novel. Even with more acceptance, many people are unconsciously aware of their sexual orientation or have a difficult time admitting it to themselves. One interesting comment in the book was about not so much fearing God's reaction as fearing the ridicule and disgust of one's peers. As someone who grew up in a non-religious household this was my only fear as well.*Isolation.* It's still difficult to find a partner when one's romantic interests are not the mainstream, which can give people a sense of isolation. The loneliness of the characters, though, is more intense than what most people will go through today. We can still identify today with the dilemma of trying to find out if someone we like would return the feelings. There is still the risk of rejection and of losing a friend. These characters also had to get past the lack of awareness of homosexuality, a more thorough persecution, and the risk of prosecution and imprisonment. Maurice can rely only on cues, body language and the person's revelation (there are no gay bars in 1910 England) and there are times he is wrong. Later in the book Maurice sometimes is resigned to being alone. I also remember feeling like homosexuality would doom me to being alone because of the rareness of it, coupled with the fact that coming forward (at least to one person) was the only way to find a partner.*Secrecy.* The characters must find ways to be together that no one at all knows about. When Maurice is heartbroken, he has to go through it alone without telling anyone at all. Secrecy closes off large sections of his life to others, and leaves him without any close relationships, because he can't take any chances at all of being discovered. It also leaves him vulnerable to blackmail, even more vulnerable than any famous religious figure or politician caught in a scandal today.*Being left for a person of the opposite sex.* It should not be any worse than being left for another person of the same sex, but it contrasts the way Clive treated Maurice with the way he treats a \\"socially acceptable\\" partner, and the way his loss is augmented by society's celebration of union with the other partner, and his inability to express his loss outwardly. Being replaced with a \\"socially acceptable\\" partner can add to a person's isolation and the feeling that they are more far-gone, hopeless, and therefore more vulnerable, than their former partner.I didn't know what to make of Clive's sudden \\"conversion\\". Certainly people's tastes can change over time, and because of people's tendency to black-and-white thinking, some people get attached to being either heterosexual or homosexual and don't acknowledge bisexual tendencies. Although I believe that a person's sexual preference can change gradually over time (in either direction), his sudden, intense attraction to women seems farfetched. Initially his attraction to women seems to be genuine, but it isn't clear that it has cancelled out his attraction to men. Later parts of the book hint at this. He could be somewhat in denial, or simply afraid his past will haunt him, but his inner mind is a bit vague. In his youth he was the rebellious one, the one with more self-awareness, and the one who influenced Maurice, but by the end of the book he is all about convention. His transition isn't fully illustrated--just one day he likes women, and then later he is shown as a mundane married person who finds sex between two men \\"inexcusable\\". He sure comes off as a sellout!*Identity.* When people enjoy something (such as the same sex) and the conflict is entirely because of social disapproval, they don't enthusiastically want to give up what they love. When Clive first experiences his \\"conversion\\" to normalcy, he says that it happened against his will. His sexuality makes him an outcast, but after being this way for so long and working to accept it, it is a part of his identity, and he is reluctant to give it up. Maurice also goes through this when trying to be \\"cured\\". He is regretful that he has to end this part of himself and forget being in love, and eventually realizes that he doesn't want to be cured.There were some things in the book that I couldn't quite figure out. Not sure if anyone else felt this way, but I still wonder, did Maurice and Clive ever actually have sex??? There was so much talk of restraint, but then again if there was no physical love at all then they would have nothing tangible to be secretive about.The book is written in a much more cerebral fashion than books of today, and leaves some things to be inferred or figured out on one's own. There are lots of books about gay relationships now, which go over similar themes, and I've liked many of them. But after reading Maurice I think it is a definitive fictional account of homosexuality, because its primary focus is on the struggles of the heart and mind, and because the time period intensifies the feelings and experiences that people still have today on a lesser scale.I don't know of what the reaction was when this book was finally published. The author at least saw late in life that homosexuality stopped being an unknown unspeakable thing, and he may have observed the very beginning of gay rights before he died and this book was published. In a way it's a shame that it wasn't published back in the 1910s (even though it probably would have been censored) when it could have helped others in the same \\"predicament\\"."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I bought the book Maurice because of having read Passage to India, Howard's End, Room with a View and, having enjoyed them so much I was wanting more of E.M.Forsters writings. As I began reading Maurice I was disappointed, thinking it was going to be another \\"boy becomes a man\\" theme; however, as I continued I was drawn into Maurice's life. It was alive. His feelings, dreads, terrors became my own. His feelings of being out of place were so vivid that I felt I knew this man and wanted to know more of his life. It is a marvelous story. I knew nothing of homosexuals apart from having heard them referred to as \\"fags\\" \\"queers\\" or seeing \\"gay\\" parades. I never connected to their part of our society or bothered to inform or investigate anything about their type of lives."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Like other Forster works (A Room With a View and Howards End, in particular) Maurice is a piece that would have pushed many societal envelopes at the time of writing; however, when read with only modern sensibility, it falters as unimpressive. This is only the case if the book is not read with the historical context in mind, and if you're reading it outside of this context, you might as well not bother to pick it up. Fortunately, the reader is constantly reminded of the historical problems faced by the central character.Similar to other Forster novels, the subject matter is treated with tender care and not forced upon the reader simply to advance a \\"taboo.\\" If the book had been published when it had been completed in 1914 instead of in 1971 (published posthumously), it would have outraged simply because of the thought of homosexuality, not because Forster forces homosexuality upon his reader. Forster seems to present his subjects in this manner to fool the typical English thinker into rooting for the characters, until a tragic \\"flaw\\" (tragic to the majority of Englishmen) is revealed and the reader is forced to consider where his/her loyalties lie and why they lie where they do.The protagonist Maurice Hall, knows from an early age that something is not quiet \\"normal\\" about him, though he is not sure what it is. Forster eases us into loving the awkward character (awkward because of his feelings, not due to physical appearance since he is a rather striking person). What is interesting about the novel is that it is not simply a study in homosexuality at a time when is was a criminal offense to act as a homosexual, but it is also a presentation of how societies react to people who are misaligned from the norm in a religious way, as well. Maurice battles with belief in an almighty God, and his first lover, Clive, is an outright atheist.Forster weaves two characters who cannot believe in the normal tenets of society, not for lack of trying, but simply because they cannot wrap their heads around what is normally accepted socially. Forster hints that Maurice is born with inherent differences that ultimately make him more beautiful that those who simply accept the status quo. Forster is perhaps at his best when Maurice attempts to \\"cure\\" himself through medicine, tracking down doctors who have eradicated his sexual \\"illness\\" in past patients with a certain degree of accuracy.As the book takes a turn toward cures, it became clear to me that this might be the first Forster novel I was going to read without a happy ending. After reading Howards End, I felt the happiness at the conclusion was a bit unrealistic and was only written so as not to disappoint the readers. While I thoroughly enjoyed Howards End, if Maurice was to have a happy ending, I figured it would end in the protagonist being cured and if that was the case, I probably would have burned my copy of the novel. Miraculously, Forster manages to squeeze out a beautiful ending to work. It is one marked with a twinge of melancholy, and remains wholly realistic. I won't do anything to spoil the plot, but I'd be highly surprised if you're not impressed by the way Forster ends this piece.After reading the \\"Terminal Note\\" following the novel, one finds that Forster poured dedication into this novel fully expecting to publish the book before he died. However, by the year 1960, views on homosexuality had changed direction, but had not taken the exact course Forster had hoped for. The author notes, \\"I...had supposed that knowledge would bring understanding. We had not realized that what the public really loathes in homosexuality is not the thing itself but having to think about it.\\"Forster's effort to increase understanding and spur empathy for gay men was one that fell short of a wholly intolerant public. The staunch views on sexuality in general did nothing to help his cause, and it is a bit ironic since this is something tackled by one of the characters consummating his marriage: \\"[T]hough he valued the body the actual deed of sex seemed to him unimaginative and best veiled in night. Between men it is inexcusable, between man and a woman it may be practised [sic] since nature and society approve, but never discussed or vaunted.\\" If this is the attitude toward heterosexual sex, no wonder homosexual sex was a crime in England until the Wolfenden Report of 1957.To me, Maurice is Forster's masterpiece. While it may not have had an effect on the public of the time, the feelings of a sexually oppressed person being put down by a sexually repressed society certainly have strains of truth that are still very much relevant in modern society. The book is a beautiful piece of retrospective that one can only hope is never forgotten. I implore you to read this book and share it with others."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"How sad that this book couldn't be published during the era it was intended as a commentary on. Nevertheless I enjoyed following poor, stupid Maurice through a tale of ultimately coming to terms with himself. Back then you weren't just gay, you were depraved or ill to have such thoughts or preform such acts, and Maurice's inner turmoil regarding this viewpoint--from a man that seems to understand little but at the same time feels everything keenly--is particularly engaging."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"\\"Maurice\\" by E.M. Forster is one of my favourite novels. It is so simply and beautifully written and tells a story that all readers will able to relate to in one way or another. A tragic reflection of Forster's own life of closeted homosexuality - the novel itself was written in 1914 when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain and remained unpublished until 1970 - the novel tells the story of Maurice Hall, a young man trying to come to terms with his homosexuality in traditional Edwardian England where his \\"sort\\" are arrested for such \\"crimes\\". However, when he meets Clive, a fellow student at Cambridge, he realises that he is not alone in his predicament after all. As the events of the story unfold, things become deely sad as Maurice suffers more and more because of a secret that he feels he cannot tell any of his family and friends. The heartwarming ending - which Forster must have hoped for himself as well - is ultimately uplifting and allows the reader to envisage what the future will be like for Maurice themselves."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"This is one of the few books I plan to read again. What a beautiful story. For those of us who have not had a same-sex relationship, it illustrates that, love is just love, the emotions and feelings are the same regardless. This book was impossible to put down yet difficult to finish and say goodbye to."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"If you are looking for THE homosexual novel, then this is it. Its theme and characters are so well developed that it is strikingly real. It deals with the disappointments in the life of a young, confused, homosexual man. It also scrutinizes British society of earlier this century in such a way that it reveals so much of the hatred and class prejudices that existed then. Amidst all that is a wonderful love story. What more do we want?"},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"\\"Howards End\\" is my favorite book of all time, but the final chapter of \\"Maurice\\" contains, perhaps, the most beautiful prose I've ever read. Longing, regret, sorrow, resolve: it's all there."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"At first blush, \\"Maurice\\" seems unlike any of Forster's other novels. An unapologetic tale of love between Maurice Hall and Clive Durham, two Cambridge students during the years preceding World War I, the book is still a sensation; it's no wonder that Forster chose not to publish it--it would have ended his career. Yet this story, too, explores the preoccupations apparent in all of Forster's fiction: the hypocrisy of British traditions and, especially, the absurdity of British class structure.\\"England has always been disinclined to accept human nature,\\" says a mesmerist to Maurice when he is seeking a cure for his \\"condition.\\" In this scene, the doctor is referring, of course, to sexuality, but considered in the light of all six of his novels, Forster judges English attitudes toward the human condition as a whole. Once Maurice and Clive fall in love, \\"no tradition overawed the boys. No convention settled what was poetic, what absurd.\\" But it is, in part, this knowledge of being outside the law (or, as Maurice admits, \\"outlaws\\") that ultimately rends the couple in half.The last section of the book brings together all these themes. Maurice's unanticipated and tense liaison with Scudder--a servant, no less--is seemingly impossible not only because they are both the same sex but also because they hail from different classes. To society, the sexual element is intolerable, but to Maurice the class difference makes such a relationship even more inconceivable--\\"if the will can overleap class, civilization as we have made it will go to pieces.\\"To Forster, however, both taboos stem from the same tyrannical tradition; he had similarly depicted the futility of mixed-class relationships in his previous novel, \\"Howards End,\\" with the illicit relationship between the blueblood Henry Wilcox and the lowborn Jacky Best. But here he brings to the story the possibility of hope. Indeed, only when Maurice has thrown over both proscriptions--that of class and of sex--can he \\"fully bring out the hero\\": to \\"live outside class, without relations or money,\\" and to understand that love must be its own reward for an \\"outlaw\\" in England.In many ways, \\"Maurice\\" is the least polished of Forster's books--if one judges such things on the basis of prose style and narrative structure alone. Scenes often feel sketched; transitional elements are scant; characters enter and exit the stage willy-nilly. Perhaps because the manuscript was revised in 1960, it has an occasionally minimalist, even modernist tone. Yet the abandonment of traditional considerations suits the story--and Forster has instead created two fully realized characters in what is surely his most caustic, most emotionally raw satire of British manners."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"This novel has been on my to-read pile for a long time. Despite all the rave reviews, I think it was just okay.There was character development on the part of the main characters, but the scenes seemed flat and dull.Also, Forster's writing is tough to follow at times. I'm not sure if it's the syntax of the sentences, or what. Maurice's dialogue lines, especially, were almost unintelligible. I get that this is how people spoke colloquially during that time period.

Why the american people had to wait so long to have it, since its edition in 1917 ? always censorship !"},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"EM Forster wrote this book in 1913-14 but declined to allow it to be published till after his death. It tells of Maurice Hall (which immediately made me think of Radclyffe Hall's classic 'The Well of Loneliness) growing up with an awareness and horror of his homosexuality. As I struggled to develop a 'oneness' with characters who were so alien to my own natural preference an amazing thing happened in the story. One of the two main 'gay' (Forster does not use this word) characters suddenly decides he likes women. Does this happen, I wondered? Or was it an excuse used by one 'gay' (or bisexual) person to disengage from a partner they no longer enjoyed? For me, of course, it drove another knife between the remaining 'gay' character and myself. It seemed that homosexuals could be changed/change - they could all be like me! Was this a literary device of Forster that aims to modify the responses of readers - making the job harder for heterosexual readers to identify with Maurice, making homosexual readers even more keenly feel the alienation of society (especially when the book was written)?In an afterword Forster explains that his book had to have a happy ending (despite great trauma suicide is mentioned only once throughout the book). This made me think again of Radclyffe Hall's 'Well of Loneliness' with its remorseless and, for me, unsatisfyingly negative ending. Hall wrote her novel about lesbians in 1928 and it created a furore in its time. That Forster was sitting on his novel at the time is an intersting thing to me. Was he tempted to publish? Perhaps he felt he could not join the same storm. Perhaps he originally had the miserable ending Hall wrote, and changed to distinguish his novel. In the end, these can be little more than speculations.When I read Richard Fortey's book 'Trilobite' I complained in my review that I never really got to like trilobites as Mr Fortey obviosly does, despite enjoying the book immensely. The case is the same here. Forster's writing is inventive and rich, but I am left feeling just as alienated from homosexuals - I am simply not one of them. Am I more sympathetic? Perhaps. But the best that I can hope for is probably to be more tolerant."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I think I'm setting myself up to be abused for an imperfect understanding of Forster's work, but I love Maurice, and I only like everything else he wrote. Forster's plots to me are so controlled that his novels become more like chess games than stories--his characters move entirely according to their classist/symbolic value; their minds are types, their types interact. Sometimes this interaction is delightful, as in Room with a View. Sometimes it is genuinely touching, as in Where Angels Fear to Tread. But it is always highly regimented. This criticism extends for me to his prose, which I find to be too rule-bound--he always leaves the same words out; his style is symbolic of delicate subtlety without necessarily being so.But in Maurice, Forster lets go some of this reserve. His prose, which I find formulaic in his later stuff, is here undeveloped enough to be idiosyncratic, un-stylized, and gorgeous. Maurice as a character is wonderfully, wonderfully real, and I appreciate the detailed development of the plot because Forster brings home with such ability the hazards of Maurice's struggle, the ever-present possibility of failure, the balance between lesser and more important goals, and the way in which Forster makes clear that these goals, as Maurice knows when he &quot;listens beneath&quot; words, are not the ends that he is really achieving as he achieves them. Maurice himself is drawn with Jane Austen-ian precision: Forster mixes the divine heroism--beauty and brutality--in Maurice's essential, private life with his utterly mundane non-essentials--politics, understanding, relationships with family, opinions, way of talking, appearance, job.This is a heroic book. It moves me to tears every time I read it."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"MAURICE is a novel of homosexual love, the first one I have ever read, but more than that it is a very direct description, perhaps as honest as could be---without either sensationalism or trivialization---of the inner feelings of a homosexual man. It begins when the main character, Maurice Hall, is a school boy, traces his emotional life through Cambridge and into the world of work, and ends in an upbeat, if rather abrupt fashion. In the confusion of early years, Maurice does not realize his true nature, but loses himself in sports, hi-jinks and studies. He devotes himself to his mother and two sisters. In short, his is the life of a typical English public school boy at the time (pre-WW I) Only at university does he recognize his real nature, though he'd had intimations mostly ignored, and truly falls in love with Clive Durham, a fellow student. Forster traces the ups and downs of this affair, leading the reader through all the ups and downs of homosexual love affairs. Maurice joins a financial investment firm, leading a totally conventional life in Britain's rigid class society, except for his sexual orientation. Eventually events take an unplanned course, Maurice winds up with another man, of a different class and nature. He experiences hitherto unknown problems. The ending, given Forster's rather pessimistic outlook on life, is unexpected.This novel may not be for everybody, but if you attempt it, you will admire the skillful writing of E.M. Forster and you will come away appreciating his honesty. The dialogues sound very alien to an American in the early 21st century---a whole different way of using the English language---but no doubt they add a special flavor to the book, a period piece after all. I would say that a person who does not try to understand all aspects of the human condition has not truly lived, has not truly understood himself/herself. This is to readers who may not see the point of reading a novel about homosexual love. If you can't appreciate it as the great literature it is, perhaps you will think about the courage it took to write such a novel in 1914. Even then, it was not published until 1971, a year after Forster's death. Perhaps you will imagine what it is to become a great writer and still not touch upon a subject so close to your heart."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I have to confess, I watched the movie first (which I watched three times in a span of two days). I enjoyed the movie so much that after the third time, I ran out and bought the book. The book is absolutely beautiful. I remember sitting on the subway reading Maurice and forgetting where I was, ingnoring everyone around me, and letting the book whisk me away to a time and place obviously different, yet unfortunately similar in attitude towards same-sex relationships (I missed my stop). I couldn't believe Maurice was written over 80 years ago. The subject matter seems too contemporary to be written about during that time, and I suppose that's why E.M. Forster's novel is so great. He manages to capture effortlessly the relationship of Maurice and Clive, as well as to paint a picture of what life was like back then for gay folk. Readers can easily transpose many of the events and experiences in the novel to the present day, which makes empathizing with Maurice so much easier. This novel should no doubt be a required read. It shares many of the complexities as Forster's other work, yet perhaps it is glossed over more because of its subject matter--which, if true, is such a shame."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"The film of &quot;Maurice&quot; produced by Merchant Ivory a number of years ago is one my favorite films. I was curious, having never read E.M. Forster before, to see how much of the issue of homosexuality was a product of the book and how much was played-up for the film. The book did not dissapoint. An honest, self-aware writer, E.M. Forster tells a beautiful story of a fairly unremarkable young man who is forced to (by virtue of being gay) become remarkable. Problems of English repugnance at homosexuality (a feeling he shares himself at first) and of class make him into a grownup, into a real man. In the book this becomes a wonderful liberation--that does not come through as well in the film. A marvelous read. Not published until after his death in 1970. Only a few read it when he actually wrote it in the teens. Too dangerous. A shame. Far ahead of it's time."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Why do I love this book? Is it because E. M. Forster presents a wide and believable spectrum of queer men? Because of how the title character is such a good example of the heroism ordinary people can have? Because of the fact that it's a piece of Edwardian queer literature that doesn't end with insanity, despair, or death? Because Alec Scudder is the best bisexual character in all of literature? Yeah, it's all of the above.Various literary critics and historians have voiced the opinion that E. M. Forster was cowardly to have not published it during his lifetime, but given that he was a somewhat retiring person who came of age as Oscar Wilde was undergoing his trials, I think it's pretty brave that he wrote it at all. \\"Maurice\\" is never sensationalized, nor is it cliched. Things I found as flaws revealed themselves as underscored points upon re-reading. I will go so far as to say that this book should be read by every single person on the face of this earth."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I read Maurice after watching the film starring James Wilby and Hugh Grant.I thought the movie which was by the way really good has been touched by the hands of a screenplay writer from the nineties to make it look so convincing. I was skeptical about whether a \\"straight\\" author of the Edwardian age would be able to write convincingly about homosexual love so I bought the book to find out for myself .Well , it was money well spent .I read it all over one night (it is not that long anyway).The author's portrayal of human emotions is mesmerizing.His descripton of anger,frustration,despair and despondency experienced by a homosexual man at that time is outstanding.The escape routes utilized by the major characters in the novel(religion,psychiatry,hypnotism and marriage) are so authentic.I recommend it strongly to anyone who is serious about ridding themselves of the contempt our society feels toward homosexual people.It is a very well written book."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I saw the film \\"Maurice\\" long before I read the book. As delightful as the movie is, the book is even better, because we are able to get into the thoughts of the characters and the mind-set near the turn of the 20th century. At first, I did not like Forster's writing style; it's almost too economical, occasionally cryptic. Many times the prepositional referent isn't altogether clear, creating unnecessary ambiguity. Moreover, a lot of the jargon is particular to second-decade England, not to current U.S readers. But as the story picks up momentum, the economy of style turns almost poetic, and the linguistic particularities fade, making this novel into a real page-turner.The story and the characters are highly realistic, even by today's standards (though written in 1914). There's the common issue of the conflict with \\"coming-out\\" gay vis-a-vis the desire to be \\"normal,\\" which as Forster concludes, is essentially one and the same, regardless of nature's impulses. While to be gay is ultimately to be normal, it is not without its social and personal prejudices and misunderstandings, particularly at the time this book was written. Likewise, Forster demonstrates that gay people can (and most often do) lead quite normal, happy, even transforming lives, despite these difficulties. This is what gives the novel its joy.Above all, this is a typical story of the vicissitudes of love, the only difference being that it involves three men (and several secondary women). One man (Clive), while thoroughly enjoying his same-sex love, ultimately represses it to make himself socially acceptable, politically viable, and personally miserable. Another man (Maurice), initially thinks he has to do likewise, but he cannot suppress the insuppressible, and finally does the inevitable and heeds his nature's call. The third man (Alec) discovers his unique love, and while initially angry that his love isn't immediately reciprocated, comes to love the man who really does love him after all. In many ways, this is the ultimate \\"homosexual\\" novel, but in many other ways, it is also the universal romantic novel.Beyond the obvious love story, Forster weaves in various themes and ideas of the times (that are still with us). For the perspicuity in incorporating these themes and how they relate to being a human being first, and being gay second, Forster makes for a most satisfying reflection and examination of perennial issues. Not only is the single most important emotion, love, addressed in all its complexities, but so are certain theological, psychological, philosophical, business, and political nuances addressed. The whole enterprise is exceptionally satisfying. A novel worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"This is one of the best books on the thought processes of a young boy/Man on various stages of maturity. I saw the movie before reading the book. So I always visualized Hugh Grant as Clive and James Wilby as Hall. The movie has not deviated much from the book at all. The movie is a must see!A beautifully written book. The words, imagery and intellectual ideas on Christianity, art, perceptions, greek philosophy, psychology - all superbly written. This book will fine tune your perceptive faculties and intellect."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"\\"Maurice\\" was written by E.M. Forster in 1914, but as he instructed, the novel was not published until after his death in 1970 as he did not want to shock \\"society\\" (specifically, \\"England\\") due to the strong homosexual theme (which was unacceptable then).To me, this is Forster's best and most readable novel. It is also easily his most romantic and sexual. I was completely absorbed in the story right from page 1 and couldn't put the book down! The scenes, situations and dialogue are so richly and beautifully written, while the love story is simply one of the most moving I've ever read.Maurice is our hero here - young, rich, Cambridge-educated and quite a snob. He is not aware of his true sexuality until it is \\"brought out\\" by his Cambridge friend, Clive who loves Maurice first. Their coming together and love affair are simply delicious to read and when the words \\"Maurice, I love you\\" and \\"I you\\" are uttered, tears just came to my eyes because it was so romantically-written, and I said to myself, \\"At last Maurice is happy\\". However, after some years of happiness, comes despair when Maurice is rather cruelly rejected by Clive who claims that he (Clive) has \\"suddenly become normal\\" and cannot love Maurice anymore. This novel succeeds because Forster had created a most believable and lovable hero in Maurice. His hope becomes your (i.e. the reader's) hope, his love your love, and his despair your despair. You desperately want him to find love and happiness again. And then when Maurice has decided to give up on love and life, his saviour appears on the scene in the form of the attractive, working-class man, Alec. The ending is a great triumph on the power of love and hope. I know I should be depressed for days (if not weeks) if this novel were to have a sad ending...Unlike Forster's other novels, this one is much \\"braver\\" and contains real sexual situations. The scenes are rather erotic (especially between our hero and Alec) without being too revealing and they are written in such a romantic, honest and passionate manner that will certainly melt your heart.This novel was filmed to critical success in 1987 by the Merchant-Ivory team (who did \\"A Room with a View\\" in 1985) and starred James Wilby (as Maurice), Hugh Grant (as Clive) and Rupert Graves (as Alec). I've ordered the DVD and can't wait to watch it.I love \\"Maurice\\" so much and will remember its beauty forever. The romantic scenes made me cry, the funny scenes at the hypnotist's made me laugh and the ending of the novel made me feel very-very happy. I know that anyone who picks up this book will be in for a wonderful time. It is a novel that could be read again and again. Now, if I were to be stranded on a desert island and could only have 1 book for company, \\"Maurice\\" will definitely be it!A 9/10!"},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"According to the introduction of the book, this question was found after Forster's death scribbled by him on the cover of the 1960 typescript version of the novel. I think that while the answer for the reader has to be 'yes', it is also easy to see why Forster had his doubts.The book was an intensely personal one for Forster, as it addresses the issue of homosexuality in the context of the early 20th century. Because of its subject matter, it was not published after it was written (1914) and Forster went on to significantly rewrite the book at different periods throughout his life. Although by the time of the last rewrite (1959-1960) Forster could have published the book in terms of its subject matter, he was not satisfied with the work itself. According to his biographers, he found it dated and had never been satisfied with the ending._Maurice_ tells the story of a conformist young man who finds himself increasingly attracted to his own sex. He moves from a disasterous relationship with an undergraduate friend to a more adult affair which finally causes him to break from the rules that he understood all his life.While the book is historically fascinating, and actually quite emotionally affecting (Maurice is perhaps one of the fullest characters in Forster's novels) it suffers from its history of revision and uncertainly. There's a hesitance in the writing and a strangely jumpy character to many of the plot points. It doesn't make it less worth reading, but perhaps less perfect than some of Forster's other efforts."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"This book, originally written in 1913, describes a man coming to terms with his homosexuality in the repressed England of that time period. Interesting reading, be sure to see the movie as well for a good portrayal of Forster's work"},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Maurice is one of the greatest books I have ever read. In terms of a gay novel, it is the only one that I can really stand. And it is the best one I have read thus far. This novel helped me to hope and dream at the start of a long sexual journey (I'm still young, so I have a long way to go).Now, you might wonder for all my high praises, why I didn't give Maurice five stars. Maurice is not a simple a novel as one might figure. It's extremely layered, and more than most novels esp. the 'classics' different people get widely different things from it. If you read it at the surface, you get the story of the sexually confused/frustrated Maurice Hall who falls in and out of love with Clive, and eventually forms a lifelong companionship with Alec Scudder, a man of the lower classes who works on Clive's estate. But if you look closer, then look away real quickly the picture becomes clearer. Archetypes form, and a beautiful story takes shape. It might not come to you like a bolt, but more like a rainy day that floods the passages of the mind until it spills all over.I must say though that while I commend Mr. Forster for his presence in the literary landscape, but I feel like he didn't work to his potential. I think he was bound by the time he was born in. If he was born nearly 100 years later, Maurice would have been a bestseller and a classic."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I rated this book five stars, and I like it a lot, but I have to admit that it doesn't quite have the depth and breadth that Howards End had. It is, however, much more readable than some of his other works (A Passage to India) and I think it has about the happiest ending out of any of his books. The maturation of the main character and his relationships (Clive is not my favorite character) is definitely well-written, well-plotted, et cetera, and it's the kind of book that you want to sit down and devour at once (less 'classics' display this tendency than popcorn genre works). It is the kind of book where you shouldn't care that the main character prefers men; it matters, that's what the book deals with, but it's not the sum total of the book."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"At the February 2013 meeting, we had a very large group (16 men and women, one of the largest groups we've had a for a while) meet at the LGBT Center in NYC to discuss \\"Maurice.\\" We agreed to pronounce it in the British way: \\"Morris.\\" Everyone either liked this book a lot or loved it. There were no detractors.Everybody thought that the story - even though it was written in 1913 - reflected very modern feelings about being gay and coming out. It mirrored a number of our coming out stories in college. We discussed the very strict class distinctions and how it affects both Maurice and Clive, and then Maurice and Alec. We considered the possibility that Maurice could follow Alec to The Argentine, but decided that the class ties couldn't be broken this way. We also discussed what might have happened to Maurice and Alec after the novel ends. (This is very \\"Downton Abbey.\\")Forster writes people and characters very well. He doesn't describe places and environments as well. We did think that the women's roles, however, were week. Maurice's sister Kitty is only lightly drawn and Clive's mother is conspicuously shallow. Only Clive's wife, Anne, seems slightly interested and interesting in her very Victorian, very well dressed sexless marriage.We discussed two of our favorite scenes: Maurice and Clive ride off to the country together on a motorcycle to spend the afternoon in a way that would never be re-created. Maurice and Alec meet in the British Museum and are confronted by all of history and their new-found emotion.While we all understood the visit to the hypnotist (and the emerging Freudian world that was emerging at this exact time), we questioned Maurice's appearance in the open window at night, mystically calling to Alec. This might have seemed out of place, but we were reminded of Maurice's grandfather who had mystic theories about the sun, which were somehow transferred to Maurice.We discussed why Forster was compelled to write such a novel, even though he knew he couldn't publish it and the comparisons to his life. Richard (thanks for your research!) discovered a discussion of Forster's diaries (entitled \\"Poor Dear, How She Figures\\") written by Alan Hollinghurst in the London Review of Books. This explains much of Forster's relationship with his mother and women, and describes the world in which \\"Maurice\\" was written.I also uncovered the Andrew Holleran review in the Gay & Lesbian review (entitled \\"The Last Englishman\\") of the Forster biography, which describes Forster's attraction to the lower classes and more about his novels.While written 100 years ago, \\"Maurice\\" has not aged much and still seems relevant, almost more than the James Baldwin \\"Giovanni's Room,\\" (which we read in the group several months ago) which was written 40 years later and seems much more of the period when it was written."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I acknowledge the importance of this book and on that alone I would like to give it five stars. However, I just did not connect with the book. I tolerated it. It had nothing to do with the subject matter as my mind is as open as anyone's could be. It just seemed to drag on for me for the longest time. I was so happy with the ending because it was finally over with. Well, that, and it did have a happy ending. That was refreshing.The book I had was the audio version. The narrator was very good, but perhaps that had something to do with how I felt about it."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Cambridge student Maurice Hall is beginning to realize just how harsh, strange, and unfair some realities are. His future has been carefully plotted. He's to follow in his father's footsteps as a stockbroker, then marry, and embrace all the responsibilities required for someone in his position. Maurice isn't overly thrilled with these prospects, but when he meets the young and attractive Clive Durham, he begins to rethink what he really wants from life.Maurice is E.M. Forster's fourth novel, however, given the attitude toward homosexuality when the book was written in 1913/14, he did not want it published until after his death. What interested me was the obvious improvement in Forster's writing with every novel. The anguish and torment is beautifully drawn, and although Maurice seems incredibly shallow at times, it's also believable of a self-centered, twenty-year-old driven by want and emotion. Sometimes, the characters seem over the top, but perhaps their actions and statements reflect attitudes of the Edwardian era.The battle between want and expectation drives the story and this is where Forster really shines. I was happy to see almost no author intrusion in this book, and I'm looking forward to reading Forster's next novel: A Passage to India."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"** spoiler alert **It's difficult to say something really meaningful about a book like this, because more educated people can obviously be more eloquent and sensitive. I'll talk about three recurring thoughts:Loneliness. This was what struck me about Maurice and what I think was the sentiment he felt more deeply than any other. Maurice doesn't have a likeable personality, not at first. He's not the brightest or the most sympathetic of people, but he is sensual, affectionate and yearning. Being alone, not being able to express his passion and feeling doomed to not share it with anyone, all his qualities and quirks made him a young man for whom I cared. His inner pain was sincere and made him deserving of love, because he wanted it so much. I felt that he was probably the character with the most romantic soul in the book.This story was clearly dear to Forster and I think this was both a strength and a limit. In the Final Notes of the book it becomes clear that the author was trying to write original characters loosely related to people he had met, probably more the secondary characters than the protagonists. Sometimes though I had the impression that Forster didn't want to immerse himself too deeply in them, that he was trying to reach a balance between what he knew, what he lived, what he was creating, therefore there was sometimes a detachment that made me think we were only allowed to see participate in the outer appearance of events, but not really penetrate them.The ending is not the perfect happy-ever-after, but it has a strong feeling of affirmation that satisfied me. I felt that we were abandoning Maurice when his life was really beginning, but it was also a metaphor of what gay people did at the time: disappearing into the greenwood and trying to live their lives without attracting too much attention. Maurice, who is so average among his peers since the beginning, is very brave at the end, not in the sense that he outs himself to the world - which was impossible at the time - but in the sense that he is ready to sacrifice a lot to be himself.Recommended."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"This is one of Forster's best novels, and certainly one of the best novels dealing with homosexuality to come out of the early 20th Century. This should appeal to anyone who enjoys reading British period pieces and anyone who enjoys books set in British schools. While only part of the novel takes place at school, it is integral to the novel. My favorite character has always been Scudder. I have read many gay novels since reading Maurice years ago, but he remains one of my favorite characters in literature. The film version of this book is wonderful as well, and I certainly wasn't disappointed in the casting of Scudder."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"I kept asking myself in awe, how does this author manage this subject so brilliantly?

Although undoubtedly not one of Forster's greatest novels, Maurice nonethelesss exudes a brilliance of style in every sentence whilst a biting intelligence permeates throughout, far outshining most contemporary works. Written swiftly and without a hitch during one of Forster's most intensely creative periods, the novel affords crucial insight into a writer at the height of his powers."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"The politics of the book's release and Forster's own closeted life have to be considered outside of the actual book. As a work of literature, \\"Maurice\\" has always been a favorite of mine. Certainly, it gives a true and honest account of what it must have been like to live as a shadow in society if you were a gay man in early 20th century England. I believe that many reviewers have mistaken Forster's penchant for illustrating \\"the muddle\\" (see Mr. Emerson's final speech in \\"A Room with a View\\") of his characters as his dislike of them. As with almost all of his other novels, the hero of the story isn't actually heroic until the end, when the muddle is lifted.In all events, \\"Maurice\\" is an engaging and delightfully unsentimental love story. To this day, I can promise that nearly every gay man can easily see a part of his youth adequately reflected in Maurice."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"\\"Maurice\\" by E.M. Forster is one of my favourite novels. It is so simply and beautifully written and tells a story that all readers will able to relate to in one way or another. A tragic reflection of Forster's own life of closeted homosexuality - the novel itself was written in 1914 when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain and remained unpublished until 1970 - the novel tells the story of Maurice Hall, a young man trying to come to terms with his homosexuality in traditional Edwardian England where his \\"sort\\" are arrested for such \\"crimes\\". However, when he meets Clive, a fellow student at Cambridge, he realises that he is not alone in his predicament after all. As the events of the story unfold, things become deely sad as Maurice suffers more and more because of a secret that he feels he cannot tell any of his family and friends. The heartwarming ending - which Forster must have hoped for himself as well - is ultimately uplifting and allows the reader to envisage what the future will be like for Maurice themselves."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"Only published after E. M. Forster's death (by his own request) this a classic no one should be allowed to miss while going through life. Set in Edwardian England it's the story of a young man's sexual awakeness, a journey of self-discovery that brings him to face the social mores of the day and eventually reject them - at a time when a happy ending could still be possible even if only by a return to nature. The characthers of Maurice, Clive and Alec are fully rounded, but on another plan they stand for the divisions of class and how the establishment could entrap you but love could liberate you from class altogether. It's been a life-changing experience for me to read this novel. Dismiss any prejudices you may have against gay love or Forster or 'classic literature'. You probably will find it a very pleasant, refreshing and poetic surprise."},{"Title":"Maurice (Penguin Modern Classics)","review":"A just wonderful book.

Like My Sixty Memorable Games or My System, you just won't be able really to understand this game until you read it. Bottvinik thought that the study of Alekhine's (and Capablanca's) games should make up the backbone of one's chess learning. Yet don't think of this book as a mere obligatory read. The games are enchanting: You will find reading this book demanding, but you will also find it fun! The author of this book is one of the four or five greatest players of all time and it shows! His games, esp. those against Reti at Baden Baden, Rabinovich, and Nimzowitch, rank as some of the greatest ever played."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"Look. This is plain and simple. There is not a collection of better annotated games out there, and for this price, how could you not buy it!

Yes, Alekhine's analysis is sometimes unobjective. Yes, he sometimes (though rarely) presented as the actual gamescore a faster win that, in fact, he had only found in a post-mortem analysis. And, yes, of course, his opening ideas and opinions are outdated.That said, this book (these books?) are still, justifiably, considered a classic. The real reason has nothing to do with Alekhine's outdated opening analysis or his creation of a quicker win in the endgame after the fact. It is Alekhine's analysis of the MIDDLEGAME, of attack, defense, and counterattack--the very meat of the game--that makes this book great.As a master of the complicated attack, of turning nebulous strategic advantages into concrete winning variations, Alekhine had seldom, if ever, been equalled. Choosing a game at random (Game 62, Tarrasch-Alekhin, Pstyan 1922) and skipping over the opening variations, Alekhine notes, inter alia:1. Move 14: White is already strategically lost because he \\"ceded the center to his opponent in exchange for a pawn of little value\\".2. Moves 18-24: After launching an attack to take advantage of this, Alekhine notes in detail the only correct tactical way to carry on the attack, praising White for defending very well (incidentally, praise for his opponent's moves--and criticism of his own--are quite common in Alekhine's analysis, contrary to the usual claim that he despised his rivals.)3. Move 28: How he prepared a bishop sacrifice to break down white's final defense and mate.It is probably true that, in top-flight games among the world's top 20 grandmasters, such games are impossible today, due to improvement in defensive technique that would not allow Black to achieve this kind of strategic advantage in the first place, or perhaps find resources to defend once the mating attack is launched.But for anybody is not one of those top 10 (or perhaps 100) players, knowing how to conduct an attack in the middlegame once you have a strategic advantage is the single most important subject to learn, as this is how most games are decided; and here, Alekhine is unrivaled. Even if one (unfairly) ignores *all* of Alekhine's opening analysis as outdated and *all* of his endgame analysis as invented, what is left is an absolute gem."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"This is a wonderful collection of games from the legendary world champion. Aleknine sheds light on all phases of the game: opening, middlegame, and endgame. His unsurpassed combinative ability is on display together with the positional thinking and combative attitude that made him a winner with an attacking style.I am a hobby type player and found the annotations far easier to understand than any other game collection. This book really helped me improve by showing that one can recover from poor moves in the opening or even middlegame miscalculations."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"This book is actually two separate books, bound together in one volume. Considering the price, this book is an absolute bargain if you are looking for a good collection of annotated games.Even though the price is very low, the games annotated in this collection are incredible. Alekhine spent a great deal of time and care to annotate the games and to point out blunders, side lines, and highlights of each position. His annotations are clear and approachable and will appeal to the novice and master alike. Plodding through these games on an actually board is a pleasure as well.The book is in descriptive notation instead of algebraic; if you can handle this, and you want a collection of very well-annotated games by one of the very best players of all time, then this book will fill the need beautifully."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"Alekhine invented &quot;attack preconditions without commitment,&quot; an essential concept of modern players. This is why Botvinnik insisted it is essential to study Alekhine.It's miraculous to watch Alehine increase his readiness to attack the King while at the same time being ready to attack ANYWHERE. Of course, this is a wonderful book just to enjoy, since Fischer called Alekhine &quot;the deepest player who ever lived.&quot; Meaning? Fantastic combinations explode at any moment!How do you create a safe, flexible position that can suddenly turn into a whirlwind attack?

I have had it since '95 and each time I come back to it I am more blown away by how great it is. The only negative--and it has nothing to do with the quality of the book--is that there aren't a lot of Sicilians and King's Indians, so we don't really know how the great man would have dealt with those.

If you don't have this book, you cannot be said to have a chess library."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"If you want to to play creative and energetic chess, if you want to leave the oppenent in shock and the spectators in awe, this is the book for you. Alekhine had this uncanny ability to create positions that not only earned him great wins, but were also visually very satisfying to the spectators - with the fireworks, and shocking surprises sometimes when you least expected them. If people think chess is a long and boring game, give them this book, and they will love the game for their lifetimes. It's an excellent piece of work - even the mighty Kasparov drew his inspiration from the great Alekhine."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"Much has already been said about how indespensible this book is - actually two volumes in one. The price is amazing...consider how much a movie costs for a couple of hours of entertainment. This book can do that for you 150 times! Each game will take you on a journey of chess learning and possibilites. Alekhine's annotations are unsurpassed in his lifetime. I like to play the games on Fritz and watch the evaluations and rarely does anyone always pick the best move once they have the advantage. Always a 2nd or 3rd best move will creep in, and although the game is usually won, it is interesting to see other possible good or better moves. Well Alekhine's games seem to have a very high percentage of best moves once he has the advantage. Such was his power of concentration and force of will.If you want to be a victorious chess player, study Alekhine! He will show you over and over again the fighting qualities a champion requires. And his creativity?!! He makes attacks where most everyone else sees nothing. It makes one consider that Tal must have absorbed Alekhine in full because that lighting attack quality exists in both champions.When you start the book, the 4th game against Yates shows how perfect and strong a player A.A. was. Yates gives plenty of thoughtful resistance but Alekhine, even this early in his career, plays inspired and brilliantly forcing chess! I don't care what the naysayers claim about this book. It is simply one of the very few best chess game collections in existance and if you want to expand your chess mind, this is a fun and wonderful way to do it. Indespensible, a bargain and full of the power of one of the absolute greatest chessplayers and world champions of all time. You play chess? You buy this book!

I lost it years ago, and have just ordered it again. I think there is something heavy and physical, brutal in Alekhine's play: more direct than Petrosian, less sparkling than Tal. Whatever--this is a fantastic book. I hate descriptive notation like any lazy s.o.b.; here's my suggestion: with a pencil write the algebraic notation just above the old form notation. This also forces you to concentrate on the game more. Every chess player should be very familiar with Alekhine, and this is a great book to do just that."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"I'm currently a USCF Expert with a rating above 2000 despite taking up the game past the age 30.When I was around 1300, I was stuck for a long time despite doing a bunch of chess study.I read this book and seemingly magically, all at once, I was at a 1600 level.Why? Is there magic in this book?No. But I believe reading Alekhine helped me utilize what I had been studying.In his games, he fought ferociously for the center and for the initiative. And held on to them with dogged determination.If you threatened one of his pawns, he ignored it and threatened an minor piece. If you threatened one of his minor pieces, he ignored it and made you respond to his attack on your king.Once I saw this and used this, I started beating people who I couldn't beat before. I grabbed the initiative and held on. If i didn't have the initiative, I fought for it.Does all the analysis hold up to today? I don't know. I don't care. It's good enough to beat people beyond master strength.I do find the descriptive notation annoying, but for me, the improvement was worth it."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"In my early years of playing and studying chess, Alekhine's games made the most impression on me (let me say first I didn't study more modern masters after Botvinnik in those years because I read materials which were dated years ago so it excluded Fischer, Kasparov, etc.) I heard that some players including Kasparov also remarked that. If you think of chess as an art, Alekhine's games certainly have quite distinct qualities which I try to describe.Alekhine's games possess qualities which someone may find very attractive (myself in early years) but another one may find it heavy (like Fischer; although Fischer did made some positive comments on Alekhine's chess). I like to compare Alekhine's art to that of Beethoven while Capablanca's to Mozart's). Alekhine in his early years did not possess the positional mastery which is necessary to propel a player to the top rank, but he did have combination gift which makes his games fascinating. This reason (there is also psychological block which Reuben Fine pointed out)explains why Lasker and Capa were superior than him in his early years. Later Alekhine developed his positional mastery and he's a well-rounded player with a rare ability to produce beautiful games. At his peak, he is distinguished even among world champions.The decision to buy this book may depend on your taste and your stage of development. Some masters' games are complicated and beginners may find them a bit difficult to understand without annotation. In my opinion, beginners will benefit from studying Morphy's games and learn the importance of development and how to play in open positions. Capablanca's games are also very good to beginners. His games improve my playing with positional understanding. Besides, I believe that one can imitate Capa's playing style with no risk. The same is true for investors to imitate Warren Buffett's investment style (but there's no gaurantee that you can achieve the same results as Buffett). But you can hardly imitate Alekhine's style as it's risky to try to imitate George Soros's investment style.In conclusion, I think you will not regret buying Alekhine's games but it's possible (depend on your taste) that you will like other masters. At the same time, some will find great inspirations from his games. One of Alekhine's greatest games, Reti-Alekhine 1923 (if i'm not mistaken) is truly spectacular, a rare beauty. I wonder if a very strong computer program (perhaps even stronger than Alekhine) can produce this game."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"a must-have for the serious chess student. this book is one of those every player needs to study for advancement"},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"It's hard to praise this book too much. The games are exciting, the notes lucid and instructive, not weighted down with mechanically generated variations. (As Hubner's and Nunn's are, for example.) I've played through these games at least once a year since I was a B-player. As a master, I still learn a little more each time. There are some game collections which equal Alekhine's -- Botvinnik, Tal, the orginal edition Fischer -- but none surpass it."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"As others have mentioned, Alekhine's analysis is highly unobjective. He often neglects to mention defensive oversights by his opponents in order to make a dubious attack seem like a forced win. Furthermore, his opening analysis is incredibly weak in this book. Many of the lines he criticises harshly are now considered the &quot;book.&quot; It almost seems that the more rudely he treats a line, the more respect that line currently receives.But the most appalling thing of all is that a good number of games have been doctored or made up out of whole cloth. Just a few of the most egregious examples:Volume 1 --(1) On page 69, he discusses a game he played as White in Moscow 1915 which ended with 5 queens on the board. In fact, his opponent Grigoriev had White, and the game provided never happened (White played 11.O-O-O, not 11.NPxP). The line he cites as the game actually come from an analysis of the game.(2) On page 79, he changes the ending of the game. The game proceeded 36....QN5 not 36....BR5!(3) On page 84, he claims Mieses resigned. In fact the game went on an additional 15 moves.(4) On page 107, he changes the move order to highlight some analysis.(5) On page 109, he claims he played 27.QK3! In fact, he played a weaker move and the game dragged on 21 more moves.(6) On page 240, he cites a game Alekhine-Tenner 1907 which never took place.Volume 2 --(7) On page 250, he changes the ending of the game. He had played the weaker 22....PxB not 22....QxB leading to mate.Utterly disgraceful."},{"Title":"My Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937","review":"The only reason I rated this book a 3 is because I only understood a little from the annotations as well as his games.

About 20 years ago, you couldn't beat him for readability, along with Bronstein's Zurich 1953 and Botvinnik's 100 best games... Alekhine also commented on a couple of tournaments in the 20's and 30's in a style similar to this book, and they had their place in the sun then.I have owned this book for years, and I attribute my too-daring playing style to Alekhine's unobjectivity. If you really want to know the truth, Hubner has a CD that mercilessly refutes much of the myth of Alekhine's perfection.IF you are on a budget, buy this book.I just wanted to add some balance to what I see as uniform, uncritical agreement--I've scanned the top selling books at amazon.com for chess and only My System and this book seem out of place so far (they should be lower, read my review on My System).PS Beretorn had some useful things to say in his review, I'm amazed that people give reviewers negative feedback--indeed, the descriptive notation is bothersome for many readers, Alekhine's Defense's absence is relevant, and the best part, \\"I'm not sure this book will help you\\" will aid the buyer in differentiating far more than uninformed fawning...however, I would not give it 5 stars.3 stars, but 2 to counteract all these ridiculous fives.I have your chess development at heart, so please, take what you can from this review.

If you can't deal with descriptive notation than beware of this :)... Still even if you can't figure out what the moves mean... Just reading the book is rather interesting, also its 2 books in 1... The price is rather affordable for just about anyone... The writing style is rather easy to follow and at times give the reader insight into what his thoughts were... I know many say he had ties to certain people and all this... This book is about his chess and mostly what he did at the chess board... The name Alekhine Defense I think is sorta confusing since not many if any of those games are in this book... From name you would think that he played it lot more often than he actually did... So do not get this book thinking your gonna learn that defense :)... Granted the cover isnt the best color, nor is the picture the best... Still its not a bad book to leave on your coffee table or something... Ive not read my book in a while at all... Yet I see it at least once a day, just one of those classic books... Im not really sure this book will help your game to be honest... Still just reading his words I find rather interesting... Many remember him as beating the one who many still think was best ever... Sadly he died before giving Capablanca a rematch, so people speculate he would of lost and got lucky... Also I think Alekhine was the one that brought preparation to new levels in chess...

That said, I realize that for many involved in a child custody dispute, it may seem like a \\"war\\" to them. Charlotte Hardwick offers to them an abundance of practical advice as to how to formulate and then implement strategies which will help them to achieve their objectives. Almost daily it seems, the media inform us of violence which results in the deaths of estranged or divorced parents; worse yet, the deaths of their children. These are indeed tragedies. Less publicized (if at all) are child custody disputes in which one parent is better prepared than the other for obtain a court ruling favorable to her or him. (Many of murder/suicides occur after such a court ruling, despite a restraining order and other prudent precautions.) I highly recommend this book to any parent who either anticipates a child custody dispute or has become involved in one; also to grandparents and other relatives of the principals involved in such a dispute; also, to others who could become involved, such as clergy, law enforcement officials, social workers, school administrators, teachers, coaches, and even attorneys who do not specialize in child custody law. One of the greatest values of this book is that it identifies what seem to be all of the options to consider. Another is that Hardwick helps her reader to sort through those options inorder to select those which are most appropriate. Once such selection has been made, Hardwick then answers the inevitable question \\"What now?\\" To the best of my knowledge, there is no other single volume which offers anywhere near as much information nor one which presents its often complicated material as clearly.We have a large family and, thus far, have had no personal experience with a child custody case. However, over the years, several friends of our family have found themselves involved in one. Other than taking the obvious step of obtaining legal counsel, they really had no idea what to do...and not do. Hardwick wrote this book for them as well as for all others who are ill-prepared and emotionally preoccupied. Not all child custody disputes resemble \\"war\\" but all of them do have profoundly serious implications and consequences. Hence the incalculable value of Hardwick's assistance when attempting to know what they are, to understand them, and then to proceed."},{"Title":"Win Your Child Custody War","review":"The book arrived!

It consists of nine first person narratives, the first eight belonging to the inmates and the ninth, and last, being that of the nurse or &quot;House Mother&quot;. The innovative technique used by Johnson is to make each line in each section correspond to the same moment in time. Each section is prefaced with a list of the various infirmities and deficiencies suffered by that person (including a CQ count, used to assess senile dementia, which is the number of correct questions answered out of 10 such as who is the prime minister, what day is it etc), giving us an idea of how that individual's perceptions of events might be affected. Another typographical device used is that interior monologue is shown in roman type, speech in italics and absence of thought or speech by white space.The technical device used may sound contrived, but it works marvellously to create a vivid three-dimensional effect. Johnson gives us an insight into the geriatric mind with humour, compassion and empathy. The accounts are by turns, both funny and tragic. A couple of the inmates who are at the extremes of senility are portrayed with great feeling and the use of white space and other typographical techniques augments the writing wonderfully in these sections. The final section, that of the House Mother's, is the only disappointment of the book. Her ostensible &quot;normality&quot; forcing us to reassess the apparent &quot;abnormality&quot; of the inmates' perceptions. However, her revelations seem insignificant compared to the human suffering we have already experienced.Overall, this is one of those rare examples of a perfect fusion of form and content, and another wonderful piece of work from a great, but neglected writer."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy","review":"House Mother Normal tells the story of a night in an old people's home as told by eight of its residents - all with varying degrees of senility - and their perverted carer, the &quot;House Mother&quot; of the title. Each of the nine narratives is synchronised in time and within the text, so that a multi-layered panorama of the evening's events slowly emerges. Johnson was a working-class Londoner who was a disciple of Joyce and Beckett. His novels display a range of experimental devices and tricks and he was in many ways ahead of his time. His books are hard to get hold of, but Picador are about to re-issue &quot;The Unfortunates&quot; his famous &quot;book in a box&quot; (27 loose leaf pamphlets to be read in any order)and Jonathan Coe is writing a biography. He is well worth reading."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy","review":"This was such a strange novel. I like the way Johnson writes out the dialogue or musings of the individuals on one side of the page while writing the atmospheric conversations on the other. I say it was strange because of the ending....but I won't spoil it for you."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy","review":"Johnson's experimental novel focuses on an evening in a geriatric home, where a house mother tries to amuse eight patients of varying mental and physical capabilities. The novel is comprised of nine sections, one for each character. Each section has twenty-one pages - except for the last section, the House Mother's section, which has twenty-two. Each section includes a short case sheet before the narrative, ostensibly as an introduction to the mental and physical state of each character. They seem to function as a rationale for the narratives following them. The narratives themselves are written in stream-of-consciousness style, following the characters' thoughts and spoken words as they occur.You'll notice as you read that the events are static throughout each narrative: what happens on page seven of one narrative occurs on every page seven. Your understanding of the evening's events evolves slowly, one piece at a time, as you read each section. Also, the narratives start with the most lucid and able character (Sarah Lamson) and work their way through increasing levels of dysfunctionality and abnormality, culminating in the House Mother's narrative.It is a very involved way of reading, of course, and one cannot help but feel sympathy for the characters as they see the world through each individual set of eyes, minds, and impairments. The House Mother's narrative is, again, an exception. Delving into her mind is absolutely repulsive. This technique would work, except for page twenty-two: Johnson speaks through the House Mother, reminding us that she is a construct and that, as the author, he has full control over the novel. It's an interesting move, but at the same time, it invalidates the universe of the novel by removing our suspension of disbelief. For many readers, this move renders the entire novel meaningless.Also, the stream-of-consciousness style detracts from character development. The main concern of the narratives was memories of the past and reactions to the present, so there is little room for meaningful characterization. I still developed sympathy for the characters, but it felt contrived, especially since we as readers are forced, by the last page, to become aware of the fact that Johnson is using techniques.With techniques aside, the contrast between the cold, scientific distance of the case sheets and the human warmth behind the first eight narratives, and the contrast between the patients' sympathetic narratives and the house mother's disturbing narrative, reveal a criticism of how ineffectively society deals with deterioration of the body and soul. During Victorianism, people with mental illnesses and venereal diseases were sent to asylums, where they were sequestered from the general population that had no understanding of their conditions. Now that science has evolved and has a complex vocabulary for nearly every condition known to man, society has adopted those terms. However, these technical terms are more comforting than enlightening: we have some control over ourselves, their existence assures us, we have found some semblance of order in the vast universe. And yet, we are still insulated from the horrible reality of illness because we give power to these meaningless words (many of which, in the case of the novel, are high-flown technical terms for well-known conditions). This labeling and empirical \\"knowledge\\" neglects that there is humanity behind these conditions, and that there are very real people suffering in ways that the healthy cannot understand. Scientific language has become the modern-day insane asylum. Johnson illustrates that point well, even though the novel suffers from a couple poorly devised techniques."},{"Title":"Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest : A Romantic Travel Guide (7th Rev Ed)","review":"From the Oregon Coast to the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, my wife and I have relied on previous versions of this book.

There are just so many great restaurants and B abd B's that are missing.An entry in Bend, Oregon states that Bend is known better for outdoors kissing spots than cozy restaurants, yet I can name Kayo's Dinner House, Le Bistro, and McGrath's Fish House right off the bat that are left out.In addition, I don't know if this would be considered a best place to kiss in other people's books, but growing up in Bend, the two best kissing spots were on top of Pilot Butte (might be closed to cars now) and Pioneer Park. Neither were included.In Washington, Centralia's got a very cozy B and B I'd love to go back to visit (no Centralis entries) and Ocean Shores isn't even mentioned.That said, the most annoying factor of the book is its organization.

What is most astounding is Kenneth Koch's humility and honesty, and his willingness to admit mistakes made in teaching poetry to a group of old people at a nursing home. He divides the book very usefully as well. First he introduces the process from start to finish of the workshops, including some of the seniors' works. In the second half of the book, he prints the poems done by participants for each exercise first, then discusses what occurred during the session. One participant in particular is very much a poet, although he'd never written poetry before, and I fell quite in love with him. However, as the book went to press, Kenneth says, this man passed on. You will thouroughly enjoy this book. Aside from the poetry, it has alot to say about the assumptions we make about old and/or infirm people."},{"Title":"I never Told Anybody: Teaching Poetry Writing to Old People","review":"The simplist, profoundest stories are laid out in a delicate and spare way by Koch's nursing home students. Don't shy away because it might be sad- rejoice that Koch got these stories before they were lost. These aren't the poems people might write to impress others or even themselves- they explore the things that matter most.If you teach anything creative- think about why you teach it. To give job skills? To meet state goals? Those are both fine reasons. But Koch is teaching in a nursing home to profoundly affect how people look at their inner landscape.

I had bought the book originally because of my interest in Ken Koch's books WISHES, DREAMS, AND LIESWishes, Lies, and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetryand ROSE, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT RED?Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?: Teaching Great Poetry to ChildrenAs I recall, in the late 1970s, WISHES, DREAMS, AND LIES especially helped me to encourage high school students in remedial reading to take a leap of faith or intuition in order to write verse and revise it -- what turned out to be a very helpful reading tactic.I'm glad to say that this edition contains the same material that was in the first. Why the title was changed, I am unsure. The new title leaves me cold; the old one was more relevant to the content of the book, and it has been maintained on all but the new title page. Anybody who knows anything about the lives of people who are remembering what cool stuff they did and never told will also wonder about the current cover of the book. (I have used 60s jargon for a reason here, people. Have you been to a gathering of 60s radicals lately? Pretty tame.)Anyhow, exactly how Dad used I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY is something I do not know. I suspect that he loaned it to his assistant. That any poetry might have been written rather defies my imagination, but the book does give some wonderful conversation starters and, in the poetry section, some insights into the kind of reflection that someone of the age I am approaching might be inclined to make. In that way it is still an invaluable tool for young aides who have the insight to read it with a little sympathy. Maybe some of those aides might have the patience to help the occasional oldster to write a lyric, or whatever.After Dad passed away I found my copy among his possessions with his name on the inside of the front cover. Invaluable!"},{"Title":"Rotten Ralph Feels Rotten: A Rotten Ralph Rotten Reader","review":"Jack Gantos and Nicole Rubel deliver one of their best Rotten Ralph books in this recent book. Rubel's illustrations capture the irrepressible spirit of Ralph (that is: mischievous, naughty, but competely loveable), and author Gantos cooks up a truly funny, very authentic Ralph adventure in four linked chapters. Owner Sarah wants Ralph to eat a healthy meal of fruits and vegetables (her refrigerator also contains miso, dates, yogurt, and hamburgers made without meat), but Ralph thinks the food \\"will finish me off.\\" Sneaky Ralph climbs into the alley while Sarah sleeps and becomes a \\"trash-can gourmet.\\" The gross-out food he eats, and the piggy manner in which he eats it is true Ralph:\\"He lifted a lit and got busy. He started with a green chicken wing. Then he nibbled on some squishy squid. After that he licked a furry fish. For dessert he found a hunk of blue cheesecake...\\"The result? A nightmare of \\"little rats with spears...jumping up and down on his belly,\\" and a quick trip to the vet. The very, very sick feeling Ralph is asked to cooperate at the vet's office, but he spits out the thermometer. When the vet tries to check Ralph's reflexes by thwapping him on the knee with a little hammer, Ralph kicks the vet off his stool. (There's a very funny picture accompanying this scene, while frustrated Sarah says, \\"Behave...or you'll just feel worse.\\" More comical resistance follows, until the vet and Sarah and a nurse pour an emetic down a funnel placed in Ralph's mouth. Rubel's talent is very evident in making these potentially violent and unpleasant situations seem jokey instead of upsetting. When Ralph wraps the vet and the nurse up in surgical tape; however, the vet decides Ralph need to stay overnight for observation. This is his comeuppance, so to speak, and Ralph misses Sarah and home terribly. What to do?Escape, of course! However, even Ralph learns his lesson about the perils of garbage cuisine, and when he arrives home he just grabs some nuts-to pile on top of a gigantic banana split! Sarah and Ralph are happily reunited. After 30 years, the Rotten Ralph series is as fresh as ever. I'm a big fan of these zany adventures for young kids, and the plot, the humor, and the pictures are vibrant and incredibly engaging. You might want to also look at Rubel's \\"A Cowboy Named Ernestine\\" and \\"Cyrano the Bear\\" for more humorous pictures and stories! \\"Rotten Ralph\\" is printed on high quality paper with superb color reproduction."},{"Title":"Rotten Ralph Feels Rotten: A Rotten Ralph Rotten Reader","review":"This is a very funny book I happened to run across at the library.

Most of the songs have been released in other songbooks or are just unexceptional. But, the snippets on Alfred Newman, his studio musicians and bios and work of great studio songwriters are interesting. Anyway, MGM and Warners were more famous and popular for their song repertoire. Still, I bought the book for its strong points. Wonder why the book ended at 1959 ? Was it because Newman retired as head of music at Fox ? And what about vol 2 1960 and after ? And, Lionel Newman was wrongly captioned as his brother Al at least twice in the photos. Fox, you can do better ."},{"Title":"The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck","review":"In his brief historical novel about the Bismarck's last days, CS Forester omits most of the usual philosophical reflections that are a hallmark of his most famous novels--the Horatio Hornblower series. Here, the compelling story of the hunt for and sinking of the great German battleship is descriptive rather than analytic, but I don't mean by this that the book is not readable and enjoyable: it is. I started it one evening, thinking I'd get a few pages into it before turning in; I ended up finishing the book in a couple of hours (and I'm no speed reader). Moreover, I'd recently seen the very good 1960 movie 'Sink the Bismarck', which is based on this Forester book--and it still excited me. Not great as strictly history--Forester intended instead to portray events as they probably happened, and the result is persuasive, entertaining, and highly satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck","review":"Interesting book.

I have read most of his Hornblower series and cannot find fault with any book he has written."},{"Title":"The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck","review":"CS Forester has proven with his Master and Commander series that he is no slouch when it comes to providing literary suspense on the high seas. In THE LAST NINE DAYS OF THE BISMARCK, he's turned that talent to a true-life history of the British hunt in the north Atlantic for the German battleship, Bismarck, during World War II.Just as the catastrophic US defeat at Pearl Harbor in 1941 seemed to result from a concatenation of small events, so too was the British sinking of the Bismarck a series of tiny twists and turns that, to give destiny its due, in many cases seemed to result more from good luck than good management - the serendipitous discovery of the Bismarck's location by a Swordfish torpedo bomber when the weather was so dismal and the skies so overcast that, by all good sense, the bombers should probably not have even been in the air; a chance shot that jammed the Bismarck's rudder and forced her to steam away from the coast of France when she was probably less than an hour away from Luftwaffe air protection; and, finally, Britain's preternatural good luck in being able to stay in battle against the Bismarck when they were literally within minutes of running out of fuel.The history is all well known, of course, and the ending will come as no surprise to anyone. But the joy and excitement is in Forester's ability to tell the story and relate the history with all the bated breath and suspense of the very best thrillers. If you enjoy history, then you'll certainly enjoy this brief re-telling of one of the decisive turning points of the WW II.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck","review":"I read \\"The Ship\\" by CSF recently and love it.

That being said, I haven't read anything so compelling in I don't know how long. The book is a journal that Joseph kept while traveling west to find his fortune in 1854. My understanding is that it was originally written in an old Germanic text, and that the original journal was in very poor condition, so translating it was very arduous and there are pieces missing.However, what is left is definitely worth the read. Full of interesting characters, encounters with Native Americans, descriptive passages of the wildlife and terrain, and an easy enjoyable read. It's one thing to learn about this time period from text books in school, but much more insightful and interesting seeing as it's a first hand account of the time period.This book is out of print, and there were only a little over 500 printed back in the 60's or 70's. If I were you I wouldn't hesitate on this purchase. Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Dangerous to Love","review":"This was my first Thornton book but it will not be my last. The characters of Julian and Serena were well developed and thouroghly captivating. Because this book was a little longer than most it allowed one to really really get involved in a complicated story with lots of mystery included in the romance. Julian and Serena had tremendous chemisty - you felt it from the first but they both had such distrust of one another. Thank goodness for Flynn - without him I fear they may never have made it in the end. I love books that have a little suspense with the romance and if you do too - you will love this book. I look forward to many more of Thornton's!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous to Love","review":"A sexy, romantic story full of twists and turns, intrigue, suspicions, and misunderstandings -- but in the end, love, freedom, and fulfillment.Although Serena is a little spoiled, her heart's in the right place; she definitely needs someone like Julian to hold the reins. Julian learns that there's more to live than revenge, even regarding his enemy's daughter. Neither character is perfectly likeable, but that seems to make them more human. It does get frustrating sometimes to see how little they trust each other (repeatedly), but trust takes time, especially in their circumstances. In the end, they both learn and grow--as individuals and in love.It's a very long book, which is quite nice when one reads as quickly as I do. I think it's one of Thornton's best; it's different from some of her other better novels, but definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Dangerous to Love","review":"Serena Ward had embarked on a dangerous course as she sat disguised as an actress waiting to smuggle a passenger out of England in her support of the Jacobite cause. Unfortunately for her, she attracted the amorous attention of Julian Raynor, owner of a popular gaming club - and die-hard anti-Jacobite. As the militia bore down on Serena and her accomplice, Julian bore down on her. Choosing the lesser of two evils she agrees to accompany Julian in order to give herself time to escape the militia. When Serena tries to explain to Julian that she is really a high-born \`lady' he cuts off her explanations with kisses and much to Serena's dismay - she responds - wholeheartedly! The morning after - her maidenhead gone - Julian is happy that he was her first and offers her carte blanche as his mistress. Highly insulted and ashamed she tells him who she is and Julian finds out that she is none other than the daughter of the man Julian blames for his family's misfortunes. He plans to exact revenge by marrying Serena. Tricked into marriage, Serena finds it difficult to maintain her icy reserve toward Julian, and the attraction she feels for him.One thing leads to another and behind the scenes forces add fuel to the fires that make these two star-crossed lovers not trust the love they have for one another, as from the beginning, events happen that have both Julian and Serena feeling betrayed by each other. Forces and conspiracies, beyond their control that neither knows about continue to wreak havoc with any chance of reconciliation. That they are indeed meant for one another - even if it is \`dangerous love' adds much fuel to the flames of love.This is again, one of the amazingly fast-paced, edge of your seat, and outstandingly sensuous stories I have come to expect from this author. Her main characters and the numerous secondary characters are so well defined that they make this story come alive. The very passionate and highly charged sexual encounters will make your toes curl - very hot! The historical background of England 1747 in this highly charged period lends substance and excitement to another triumph for this historical romance author! Outstanding book and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Dangerous to Love","review":"I enjoyed bits and pieces of this book, sadly the melodrama was a bit over the top. I think I'll have to be in the right mood for the excess of emotion and drama in this one in order to read it again. I will be trying out other titles, however, as the mystery of the real baddy was good and the writing was fast paced and engaging. I had a bit of trouble with the \\"brat\\" factor of the female character, and the fact that the male character (who really originates a great deal of the mistrust between the two) never actually apologizes for being such an a**. Of course, the female character prostrates herself, because her love means more to her than *sob* *sob* I can't go on, you get the idea!!

Although the plot of whether or not Justine will succeed in her mission holds the whole story together, it is largely scene after scene of hedonistic sex and punishment with a variety of different lovers and scenarios.

Now, what about the Incas and the other pre-Columbian civilizations of the Andes?This book consists of 15 essays by a dozen scholars about the Incan quipus (or kuipus if you prefer) -- knotted cords in complex arrangements that, everybody agrees, were used to record numbers and statistics. Did they also convey thought? Or in other words did they comprise a \\"written\\" language, albeit a very strange one in that their communications resembled a bird's nest more than a book? Were the quipus a mnemonic device only? Or could a narrative be transmitted from person to person?These scholarly essays examine different aspects of khipus including their history, construction, mathematical theories of their meanings, and factors which might lead to their decipherment. It seems doubtful that we will learn to \\"read\\" khipus unless we have the luck to find one in a context that will suggest its meaning. However, it seems also that they truly did constitute a system of communication akin to writing.I thought this book was fascinating -- although the essays are written in dry careful scholarly prose that can be forbidding. The Incas are one of the most mysterious of the non-Western civilizations and the study of the khipus is a real-life detective tale. Not the least interesting aspect of this is to realize that the Andean civilizations, isolated from the rest of the world, came up with unique -- often odd to our perception -- inventions and technology that worked for them. The khipu instead of writing is one.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Translation of Children's Literature: A Reader (Topics in Translation)","review":"This is a wonderful collection of articles on the subject of the translation of children's literature, and I found it extremely helpful in doing my own research on the subject."},{"Title":"Aspects of the theory of syntax (Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Students and instructors alike were baffled, spent hours trying to understand it, and loved it or berated it. But no one could remain neutral about Chomsky's Theory of Syntax.Many years after graduate courses in different linguistic grammars, I picked it up again, and it is a comparatively easy read for present or former lingusitics students.The initial problem readers encountered was Chomsky's presupposition of a wide knowledge of all aspects of linguistics (and some major theories of learning behavior)-- he presupposes that you have grasped the sources that he either is reacting to or revising: What came before is what forced Chomsky to begin creating his theory of syntax. This is NOT like his later books: this IS syntax, the \\"technical kind.\\" And that is partially what makes the book so important.Regardless of your opinion or reaction to this book: NO ONE CAN IGNORE IT, or its effect on linguistics after its publication.IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO READ 'WHAT SOMEONE SAYS CHOMSKY SAID.'

This is also the work which sparked the &quot;generative semantics&quot; debate that charged all through the 1970's. If you are a linguist, you must read this book.

As a student of English as a second language, I find his work (on the English language) precise and very instructive.Since this is a new area of attention for me, which all came to happen when I started to prepare for my grammar section on the GMAT exam, I find his work as linguist, the ultimate piece of knowledge on the field. What I mean is that by reading half of any of his book (on linguistic), you develop a mental picture of his theory. He makes any other books I read on grammar, which are essentially filled with rules, just too limited if you try to find further explanations about the rules. For example, find out why the sentence, \\"I had a book stolen\\", can have three meanings (Pg. 21).Finally, what can we say about the person who questioned Skinner with enough grounds? Some of his other work could be questionable, but he is one of the most influential authors of our times with no doubt. I wish more research and development were possible to actually attain a universal grammar concept.I mean just check out the book from a public library, or buy it if you are really interested on knowing why we say what we say and giving the proper meaning to words.My background: I learned English as a Second Language 20 years ago. I have an engineer degree and a Master's, both from a US - tier two - college with a great football team.

It is preceded by experimental modelling of linguistic knowledge based on rewriting rules and the resulting conclusion of the need for transformations and is followed by new innovating ideas on restricting the power of transformations. We already see the deep thinking that went into the development of the next stage. He discusses the idea of 'singulary transformations' which the individual transformations were, then, composed of and which later developed into Move-alpha, Delete-alpha, etc. He argues very persuasively for a separate 'lexicon' and the kind of information we should expect to find there. Overall, it is rich with seeds that later developed into the ideas comprising the 'principles and parameters' theory.

Special technical report)","review":"This is the single most influential book in the cognitive sciences. Everybody in that field defines their position in relation to this book.Has it stood the test of time?The fundamental distinction in the book is between 'competence' and 'performance.' We can have a hard, mathematical and super precise science of competence, but not of performance. Performance, at the time this book was written, was a &quot;mystery.&quot; Chomsky went on to claim that it would always be a mystery.As it turns out, Chomsky's distinction (which is fairly isomorphic to Kant's position of &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;faith,&quot; whether he knows it or not) has turned out wrong. Sociobiologists have basically made &quot;Orwell's problem&quot; (why do we know so little about such obvious stuff?) into a permanent fact of human nature. It is effectively the case that all societies have elites, they all have crime, and they all exercise violence to lesser or greater degrees. And if you read Chomsky's work in politics (all of which is in the realm of performance or Kantian faith) he comes out and says it: every state that has ever existed is run by gangsters.What of the idea of 'competence'? It will probably last a long time, it may very well be the equivalent of mass in physics. But there are problems with it. Namely that it treats the person who applies it and is alive as though he or she is dead. It is essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy that is derivate on the Universal self fulfilling prophecy and tries to usurp the Universal's power. My guess is that it is like Freud's Oedipus. It has overwhelming heuristic and pragmatic value, but no ontological power.(What is it with these Jews?

The book manages to avoid the story-telling of strictly popular &quot;myth books&quot; and to avoid information that will be extranneous to a novice reader. At the same time, each entry gives sources, so readers know, for example, that the story of Philomela was covered Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Sidney, Keats, and a host of others as well as Apollodorus. In other words, it is a fantastically useful resource for readers of English literature as well as classical. The affordability of the volume (and the portability of it) has made it an absolutely essential first-buy for anyone serious about reading. Even when working in the most precise and demanding forms of editing and annotation of literature, Zimmerman's book is still the first-grab, first-glance entry point to further research."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Classical Mythology","review":"This book has one thing most (as far as I can tell) classical mythology references don't have: PRONUNCIATION for every entry.

This is very good. The entries are clear and concise. The names have pronunciation guides and where they are mentioned. It also has entries over the authors who wrote the works. The entries also have cross-references to other entries in the book. The font of the book is clear and there is enough white space to where the words do not seem cluttered. While this may seem not that important, when you are having to look up a character very fast so you can respond to a question, you will be thankful. I have only one problem with this book. Some of the entries on the groups of characters, such as the muses, only reference you to the names of the characters, not what they did together as a group. Even with this, this book is something you can buy and not worry about making a wrong buy."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Classical Mythology","review":"Whenever I want to know about anyone from Greek or Roman mythology, this is the first book I grab.

Although she always covered the figures and places fairly well, obviously it becomes simpler when you have a dictionary beside you as an extra source (and at times the one and only) pointing us all in the right direction. If Greek and Roman mythology have ever stumped you beyond what you thought was repair, I promise that this book has the potential to clear that obscurity up. And look at the used price, you can actually AFFORD it, too! YAY! So if you want to better understand Hamilton, or even Joe Campbell, purchase this buddy. It's well worth the investment! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Classical Mythology","review":"\\"Dictionary of Classical Mythology\\" by J. E. Zimmerman is affordable, portable, and has broad application into understanding ancient customs, beliefs, value systems, and how they impact contemporary academics, astronomy, science, art, literature, religion, and how ancient mythology is alluded to in editorials, lectures, advertisements, and Science-Fiction / Fantasy themes for TV & theater. This book not only references the Greek mythology, but also Roman; explaining that who the Greeks called Zeus, the Romans knew as Jupiter; who the Greeks knew as Aphrodite, the Romans called her Venus; and so on. \\"The Iliad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer, are much more enjoyable if you can connect the mythology influence as part of your understanding. A tour of any museum of antiquities is going to be a better experience if you have this book with you for reference.\\"Dictionary of Classical Mythology\\" by J. E. Zimmerman gives a foundational background of the early ancient Gods & Goddesses; breaking it down into modern terms, and suggesting potential contemporary influences. There are just under 2,100 entries that are given pronunciation and definition. Although abridged, one handy feature kept consistent throughout is when one is mentioned that belongs in a group, the others are mentioned (such as the nine muses); as well as other cross-reference within this book. Usage key, suggestions for further reading, mythological entries, historical entries, biographical entries, variant names and spelling, and other features make this book the one to have; not just the affordability or portability.An example:Vulcan (vul' can) The Roman name for the god of fire and metalworking. He established a great forge in the heart of Mount Aetna, in partnership with the great Cyclopes. See Hephaestus.(Hephaestus is listed in this same book and takes half a page when you cross-reference to that other page by the alternate name; which cross references ad infinitum with related people, places, or things.)Along with the nearly 2 dozen books listed in the back of this book, seriously interested research into ancient mythology can also take advantage of how Amazon dot com offers DVD documentaries such as by A&E; \\"Ancient Mysteries - Myths & Legends\\" by John Swanson; The History Channel \\"Gods and Goddesses\\"; and In Search Of History \\"The Greek Gods (History Channel).\\" If you are looking for something geared more toward your preteen age children, consider \\"Oh My Gods!: A Look-it-Up Guide to the Gods of Mythology\\" an encyclopedia by Megan E. Bryant.This book is worth having, and I rate it at 4 stars only because IMHO it cannot rise above encyclopedia merit, and although it has 300 pages of material, there are no illustrations of any kind which by default means nearly all who might purchase this book will want a book that DOES have illustrations and this book then becomes a secondary companion to the other. The paradox of that becomes profound because had the author of this book included illustrations (as mythology students prefer), it wouldn't have stayed as affordable or as portable. For what it is, as it is, I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Classical Mythology","review":"Bought as a gift for a student and really appreciated.

He is cared for by his Nanny, Teddy Stein, the educated daughter of their former friend and physician. When the Nazis begin their reign of terror in Berlin, rounding up and murdering the Jewish population, Sigmund sends Ursula, Teddy and Maxim to Paris to escape, intending to join them shortly. When he is prevented from doing so,Ursula leaves Maxim in the care of Teddy with instructions to take him to safety in England while she returns to be with her husband.The Wests had tansferred large amounts of money to their English bank so that Teddy is able to have the little boy educated properly and so that they want for nothing.After the war, they learn of the tragic deaths of the Wests in concentration camps, so Teddy continues to be Maxims' guardian until he comes of age. After finishing his education, Maxim proves to be a brilliant businessman and forges a vast empire which makes him a multi billionaire but also starts him on a rocky track with women, marrying three times and with many mistresses and love affairs. The story climaxes with the collpse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and, apart from one very short section, is a tale of wealth, glamour, beautiful people with beautiful clothes and houses. In short, it's a book to read when you want to feel surrounded by luxury and opulence....not a poor person in sight! I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Women In His Life","review":"This book couldn't hold my interest. I didn't like the way the author went back in time and bounced around. It got good towards the end.

More of a fictional history of Mr. West than a study of the main women in his life, it's still a fairly consistently entertaining novel, worth the effort to read.However, for me at least, for a book about a business tycoon it was awfully thin on the business side, the wheeling and dealing, hostile takeovers, buyouts, tender offers, boardroom antics, politicians bribed and competitors beaten, and awfully thick on who was wearing what type of designer dress and what style someone's 5th Avenue apartment was decorated in.

Much of her more popular stuff, particularly Poirot and Marple, was dashed off to keep things on the boil and many of them are, in my view, not worth reading. The Parker Pyne stories are different, but I will never understand why he is referred to as a detective. This gentleman is a former British Civil Servant who sets up an agency - an agency to help people with their problems - real or imaginary. So, I guess he's a bit like an agony aunt, but his solutions are real! For example, he fixes it for people very bored with their lives to have some excitement - using actors - but it seems real to the individual. He sorts out errant husbands - and wives, he even finds a way to make a miserable wealthy woman happy, living in relative poverty. Parker Pyne has a novel approach to fees, he charges what people can afford to pay. This is usually done by getting the client to unwittingly perform some service for a paying customer. In some cases this leads to the client getting paid! All in all, these are little morality plays, handled with great humour, skill, and compassion. They may be a bit innocent for modern tastes but I have read them many times and still enjoy them. Sex and violence are not essential to a good read. There are 14 stories in all, so find an edition that has them all if you can."},{"Title":"Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective","review":"Agatha - always a favorite.

I haven't read the original German version of this book, but the English version is so captivating that I can't imagine much was lost in the change of language.If you want to learn more, not only about the scientists who developed the bomb, but the issues surrounding its use and further development you can't to better than this book. It is exceptionally well written, and superbly translated. It's fabulous to have a record so well researched written by someone in a position that is far more objective than an American's would have been at that time.The book starts you off after World War I in G&ouml;ttingen, the mecca for scientific thought at the time. The early chapters lay an excellent foundation for the readers understanding of the issues surrounding the development of the atomic bomb.The account of the research at Los Alamos is very well covered, and Jungk avoids going to deeply into the technical aspects of the research. This makes it accessible to anyone, regardless of their depth of scientific knowledge. (I also recommend Richard Feynman's &quot;Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman&quot; for an anecdotal, and more whimsical account of the Los Alamos research.)The most fascinating part of the book for me was the discussion of the events leading up to the use of the atomic bomb in Japan. I have used this book many times as a source for arguing that the atomic assault on Japan was not necessary. The unique thing that &quot;...Suns&quot; provides is the perspective of the scientist's involved. Instead of only discussing the political aspect, and occasionally mentioning Oppenheimer or Teller, as other texts about the bomb tend to do, Jungk gives the reader clear view of the scientist's perspective on military deployment of an atomic weapon. (The Franck Report is appended.)Finally, the beginning of the arms race is explored, up through Russia's and the United States' development of hydrogen bombs. No doubt this section would have been more complete had the book been written later. However, I found that reading the book now, with the knowledge of the extent of the cold war and the arms race makes reading the perspective of someone who was witnessing the beginnings of it even more interesting.One usually does not think of history as something that enthralls so deeply as this book does. It is perhaps the most engaging book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"(Although I said men I wanted to say men/women). This book shows the lives of the people involved in the development of the Atomic Bomb. The shoulders upon which other scientist climbed to get the atom knowledge, the relationship among them and the work done by each of them.

The author has taken pains to get to the &quot;facts&quot;, which are difficult to get at wartime, and has also tried to present them as facts, taking extra care to remove his personal opinions/comments. Even though most of the book is presentation of the stark, cold facts, it does bring about the realization that no matter how advanced we get technologically, lack of trust (on people) can quickly destroy all that we have achieved. Even the sharpest scientists, and the most perspicacious philosophers are not immune to this curse.I would not hesitate at all to recommend this book to anyone with the slightest inclination to read about the second world war, the manhattan project or Hiroshima and Nagasaki."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"Robert Jungk went to a lot of trouble to interview as many people as possible who'd worked on the A-bomb, and produced this well written history of the Manhatten Project. It's a bit dated, but if I had to recommend three books on this subject, this would be one of them (the others would be Richard Rhode's THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB and Lillian Hoddeson's CRITICAL ASSEMBLY). There's interesting information in here I haven't read anywhere else, and I've read over a dozen books on the Manhatten Project."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"This book was written nearly 50 years ago in the 1950's, so naturally some of the stories are incomplete with todays hindsight, but I wish I'd read this book 20 years ago. It is extremely well written, and full of fascinating anecdotes. Although I am familiar with many of the characters &amp; stories, there was something new for me in every chapter, for example the insights into Oppenheimer in Germany before WWII. It would be wonderful if a revised version could be published incorporating the story of the Soviet Atom Scientists."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"While an easy to read book, Jungk presents some false information that depreciates the value of the book.The first is the impression that Von Weisacker and other German scientists attempted to give to the post war world, that they were not really trying to build a bomb, but were merely interested in nuclear power. This is refuted by Jeremy Bernstein, in his book \\"Hitler's Uranium Club.\\" The historical record shows that there were many memorandums sent to the German Military, by the scientists, about the possibility of producing an atomic bomb.The more serious misstatement however, is about Klaus Fuchs' espionage on the Manhattan Project which was the most damaging espionage committed by any of the atomic spies of that era. Jungk claims that Fuchs decided to spy for the Soviet Union when he learned about plans to bomb Hiroshima. This is so off base that one has to question Jungk's scholarship or motives. Here is why: Fuchs began spying for the Soviets in 1941 in Britain, before Pearl Harbor and before there was even a Manhattan Project. The decision to acutally bomb Hiroshima was made in 1945. None of the scientists know what the targets were.This is such a huge distortion of the facts that it should be mentioned in any review of this book. The book has lots of details but if you buy it, beware of some of the downright distortions of history. A better choice is Richard Rhodes's book, \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\"."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"An extraordinary book. The story of the University in a small town of Goettingen, and the amazing characters who gravitate there to learn physics. This part on its own, prior to the Manhatten project is an exciting reading. Both the atmosphere of the German University and the characters of the students, inluding the &quot;fathers&quot; of nuclear and thermonuclear bombs, Oppenheimer and Teller, are very well described and vivid. Easy and interesting description of the foundations of physics behind the nuclear weapons. Actually that was my favorite part. The story of the Manhatten project is done very well. The book was powerful enough to affect me to become a physisist - 35 years ago. I am happy to see that it is still in print. Good reading for any age, but especially highly recommended for those who are chosing a profession and are too bright to go to a Medical School."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"Recently, in theatres in London and New York, the public was treated to the drama \\"Copenhagen,\\" by British playwright Michael Frayn, and it revisited the theme of this now old book. The play was about a visit in September 1941 by the then young German physicist Werner Heisenberg to his mentor and dear friend Niels Bohr in Nazi-occupied Denmark. So a detail in a bigger picture, but still a key detail!The wider subject of Robert Jungk's book is a biographical sketch of the pioneers in nuclear physics, the individual scientist who built the atomic bomb (the time before Hiroshima and Nagasaki), or whose theories were instrumental. The debate about the history, the science, and its implications of the nuclear bomb started after World War II, and it is important to remember that nuclear scientists worked on both sides of this conflicts. Now with hindsight, the Cold War, and nuclear proliferation have taken centre stage, but back in 1956 when Robert Jungk's book first appeared, World War II was still casting a big shadow on events and on the debate about nuclear deterrence. In my opinion Robert Jungk's book was one of the first serious attempts at a general account on what was clearly a watershed in history, a series of events that are shaping our lives even today. Since 1956, Robert Jungk's book was reprinted many times, and many more related books appeared.Jungk's book is interesting in that it paints a vivid portrait of such scientists as Robert Oppenheimer, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and other leading physicists at the time, and on both sides of that conflict.What is interesting now is to view Robert Jungk's book in the light of Michael Frayn's play, and especially in light of newly released papers on the Niels Bohr archives in 2002, following the wide attention given to Michael Frayn's version of the 1941 meeting in Copenhagen. The 2002 addition to Niels Bohr's archives is a deposit comprising documents either dictated or written by Niels Bohr referring to what was said at the fateful 1941 meeting.Michael Frayn's play makes it clear that the two Bohr and Heisenberg were very close both scientifically and personally, and that the 1941 meeting changed all of that. Both men were devastated!Heisenberg was a leading scientific advisor to the German government in post WWII Europe; and yet he spent the rest of his life attempting to put his spin on his war work; his work on a nuclear bomb for Hitler, or perhaps rather denying these efforts. Niels Bohr who died in 1962 had been extraordinarily tight lipped about his meeting with Heisenberg in 1941. So while the newly released letters supplement and confirm previously published statements of Bohr's recollections of the meeting, especially those of his son, Aage Bohr, this part of the story is not well known, and especially not to Robert Jungk. The letters are from Niels Bohr to Heisenberg, and they are interesting for many reasons, not least of which is that they were never mailed, and so their contents were never known to Heisenbrg. Quoting from one of Bohr's letters to Heisenberg: \\"--- I think that I owe it to you to tell you that I am greatly amazed to see how much your memory has deceived you in your letter to the author [Robert Jungk] of the book [\\"Brighter than a thousand suns\\"],---.\\" Review by Palle Jorgensen, July 2006."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"Robert Jungk&#8217;s Brighter than a Thousand Suns encompasses one of the most recent subjects in Physics, Atomic Energy. He begins by describing the Environment the most prominent physicists were educated in, Gottingen University in Germany, although an insight into the lives of these emerging physicists was well depicted, I felt that it was little too much background information and not enough explanations of the developments these budding physicists generated. The pattern of excessive background information seems to continue throughout the book, but there is much valuable information to be had throughout the book. The book covers everything from the plethora of atomic physicists sprouting after the First World War to the Manhattan Project and J. Robert Oppenheimer&#8217;s trial that removed him from his lofty position at the head of America&#8217;s Atomic Energy Commission.

Lot's of fresh material and interesting insights."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"It was shear chance that I came across this book in the library. I have read it twice already and I think I will buy it. Definitely a collectors item for those who are even half as interested as I am in the facts about the bomb and the world war."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"Originally published in German in 1956. Some English universities recommended this in the 1960s as general reading. First English translation 1958. It covers events up to the claimed Soviet nuclear H bomb, and the 'Lucky Dragon' incident of supposed irradiated Japanese fishermen. Jungk was apparently a Berlin Jew, born 1913, who studied European classics and got a PhD in 'modern European history' - presumably on Europe since the French Revolution.I reread this to try to disentangle mythology from truth. Jungk, as might be guessed, says virtually nothing about the science or technology - or mistakes. There is (for example) no account of separation of U235; no account of why 'heavy water' might be important, or how it's isolated; no account even of where uranium was mined. Jungk says in effect that radioactive poison can now be made more or less indefinitely - but this seems not true since the supply of neutrons seemed/seems fixed by the amount of uranium mined. Jungk made little attempt to check anything, though there are a few letters to him from physicists.Jungk's main attitude is rather awestruck reverence in quotation - for example, a Japanese physicist is quoted as saying only an atomic bomb could do this. (Wrong, in fact). All his judgments of the competence of physicists are second-hand. This approach tends not to work: for example, Jungk says hugely detailed calculations were needed. (He doesn't say what they were and in fact one has to wonder whether it's true - but I suppose if computers then resembled pocket calculators, well, they would be of some use). But if the need for elaborate calculations is true, how come the measured blast from explosions was supposed to be far greater than estimated?Unfortunately Jungk is also uncritical as regards the political material: as an example there's a whole section on Oppenheimer's fall, but although the type of building, sofa, characters of the interviewee/interrogators, weather, tone of voice, taste in poetry, etc etc are detailed, it's not made clear what he was charged with - let alone of course how serious the charges were. He accepts all World War 2 mythology - on for example Pearl Harbor. He does not take the cost of the operation very seriously.Sometimes he gets things right - his account of Groves is convincing, for example. So is his belief that the US Navy wanted to get in on the act - hence Bikini. His accounts of security and control of information sound right. The preponderance of 'foreigners' was acknowledged at the time - this may be a codeword for Jews, though Jungk barely mentions this.An appendix is the 'Franck Report' to I think Stimson. This is full of comment on dangers of nuclear weapons, proliferation, treaties, control, and so on. Astonishingly, this was dated a few months before the first test, at night, in a remote country area, ten miles from observers, with full military secrecy! They had a lot to lose if their huge funding was found not to work.**There is a very good account of Goettingen [should be o umlaut] University in its great days, mostly of course taken from other sources. Read it and weep over modern times."},{"Title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns","review":"I read this book in the 1960s but misplaced my copy.

Its title heroine grows up spoiled and adored by her shopowning mother and mother's sister; indifferent to their ideas for her future (or indeed to just about anything else), Angel discovers her gift for fantastic fictions translates beautifully into the publishing world, where she becomes a bestselling author of contempibly popular potboilers. Angel accordingly re-invents herself as a glamorous author figure of the Elinor Glyn school, and we follow her through her successes, marriage, eventual popular neglect, and poverty.ANGEL is a cult favorite among many British novelists, including Hilary Mantel, but is only really transcendent when it allows Angel to strive (at the beginning and the end of her career) against difficult odds. The scene, for example, where she tells off her aunt for planning to make her a ladies' maid is enormously funny and satisfying. But when Angel is rich and successful Taylor seems too invested in scoring points of of her heroine, as if she, too, feared what Angel might do if not kept in her place."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"I loved this book when I read it a number of years ago It was my favorite of all of Elizabeth Taylor's novels. A film adaptation in English by french director, Francois Ozon (\\"8 Femmes\\")is coming out, but you must read the book first. I plan to read it again before I see the film."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"What a splendid book. This is a compelling and moving portrait of a narcissist written decades before that diagnosis became a glib characterization in lesser books. That Taylor is able to make the story of such a shallow, self-deluded, selfish brute of a person so absorbing and compelling is a triumph of the writer's art and craft."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"This is a delicious book. Elizabeth Taylor has created an unforgettable character in Angelica, the unlikely best-selling author with a hilarious lack of self-awareness. It's a quick read -- Ms. Taylor writes like an Angel. You will laugh out loud reading this novel."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"I like this book because the protagonist is not really a very likeable person. But I certainly have a sympathy for her at the same time. She's an individualist and odd. Great!"},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"Those who have loved author Elizabeth Taylor's Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (1971) will also be fascinated by Angel (1957). Less subtle in its black humor and obvious satire, Angel will strike chords among all writers and lovers of writing who have ever fantasized about producing a blockbuster novel, or even a moderately successful one. Taylor (1912 - 1975) lived her own life in relative obscurity, admired and praised by a small group of literati, including Barbara Pym, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Robert Liddell, but she is now being republished by New York Review Books, and contemporary lovers of clever writing will celebrate this darkly humorous vision of what it takes to be a successful author of popular novels and her wry insights into why popular fame often fades.In 1900, Angel Deverell, fifteen, lives with her mother above the family grocery store in Norley. Emotionally, however, she lives on a completely different plane, imagining a life in which she is elegant, successful, admired by all, and, of course, wealthy beyond her most fervent dreams. Her mother and her aunt have made enormous sacrifices so that she can attend a private school and get the kind of education which might allow her to live a different sort of life from theirs, but Angel decides she has had enough and leaves to finish writing a romantic novel, The Lady Urania, on which she works almost around the clock. When she finds a publisher, he wants Angel to make some small changes to make the book more salable (such as giving the Duchess of Devonshire a fictional name), but Angel risks all and says \\"No.\\" Eventually, the publisher accedes to her demands, and the book is a huge popular success.Writing a bestseller a year for the next five or six years, Angel becomes wealthy enough by the age of twenty to move from the grocery store to The Birches at Alderhurst. Eventually, she meets Nora, the poetry-writing niece of Lord Norley, who becomes her companion, and her brother Esme, a handsome rotter who gambles, toys with the affections of young women, and lives only for himself, the male equivalent of Angel herself. As Angel's story continues with its ups and downs for forty more years, her personal life and her literary life experience dramatic changes. Always front and center in her focus - after herself, of course - is Paradise House, where her aunt once worked, the symbol of the aristocratic lifestyle Angel has sought from the beginning of her life.Written in the middle of Taylor's career, Angel sometimes feels like the kind of romantic melodrama that Angel herself writes, and lovers of serious literary fiction may be surprised by that style, at least at the beginning. Taylor is clearly mimicking Angel's own style, however, to give added irony and satire to her depiction of this completely egocentric character, who wants only one thing, her own happiness. Such a focus can become tiring, since it allows for very little character development, and Angel remains one-sided and shallow, unconcerned with the everyday niceties that make social life successful. As her fortunes change over more than forty years, Angel remains resolute, and it is in her resolve that she becomes more than just a satiric main character and becomes almost admirable. Similar to Barbara Pym, Penelope Lively, Alice Thomas Ellis, and Jane Gardam, Elizabeth Taylor may finally be getting the literary attention she deserves."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"I don't disagree with the earlier reviewer, but I think things are a bit more complex. After all, we have a woman novelist writing a novel about a woman novelist. While Angel is certainly a narcissist as mentioned, she is also a woman refusing to be bound by the unwritten rules of the English class system. She is also a person who lives almost entirely in her imagination and this raises the interesting question: how much imagination is too much? She picks as a husband a rather effete artist and they hardly have any life together so there are important questions raised about her gender identification. Her gothic and fanciful romances are hugely successful with the reading public, so she must have some talent, although where it comes from is never entirely clear. This combination of popular success with critical contempt brings to mind some other novelists of the post-WW II period in which Taylor wrote. How much of herself, these other writers and her own imagination went into Angel is worth thinking about.But the important thing is that this is a superbly crafted story which profits from Taylor's distrust of conventional narrative. Like so many of her novels, this is really \\"Scenes from Angel's Life\\", and this in a book about a very conventional writer bears some thought."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"Angel is delusional, narcissistic, proud; she makes her own reality, in comparison with which the true reality is rather disappointing. If Angel Deverell existed I'm sure I'd love her writing--ironically, of course. She's described as a popular novelist of little talent, her books filled with inaccuracies and melodrama, certainly never one to be accused of creating Great Art. Try telling that to her, though; she thinks herself peerless, important, believes the world knows her books by heart and can hardly stand the wait for a new one to appear in print.Early in the story, a doctor, seeing Angel's handwriting, renders the verdict \\"lack of character\\". Yes, delightfully, appalingly so. It's one hilarious thing after another, showing just how self-centred and bereft of compassion and understanding she is. The zings just keep coming, reminding me of nothing so much as my Bible, June Flaum Singer's The Debutantes, aka the Worst Book Ever Written. Both manage to consistently supply high quality humour, nearly every sentence a joke, with no signs of slowing down. It's awe-inspiring.Taylor's amazing accomplishment is that she makes Angel both a figure of fun-- and what fun!-- but also someone to feel sad for. Angel lives too much in a fantasy world to see herself for what she is; the reader can see, though, and from what they see can say it's for the best that the dreamer never wakes up."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"I'm sad I had not even heard of Elizabeth Taylor, the novelist, until last year, but then again, maybe that's great, because now I have much to look forward to in the months ahead as I make my way through her fiction. I started with _Angel_ and found that I could not put it down. The novel raises so many fascinating questions of identity and class, as well as the meaning of art. This is the type of novel that I would enjoy teaching in a literature class because it's not too long, and yet it is packed with significance on many levels that would engage students.Taylor's prose style is spare and effective; she does not waste words. Angel, the main character, does. She seems real, although I have yet to meet (thankfully) anyone as cold, calculating and selfish as she happens to be. The character who most understands Angel and makes her real, even sympathetic, to the reader is her publisher, Theo. His point of view becomes invaluable in the later pages of the novel when Angel and her companion (her sister-in-law, Nora)live out the Second World War in a house right out of Faulkner's Southern Gothic genre, but transported to England.Is Angel a victim of her own self-willed ignorance? The question stays with me and gives me something to think about."},{"Title":"Angel: Unabridged","review":"Elizabeth Taylor's Angel is a good read, as other reviewers have noted, hence my 4 stars, but Kindle users should know that the current digital version has not had the OCR errors corrected, and this detracts from the reading experience. To Hachette Digital: It's one thing to deal with typos if you've downloaded some public domain novel off a free site, quite another when you've paid the publisher $9.99 on Amazon for the right to read it.

It's roughly the same dimensions as a coloring book, and the information inside is just as basic. That being said, it is perfect for a young person interested in the subject.However, I must point out that at least one piece of info (and I believe several others) are inaccurate. The small section on Author Whitley Strieber says that he believes the aliens took over his mind. This is an outright lie. He has never stated anything of the sort. Several other stories seem to have inaccurate information as well, but at this point I haven't looked further into it.Other than that, the book has a few stories that even a seasoned UFO enthusiast may not have read before.

More importantly, this book provides a roadmap supported by rules and principles that will help an organization move closer towards their ideal state. I appreciate how the authors applied theory to actual case studies drawn from their years of personal experience. The lessons provided are broken down so they are easy to read and understand. This book is required reading for all of our leaders in my organizaiton!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"Like many reviewers, I too have read many books on Lean, and have been unsuccessful at developing sustainable change in many organizations. The \\"tool focused\\" books are seductively inviting as they promise phenominal results with fairly easy steps. Like fad diets, the weight eventually comes back.I wish I had this book when I first started my Lean journey. Flinchbaugh and Carlino do a great job at defining the principles of lean, which is its true foundation. They go on to describe the process for transforming your organization through lean inclucation. They give you warning of the many common pitfalls along the way. And they demonstrate the ability to, and benefits from leveraging lean throughout the organization - not just in manufacturing.This book is a must for any organization attempting to be successful in their lean journey."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"As a lean leader in my organization and a Six Sigma Black Belt, here are my impressions:Oh No, Not Another Book About Lean!Admittedly this was my first thought. But I've long admired Mr. Flinchbaugh's blog and his seemingly honest, straightforward, and technically sound approach to lean; so I figured I'd give it a try. The first section is a basic lean overview, but it does offer an interesting distillation of lean into a few basic principles. Even several years into a lean journey of my own, I found it to be a good perspective on the journey and its key guideposts. I found it especially helpful to be reminded of the importance of \\"high agreement\\".Advice for Lean LeadersThe book also touches on one of the most important topics of lean transformation, leadership. Although I do not have nearly the depth or breath of experience in leading lean that Mr. Flinchbaugh has, my experiences align almost perfectly with the book's principles. I think this is a great synopsis of effective leadership, and I think that everyone in a lean leadership position should hear this message.Charting Your CourseI've personally seen the enormous galvanizing power of both a roadmap and, as the book puts it, an operating system. These are crucial tools in getting going effectively, and I think chapters 4 and 5 do a good job of not letting us forget that.Number CrunchingChapter 6 reminds us that cost accounting can be a real impediment to lean transformation. I like that the subject is broached and that we can have the conversation. And I hope we see more progress in the area of lean accounting in the near future.Material MovementI like that this chapter doesn't focus solely on kanban; but rather it talks about more fundamental keys to making material flow, like eliminating waste and making things visible. I was pleasantly surprised by this approach and learned a lot.You Want Fries With That?I was especially interested in the chapter on service, since I've been spending more and more time trying to improve transactional processes. This was the first time I've seen a clear and concise breakdown of the elements necessary to effectively manage a lean transformation in a non-manufacturing environment. I found it very helpful.Look in the MirrorI get laughed at all the time for trying to find innovative ways to use lean in my personal life. So the chapter on \\"Personal Lean\\" hit very close to my heart. There's great stuff in there, including some very helpful tools. I like that someone else recognizes the tremendous value in walking the walk. I think this goes hand-in-hand with good leadership.Case StudiesI always enjoy these, and there are some great ones at the end of the book.SummaryI think Mr. Flinchbaugh has written a solid and comprehensive book on lean, and I would recommend it to anyone who is contemplating or who has set out on a lean journey of their own. No one can truly show the way, but in the pages of this book you'll find the knowledge necessary to plot your own course."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"This is a short book, 190pp., that's pretty practical and points out the Best Practices & Lessons Learned in a major Lean Transformation.

The book does a fantastic job to give you an intro into lean and focuses on lean as a cultural change and not a set of tools. From my own experience as the CEO of [...] I can tell you that if a company doesn't realize lean is a cultural change they will fail with their lean implantation.Besides the content being great I also loved the analogies used to describe concepts and ideas. It really helps with learning the concepts if you are new and if you aren't (like myself) you can use the analogies to help others understand lean better.I gave this book along with 5 other lean books to my sales staff to read and they said that this book was hands down the best one of the bunch.I like the main message that lean is a journey and there's not just 1 way to get to your destination. If you are new to lean this is the book you should start reading. If you are in the midst of your lean journey this is an excellent supplemental source of information that may give you new perspective."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I consider myself to be very knowledgeable in lean already, actively consulting in it in the software industry. I read this book mostly because it was recommended and I liked the thoughts I'd been hearing from Jaimie on twitter (@flinchbaugh). I found it to be interesting to read and have lots of nuggets of insight. However, the reason I recommend it, is that it has the, hard to say this accurately, \\"being-ness\\" of being lean. By this, I mean that it captures the true essence of what lean is. Lean is not a set of tools (although it has tools), it is not just a set of perspectives or thought processes, although it has them. It is more about an approach to life and work. But it is not even just that attitude. It is about how one collectively takes one's knowledge and viewpoints and rolls them all together to be effective.Yes, I know I'm talking a little zenish here. :) But lean is like that (or should be when understood). But this isn't just a 'zen of lean' which might leave one looking for more tangible information. It includes this quality while giving tangible information. This is what makes this a great book. For example, the 7 wastes - a couple of quotes. \\"when talking about problems or opportunities, do you apply the lens of waste every time?\\" and \\"The seven wastes are not to be used as an academic exercise to see how organizations can categorize things. They comprise a specific lens companies should use every day.\\" Now I've known the 7 wastes for years. And I've found them to be useful. And I've even done what Jaimie suggests. But I've never used the metaphor lens before, although it is spot on. He talks about using them as a lens to see our process. It's not just about eliminating the waste, it's about improving the process by eliminating the waste. Doh! I knew that, done that. But the metaphor is powerful and takes it a step further.This is just one of many examples that illustrate how the authors speak from knowledge, understanding, experience and an ability to explain and transition people. I admit to having many books on my must read books on lean. This is both a good introductory book on lean, but perhaps has a special place for those who already understand the sense of it, but can't quite get what all the excitement is about.

Hithchiker's Guide is an excellent primer on approaching Lean Transformation. It is important that you come to this book with a mindset of changing how you and your organization do your work (i.e., changing your culture). If you are looking for pixie dust to sprinkle on your company to make the bottom line better overnight, then don't buy this book. If, however, you are looking for a path to dramatically change results, then this book is better than nearly any other for people exploring what it would take to be Lean. We have taught approximately 600 people in our organization a week-long class based on this material and LLC's course. The purpose is to educate them on the rules and principles of Lean because our goal is to truly become a Lean organization. We went this path after dabbling with tools (e.g., kaizens) until we realized that there was much more to Lean than just events. Toyota, GE, Dell, and others achieved excellence through disciplined application of systems thinking over a period measured in years and Lean is the philosophical framework that helps us follow in their paths. If this is the direction you aspire to then read this book and share it with others in an effort to drive a consensus on truly pursuing Lean. Two points of dispute with the book: organizing everything in lists of five was too cute for its own good; and second that Andy and Jamie fall prey to the deification of leadership at the expense of management. For the Lean initiate, this is an appropriate discussion but Lean is truly about the power of small things and hence execution. It is a function of constantly eliminating waste towards the ideal state of meeting the needs of the customer. To truly be Lean requires both leadership and management and the book fails to effectively underscore this point."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"Jamie and Andy do an exceptional job of laying out the management system of the Lean business model. You won't find \\"how to use an A3\\" or \\"how to do a 5S initiative\\" here. Rather, you'll find \\"how to bring about a Lean transformation\\", how to effectively design and lead initiatives, and how to tackle areas beyond the manufacturing floor. I should have read this book the day it came out.Having the luxury of mentors who retired from varying levels of management in the Toyota system, I can't say that I found anything I even remotely disagree with in this book. It was as though Jamie was right there with me in the initial steps of my journey. I'd have every member of management, regardless of the size of your business, read this book.Excellent reference piece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"This book is a staple on my kindle. I have read it 3 times end every time I read it, I pick up a new nugget of information that I can apply to my site's lean transformation. This is not a how-to book of tools; most books like that do not help your team grow culturally. This book will literally modify your thought-processes to that of a waste-busting machine! I cannot succinctly explain everything that this book has done for me.... Get it and find out for yourself!!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I have read so many books upon the lean process over the last few years that seem to focus on the tools of the trade and not the process itself.

In my opinion and based on what I take from this book, leadership is probably the most important aspect of the implementation. Without it you will fail!\\"It is ideal to have senior leadership actively engaged in the lean journey, not just sitting in a seat, but also driving the vehicle. Unfortunately, senior leadership typically delegates the responsibility of guiding the lean journey to others of lessor authority.\\" This sets up a fall guy rather than forcing leadership to look in the mirror to determine why they are not getting what they expected from lean. Challenge your leasdership to join the journey!The book asks questions like; \\"Is leadership actively engaged?\\". This is such a good question but the answer may not be what you want to hear. Being engaged does not mean attending meetings!!\\"Leaders can not lead if they can not teach.\\" Wow...this is great...and to teach you must know the subject and to know it you must live it. If leaders are not hands on engaged they can't possibly \\"know\\" how to drive lean.I could go on and on about the great material in this book but suffice to say...READ IT!! You will absolutely get more than your money's worth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The Lean Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean is one of very few books on lean enterprise on the market today that really, really \\"gets it\\". Authors Flinchbaugh and Carlino focus on the essential truth of lean enterprise, which is organizational learning. This is why your CEO, and not the \\"lean department,\\" should be leading your lean transformation. Throughout the book, the authors make the point that lean is not just about manufacturing, it is way of managing continuous, evolutionary change in all conceivable dimensions: manufacturing, materials management, accounting, service--even personal life!At core of the book is Flinchbaugh's and Carlino's important concept of a lean business operating system, which--much more than Just-In-Time production--makes lean tick. Why don't more lean gurus write about this?In addition to getting it all right, the authors have wrapped their message in a highly readable, practical package.Don't leave home on your lean journey without the Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"There are many books on lean transformation that detail the tools and methods, with the better ones discussing the importance of culture and implementation. This book goes a step further by talking about the lessons learned from over 30 years of experience with real companies on the lean journey. The tips and ideas will reinvigorate your lean efforts and help you avoid potential pitfalls."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The really nice thing about this book is that it is incredibly \\"user friendly\\" and organized in such a way as to almost anticipate the questions you might be asking if considering a LEAN approach in your organization. I found my yellow highlighter flying across the pages and my head nodding, \\"yep, yep, yep,\\" as I read. The authors emphasis on learning to see, leadership, and the so-called soft skills for implementing LEAN (or any change) really help set a tone and foundation for taking LEAN into your processes and work. This is the kind of book that will not gather dust on your shelf, that you will encourage others to buy, and that you will come back to over and over - each time discovering new \\"truths,\\" new nuances, new learnings. It is great to be able to listen to those with 30 years experience share their lessons learned and be able to \\"leap frog\\" SOME of the pain they experienced as I work to \\"evangelize\\" LEAN in my company. I am a big reader.

Very few books touch on this subject as directly as Flinchbaugh and Carlino do. They guide you down the path of understanding just what it takes to be leader who will succeed in transforming an organization to be a lean enterprise. The subject of lean leadership is a passing topic in a few books, but it is the topic of The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean.Leadership for transforming a business, regardless of its size or industry, has key elements to guide it down the path to developing a lean enterprise. Only by improving your own individual leadership ability can you help others to raise their own contribution to a higher level, and in turn, guide your organization to a higher level of existence. Leadership is a conscience effort that must be learned and applied to understand, The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean gives you a proven roadmap to get there."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I have to disgree with the first reviewer, I think that this book does provide a unique perspective on lean thinking and lean manufacturing. It does a good job of filling in the blanks left by other lean books. With a number of unique topics, it seems that the authors' intent was that this book is for those who have already read some of the standard introductory lean books and have already started down their own lean journeys. This book will be most helpful to those who have already struggled with lean and are looking for additional tips and ideas to get their lean journey back on track.Chapters and topics include:1) principles of lean2) leadership moves for lean3) common lean pitfalls and how to avoid them4) phases of a corporate lean transformation (a topic not usually covered)5) structure of a corporate lean \\"operating system\\" (again, a rarely covered topic)6) lean accounting (a very new topic)7) lean material management8) lean applied to service industries9) lean applied to your career10) interviews from real lean practictionersSome, if not all, of those topics should peak your interest as a lean practictioner or student. The other reviewer must have missed the entire chapter on lean applied to service industries, such as healthcare.The writing style is quick and conversational, as if the writers are talking directly to you. There are many relevant real-world examples given to back up their lean concepts and philosophies."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I'm an Engineer, private consultant, and six sigma black belt who has been leading Lean and six sigma initiatives since 1991. I've read numerous books on both subjects. My experience has been that all of them claim to have a new, \\"unique\\" perspective to share. But most are a re-packaging of the same ideas and are almost always written by authors who have spent their careers working for very large companies mostly in the automotive industry or other very large assembly type industries such as appliances. This book and it's authors fit that model and so they tend to have a relatively narrow perspective.They ignore many important questions such as:Should the approach be different in a small company?In a process industry?In a job shop?In a service industry?What, precisely, are the differences, if any, between Lean and Six Sigma? How do I know when to use what?The authors state correctly that the tools of lean are not enough and that culture change is the bigger, more difficult issue to be dealt with. But they come dangerously close to advocating a return back to the bad old days of faith based, activity based initiatves like TQM. The reason lean has been so successful is that there is a toolbox that can be taught and used quickly with measureable results. This alone does not ensure culture change and the sustainable results that come with it. But until you can demonstrate measureable improvements and thus show that the ideas work, no culture change will happen.They needed to more clearly articulate this symbiotic relationship between tools, results, and culture change.I thought the chapter on lean accounting was the best part. Until the accountants move out of their \\"policeman\\" role and become part of the solution instead of just score keepers, long term success is doubtful.Overall I give it a \\"C\\", thus the 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"This excellent, easy reading book is for every organization that has been on their lean journey, where results have leveled off and the enthusiasm of the people responsible for the transformation has faded, and are asking themselves, \\"Now what?\\"; which can happen even in Shingo prize winning companies.This is not just another \\"cook book\\" filled with the standard lean tools and templates. The authors assume that the reader already knows and understands, for example, what kanban and andon are. Furthermore, they challenge conventional thinking associated with traditional lean activities and implementation. Jamie and Andy provide fresh, thought provoking, and in many cases, breakthrough, insights as to why so few companies succeed at lean, why more do not realize their full potential, and why far too many fail.Lean has morphed in its definition and applications over the past decades and will continue to evolve, but I believe the wisdom imparted in this book is as applicable today as it will be well into the future. This is definitely one of those exceptional books that will not collect dust on your bookshelf after you are done reading it. Every re-read and future reference will reveal deeper knowledge and continued learning."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The authors have done an outstanding job in differentiating this work from the existing volumes on Lean Manufacturing.

There are plenty of books for that. Rather, this book gives some insight in how to make lean thinking last for the long haul - to make a real difference in the way you work and the way your organization works. It is about the principles and leadership required to make this successful. Many companies and organizations talk about being 'lean' and practicing 'lean'. Are they? This book gives some insight into what that means and how to create your own personal roadmap to change the way you and your org work and behave. It is very different from many other lean related books, which I found very refreshing. A short book packed with plenty of depth. And one of the most useful books I have found in my lean journey."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I am a lean practitioner and have been for many years. I have been responsible for launching lean implementations in companies and am familiar with many challenges such as leadership, cultural change, company commitment, etc. This book provides all the foundational things one must know prior to going into a lean initative.

By quickly focusing in on key principles, the book goes beyond describing lean tools and practices to suggesting from experience, how lean thinking should be taught.The book is full of questions that are an asset to anyone looking to improve how they reflect on the current and future state of their operation and lean transformation. The many questions posed are great thought starters that promote 'next level' implementation of lean in a variety of manufacturing and service settings.What I enjoy most about the book is the fresh look at lean implementation. Points made and examples given are not focused on what has brought success in the past as much as they relate to what new thinking is necessary to be successful tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I am recommending this book more and more to clients.

I was pleasantly surprised with the contents, and although I wouldn't call the material new and groundbreaking in general, it was clear that the content came from someone who has actually successfully been doing lean a long time (and by successfully, I mean that he has learned from his mistakes).As the OpEx leader for the site, I am now always seeking good texts to share and discuss as a team. We as a leadership team attempt to read relevant texts together on operational excellence, and this one will probably to the third of four identified so far (2 have been read, this one begins late October 2009 using this text with a 4th book identified for 1Q2010).Pro:+ I think that the authors have been doing lean and continuous improvement for a long time... little things tell me so+ Several interesting tips/tricks that I've been using a long time, but which I've not seen written/taught elsewhere+ A chapter on lean pitfalls (a great conversation starter for leaders in our upcoming book group)+ A chapter on lean accounting, albeit too short to be majorly useful (see cons section)+ I appreciated the last chapter that interviewed lean practitioners... creates a sense that even the successful stumble and have regrets+ Seemed to attempt to adopt and be in alignment with \\"principles, systems, tools\\" language from the Shingo prize (but often substituted \\"thinking\\" for \\"principles\\")Con:- Statements about unused creativity having no place in the 8 wastes is totally distressing! It is the premier waste that harbors all the others!- Less coverage of lean itself... more about pitfalls, tips, leadership requirements, etc.- Lean accounting chapter was too short and vague... for this topic look elsewhere- Encouraging others to read this book was a real chore - the title is a real turn off, even for the most open-minded people. Why oh why did you do this???- Not the most eloquently written book and was choppy at times. Some sentences appear like random fragments.- Chapter summaries were not as good as other texts, and would like bulletized lists of items to be at the front of the chapter so that you know where it is going (tip: read the summary first)- Why is every key topic broken into 5 sub-topics? Randomly one would think that some might actually be 6... or 4... or 7 even. I get the \\"more than 5 rule\\" but seriously, this a text. I think that we can handle more complexity - be true to the topic (we teach 17 principles of OE for example).Bottom line: Generally solid, recommended for your reading groups. See my guide on \\"creating a thinking organization\\" for more. Of 30-40 books on excellence, this fails in the top 5 or so... wonderful must-have!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"This book is written in a very easy to read format that people from almost any sector of business, manufacturing, or service can relate to. The practical guidance it offers in understanding lean is fantastic, especially for anyone/organization considering beginning a lean journey. A format/theory is offered, yet with caution to find one's own way, that makes complete sense. Lean isn't easy and the authors make it clear, but they provide ways of thinking through a lean journey that I think EVERY lean leader should consider. I wish Jamie and Andy would write even more books on lean. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I will agree with just all the other reviews listed. It is an excellent Lean book and very well written. It appeals to both a novice and a seasoned Lean practitioner, a testimonial to the authors.What I found interesting in the reading is the ease in which the authors discuss Lean; a quality that comes from someone that has lived it versus just writing and teaching it. I liked the fact that they took on the subject without all the jargon and references to Toyota. It made it a much easier read and more practical. In fact, so practical that you felt the authors had added insight about your company. Knowing that was not true, I realized that it was about the thoughts they had stimulated. This is a book that doesn't go away. You keep referring to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean provides relevant, insightful information that I use on the job and in teaching others about the subject. The Five Principles define the fundamentals of a lean implementation and reminds readers that lean is about more than just waste elimination. It also addresses the importance of the organizational component which is critical to lean success. The chapter on the Common Lean Pitfalls is priceless. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to Lean is a valuable resource for knowledgeable, experienced project managers and executives who are seeking advice on how to improve their odds of success in creating a lean culture.The authors provide an insightful list of pitfalls to avoid, a solid and usable 5 stage model for implementation, an in-depth description of the operating system which holds the components together, a contrast between manufacturing and service applications and advice on how to apply lean principles on a personal level. They apply lean principles to the activities of accounting and materials management departments with less success.In spite of the process focus of most lean thinking, the authors strongly argue that lean leadership is solely about creating results, through teaching that changes thinking and habitual behavior. In our bottom-line driven business culture, this is a critical baseline for starting, growing and continuing lean activities.The authors squarely address change management issues with a simple model. Leaders must clearly define the end objectives/create the vision of adding perceived customer value. They must help all to see the real current situation and hate its waste! By creating a tension between the current and desired states, leaders can motivate staff to leave their comfort zone, avoid fear and overcome their resistance to change.Lean is an organic, holistic system, process, philosophy, journey and way of thinking. It is not an end. Lean contains a system, tools, measures and thinking, but no one component is adequate or more important than the others. The combination of the integral components creates consistency which drives results.The authors clearly describe 5 principles that are foundations for lean thinking. Everything is a process and deep understanding of process matters. An operations perspective focused on eliminating the 7 varieties of waste and delivering customer valued results is essential. Standardized processes are required for progress. Problems should be welcomed as opportunities to reduce waste and add value by applying systematic problem solving processes. Organizational learning requires processes with feedback loops and delivers cumulative knowledge and continuous process improvement.The authors' final analysis is consistent with their lean principles. Ongoing lean success depends upon deep understanding of the lean process, integration and application of all components and a clear understanding that nothing less than organizational transformation and cultural alignment is required."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"I have used \\"The Hitchiker's Guide\\" as a training tool for Lean Champions.

It's one of the best books on showing how lean needs to be a way of thinking, which is very helpful for lean leaders.As a communication professional, I also find the book invaluable in reinforcing the importance of talking about the \\"how.\\" Authors Jamie Flinchbaugh and Andy Carlino write about how managers are more comfortable communicating the \\"what.\\" Managers often tend to ignore the \\"how\\"--or at least they don't drive for full agreement. (The \\"what\\" includes the goals, objectives, tasks and the metrics used to measure success.)To prove their point, the authors compare work departments to the road system in which millions of people drive at high speeds in heavy pieces of equipment over varying road conditions in all types of weather. \\"In reality 100 million drivers never sat in a 12-hour planning meeting together, nor do they report to the same boss; but they are able to navigate the nation's highways with less chaos than most 50-person departments,\\" they write. Chaos is non-existent because drivers agree on the \\"hows.\\" This includes driving on the same side of the road, stopping on red and not crossing double-yellow lines.Thanks to this book, I emphasize the \\"how\\" much more in my communications work and I achieve better results."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"The author's do an exceptional job of communicating the reality that \\"lean\\" is beyond a simplistic set of tools that are usually unleashed upon an organization. They bring it home in stating, \\"Lean is not born from what you see, but from how you think.\\" From this view point they begin explaining the principle side of \\"lean\\" that drives change. Each of the 10 chapters are structured with five key concepts that moves organizational leadership towards continuous improvement. Another great test of the author's understanding is seen in their comment that one must not \\"confuse activity and productivity.\\" As a full time lean implementation manager with 20 years of hands on experience, I can say this is one of the few books that really connects the principle side of lean. I've used this in numerous book clubs, resulting in positive feedback from office and administrative team members who have their eyes opened to what \\"lean\\" really means to them and their functions. The book is a great read, with excellence flow and applicable methodology. The material in the book will help any organization realize the change in thought processes required to sustain a lean journey beyond another flavor of the month project. I would greatly recommend this to those who are beginning the journey of lean and continuous improvement."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road","review":"This book is a refreshing take on Lean Thinking. Instead of simply rehashing material, the authors (Jamie Flinchbaugh and Andy Carlino) provide practical and useful content that can be applied immediately.The authors present lean as a way of thinking instead of a set of tools moving through the principles of Lean, to the importance of Leadership, and addressing five common pitfalls and how organizations can avoid them. The transformation roadmap presented is very useful to help an organization understand where it lies on its lean journey, and that it is a journey, not just a destination.The material is presented in a very readable, almost conversational format.

The booklet was so small that I read everything within an hour. The 24 hour service was to call the casinos around the U.S. I did'nt need that. I felt that I should be able to call the Author or someone associated with the Author and get some real Help, as we say (from the horses mouth).

Tonight being that date I told a friend about this treasure, and am amazed to find it actually in print and available. I have read of Cassandra's adventures since I was her age through my own now (31). Each time I read I am struck by the forcefulness and poignancy of the writing, at how we as readers watch Cassandra grow into her strength as a writer and into her pain as a young woman. The scene in which Cassandra sits in the church during a storm (&quot;I am a chaos inside a stillness inside a chaos&quot;) and ponders the relation of spirituality and human-kindness I review my own sense of spirit and self. Details, such as the color of the liquers, the shadows of the castle, the green die in the tub, the packed lunches for Mortmain in the castle, illustrate the power of Smith as a writer of tremendous force-- most powerful in her ability to have these details grow from Cassandra's pen (or pencil stub). I gave my first copy away to a good friend for her graduation, then received another used copy from a good friend on my first birthday away from home. I have never known a world which I wish to share more than that of the castle, England in the 30s, the world of I Capture the Castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Most of these reviews sounds as if they're written by teenagers -- let me sign in -- I'm 72, first met the book when I was 25, totally enchanted.

Once I did, once I read that fantastic first sentence, I was hooked. Since then, I have read it at least once every year, and my mother and her friend Polly and I have amused ourselves for many hours casting the movie we'd like to make of it (Gabriel Byrne for Mortmain, Sean Bean for The Swain . . . ?).It is a charming, clever, intelligent book, with a heroine who is three-dimensional and extremely sympathetic. Its cast of characters are the family and friends you always wished you had, its love story satisfying in its open-endedness.If you know a smart, literary teenaged girl (or if you are or were one), buy the book.

Her charm and her romantic view of the happenings surrounding her and her family draw one into this beautifully written book. When you're through, you'll want to have a Midsummer's festival, just like Cassandra.I try to read this book at least once a year- it is one that you will never tire of, and one which you wish would continue long after it is over!

It started out a perfectly beautiful little escapist story, filled with scrumptious images and a romance with life....The problem came when the author tried--exceedingly heavyhandedly--to turn it into a life lesson.

Their lives get turned upside-down with the arrival of the American Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, the new owners of the property. Cassandra chronicles the changes within the family and home for the next six months.Initially, I loved the story. I found Cassandra's narrative to be extremely charming, and I felt the book was well written. As it was written in 1948 and set in the 1930s, a lot of the subject matter in the book was extremely progressive, i.e. Cassandra's musings on whether she is an atheist or not. I cannot seem to recall a book I've ever read from that time period that was so candid about such a controversial topic, which I really appreciated.I also loved all the characters in the book. I felt that they were flawed in a very natural sense, very much like people that one would know. My favorite character was Stephen; he was like a knight in shining armor for the Mortmain family.The things I didn't really care for was the way Cassandra turned about halfway through the book. The story got convoluted and started becoming trite, with subplots that really didn't seem to make sense. Cassandra goes from being an interesting, intriguing character that I really wanted to know more about to a character that is simpering, insipid, and contradictory. Having said that, though, one forgets that she's seventeen, so her wishy washy, over-romanticized nature con be slightly forgiven. Only slightly.The ending is ambiguous and may leave some people thirsting for more of a story; however, as it is a journal, there will be some loose ends. It is unpredictable, which I appreciate.While things didn't go the way I wanted or expected, this was still an excellent story with excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Along with the rest of the literary world, I recently rediscovered this classic after it was republished having sat in obscurity for years. And was promptly blown away. For any lovers of Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, or even The Age of Innocence, this is a must-read. The plot is Austen's, the characters Montgomery's, and the setting and bittersweet flavor Wharton's. Written as the journal of a cynical but essentially dreamy 17-year-old, it depicts the turning point in both her life and the lives of her family, as they spiral toward decay and complete poverty, the only hope of redemption being offered by the arrival of wealthy, good-looking neighbors next door. Don't expect to find any Mr. Darcys in this book - the Cotton brothers are much more thinly sketched and truth be told despisable heroes than that famous character, but the book rides on the wistful, witty, breathtakingly clear voice and character of Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine who burns in the memory long after the book has been put down, and as such the book is more than worth reading. Doesn't quite achieve the peak of lofty classicism of other more famous books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice, but a lovely story which skitters on the edges of childhood, romance, heartbreak, and growing up with grace and near-brilliance. For a book to be a true classic it must contain 1)intensely vibrant, complex, and individual characters, particularly the main one 2)a well-constructed and finely drawn plot, that brings nothing extra in and 3)that extra spark, of style or vision, that lifts a book into something that appeals on some level to all humanity. I Capture the Castle has a good dose of all three but not quite enough. On the first charge, while Cassandra herself fits the bill as nearly as a 17-year old can(unfortunately by the very nature of the age given to her she doesn't quite have the maturity or decisiveness of a woman) most of the other characters feel either over-the-top(her family) or under-drawn(Rose and the Cotton brothers). On the second, there is such a thing as too much detail, and Dodie Smith falls into that trap. On the third, she nearly, nearly reaches that level, particularly in the brilliant ending scene, but not quite; the wider emotions - hate, fear, and the deeper vision, is missing. So, in the end, while this remains a minor classic - the story of a year or so in the life of a girl - it's a brilliant and heartbreaking one. \\"Three more lines left. I love you.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Cassandra keeps a journal as an exercise to practice writing and she records the events that occur over the period of about one year. She is a 17-year-old girl who lives in a rundown, but romantic castle in England with her family. Her father, James Mortmain wrote a novel years ago that was wildly successful and earned alot of money, but he hasn't written anything since and now the family is impoverished to the point of hunger. Cassandra is kept company by her older sister Rose and her eccentric stepmother Topaz while her younger brother Tom makes infrequent appearances because he is mostly in town at school. And then there is the servant Stephen, an extremely good-looking young man devoted to Cassandra. He so hates to see her hungry that he takes a job to contribute his earnings to the household. However, the father discourages any interest Cassy might have in Stephen because he is from a different social class.The real excitement starts about 100 pages into the book when the Cotton family arrives at the nearby Scoatney estate. Neil and Simon are wealthy Americans and Rose sets her sites on Simon because he is the heir. Anyone who has ever been poor can somewhat relate to the girls predicament. Rose's desire to marry wealth would not only ensure enough to eat and buy pretty new clothes for herself, it would ensure the same for her family (since her father shows no signs of changing and Simon is kind and generous).I think young adults would enjoy this book because the rest of the novel is about young love. The relationships lack real depth and the ending is somewhat open ended which some will like and others will find disappointing. I can't really imagine being 17 or 20 and being as nave about boys as Cassy and Rose, but I suppose things used to be very different. The real charm of this novel is the enchanting atmosphere of the castle as depicted through Cassandra's rose-colored glasses. Most of the characters seem shallow and we didn't see enough of Stephen, the only person I actually admired, but somehow Cassy's rendering of the whining characters makes them likeable."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a &quot;small&quot; book. The scene is circumscribed, the characters few, and the action minor. Yet is is a beautifully written, achingly real book about the passage from girlhood to adulthood.

The characters, the settings are all beautifully drawn and developed. But more than that, the feelings of Cassandra at seventeen, falling in love for the first time are so vivid. It is wonderful to remember how it felt to be young and in love. A book for everyone. The only problem is that it ends.

The two eldest (girls) are of an age when the world of childhood fantasy and the \\"real world\\" have begun to collide. The results carry the family (with a narrator reminiscent of those created by Nancy Mitford)into situations both absurd and absorbing, but always with a warmth and wisdon that does not fail to charm."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read this book only because it had been recommended to me by a friend years ago, then I found it on a \\"librarian's picks\\" shelf in the library.Once I began reading, with no particular expectations, I was quickly and completely caught up with it. It is the coming of age tale of a young girl, whose family, including her father, step-mother, sister and brother get by in rather desperate and precarious financial circumstances in an excentric house that's part of an English castle wall. Her father is an writer, of real reknown in literary circles (think Joyce), but hasn't written anything in a very long time. A wealthy American family moves into the castle's main house and their lives change profoundly.The book was originally written in the early 20th century, but its insights about a young girl and her observations of the world and people around her are timeless.This is a lovely book that was well-deservedly reissued and I recommend it to everyone. After reading it through a library, I ended up buying two copies so I could keep one and share another with friends."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I loved this.

This is a definite keeper. I would recommend it in an instant."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a gently whimsical and vaguely gothic story told from the perspective of young Cassandra Mortmain, living with her eccentric, genteely impoverished family in an old English castle. Writing in her beloved journal, Cassandra, an aspiring writer, creates a clear picture of her castle home and her brilliantly bizarre family; genius novelist father James with a case of intense writer's block, sweet, bohemian stepmother Topaz, elder sister Rose and servant boy Stephen.The novel picks up pace when the wealthy Cotton brothers move from America to their English estate, very close to Cassandra's castle. This sets life into hectic motion for all the family, particularly Cassandra and Rose. As Cassandra chronicles the goings on, she gradually, gracefully grows up. Ultimately, this is a story about the joy and pain of love, particularly when that love is unrequited.While there are moments when characters behave, well, randomly (why in the world DOES Simon kiss Cassandra?), the book has a quirky, lovable charm and beauty. Cassandra's voice is fresh and unaffected, and the characters and surroundings are finely sketched. A good read for anyone, particularly imaginative teenagers."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I prolonged my reaching the end of this book as long as possible.

I instantly fell in love with Dodie Smith's style of writing. She describes the characters and the setting so well that you feel as if you are inside the book rather than reading it. What makes this book so great is that by the time you are finished you feel as if each character was a long lost friend and you feel so sad that the book has ended.

With wit and an eye for detail, she describes her family, the history that led to their reduced circumstances, and the remarkable events that transpire to change those circumstances.

The Mortmains live in England in a drafty old castle, without any source of regular income. In her witty and wonderfully colorful diary entries, Cassandra bemoans the horrible meals, the awful clothes and the bitter cold that they all must endure. She writes with bravado and style, and she is a most endearing heroine. Her family is not ordinary. James Mortmain, her father, is a formerly successful author who wrote one book and then abruptly stopped writing. In spite of his family's extreme poverty, he refuses to put pen to paper. Cassandra's stepmother, Topaz, is a former artist's model who is still gorgeous and occasionally outrageous. Cassandra and Rose decide that Rose, the older sister, must marry someone wealthy in order to escape their wretched impoverished state. Fortunately, two brothers, Simon and Neil Cotton, come into their lives and the inevitable romantic entanglements ensue. Most of the book is engrossing and funny. However, the book is a little too long. The last fifty to seventy-five pages drag a bit. All in all, Smith has created a delightful heroine, whose fresh and irreverent voice is a breath of fresh air. I recommend this book as a light and entertaining diversion."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"After reading a glowing report of this book's reissue in my newspaper and the raving reviews of other readers on this website, I was dying to read I Capture the Castle. And I enjoyed it at first--I loved Cassandra and could definitely identify with her. But it all fell apart for me when she fell in love with Simon. Maybe it's because I don't like that name, maybe it's because I couldn't get the image of his ugly beard out of my head even after he shaved it off, but I think the main reason I was disappointed was that I never quite understood what she liked about him in the first place--he seemed nice and benevolent and all, but hardly desperately attractive. I'm disappointed to be disappointed though!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I was not terribly impressed by this story. It was well written with wonderful character development of the narrator, Cassandra, however the overall plot was dull. I think what really threw me was the very beginning of the novel, when Cassandra and her family describe their overwhelming poverty, and then they all come to the conclusion that not a single person in the house can go out and work to make money. Why not? What are they doing with their time? Cassandra daydreams and writes in her journal, I have no idea what Rose is up to, Thomas goes to school, Topaz keeps house, the father does crosswords and mopes all day about not being able to write, and the only person who does go out to make money is the orphan serving boy who shouldn't even be giving the family money in the first place.Instead of self sufficient pluck to get the family out of poverty, the plot revolves around her sister Rose snaring a rich man, which in turn leads to the family's fortunes turning around (and a lot of other stuff happens).It reminded me a lot of \\"A tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" but what made that such a wonderful read was the tenacity of the family, never giving up to pull themselves out of poverty through hard work and determination and not waiting around for things to be handed to them."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What I enjoyed about the story was mostly how it evoked other favorites of mine - this tale of a girl coping with poverty, an eccentric family, and her own budding sexuality is a little Wuthering Heights (without the melodrama) meets Pride and Prejudice (without the social satire) meets Judy Bloom (without the happy ending).I found the story to be sweet, entertaining, and well-told, if not particularly memorable. Like a slow walk through the English countryside on a summer day, the narrator is in no great rush to tell the story, taking time to wander down lanes that don't ultimately contribute much to the story (Cassandra's flirtation with religion, the history of castles, psychoanalysis, etc.) but that are scenic enough.However, as much as I enjoyed the stroll, the impatient American in me longed eventually to arrive at some destination. Instead, the narrator leaves us at a fork in the road, watching as Cassandra looks longingly down the path she yearns to take and then down the path she ought to take. Not sure if it's the author's attempt at realism, or symbolic of Cassandra's emerging maturity/wisdom, or just a British thing - but did find the ending a little unsatisfying. Not enough, however, to entirely detract from what was, in the main, a pleasant and worthwhile journey.(See, Cassandra, just how useful metaphors can be?)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Cassandra's lovely prose far transcends her age in the book.

I am only 14 but this is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It explores the life of 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain through her diary. It is a coming of age story as Cassandra learns what it is to love and to hate. Her life changes over this period of a year. She is put out into the real world (she lived a sheltered life in a castle in the countryside of England) and forced to rethink her semi-naive ideals of life. I really identified with Cassandra when I read it. She wants to become a writer, just as I do. There are some absolutely beautiful passages in this book about what it means to write, and the stumbling blocks, which are totally true. It also explores the mishaps and adventures of love, and how you can lose your head, and hurt others as well as yourself. It has an extremely poignant message about true love and also the affects of fooling yourself into love for the begiuling riches. Dodie Smith has written a masterpiece, a classic, in my opinion. I think that every young woman should read this book and learn the lessons it has to teach about love, friendship, strife, and life in general. I don't want to sound Cheesy at all but that's what it is. If there was one book that I have to say influenced the way I looked at life and my writing the most, it would probably be this one.GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of the owner of Bookhampton in East Hampton, NY for my 14 year old daughter.

Narrator/diarist Cassandra (I know she isn't really Romola Garai, but it's nice to think she is) is quite a wit and a talented young writer, courtesy of her eccentric father. Her stepmother and older sister, according to her, are both great beauties - nothing wrong with that. Each of them is admired by several men, always a good sign. And the several men are in turn variously chased by the (mostly) chaste women. If this sounds a bit like a soap opera, as some of the less enthusiastic reviewers have written, perhaps it is, but one of a very high quality, one with many surprises, picturesque settings, and at least one great car - played by a GP Bugatti in the movie.

What a charming book!Set in the 1930s in a rural English town, the novel tells the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl living with her family in a run-down castle. Cassandra's family is highly eccentric. Her father is a tortured writer, her stepmother a free spirit and great beauty and her sister Rose is her imaginative best friend and confidante. The story revolves around the love triangle that ensues when two wealthy American brothers move into a nearby estate and begin courting the Mortmain sisters.Smith's writing style is languid and lushly romantic. The novel is a pleasure to read. While Rose and Cassandra's romances are very much mired in old fashioned conventions, the emotions involved are quite accessible to modern readers. Cassandra comes across as a vivid and believable character and it's easy to care for her.I have to say that I was disappointed in the ending.

Sure, the movie was OK, but I don't think it really got to the heart of the story.I feel the author is really trying to say something here that is summarized at the end during the discussion between Simon and Cassandra about her father's book.

I even have castles on my checks! And, since I'm an Aglophile, I gravitate towards books from Britian. Anyway, I get a lot of ideas for books from AMAZON'S marvelous 'lists' and when I saw something that said, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE, my curiosity got the best of me. And then, reviewers were comparing the author to Austen and Bronte and the heroine to Jane Eyre or Elizabeth Bennett. Since these people are referring to my all time favorite books, I immediately ordered this one. The cover of the book has a castle on it and the back has a recommendation from J K Rowling, another favorite author! WOW! I couldn't wait to start this book.Well, despite not seeing any similarities between the above authors to Dodie Smith (who also wrote the classic 101 DALMATIONS) or my beloved heroines to the seventeen year-old Cassandra Mortmain, this is still an enthralling read.This novel was published in 1948 but takes place in the 1930's. James Mortmain has written a very successful novel called \\"Jacob Wrestling.\\" He makes quite a bit of money and then, years later is sent to prison for 3 months for dramatically brandishing a cake knife at his wife during a family picnic (a neighbor 'tells'). When he returns from his incarceration, he has writer's block that spans decades. He also impetuously signs a 40-year lease on a ramshackle castle that is hundreds of years old. He promptly hides out in the tower all day, every day to read novels (while his family thinks he is writing). Cassandra, an aspiring writer, tells the story through her detailed journals.In addition to the father and Cassandra, the family now consists of the beautiful and selfish older sister Rose, a brother Tom, and an eccentric and free spirited Topaz, the beautiful stepmother (their mother has died years before of natural causes). There is also a young servant boy, Stephen (who is madly in love with Cassandra). Since the dad is useless, the family sells not only the furniture but also personal belongings to buy food. Stephen tends the garden and volunteers to get another job to support the family that should be paying him. To add drama and romance, the handsome and charming Cotton brothers move into the manor adjacent to the castle. Mr. Mortmain is supposed to be paying rent to the owner of this estate (he doesn't).One can really imagine what is going to happen from just reading the paragraph before this one. Yes, this book is a tad dated and predictable but trust me, there is a delicious twist at the end to satiate all of us romantics who love the fairy-tale ending. Cassandra is absolutely charming and we really pull for this young lady. I loved reading this novel; it was so easy to get into and easy to follow. The story was sweet (if you ignore the slattern father and bratty sister) with nice language and no $*x.........very classic.

All the characters are enjoyable and life like.Of course, this is a book for younger readers. I still feel it is a very good read for any age. I read it in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I have since re-read it twice and I still love it.I have heard that this is also one of JK Rowlings favorite books as a child, and that it inspired her to write.High praise indeed.Please read it for yourself and don't let those without imagination turn you away from it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I absolutely love this book! I say it a lot, and it's always true. My mom gave me her copy when I was twelve, she'd found a first printing copy in a box of books her father recieved from the book of the month club, read it, and fell in love. So she passed it on to me and I adore it every bit as much as she does. This is beautiful story, it sucks you in. You care about the people and it is definatly not a brick wall happy ending. I still wonder what happened...how Cassandra's life turned out, not to mention her sister rose's. This is the story of a young girl and her family living in an old castle in rural england. Her sister detests poverty (unfortunate, since they are extremely poor), her father is a has been writer who's work is still studied in colleges in england and america, but brings in little to no income (he hasn't written a word in years) and her step mother is an eccentric (to say the least) painters model who communes naked with nature and finds the castle wonderfully romantic. Everyone in this book is human. they have flaws...selfishness, lazyness...insecurities, and their flaws only make them more endearing. When Cassandra's sister Rose meets an American millionair come to stay at a neighboring estate (actually, he's their landlord) she determines immediately that she will marry this man, Simon Cotton, whether she loves him or not. I wont say too much about the plot, because I don't want to ruin it, but suffice to say that this story is above all real. I can relate, just as my mother could, and anyone who has ever been in (unrequited) love will be able to relate. It's touching without being mushy, and trust me, you don't know how it's going to turn out, even if 2/3rds of the way through you think you do. On top of that, it's funny! you will be laughing out loud. Green hands, naked step moms, and ackward situations abound (there's a scene involving rose and a bearskin coat that is a classic) so don't expect it to be preachy. Just entertaining, touching, and fun."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I cannot think of a book which has made me laugh, cry, daydream, and fight the urge to finish reading instead of savoring each word as long as possible. The book works on so many levels, but I won't bother mentioning them. Mostly, it shows Cassandra developing her writing skills and maturing into a lovely sensible young woman. The descriptions are sometimes so breathtaking that I reread them and just closed my eyes to visualize what this place must be like. While I wish there were a chance that a movie could be made about it, so much would be lost without the words Cassandra writes. This is a book that I will recommend to others; it was as close to perfect as I have found for some time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I knew that the book was good the moment I realized that I was enjoying it -- because the first time I read &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot;, I was only ten years old.

The book is told in the form of a journal; seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, whose best poem was written on top of the henhouse (and it wasn't a good one at that), has finally given up on rhyme and meter, and has decided that the best way to train herself into &quot;good writer&quot; position would be to keep a journal in her own very unique shorthand.Cassandra, her broody father, her eccentric stepmother Topaz, her older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen (who helps with the gardening and things) all live in a large house -- well, mostly castle, but a bit house as well -- with very little money and not much hope ... until two strangers show up at their door after their car has been stuck in the mud, claiming to have seen some spirits dancing around atop the battlements.Smith's style is whimsical at times, dead serious at others, but all the time managing to capture the reader's attention, as she captures the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I first found this book in England and have read it twice since then. It will be difficult to find one unhappy reviewer for this book as it is perfect in itself. It is the story of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her eccentric family who live in a crumbling castle in 1930's England. Her lovely sister Rose,&quot; a pinkish person&quot;, is desperate to be married off, her father has become strangly antiscocial after his days as a best-selling author, and Topaz, her stepmother, is the very embodiment of eccentric. Cassandra herself is intelligent, dreamy and sometimes sarcastic, loved by Stephen, &quot;eighteen now, very fair and noble looking but his expression is just a fraction daft,&quot; who gives her plagiarized poems, but in love with someone else. Light a few candles on a rainy day and read this book. It is worth far more than $11.16!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle, an absolutely delightful story by DodieSmith, also the author of 101 Dalmations, which was popularized byDisney's film adaptations. Dodie was born and raised in England (rather evident from this tale!), but wrote I Capture the Castle in the '40's while living in America. For some reason, ICtC has been out of print for many years. I join many of the literary populace in their cheers of gratefulness for the recent re-printing!I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen-year-old aspiring writer, who lives with her family in a rapidly deteriorating castle in the middle of the English countryside. ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a story, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her comments about the people in her life kept me constantly in stitches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published author; a man who everyone considers to be brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother-- though young enough to be a sister. Topaz is a nude modelist for &quot;great&quot; paintings and is invariably eccentric, down to her midnight romps &quot;communing with nature&quot; out in the country. Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, is a lamentable character; and Thomas, the brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen- the family man-of-all-work, and the Cotton Brothers- a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh unto impossible!If you want something light, humorous, and quick, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a very good time with I Capture the Castle.

Well I do love reading, and I especially love reading and rereading this book. I'm always enchanted by the clever plot, the teacher with the blinky eyes, the white dresses the sisters wore in London when everyone else was wearing black, the image I have of Cassandra's stepmother floating like a ghost while communing with nature and the crinoline tossed over Cassandra's shoulder as she walks down the lane. Sometimes I think I can even smell the musty, dank hallways of the castle. In my many moves over the years, I lost the copy of the book my mother gave me, and was heartsick about it because I had planned to give it to my two daughters when they become teenagers. I'm thrilled that the book has been reprinted! I hope it becomes our family tradition to pass this book on from mother to daughter."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I was online searching desperately for other books by Dodie Smith and became absorbed in the reviews for I Capture the Castle, my favorite book of all time. Most everyone agreed that it is one of the most beautiful, enjoyable novels ever written, but I was spurred to write this review after discovering a review by someone who ACTUALLY gave it two stars or something equally pathetic. Their reason: because \\"no book could ever live up to Lord of the Rings,\\" which they had just finished. For the record, this is not a book to be compared to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The differences between the two are astounding, one being that tLOtR is, albeit a well-done history and fantasy novel, stale and boring, especially compared to a book like ICtC, which really enchants the reader from start to finish. I read Tolkein's trilogy and enjoyed the imaginative goings-on, but I had to force myself to finish, to read the long boring passages saturated with history.Everyone should read the Lord of the Rings, and everyone should read I Capture the Castle. But please don't avoid it because one elitist person thinks that one is better than the other. I Capture the Castle is truly mesmerizing and can be enjoyed by anyone...seriously."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read \`I capture the Castle' over a year ago and enjoyed it even though (forgive me for using the \`R' word) it is a romance, which I don't usually find too interesting. What I find amazing is that it has stuck in my mind like the contents of a child's treasure box.The setting of the castle is as clear in my mind today as it was when I read about it and it gives me a pang of regret to realize that it is only a place of fiction and not one I can ever lay eyes on. In truth, though, it appears more vividly in the imagination that it ever could if it were made of mere stone. Seldom has a title of a book been so apropos.I would say more about Dodie Smith's portrayal of the characters but others have done so. I do regret that she didn't leave the world with more of her books.I can't wait to introduce my daughters to it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"There really are no words for how much I enjoyed this book. The main character, Cassandra Mortmain, tells an entertaining story in a delightful voice. Her humor, her zest and her knack for observation and introspection make her first-person narrative both compelling and vastly entertaining. I wish I had the book handy so that I could post half a dozen excerpts to demonstrate how falling-down funny this book is in places. As it is, I will have to satisfy myself only by telling you that the first sentence is \\"I am writing this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" A more auspicious beginning I cannot imagine.A great part of what I enjoyed about this book was the humor. Cassandra's family gives new meaning to the term \\"dysfunctional\\" and her descriptions of the various members and their escapades are hilarious. But I appreciated the book equally for its serious parts and for the sensitive touch with which the main romance was unfolded. Cassandra's soul-searching is insightful and touching, and her rendition of the traditional teenage unrequited crush and subsequent angst is fresh and honest. Towards the end of the book, I started to get a little worried that the book's original light-hearted tone had gone forever, and that the book would end on a downer, but I was relieved to find that I was wrong. Speaking of the ending, it was neither complete nor entirely without a note of sadness, but I thought it exactly appropriate. It ended with hope, even if you're a cynical reader, and if (like me) you're a shamelessly sentimental reader who can squeeze a happy ending into even the tiniest crack given the chance, it ended with considerably more than hope. Thematically, the ending was perfect.For some reason, I keep wanting to say that Cassandra Mortmain is Anne Shirley for post-moderns, which I don't think is exactly right, but it's close. She did strike me as a character that many Green Gables fans will identify with. I Capture the Castle deals with a lot more complicated issues, especially in the interpersonal relationship department, whereas Anne's stories (and relationships) are much simpler and more straightforward. Cassandra is called upon to examine herself and others much more deeply than Anne ever does while Anne has more opportunity for innocent whimsy. Anyway, I think that people who identified with Anne as teens will identify just as strongly with Cassandra a few years later. I did, at any rate."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I am not sure when first I read \\"I Capture the Castle\\". I believe I might have been in High School. I do know when I got my own copy of the book: in 1975, when I was twenty-five years old. That was 31 years ago...and I have read it every few years ever since I've had the joy of it's presence on my bookshelf. I shared it with my daugter when she was in High School, and it's one of her favorites, too. That is not to say this book is a \\"girly\\" book, or even a \\"romance\\". It's something altogether different. Ethereal, yet heart touchingly real. Imaginative, yet grounded and honest. It really is, very much, a journey of a young soul into self awareness, truth, and ultimately, spiritual and moral triumph. All this accomplished through a journal written by 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain, documenting the sometimes humorous, sometimes embarassing, sometimes touching and sometimes painfully profound events that occur during seven months in one momentous, and pivotal year. This is no \\"fairy tale\\". The image of the crumbling castle, and it's eccentric and complicated inhabitants isn't a careless or gratuitous one. Like in the fictional book \\"Jacob Wrestling\\", that the father of our heroine wrote years ago as his \\"one hit wonder\\"...there is a reason for everything in this book. The image of a \\"bear\\" \\"attacking\\" sister Rose, the \\"dead shoes\\", the \\"Shape\\" seen at a Midsummer's Eve observance. the pennies coming out of a 'phone in answer to \\"prayer\\"; the green of a liqueur against beautiful hair, a bowl and pitcher glimpsed in a window: all of it together forms a pattern that is crafted to imprint the book's message indeliably into a receptive reader's mind. Yet..it's all done so charmingly that one hardly realizes one has just had one's consciousness elevated. The reader may think he's merely being entertained....I am with those who believe \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a modern classic. The very fact, from the time I read it first, some 40 years ago, that it's images and charm has haunted me to this day is testament to it's validity and value. I will find myself somewhere, in some circumstance, and suddenly a correlating scene from the book pops into my head. As Cassandra's passage into womanhood leaves first one childhood dream, then another, behind...my heart squeezes with pain at the losses we all endure in our journey into adulthood. Yes, this is a wonderful book for a young person. But it's also for all ages, even someone old, like me. That is why I must go back to \\"The Castle\\" every few years, as I travel this road of life...and with every visit, I spot something new, learn something else, grow a little more...."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This intelligently written, playful, and all around delightful novel, set in mid-20th century England, was the answer to my prayers oh so long ago, when I was in the throes of teenage angst. Although it was written before I was born, it never struck me as being outdated or inaccessible. The heroine, Cassandra Mortmain, lives in a derelict medieval castle in the English countryside, with a motley assortment of family members. Hers is a distinctly bohemian, if not to say eccentric, household, but to me she seemed as real as my fellow classmates in New York's Greenwich Village. The frequently hilarious, frequently touching moments in the life of Cassandra and her circle--her father, a once-famous writer, her beautiful, dissatisfied sister Rose, her artist's-model stepmother Topaz, her precocious younger brother, and the family's faithful \\"servitor,\\" the incredibly handsome, lovelorn Stephen--make for entertaining reading of the best sort. Enter two wealthy, half-American brothers, one of whom actually owns the castle and the land it stands on, and the stage is set for romance (both requited and unrequited), misunderstandings, comedy, and Cassandra's own poignant coming of age. Dodie Smith, the author of \\"101 Dalmations,\\" combines wit with a sprightly prose style to produce an almost cinematic flow of imagery in the mind of the reader. For young women, age 13 and up, who have not grown hardened and blase on a diet of \\"Gossip Girl\\" type literature, this book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I came across this book accidentally. My co-worker had it on the library reference desk. She said it was the next book in her book discussion group. After she told me a little about it I decided to read it. Then, I had second thoughts. So, I read reviews of it on Amazon. I still wasn't sure if I wanted to read it when I read that people said it was like Jane Austen would write if she was around today. Even though I'm a former English major and a librarian, I will commit the great heresy and admit I don't like Jane Austen. She's too hoity-toity for me. But, then, in a review I read the opening couple of sentences: &quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.&quot; This is such a great and intriguing opening that I had to know what was going on. I'm glad I decided to read it. It is a delightful novel, especially describing the poverty the Mortmains experience living in the castle. (You don't associate living in a castle with poverty! That, right there, makes the book different.) I have to admit, it does rather read like a modern Jane Austen and yet I didn't mind all the talk about who loved whom and who was going to marry whom. I also enjoyed sharing the challenge of getting James Mortmain to go back to his writing. It's a very good read with interesting characters, including the castle itself. And, if you like romances, you will really like this book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"this book was really good i just finished it. i loved the characters although i wished the ending was a little different. i recomend it to anyone who loves the british!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The method of telling the story reminds me heavily of Emily of New Moon by L. M. Montgomery but the overall themes and characterizations remind me most of the Great Gatsby.Nick Carraway, the narrator and protagonist of The Great Gatsby describes Jay Gatsby, all his excesses and his hangers on with a sense of detachment and mild amusement. Cassandra, the narrator and protagonist of I Capture the Castle takes the same approach with her description of the Cottons, who are visiting from America. In Cassandra's case, her family's extreme poverity heightens the divide between the two families and opens her eyes even wider to the oddities of the wealthy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I am what you would call the typical teenaged girl with a passion for books of all types. However this book has topped all my lists I have read it hundreds of times, without it loosing and ounce of appeal. It does not have the typical ending or follow the formulated outline for teen fiction, it is unique in itself and should be a required reading of anyone who is growing up. By the end of the book the characters are as close to you as your own family, I feel their pain and happiness with every word &quot;Cassandra&quot; writes. I belive this book to be the best book of all times and that could be true, but oppinions change and intrests grow so, I would be tempted to recomend this book to the large population of teenagers. I would not however recommend this book to adults. I think adults may see it as yet another book about teen angst or unrequinted love, but it is so much more it is about the life of youth and the heart of an entire would and time.

Before I knew it (and to my very great dismay), the book was over just as I was getting to know and become fond of the narrator and heroine, Cassandra Mortmain. I was enchanted by this story of a bright young girl and her first love though I was often times quite aggravated by her very eccentric family and neighbors - most particularly her mad father and marriage-minded sister. Yet, in the end the characters are part of what made the story so enjoyable. As portrayed in this book, life in a castle in 1930's England, was quite an experience. An ideal read to curl up with on a rainy day!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book is a fabulous coming of age story that is written splendidly. The narrator begins as a clever 17-year-old and matures in the story to be a sharp and self-aware young adult. The stories of her family are entertaining and it is so much fun to see all of them mature in the novel. The story and Dodie Smith's engaging writing style makes the book almost impossible to put down."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"In the first few pages of her journal, Cassandra Mortmain paints an amusing, whimsical, and somewhat depressing picture of her life in a crumbling castle in the English countryside. She lives here with her sister Rose, her brother Thomas, her father James, her stepmother Topaz, and the family's live-in helper Stephen Colly. They live a life of genteel poverty, quite often not having enough income to feed the family. James Mortmain has a more-than-serious case of writer's block having once traveled and lectured on his critically aclaimed book. Now the family has no other income than that contributed by the hard working Stephen who would gladly hand over all that he owns to win Cassandra's favor. In the opening scene, Cassandra discusses the family's poverty and the fact that they have sold off nearly every stick of furniture in order to make ends meet. As the family sits down to tea, Cassandra writes of the unexpected treat of having eggs. She exclaims, &quot;I was only expecting bread and margarine for tea, and I don't get as used to margarine as I could wish. I thank heaven there is no cheaper form of bread than bread.&quot;This book is told in first person and is the journal that Cassandra keeps over the course of a year. We learn her fears and dreams, and we get to know her family through her eyes. When two handsome, wealthy, and exotic Americans show up to claim their birthright, Cassandra and Rose are both thrown into their first encounter with romantic love. Cassandra tells a sweet and touching story woven through with a great deal of humor which keeps this story from becoming dull and whining. We literally get to read Cassandra's march from being an awkward girl to developing into a charming young woman making her mark on the world.As trite as it might sound, this is truly an enchanting book. I kept thinking that the author was doing such a remarkable job of creating an authentic atmosphere with the dialogue, clothing, and current events of the time. Then I found out that the book was originally written in the 1940s which isn't a far leap from the 30s setting of the book! This is also penned by the author who wrote One Hundred and One Dalmations. I recommend this for anyone who has no problems reading books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. While this is certainly less stuffy than the &quot;classics,&quot; it is nonetheless a treat to read.(reviewer: mellion108 from Michigan)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is one of the nicest, sweetest, loveliest books I have ever read.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book was recommended to me and I am forever thankful that I bought it. Through the diaries of a teenage girl named Cassandra Mortmain, the reader has the opportunity to discover the Mortmain's style of living in their old, broken-down castle. James Mortmain, reknown author of Jacob Wrestling, suddenly stopped writing and spends his days in the gatehouse, reading detective novels. After Cassandra and Rose's mother died, James decided to marry a woman who was at the same time excentric, peculair and overly obsessed with nudity: Topaz. Topaz posed for artists', but did not really enjoy it and rarely received any money for posing. With no income whatsoever, it would take a miracle for the Mortmain family to continue living.However, thing slowly changed: Stephen, the Mortmain's servant and Cassandra's admirer, received a job at Four Stones. This gave the family a bit more financial freedom, but nothing major happened until they met the Cottons'. Simon Cotton took possession of Scoatney Hall, and, in this case, the castle, since the Mortmain only had a 40 year lease on the castle. But Simon didn't mind that the Mortmain's couldn't pay their rent; in fact, he was so honoured of meeting James Mortmain that Simon frequently came to the house to talk to the family. Neil Cotton, Simon's brother, was also there, but less present then Simon was.As the story unfolds, things seem promising for the family: Rose is engaged to Simon. However, things suddenly go wrong, as first love often does. A surprising ending, with a witty and lovable narrator and a perfect length for the book. What more can a reader ask for?I find this is a great book for teenagers and prepares them for the often deceiving ending of their first relationship. It was very well written and inspired me to start a journal, just like Cassandra did. It makes readers who have never experienced love realize that it is not as beautiful as is often perceived to be in fairy tales. With a zest of rustic, mediaeval feel snd a modern twist, this book is something that will be cherished and passed on from generation to generation."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Here is a book you can &quot;live in&quot; and enjoy all the tears and laughter right along with this wonderful family.

I was unprepared, however, for how deeply I felt about it. This is a book to savor, although I found it hard to pace myself. Smith's book is as satisfying as a Jane Austen novel and as funny as the Adrain Mole diaries by Sue Townsend."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Have you ever had lots of people tell you that you *have* to see this great movie, only to go and wonder what they were talking about? That's how I feel about this book. My expectations were so high after reading the reviews here, that I was expecting this to be one of my favorite books of all time. And although it did not live up to the hype, I still thoroughly enjoyed this engaging book -- I just didn't *love* it.The story takes place in a more innocent time, in a lonely and dilapidated castle in England, where the impoverished Mortmain family lives. The narrator is the younger daughter of a once-successful author, and one of the sheer joys of this novel is the narrative voice -- it is charming and youthful, and wise yet perplexed in a way that intelligent young people can be -- remarkable since the author was in her 50s when she wrote it! This was also playwright Dodie Smith's first novel; often a playwright has trouble capturing the natural flow of conversation and description, but Smith accomplishes both here.Another strength is that the author, like Alfred Hitchcock, does not *tell* so much as *show*. Related as diary entries, and therefore more intimate than straight narrative, illustrative anecdotes immerse the reader in the state of mind of the narrator, Cassandra: we are as confused by her father's peculiar behavior as she is, we do not know whether or not sister Rose really loves her fiancee, we do not know whether or not Stephen would be a desirable beau for our heroine. Late in the book, Cassandra's father develops a theory that readers create and discover as they read, and Dodie Smith has ensured that we experience this as well as read about it.The Mortmains are complex -- stepmother Topaz is hard-working and kind, if a bit shallow; Rose is dramatic and moody, but also brave. Other characters, particularly the two American brothers who inherit the castle, are not as three-dimensional, and we are never as interested in them as we are in the English characters.The ending is lovely -- no neat resolution here. Instead, the reader is left to conjecture about the future of the Mortmain family based on what we know about them, and thanks to the talents of the author, we know a great deal and care enough to wonder."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is about a 17 year old girl in England living with her eccentric and impoverished family in a castle that her author father bought when he received money from writing an acclaimed novel called \\"Jacob Rising\\".However, since the death of their mother, Cassandra Mortmain and her siblings, Rose and Thomas, have lived with their father and stepmother, Topaz, in poverty. Their father, Mr. Mortmain, is down on his luck and seems to have writer's block or possibly have suffered a nervous breakdown.

The Mortmains are soon receiving monetary aid for their predicament from the Cotton's.Cassandra Mortmain chronicles the Mortmain's life in her journal. Her chronicles make up the book, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" and the story is fairly tedious at times.

I rarely give up on books but after 120 pages I HAD to send this one to Goodwill!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"When I finished reading I Captured the Castle, I couldn't get it out of my head. The characters came to life in the 1930s of the English countryside.The narrator is a precocious 14-year-old. Perhaps I felt something for this kind of strong female pubescent lead character. Cassandra Mortmain narrates her family's travails in her notebook and keeps a journal to chronicle the eccentric activities of her father, the essential paper tiger. A one-hit-wonder with an obfuscating literary book published many years ago, Cassandra's father fails as a breadwinner and the females in the family conspire to generate household income. Their best option is marrying off Cassandra's older sister to the new rich American neighbor.This premise doesn't reveal the surprise and ambiguous ending to the tale, and it is all about the means towards a better end that makes it a fun and light summer read. What lingers long after the reading is the way Dodie Smith wrote about the confusions of first loves and how one loves another who doesn't return the affection and how another loves you and you can't reciprocate. Confusing? She captures that female whirlspinning sensation remarkably and it seems so timeless.The male characters are three-dimensional and Cassandra's younger brother Stephen wins my heart. So too the young male servant orphaned into their family; Cassandra is not taken with his godlike beauty and finds him a bit daft.The father character is so fantastic that I won't give much away. He is a portrait of so many tortured writers who will never be authors. A widower, once accused of threatening to kill his wife with a butter knife and sent to prison, he remarried an aesthetic muse in Topaz, a beauty whose images adorned the walls of museums. But he hasn't written a second book. He doesn't do anything but read cheap detective novels all day long. Now a penniless country bumpkin instead of a London diva, Topaz cannot arouse him to write. It is the American widow who arrives and intellectually stimulates him to change his behavioral oddities and replace them with other peculiarities.I am reminded of the same kind of writing agility of Willa Cather in her depiction of the professor in The Professor's House. The skill required to convey the gender and age and human frailties of these men is impressive for any writer. Each character has a distinctive voice and personality.Cassandra and her brother conspire with insights derived from the new fangled theory proposed by Freud to make their father work. Cassandra can't help but want to free her sister from a loveless marriage to support the family because she has fallen in love with her sister's fiancee. If only her father would make a living!It's Parent-Trap meets Petticoat Junction on a Monty Python set.

I've probably reread it 100 times over the years and it still remains one of my favorites--not only because of the lyrical, descriptive prose but the beautiful images of England it conjured up in my mind.

It is the kind of book in which halfway through it you become terribly sad because you don't want it to end. I Capture the Castle is written with such beauty, originality, and humor, and is so easy to relate to, even if one has never lived next to a crumbling old castle in the English countryside. If you want to read a book that will make you feel wonderful inside, this is the one."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"An old family friend gave me a copy of this when I was a teenager and I must have read it ten times before loaning it to some wretch who didn't give it back! I just re-read my brand new copy and loved it just as much. Dodie Smith was not only a great storyteller and a wonderful writer -- she also had a fabulous sense of humor. This book literally makes me laugh out loud every time I read it -- and in spite of its age, it isn't dated at all. Great characterizations, tons of atmosphere, and wit by the gallon -- not to mention a story that will keep you up much too late for your own good!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Each page of this remarkable book contains an enchanting tone. Cassandra Mortmain chronicles each event at Godsend Castle with such a distinct detail. Her narration of her exciting life is very readable and enjoyable. Dodie Smith obviously had a strong connection with this wonderful character.The plot should not be discussed in too much detail because it takes so many turns. Cassandra's descriptions of the characters in her life and how she interacts with those characters is as delightful as her situation. A seventeen year-old girl living with her older sister, eccentric stepmother, and unusual father in a dilapidated castle in pre-war England? How could I resist such a romantic setting. Cassandra's story gives us a very unique look at the people in her life, and what unique people they are! The American Cotton family, the bashful Stephen, the mysterious father. We are given a thoughtful look into her life. Instantly, I won Cassandra's attention. I took interest in her thoughts and experiences. Her voice is wonderful, her experiences are unique, and her story is delightful. I was glad to have met her. I am not yet fifteen, and I heartily congratulate the reissue of this gem of a book. I hope other young people will enjoy this story. Similar to this is Cold Comfort Farm.

I read it as a girl in the 90's. Through three generations, &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; has been--and still is--our favorite book. I am overjoyed to see that it has been brought back to print. It has been long, long overdue."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Plain and simple: I ADORED I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith. I fell in love with the unusual and artless Cassandra. I fell in love with her entire eccentric family: her selfish writer-father; her beautiful artistic stepmother, Topaz; her shallow sister, Rose; and her little brother, Tom. I fell in love with poor but gorgeous Stephen. And I most definitely fell in love with the decrepit castle in the remote English countryside. But then I'm a romantic.I think part of the reason that I Capture the Castle charmed me so much was because certain elements of it reminded me of two of my favorite books and their heroines: Anne of Green Gables and Pride and Prejudice.I Capture the Castle is set in England in the 1930s. Cassandra's family has been living in the moldy castle for many years without having paid any rent. They have no income coming in because no one works. Sometimes there is a royalty check from the publisher because Cassandra's father once wrote a highly acclaimed and important novel which is still being taught in universities. The problem is, he hasn't published anything since. He has been shutting himself off in his room to supposedly \\"write\\"; everyone indulges is strange behavior because they're hoping for more of his greatness to come forth. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, does her best to take care of everyone, but a life of poverty is a far cry from when she used to be an artist's model in London. Rose hates the castle and having no money and is determined to get out being poor by any means possible.Cassandra, ironically, is writing up a storm. While her famous father is blocked, she fills notebook after notebook about her family and her sharp and lyrical observations of their lives. You might think that living in such isolation with so little wouldn't have much cause for her to write but some of the funniest sections have to do with how they try to make do with what they have. However, things soon take an exciting turn when two American brothers stumble upon the castle and its peculiar inhabitants.\\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring--I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that isn't a very good poem. I have decided that my poetry is so bad that I musn't write any more of it.\\"Characters fall in love but not with those whom they should; hearts are broken and there are no neat and tidy conclusions. All throughout, Cassandra's pure voice chronicles every occurrence with such candor, heart, and insight that reading I Capture the Castle was a magical experience.The 2003 movie is wonderful and does capture the book very well. Plus the one and only Bill Nighy as Cassandra's father is perfect casting!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a fun, charming little book, written in a sort of loose diary format from the perspective of a girl living in 1930's rural England. Most of its appeal is in Cassandra's voice, which is very strong, and its portrayal of a coming-of-age story that's enjoyable and lighthearted, but without being dumb or shallow in retrospect.Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, and they've been sinking into poverty since her author-father hasn't written anything for years. Much of the book focuses on the romantic escapades of Cassandra and her older sister Rose, when two eligible young American men move in nearby. But the book isn't a romance; it's a story about growing up, and Cassandra wrestles with her relationships with family members, her (lack of) religious beliefs and her writing skills--she's keeping a journal as practice for writing a novel, which neatly explains the inclusion of scenes and dialogue in someone's diary.The book starts out a bit slowly, but gets going after about 50 pages and is an entertaining read. \\"Charming\\" is probably the best word for it. Cassandra stands out for her mix of intelligence and navet&eacute;; she's quite perceptive about people, but doesn't know much about life. She feels real and authentic (minus one problem that I'll get to later). It's interesting to see all the other characters through Cassandra's eyes, because several are not very nice and yet everything we hear about them is filtered through Cassandra's deep-seated affection for them. The book makes excellent use of voice and perspective and never forgets who is telling the tale. And the writing style is good, but believable coming from a 17-18 year old girl. Some episodes are downright amusing, and the book does a good job recalling what it's like to grow up.My biggest problem with the book was that I experienced a lot of dissonance regarding Cassandra's (and Rose's) actual age. Cassandra is 17-18 and Rose 20-21, but both felt 3-4 years younger. A lot of that is probably cultural and as a historical fiction reader I should be used to this, but I think the fact that the book is set in relatively modern times actually made this worse. There's the way people around Cassandra infantilize her--their constantly referring to her as a \\"child\\" (even her significantly-older love interest does this, which is creepy) and, for instance, asking if she's old enough to attend a dinner party (why wouldn't she be?) had me picturing her as about 12. And then, neither she nor Rose seems to have any future plans; Cassandra has no thought of leaving home; neither has any work experience or marketable skills; neither has ever thought herself in love or so much as kissed a boy. (Rose, whom we're told is beautiful, \\"first realizes\\" her power over men during the book. I know they live in a remote area, but surely she'd encountered male attention before?) So, Cassandra's experience of being 17-18 felt more like my experience of being 15. Which surprised me a bit, because we think of ourselves as growing up slowly in the U.S. these days. On the bright side, though, the fact that I can relate to Cassandra's experiences at all speaks well of the book.Possibly I just read this book at the wrong age (mid-20s). It's probably best read by either teenagers a few years younger than Cassandra, or adults decades removed who want to look back nostalgically on their teen years. One of the things Smith does very well here is write a book that can appeal to both kids and adults; perhaps because it was written before the \\"young adult\\" genre was born, it's appropriate for young readers without ever feeling patronizing or whitewashed."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle has been sitting on my to-read pile for years...ever since my aunt gave me a copy and told me I'd love it. She was right! It is a sweet (and a little silly) coming-of-age story about a girl, Cassandra, who lives in poverty in a dilapidated castle with her eccentric family. She wants to live in a 50/50 mix of a Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte novel, so you can guess how the story progresses when a rich family moves in nearby! I'm happy that I took time to read this gem."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle,\\" by accomplished English playwright and novelist Dodie Smith, will capture your heart. With consummate skill, Smith presents us with the journals of young Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra at seventeen possesses both sense and sensibility; the novel is both a coming-of-age tale and a love story. Cassandra looks at the world through clear eyes; she is kind and loving to everyone in her life, and completely honest with herself. Yet at times we are transported into the romantic fantasies of a young girl experiencing first love. Like the best novels of the 1940s--a golden period for women readers-- this one is wisely written and emotionally satisfying, with insights into the hearts of the central characters. It would make a good book club selection."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I just finished reading I Capture the Castle for the first time and I am left with wonder at the depth and artistry of Dodie Smith. The characters were strong individuals without becoming clich?s (Let's face it: Rose could have been.) I loved their quirks and their problems.As I flip through others postings, I'm rather shocked to read that many believed/hoped that 'I Capture' was a romance. It isn't. The ending isn't accidental or vague. (Yes it leaves possibilities... But that is part of the point.) This is a book about \`choosing to feel', not about \`falling in love.' Reread the portion about Miss Marcy's work with the children, the Vicar's work with the church, and Cassandra's thoughts on embracing their choices or walking past. (And the reason she gives for why she chooses as she does.) Reread (and figure out) what the father's strange writing was about.To all the scoffers, I loved the ending. She was true to what she'd learned and what she believed, and that was more important than romance. (Although, I'm not a romance basher. Love it actually.)I can't recommend this book enough. It was a pleasure to immerse myself in Cassandra's world. Wish I could stay there longer."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read this book as a teenager in the 60s, and still, on occasion, pick it up for a &quot;change of pace.&quot; It never fails to charm and please me.

I lent my copy to a &quot;friend,&quot; and never got it back! Hard lesson learned."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"[yes, the title is cheesy, but it's true!!)At first when I started reading I Capture the Castle, I must admit, I was a little bored. I put off reading it for more than a year! Now I could read it over and over and over again, and it would still be great! The book starts off slow, really, but after sitting down in a nice, quiet room, and taking in every word I began to like it. I found as I began reading that the book grew more and more interesting. (Once you getting a feeling of the book) The storyline flows and it's so well put that you feel like you're sitting in Cassandra's kitchen, that you're right beside her while she writes in the kitchen sink. Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, which Cassandra absolutely adores. The book is about Cassandra Mortmain, and her daily life in that castle, set in the 1930's; her hardships with her family, her battles with love and the every day comedy's of life.Dodie Smith really makes Cassandra and the other Mortmains come to life. Cassandra is one of the most likeable characters I have ever \\"read about\\", she is stubborn, funny and dislikes anything involving romance,[ in the sense of romance between to people.] Quirky and perceptive, Cassandra will always keep you smiling. Then there's beautiful Stephen who's in love with her, who she thinks of as a brother, her sister Rose, who attracts boys where ever she goes, Topaz, Cassandra's step-mother who's a part-time nude model and her eccentric father, who's been having writing block...for twelve years. Cassandra's younger brother Thomas plays a lesser role in the book, but he does help with some of Cassandra's schemes. I do have some qualms with the ending though, it was a strange ending- but at the same time, I loved the ending! I capture the castle is a delightful book....go out and buy it!! If you're Canadian it's pretty expensive for a paperback, but get it anyways, it's truly worth it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a really wonderful book for those with a whimsical, romantic, but unconservative bent. Seventeen year old Cassandra, along with her unusual family, lives in a chilly dilapitaded English castle. Though they live in poverty, the strength of their imaginations, wit, and sense of fun, prevents one from feeling their lives are lacking. Many scenes are infused with a subtle otherworldliness, as are some of the characters. The tale is filled with the tricks ones mind can play on itself when in love and even Cassandras sister Rose, so determined to marry her way out of poverty, finds she cannot ignore the real thing when it comes along. Though she tries. Oddly, as a female, I had a lot more empathy for the male characters. Especially the gentle love-sick Stephen. The characters, while not sophisticated, are something finer, more brilliant, and fresh. Nothing new or original is said about love in this story, but it does take the essence of coming of age, longing, and struggle, and infuses it with a pensive magic. To say anything more would deprive one of the delightful details of this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle can be summed up in only one word- delightful. This book will &quot;capture&quot; your heart with its engaging characters and charming plot. Cassandra Mortmain lives in a rundown castle with her father, stepmother, brother, and sister. Over the course of a few months, she intends to &quot;capture&quot; each person in the castle- describing his or her personality, opinions, and other interesting quirks. Reading this book reminded me of reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. The characters were just as likeable (or unlikeable) and the result was a story that shimmers like a fairy tale. My only complaints are as follows: a. The second half of the book gets a bit melodramatic at points, and you'll probably find yourself longing for the lighthearted wit from the beginning of the novel. and, b. The book is now over and I can't read it again for the first time.Read it once. Believe me, you will fall in love with Cassandra. She is literary heroine that I think I would actually want as a friend. How often can you say that about a book?"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Cassandra Mortmain is the middle child in an eccentric English family. Her father is a once-published, once-celebrated author who has had writer's block for years, and as a result, his wife and three children are on the brink of starvation, although they live in a crumbling, albeit leased, castle. They hope that their father will one day begin writing again, or that Cassandra's beautiful elder sister, Rose, will marry well and save them all.Enter the American Cotton brothers, who are wealthy and have just inherited the nearby estate of Scoatney, as well as the landlordship of the Mortmain's dwelling. Rose Mortmain and her stepmother see nothing but dollar signs as they scheme to marry Rose off to Simon, the eldest Cotton. But Cassandra has fallen for Simon herself...I was skeptical of this book because the cover was so outdated and plain. The story itself is set in the 1930's, but the book was published in 1948, and it seemed so dated. But once I started reading, I could scarcely put it down. This is classic English literature at its best, with a storyline that will pass from age to age without ever seeming old-fashioned. I highly recommend it and plan to keep my copy forever!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"(I save 10's for Dostoyevsky)This book is a dear, wonderful tale of life and love and intellectual exploration. It is the story of Cassandra and her sister Rose; their adventures in castle and great house and village of England; touching on London high society, the art world, Druidic rites, and an American dowager who collects creative types.When it opens, Cassandra and Rose are in dire poverty because their brilliant writer father is going through a long dry spell. Rose makes a wish by kissing a gargoyle 30 feet above their medieval kitchen for something to happen... anything! Of course her wish comes true. Enter Simon and Peter and many exciting events, including Cassandra being stranded penniless in London after midnight, and Rose being mistaken for an escaped circus bear.Reminiscent of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, with its daisy chain of infatuations, and peopled with delightfully real characters from the beautiful, gallant Steven to the bogus artist-model stepmother, this book is a joy to read from start to finish.

Cassandra Mortmain is witty and funny and makes you feel as if you are literally there with her in the castle. Some people may think it moves too slowly, but I think that is part of the charm. Every detail is \\"captured.\\" This has become one of my favorites! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE was recommended to me by an acquaintance when it became available a few years ago, in print after a long absence in the United States. It has become one of my favorite books not for it's depth or subject matter but for the shimmering state of existence it captures- that of a precocious girl becoming an intelligent young woman. Don't let the recent film adaptation prevent you from reading the book because its charm lies in the first person narration (something never captured in film) of Cassandra Mortmain. She chronicles her family's life in an old castle where her beautiful elder sister Rose chafes at her isolation and poverty, her father, the once promising author, continues to suffer from writer's block, his artist's model second wife, Topaz, makes the best of it, and the solid Stephen helps the family without pay. Their world is inevitably changed by the arrival of new American landlords and eligible bachelor brothers Simon and Neil Cotton.However what could become a trite romance or standard coming of age story is carefully avoided by the thoughtful honesty of its narrator tempered by the comedy of the situations and by a hint of the sadness that accompanies all change. I confess I have purchased eight copies of the book and given them to friends because of the transitory feeling it so accurately grasps. Set in the 1930's, the narration still feels fresh even if the social codes have changed. This is unlike Dodie Smith's famous work, 101 Dalmatians, though, it is perhaps more like her plays, indeed, she even wrote a stage version of I CAPTURE THE CASTLE. It is an imminently readable and enchanting book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This was easily the best thing I read in all of 2002, and I read a lot.

I read this book at least once a year, just to stay in touch, and i never, ever get tired of it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The first feeling is one of total surprise. I really did not expect such an entertaining modern book. Although this is a book that was published, as I understand in 1948, it is very modern and refreshing and seems to be dealing with issues relevant to young women in any time and place.What is mostly refreshing is the writing of Cassandra, the 17 year old narrator. Cassandra would like to be a writer one day and therefore writes this account. She writes candidly, vividly and with no need to impress herself or others. Cassandra is totally true to herself and the fact that the Dodie Smith chose this mechanism of diary writing as her narrating tool allows us to see Cassandra grow, mature and understand the world in front of our eyes. The descriptions are real, alive and very detailed. The story, which can be very simply described as a sort of love story is interesting due to the lovely characters. Cassandra which the reader knows inside and out, a person that likes human beings and nature alike. The beautiful rural English view comes alive through her eyes as well as the behaviours of the people surrounding her. Cassandra has an eye for detail and a natural way to catch all gestures (an example for this would be Cassandra's description of her sister Rose drinking the green Menthe drink which she chose on purpose as it matches her hair). We also have Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, beautiful and looking for a way to escape her poverty life, Thomas their younger brother, Stephan a servant son who has been living with the family, the father, a writer who does not write, and their stepmother, Topaz, a model for artists, full of good will and kindness. All these characters are presented as round figures, we see their good and bad qualities and this mixture, together with further characters makes this a superb book. Pure entertainment."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain lives a life of poverty is a crumbling castle in England.

When Rose becomes attracted to Simon she begins to come up with a plan that could bring the Mortmain family out of poverty. What is she marries Simon? As the book progresses Cassandra deals with all the issues of growing up: love, trust, finding faith, and learning to understand her family and friends.I have to admit the only reason I really read this book is because of JK Rowling's commentary of it on the cover. I learned quite quickly that I Capture the Castle was much different from Harry Potter. Written by Dodie Smith (who wrote 101 Dalmations which has been made into two movies by Disney) in the 1930s, I Capture the Castle manages to capture a young, charismatic narrator that you will fall in love with right away. Cassandra begins this book very much as a child but by the end she has not only &quot;captured the castle&quot; but has grown up into a sophisticated young woman. I very much enjoyed this book. There are a couple twists near the end that even I didn't expect to see. The characters are fascinating and very well drawn and it's written extremely well.

It's about 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain and her family, who live in an old ruined castle in England. Her father is a writer with severe writers block, but who wrote an obscure book, which was one of the most important books of that generation. This book is about her experiences, going from poverty to wealth, from loneliness to love, from complete estrangement from her father to a daughter again. Written as a sort of journal, it chronicles her life for what seems to be about a year. It is written beautifully, very expressively, and to me seems to have an ethereal quality. Some characters are well thought out, and necessarily deep, whereas some, such as Mrs Cotton, are just small, sometimes comedic, sometimes more sombre, pencil-sketches.Cassandra lives through desparate poverty, her father's mood swings, her sister's love affair, falling in love herself, her step-mother's odd habits and rituals, the &quot;hired&quot; help's love for her, and records all of it in hindsight, often with amazing insight and maturity, while maintaining the voice of a 17 year old.This book, to my mind, brings back images of the novels I read when I was young - narrative, and with seemingly no other deeper messages to convey. It is the type of book that I can imagine a mother giving a daughter to read. It is wonderfully innocent, and yet delightfully ravishing to the senses.

Cassandra is the second daughter of what would be called today, a one hit wonder, a writer whose only, and only moderately successful book was followed by a period of writer's block which lasted for many years. She lives with her father, elder sister, younger brother and step mother in a 14 th century castle, a mouldering ruin with crumbling brick work and damp walls which looks romantic and like something from a fairy tale but is, in reality, far from comfortable in any way. The family lives in poverty with barely enough to eat and only a few items of clothing left on their backs. When the new owners of the castle return from the US to take up their inheritance, the family plots to marry off the elder and prettier sister to the heir to the estate, as they are literally starving and prepared to resort to any means of getting money. It was an enjoyable read which has been made into a movie which I would be very interested in seeing."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"how can you not love the opening line(you'll just have to read it)? it creates an understanding and caring for the main character, like few other novels. this delightful book also deals with family, painful writer's block, slight insanity, society's views, wanting more, poverty, coming-of-age and love. although the characters are flawed (just how i want them, don't give me perfection), you love them and cheer for them. this is an enjoyable book which i recommend."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Dear Older women, please don't let the negative reviews of this book convince you that it is a teenage love story! yes the heroin is 17, this is a charming story of a very crazy family. my very dear friend is well over 50 and she adores it! this is not a very sophisticated book, so please don't dislike it because of high expectations. aproach this story with none and you will be pleased with the result"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"First of all, this book is done in a journal format. However, please dont let this deter you from reading it. I thought I would really dislike the style, but you will hardly notice it once you start the book. The book has a good pace to it, its definitely a leisurely summer read. The main character is Seventeen-year-old Cassandra. Throughout the book she has do deal not only with her crazy family, but also first love. My favorite thing about the book is that it really goes against the perception of many young girls today that all your problems get fixed if you get married, but it doesnt rub your nose in it either. Cassandra's sister is one such girl, and its a nice comparison to see how Cassandra handles her problems compared to how her sister hopes to handle them. I highly recommend this book, it has beautiful language and a wonderful setting, a castle in england. There are no bad scenes in the book, nor bad language. Both young and old will find the book very delightful."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What a thoroughly enjoyable book.

I was surprised to find it so overwhelmingly positively reviewed as it is long and I thought it might seem dated to new readers but I am delighted to be proved wrong. It spent so long out of print (my copy was my mothers) and I wonder who finally bit the bullet and put it back in print. May they be rewarded with great sales!

The library didn't have it but amazingly I found it on Kijiji for $2.I was very excited about this book and this is why I am so disappointed. I've been reading patiently, waiting for the story and not just descriptions of minor events, and finally, at the end of the second of Cassandra's journals something happens. Great, here we go, I thought relieved (I really wanted this book to get good as I had already invested some time in it). But no, that event sort of implodes, and looks like we're back to more descriptions of Cassandra's strange (and not very likeable to me) family. I don't know, maybe I am five pages away from something happening again, but I don't care anymore. I don't even like Cassandra all that much. I think I'm a little tired of quirky, beautiful-but-not-in-an-obvious-way female characters. I just read \\"Winter's Bone\\" and liked the main character Ree (17 years old) so much more."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"When I first began reading I Capture the Castle, it was simply out of pure boredom. As i read further, I began to understand the concepts of Cassandra's writing and relate to some of her feelings. The life of England in the 1930's is most astounding from Cassandra's point of view. I found myself transported into her world, imagining what was happening, having mental pictures of the characters. I am happy to say that in my mind, I have a slight knowledge of all the characters and what they really are to look like.This is an absolutly brilliant book that is beautifully written.

But I suppose that is the way of things, as different people fell in love with other people throughout the book. The best part of this novel - aside from its all-over dreamy, magical feel (&amp; no, there is no magic in this book, it is just the feeling) - is the characters. Wonderfully unique, and very real, you find yourself caring for them, despite their faults, as people close to you. And I adored the concept of her father's novel, ingenous. But most of all, this novel let me meet Cassandra and that is by far the most wonderful gift of all. What an enchanting character. Yes, buy this book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I fell in love with this book from the very first chapter. It's funny, poignant and creates such a vivid picture of Cassandra's family and castle that you never forget them.

You will never forget it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is the most wonderfully enchanting story! I first read this book when I was 12 or 13, a Book of the Month Club selection from the 1940's that belonged to my grandmother. I have probably read it least 50 times since then (I am now 47). I would love to find another old volume of this book as mine is lovingly worn. I was so delighted when I found out that it was being reprinted. I have purchased a new copy and recommend it to all of my friends. It is wonderfully written and Cassandra Mortmain has captured my heart for all time. Was there ever a sequel written? Did Cassandra love Simon for all time? Did Simon ever return that love? And what of Rose and Neil? Did they live happily ever after? How I wish I knew; I have wondered all my life. I wish I could thank Miss Smith personally for her lovely story that has brought me so much happiness."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I chose this book as I enjoyed Dodie Smith's book for children- especially 'the Twilight Barking'.

A nice promise - yet not delivered.Three stars, all for them for the first part of the book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"With blurbs from authors like J.K. Rowling and a huge following I was so excited to read I Capture The Castle. It promised to be a romance from another time, filled with whimsy and spunk and all that other good stuff they had in the mid-thirties. There was even an old-castle and a, possibly haunted, tower! All of the ingredients seemed to be there. Unfortunately I think I built my expectations up a bit more than I should have. It wasn't that I hated this book, in fact there were things I really loved about it. Let's start with those shall we? First of all I loved the style it was written in. The story is told through our main character, Cassandra's, journals. Her genuine and lovable voice lends itself well to the story as she describes her life living in a crumbling old castle with her eccentric family. Although she has seen years of poverty and neglect thanks to her writer father, she loves her family and enjoys life at the castle. Cassandra starts out as such an up-beat character. She sees the good in life and strives to see everyday as a new adventure. Along with Cassandra, there is an entire cast of lovable, if flawed, characters. There's her father, who hasn't written a word in 12 years but continues to lock himself away in his office each day, her stepmother (who insists her given name is Topaz and likes to dance naked in the rain), her older sister Rose, who is the definition of a drama queen and the two new Americans who have moved into the mansion down the road bringing an air of mystery and suspense along with them. The first half of the book was full of adventure and intrigue with these characters and I ate it up. I was sure that I would love them forever and that this would be a favorite book. Then things got messy.Now, I'm not talking about conflict. There's plenty of that from the beginning. Mostly what I'm referring to are the love triangles (yes multiple). I could have tolerated one, but everyone seemed to be in love with the wrong person and this was the main plot device for the majority of the book. Not only was it confusing, it was frustrating as hell. Everyone was going around being as selfish and stupid as possible with no concern for anyone or anything else and I just sat there wanting to throw the book at my wall. By the time I got to the ending I was so exhausted and upset that I didn't even really care what happened. No, that's not true, I did still care, but then Dodie Smith had to go and make sure that no one ended up where I wanted them too. I realize that Ms. Smith didn't do this as a personal affront to me, but it sure felt that way. I won't say that I hated this book, because I didn't. I could have even loved it if it weren't for so much nonsense in the middle. I could have dealt with the ending too, but I was so worn out that all I felt was frustration. So I'm giving this one three stars because the setting, characters and the beginning were all great. It just didn't quite live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I enjoy reading historical fiction and England is one of my favorite places to read about. Throwing a castle in was just icing on the cake. Well written and engaging."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a reputed classic, which it took me some effort to land on the Kindle. It was reputedly revised endless times before publication, and is supposed to have been the Great Hope of its author. It is well-written, if well-written = very smooth, fairly clear transitions, strong narrative voice, memorable setting and characters. The central trope, the Young Girl's Bildungsroman, has been around since *LIttle Women* and *What Katy Did*, and it seems rather obvious that the writer has gone for Oddest Version of the Young Girl Possible, a competition very evident in some of the (English) YA i've recently read - Joan Aiken's Dido Twite, Eva Ibbotson's Countesses, for-ex, but happening in a lot of other places too. If your Young Girl isn't odd, it seems she isn't interesting.Cassandra Mortmain certainly comes across as odd, from her opening sentence, written ostensibly sitting in the kitchen sink, but then her whole family appears odd, from her reputed genius novelist father to her supposedly gold-digging sister, and their Castle is even odder. There's another recent narrative solution present - the arrival before an impoverished English family of some Rich, Young, Handsome Americans - Pride and Prejudice for the Post-War Period. *Castle* does present the husband-chasing of at least one Mortmain girl more unabashedly than Austen did, though of course, that turns out to have been a mistake, and she actually elopes with somebody else, while the protagonist/narrator (sort of) captures the main matrimonial prize.Cassandra's whimsical voice, poverty-stricken circumstances and general comedy of weirdness are taking generally, but I'm glad the ending has an unexpected twist, because by then I was thoroughly out of charity with the book over its treatment of the other Competing but Utterly Ineligible Suitor. This is the young Englishman who's been living with the family, trading his orphaned lack of hearth or kin for playing general dogsbody while mooning after Cassandra. It's made plain from square one that he is Not Suitable - a sudden and very ugly extrusion of classism that is startling in this context.Unlike Simon the Gooseboy in Aiken's Willoughby Chase books, however, Stephen never apotheosizes into a nobleman and discovers an ancestral heritage. Instead, after attempting to serve Cassandra as devotedly as a dog, he's treated like one. He's very handsome, so eventually a fast lady photographer takes him off to photograph (and possibly seduce) and then introduces him into filmdom. Whereupon the Mortmains let him pack up his little chest - given to him but a non-Mortmain - leave his squalid little Castle room, and, despite his even having travelled clear up to London to help Cassandra in extremis over her American, walk out of their lives without so much as a Thank you, let alone any more concrete keepsake.I personally was so angry over the way Stephen was treated, by both characters and author, that this book went very close to bottoming out on my review scale. Classism is to be expected in Austen (who seldom shows it because the really Lower Classes never behave like humans in her work) but what's it doing in somebody writing after WWII? Especially as blatant and unremarked as this lot.Wherefore, so far as I'm concerned, Miss Cassandra Mortmain may have captured the castle but all she captured from me was a large helping of disgust."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Now that I've reread this, I can honestly say I am still in love with it. I first read I Capture the Castle when I was about Cassandra's age, and it spoke to me on such a deep, personal level. Years and years have gone by since, but a new book club gave me the opportunity to read it again... and I shall be forever grateful.Dodie Smith created such a magnificent piece of wonder when she wrote this. Being (much) older than the first time I read it, I feel like I can sympathize more with Rose and everything she goes through... and causes to happen. I think I remember hating her for being such a heartless wretch of a human being during my first read. Now, I can commiserate with her despair and wanting to help out her family, even at the cost of marrying someone she doesn't love. Stephen, on the other hand, remains a character I feel kind of sorry for. He's so devoted to Cassandra. When he finally realizes she doesn't and will never love him the way he would want her to, he is devastated, but he accepts it eventually. He just wants her to be happy, even if that means she ends up with someone else. Stephen really shines at that point, in my opinion. He finally takes control of his own life and makes decisions for himself. I know I definitely prefer this Stephen over the lovesick puppy hoping for attention. Topaz also shone more the second time around. I fear I felt she was just a silly woman with no real substance to her at first. She really is a strong and brave character and she is quite selfless, though a little eccentric. I did find myself getting quite upset with Mr. Mortmain. It made me angry that his loving family was being practically ignored and forced to live in such horrible poverty. I believe he should have sucked it up and helped support his family... taken responsibility for their misfortunes. Stupid man.During the book club, it was much talked about and despised that nothing really resolved itself. Cassandra didn't get to be with Simon. Rose and Neil got a happy ending, but still. Does Mr. Mortmain ever finish his book? Does Stephen go on to be a famous actor? Does Simon ever get over his heartbreak, forget Rose and embrace Cassandra? So many questions, but only an open-ended story to tease you. Frankly, I love the open end. I know full well what I imagine happens to these characters and I think the author was quite right in giving the reader an opportunity to create it. I suppose it would have been nice to have confirmation, but then it wouldn't feel genuine, in my opinion. Cassandra is more or less content with where her story ends, so why shouldn't we, right? I mean, not everything gets tied up in a neat bow in real life. Cassandra, being the intelligent, brave girl that she is, knows this.Also during our book club meeting, there were complaints about too much scenery talk. Personally, being an extremely visual person, I loved it. I guess I'm just a different kind of reader from those in my group. Also, I thought it went well with the format of the novel. Cassandra wants to be a writer and she's writing a journal as a way to practice. Naturally, she is going to write about what she knows, hence why there is so much about the castle itself. You can also see her mature through her writing so much of what surrounds her. Our heroine really does find her voice and is able to \\"capture the castle\\" quite perfectly.I Capture the Castle is a beautifully written coming-of-age story that is sure to continue to be as relevant today as it has been since its publication in 1948. I simply love this novel!A favorite quote: \\"The thought came to me that perhaps it is the loving that counts, not the being loved in return - that perhaps true loving can never know anything but happiness.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"It certainly isn't a bodice ripper. The characters are pleasant people and the main character grows from teenager to an intelligent and caring young woman while doing everything she can to help her father, step-mother (no, not evil), sister, brother and adopted brother without hurting anyone."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I started this book and then put it down for months. I finally picked it up a couple of days ago and could hardly put it down at all. It is delightful! But oh, I wish it would have continued. I wish there was a second book to continue Cassandra's story. This is a lovely, lovely, laugh-out-loud book that touched my heart so much!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a classic coming of age story with a memorable, loveable heroine. If I'd read this when I was fourteen I would have grown up loving Casandra Mortmain just as much as Jo Marsh or Elizabeth Bennett. Her first-person narration is both laugh-out-loud funny and innocently heartbreaking at the same time. A bit Jane Eyre and a bit Pride and Prejudice, Smith uses the elements of both the gothic novel and the comedy of mannors to unique effect. The subtle criticisms of modern art and literature that are woven throughout the story are both funny and true. More importantly, I couldn't put this book down and was sorry when it was over. The characters are memorable and their world is enchanting. It's feminist and romantic at the same time. And the ending, without giving anything away, is absolutely perfect. This is the rare book I've read as an adult that feels as if it's always been a favorite. So glad to have discovered it now!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Warm, wise and witty, a lovely (and quite funny) story of young love in a crumbling English castle. The voice is delightful and although I was, as I began reading, a bit concerned about the diary-entry structure, I needn't have been. Suits perfectly. And it made me want to drink lots of tea, which is always a bonus. Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Wow- I loved this story from the very beginning to the last page. Cassandra is one of those great characters and I loved reading her journals. The story begins with Cassandra's family in poverty, her father wrote an important book many years ago and has not written anything since. The family is out of money and hope when they get a new owner to the castle they rent. The new owner, Simon, is a rich, handsome young man who comes to visit the family with his brother Neil. After a bad start the brothers come to enjoy spending time with Cassandra's family and Simon falls in love with Cassandra's beautiful sister Rose.The story follows Cassandra through many difficulties including dealing with Stephen, the boy who has loved her for a very long time, helping her father get through his writer's block, supporting her sister, and finding her own way through the feelings of first love. It is a delightful story told with humor, insight, and love by a very intelligent 17 year old girl.The setting of the old, crumbling castle is perfect and the characters are entertaining. Cassandra's father gives a whole new meaning to the word eccentric! I would highly recommend this delightful coming-of-age story, it was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this Brit lit coming of age story more than the 2nd half. The unique narrative voice of the character Cassandra is very intelligent and charming throughout. The resourcefulness of the Mortmain family living in poverty and need in a crumbling castle was related in a humorous way. However, the fact can't be ignored that they are living in poverty and want because their one-hit wonder author father has not produced any source of income in quite some time, and appears to have no motivation to do so. Although most of the characters are flawed in some way, some of the father's flaws are a bit darker in nature.The book was written at a time when women had few options to make their way in life, and some of the character's motivations and attitudes reflect that. From a more modern perspective, some of the character's attitudes were a bit grating at times. This is especially true of sister Rose's desperation to marry for material security, and her utter lack of any other skills other than singing or looking pretty.There was at least one part that I found laugh out loud funny involving a foiled attempt to evade a social encounter, some old beaver and bear furs, a case of mistaken identity, and a pitchfork. That alone was worth the read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This charming, old-fashioned novel is by the author of &quot;101 Dalmations.&quot; I enjoyed it greatly and feel that it would be most appreciated by romantic teenage girls and ladies who remember it from their childhood. It is a sweet tale of a family very similar in nature to the family in George S. Kaufmann's &quot;You Can't Take It With You.&quot;However, I did find the plotline regarding the lovelives of the sisters to be trite and taken directly from the melodramas of the 1930's and 40's. It is a sweet book, but there isn't anything new or unexpected in the story."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I thought this book was truly wonderful, even if the ending was a bit sudden. This is a story about two young women who live in an old castle with their father Mortmain-who was a writer, untill he went to jail-, and their step-mother Topaz-who was a model for artists. The story takes place near London. I'm sure any ambituos young reader will like!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and then reread it so often that I almost knew it off by heart. I love everything about it, the eccentric characters, the strong visual images, the hints at sexuality, the wonderful, mysterious fantasy world that you can escape into. I too imagined it as a film, or TV series (I'd be the director and could choose the cast). I've loved reading all the other reviews, they brought back so many good memories. Thank you everyone. I lost my book about 20 years ago, but am going to buy another asap. I can't wait to read it again (and again)!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"&quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy. I can't say that I'm really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiriting-- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that wasn't a very good poem. I have decided my poetry is so bad that I musn't write any more of it.&quot;So opens &quot;I Capture the Castle,&quot; an absolutely delightful story by Dodie Smith, who is also the author of &quot;101 Dalmations,&quot; popularized by Disney's film adaptations. Dodie was born and raised in England (a fact that is rather evident from this tale!), but wrote &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; in the '40's while living in America. For some reason, ICtC has been out of print for many years. I join many of the literary populace in their cheers of gratefulness for the recent re-print!&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen-year-old aspiring writer, who lives with her family in a rapidly deteriorating castle in the middle of the English countryside. ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a STORY, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her exceedingly truthful comments about the people her life kept me constantly in stiches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published-author; a man who everyone considers quite brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's excentric step-mother, though young enough to be a sister. She is a nude modelist and engages in all sorts of interesting romps, including &quot;communining with nature&quot; at midnight, also in the buff! Rose, Cassandra's sister, is a lamentable character, and Thomas, her brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen, family man-of-all-work; and the Cotton Brothers, a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh impossible!If you want something quick, light, and humorous, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a VERY good time with &quot;I Capture the Castle.&quot;"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read this based on two or three articles in the press and was somewhat hesitant about it on that basis -- after all, hype is never trustworthy. However, like so many other reviewers, I was delighted once I began reading. Age tends to teach us that love and art do not respond according to plan and Cassandra's experience is a charming reminder of what it is to be seventeen and just learning that lesson for the first time. I do wish I'd found it as an adolescent. This is an unsung delight. Buy it for a young girl you know and keep a hardcover copy on your own shelf."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I've been re-reading &quot;I Capture The Castle&quot; for more than 25 years. It's one of the books of which I have to keep two copies: one to lend to friends, and one to keep safely on my nightstand. The prose is delicate without being unbearably sweet, the story is a constant delight, and Cassandra's dry humor is perfect. I can't imagine a life of the mind without this book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I thought until I met Cassandra that I was the only sixteen year old girl who'd ever fallen in love with a 28 year old man who liked the same books she did.

I had never heard of it before, but thought that with all these great reviews it would be worth a try. It was. Wonderful characters, interesting plot - a great coming-of-age story. I enjoyed particularly Casssandra's father, although I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed his books! I wondered if the fact that it was written in 1948 when the British were still enduring rationing has anything to do with the many descriptions of food and clothing which were written with real longing."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful book that will be enjoyed by girls and women of all ages. I've just discovered the book now but I know that I would have loved to have it as a companion during my teenage years. One aspect of the novel that I enjoyed was the contrast between British and American customs and behavior. I'm so grateful that this classic has been rediscovered and reissued."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I have been reading this book for over 30 years. There is something about it so magical, and yet so earthy, that I always come away from it with something new. Although set in '30's England, the characters face situations and troubles with which we can all identify and in particular, Cassandra, the narrator of the book goes through adolescent angst so poignantly that you just want to sit with her in the castle window seat and be her friend through it all. I heartily recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who cherishes good books with characters you wish were real."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful book that is about a seventeen year old girl named Cassandra. She and her family live in a large castle in England though they are very poor. She finds her life exciting yet dull. When two American men come it seems cassandra's life is going to change as well as her sister Rose's. This book is in the form of Cassandra's journal and is split up into three parts. While reading the book you fall in love w/ or get annoyed with each character. You want to be them, meet them , or just become friends with them. For me it kept me guessing till the end. Does she love him? Will they get together? What will happen to them? You soon feel like you know the charachters personally. I admit after finishing the book I was a bit frusturated. It seemed it didn't end how I wanted it too. But after going over it in my head multiple times I sooned realized why it makes it so good. It shows that you can't always make someone love you and you can't make yourself love some one. I recommend this book. It is a great read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read this book after seeing the film starring Romola Garai as Cassandra and Bill Nighy (yes, he who plays the ageing rock star in \\"Love Actually\\") as the father suffering writer's block.Author Dodie Smith, (also of the classic \\"101 Dalmatians\\"!) had transplanted herself with her husband in California, at the height of her fame in England. As World War II broke and rumbled on, she longed for London. Writing this book was an expiation of her nostalgia.The novel's title is the triumphant declaration of the book's narrator, dispossessed wannabe writer Cassandra. In fact, it is author Smith who \\"captures\\" the angst of her young heroines, class warfare, tension between Transatlantic neighbours and especially of the England of the 1930s that she missed.Apart from the luminous romance, two of the characters are concerned with writing. Young narrator/protagonist Cassandra ambitiously works through her story in ever-more-expensive notebooks. By contrast, her unproductive father cannot reproduce his early creative form.It's a good story in the Jane Austen comedy-of-manners tradition, with a little sexiness of DH Lawrence mixed in, and the down-at-heel feeling of, e.g., Cold Comfort Farm\\". The compulsive beginning immediately establishes Cassandra, the writing motive, and engages our sympathy: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What a wonderful book! Cassandra Mortmain, the young narrator, writes this a journal that takes place over six months, while she works on her writing. But this never feels like a journal, instead it is well-written,and joyful, with all the melodrama one would expect from a teenage girl. The Mortmains have been living in poverty in a castle in England, because after Father was released from a three-month stint in jail, after the \\"cake-knife incident\\" in their neigborhood, he wanted to live in the country. They had been living on the profits of his first and famous book, \\"Jacob Wrestling,\\" but he has a serious case of writer's block, eccentricity, and questions are raised about his sanity. With little income, their home is falling apart, many of their belonging have been sold off for food, we watch their fortunes change when Neil and Simon Cotton move in next door. Cassandras's sister, Rose, her brother, Timothy, stepmother, Topaz, and the lovesick Stephen all live in the castle, interesting people all. Throw in the wealthy Cottons who move in next door, and we add love and engagements, Simon loves Rose, Rose doesn't love Simon, Neil hates Rose, and Cassandra of course, loves Simon. There are many more interesting characters who do not overshadow the plot while we watch Cassandra change during the course of her journal. Fabulous story!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is the delightful story of 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmaine, who records in a series of journals what could be an ordinary life of a young girl teaching herself how to write. But instead the narrator develops an extraordinary coming-of-age-fairy tale set in a deteriorating castle outside London. We explore sibling relationships, parent-child relationships and the powerful feelings associated with first love.Filled with a cast of well drawn characters who are both down-to-earth and sublimely eccentric, I was captivated from page one by Cassandra's charming innocence. It can easily be compared to Jane Austen's work and now fifty-five years in print, it's appropriate to label it a classic.

The arrival of Americans turn the family's focus from their dire finnancial crisis to matters of the heart.This book is essentially about Cassandra's journey from childhood to adulthood, yet I found other aspects of the book to be very profound and thought provoking. At the same time, I laughed often whilst turning the pages, and smiled at the beautiful way Cassandra has captured not only the castle, but also members of her family and entertaining incidents.

Well, I absolutely adored this book and its characters--laughing out loud at the bear coat scene and crying inconsolably at the last words the narrator writes. Others here have said more about the plot, but all I can say if you love Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, Little Women or any books that feature strong-willed, quirky girl-women, you will adore this book. Give it to your friends, too. And I hope it's true that they are making a film of this, since it should revive interest in the book.

Her unique, spiritied family, the Mortmains, struggle daily with poverty, having little to eat.There's her eccentric father, James, an hermit-like ex-writer who has a huge case of writer's block. There is Cassandra's sister Rose, a vain beauty who longs for riches and something more in her life. Then there is her stepmother, Topaz, a towheaded artist's model who likes to play her lute and commune with nature (walk around outdoors naked with the elements). Lastly, there is the god-like beauty Stephen (but Cassandra says his expression is \\"a bit daft\\"), who helps around the house and is totally in love with Cassandra.Our heroine records events with wit, honesty, and cozy warmth. The Mortmain family meets the sons of the late Mr. Cotton, the rich landlord, Simon and Neil Cotton. Soon Cassandra's life and the lives of those around her begin to change. Rose becomes engaged to Simon Cotton. But does she actually love him? Rose had once told her sister that she would do anything to help her family out of the poverty they are in.Cassandra is a wonderful girl coming into her own, witty and likeable up to the very last word. I really identified with her, as a teenaged girl. This book may not deliver your standard happy ending (we never know who Cassandra really ends up with relationship-wise), but will certainly deliver a wonderful reading experience. It is a good book to simply curl up with."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I found \\"I Capture the Castle\\" in the attic of an estate sale in 1953 at age eleven. Since then I've read it AT LEAST every two years; you do the math. I've probably given out twenty copies, always telling the prospective reader that she will be hooked after the first page, if not the first sentence. You can imagine my delight when the book was rediscovered and republished several years ago. There is a British version of the paperback that includes fascinating background information on Dodie Smith. She had moved from Britain to California with her husband, a screenwriter and a pacifist, in the early days of WWII. She longed for \\"home\\" and the innocent time before the war. Thus writing \\"I Capture the Castle\\" was a labor of love. Well, it's not a labor to read-- infectious, clever, funny, romantic, surprising. The movie version is not half-bad, but the book is ten times better!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Not many people know that British writer Dodie Smith produced more than children's beloved \\"101 Dalmatians\\". \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is probable her second most famous book -- although one may wonder if it doesn't deserve the title of her most famous work. Largely known as narrative produced for young girls, this one goes much beyond its target reader. \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a book that may be read and appreciated by women and men alike, no matter how old they are.A romantic comedy, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" keeps the light tone most of the time -- albeit it flirts with the Gothic novel sometimes. After all, the main characters have an old and abandoned castle in their backyard. The castle is as Gothic as it could be with gargoyles and towers falling apart.But Cassandra, the witty nave narrator, never leaves the castle to be the center of the action. Dutifully she is the raison d'tre of the book. She is a young girl, daughter of an ex-famous writer that hasn't produced anything since his first novel. She lives with her father, stepmother, older sister and Stephen -- the son of their deceased maid --in a house adjoined the castle. They lead a poor life -- actually a money, food and joyless one. Until the day two young and handsome heirs arrive. They come to claim the castle that once belonged to their grandfather.But don't expect the ordinary from Smith's quills. Contrary to the \`natural' order, Cassandra's family do not battle against the heirs for the castle. Again, against all odds, the stepmother is not the incarnation of evil -- actually she is a good friend of the two girls. The writer only brings to the novel ideas that would unfold in a clich&eacute;d way and then subvert all of them.This is the biggest pleasure in reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\". The book is a narrative of sweet subversion -- so is the young narrator. A delightful voice, Cassandra has been praised as one of the best young female narrators ever (J. K. Rowling seems to agree). Extremely well developed, one may take this novel for an autobiography sometimes, rather than fiction. Her moral, intellectual and romantic dilemmas are real and interesting.With \\"I Capture the Castle\\" Smith produced a novel of touching and tender subversion -- funny sometimes, sad other times, but real all the time. Something that is already a reason to praise a book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"When I first found this book I was on vacation, looking for something to read. I was drawn to the book, maybe by its interesting cover, or the fact that it has been praised by the author of my favorite book series, Harry Potter. After picking up the book and reading the back cover I thought, why not, sounds good enough.I started reading the book and yes, it was a little slow at first. But usually once I start a book, even a seemingly boring one, I try to finish it. I can't be exactly sure when I really started getting into the book, perhaps it was the introduction of the Cottons, but soon after I couldn't stop. After I finished, I recommended it to everyone I knew.Cassandra is a character, in my opinion, many girls can relate to; mainly being in the shadow of an older sibling, and living in a castle was a fantasy of everyone at some point or anotherI highly recommend this book to teens and old alike.

I thought I'd read all of the cozy, well-written, pastoral English novels that exist ... and then I found this novel. I read it in three days flat and mourned that it didn't last longer. The characters are vivid and real and the dialogue sparkles ... it's like a modern Jane Austen but with a touch more action and with beautiful visual descriptions of the English countryside. If you love Anne of Green Gables or Elizabeth Bennett or Jane Eyre or Betsy Ray, you'll adore Cassandra: she has the perfect blend of spunk, ingenuity, and pensiveness. I adored this book. I'll never get tired of it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle was a truly delightful book. Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving. The book is a little dated, and the naivet&eacute; of Cassandra sometimes takes one by surprise, but don't let that stop you from reading this book, because you will miss a lovely story."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"A short while I discovered this enjoyable book, now back in print. I sat down and devoured it in a day or two. Cassandra is a teenage girl growing up in England in the 1930's. Her family has moved to a ramshackle castle, where they live in poverty, or near to it. The story is her enchanting diary, in which she records her thoughts, hopes, and wishes candidly and clearly. Cassandra is a very likeable character, as she is by no means perfect, and is honest about her imperfections; at the same time, she keeps trying to be the type of person that will make her family proud. Well worth the read, for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I found out about this book from a small catalog and bought it with my fingers crossed. And I was very impressed! Smith's character Cassandra captures the castle and the people living in it with cleverness and thoughtfulness that I could only hope to possess. She is a wonderful heroine - maybe not beautiful like her sister Rose, but she knows what she wants (at least in the end) and has a way of talking right to the reader so you can identify with her. Simon and Neil Cotton characters bring more humor to the book and bring out the Mortmain family, as seen from outsiders. Another strong point besides the characters was the foreshadowing that keeps one wanting to read on and on without stopping. Some parts, especially the &quot;life lesson&quot; at the end, were a little predictable, but that doesn't take very much away from this excellent story. I recommend I Capture the Castle to young adults and older adults who enjoy romance and fantasy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This truly is a classic. Written in 1948, I Capture the Castle is a marvelous book about mid-20th century England. It is written in the form of a young woman's journal entries over the span of a couple of months, March to October. The Mortmain's are poor and hungry, though they live in a castle; it is mostly empty because they had to sell most of their belongings for money. Cassandra's father became famous for a brief time in the past with the writing of his book, but has since then stopped writing and acquired very strange behavior. Cassandra's mother passed away when she was very young.One day everything changes when two young men come to the castle. Rose takes a great interest in one of them, Simon, and he eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Cassandra knows, however, that her sister is marrying him for the wrong reasons: she only wants the money, for herself and for her family. Cassandra becomes quite upset and it is soon learned that she herself is in love with Simon!This book is written with wit, beauty, and the words flow so easily. It is impossible not to love the characters and the story. In the end, Cassandra truly captures the readers heart with her heartfelt and sincere entries. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is the depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring -- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. \\"This is the story of the Mortmain family, in all their wonderful eccentricity. It is told by Cassandra Mortmain, youngest girl of the family, and aspiring writer, as she tries to \\"capture the castle\\". She lives with her family in an old English castle. The father, known only as Mortmain, was a famous writer. His one novel, was very successful, especially in the United States. But he has been suffering from writer's block every since....and is a tad bit on the crazy side. With no income for years, the family is basically dirt poor, having sold off all their valuable possessions just to have enough food to live on. They live with Mortain's second wife, Topaz, an artist's model and extremely free-spirit who exists only to be her husband's muse. And hasn't been able to accomplish it. The eldest sister, Rose, is self-centered at best. She hates being poor. Hates it with a passion, and would do just about anything to marry someone with money. Youngest child, Thomas, is just a schoolboy, but remarkable insightful. And rounding out the motley bunch, is Stephen. Stephen is the son of their former housekeeper. When she passed away, Stephen stayed on with the family. He's exceptionally handsome, though Cassandra finds him a bit \\"daft\\" (of course, he thinks the sun rises and sets on her!)Things change very little in the Mortmain castle until the day the Cotton's move into Scoatney. The Cotton's are Americans who have inherited the estate, and with that become the new landlords to the Mortmains. Simon, as the eldest brother, is the actual heir to the land and in essence, the \\"wealthy\\" one. Neil, the younger more carefree brother wants to return to America to become a cattle rancher. Rose, in her desperation to get out of the poverty that has struck her family, decides that she is hopelessly in love with Simon and will do just about anything to get him to propose to her. And since Simon is rather scholarly, he and his mother are taken with Mortmain. Fans of his writing, they try to get him over his writer's block.The story is told in journal format by Cassandra, who is sweet and gentle and kind. She's also smart as a whip and devoted to her family. Cassandra, in a word, is delightful! I usually tend to root for the more brash characters. But there is just something so endearing about Cassandra. \\"And that was all she ever did talk about it -- that was almost the worst part of the gloom, our not talking naturally. Never have I felt so separate from her. And I regret to say that there were moments when my deep and loving pity for her merged into a desire to kick her fairly hard. For she is a girl who cannot walk her troubles off, or work them off; she is a girl to sit around and glare.\\" \\"That evening of the row was our lowest depths; miserable people cannot afford to dislike each other. Cruel blows of fate call for extreme kindness in the family circle.\\" Cassandra is level-headed and wise beyond her years. She is charming and refreshingly honest in all her writings.Rose drove me crazy though. She is vain and self-centered and annoying. And even though she tried to justify that her marrying Simon would help the family as a whole, she really was in it only for herself. She was obnoxious and the type of woman that sat back waiting for someone to give her something. The Cinderella waiting to be rescued by the Prince, instead of the Belle, who was out there doing the rescuing. And that just drove me crazy! But, in truth, it's how the character is written and Smith definitely did a great job in making me dislike her immensely!Each character was so thoroughly fleshed out. It's like you actually knew the people that were being written about. And you cared what happened to them. I can't remember the last time I was so taken with the characters in a book. And I can't even begin to pick a favorite. Aside from Rose, each character has some strange but endearing qualities. And I loved them all!! A timeless story that will last forever, this is one book that I'm truly a better person for having read! A 100% definite 5-Star Rating!!! Will surely land on my list of favorite novels!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I probably read this book 5 times while I was a pre-teen and teen-ager.

As an adult I looked in every bookstore I entered, trying to locate a copy of it to see if it was as good as I remembered. When I finally found one I had a wonderful reunion with the Mortmain family!

The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door, it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parentsI served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I absolutely adore this book.

After an excellent first half, it gradually descends into a morass of puppy-love.The picture that this book \\"captures\\" of the social possibilities for girls in the 1950's is devastating."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra, a 17 year old girl living in a decrepit castle in England in the 1930's. It's told through her journal entries, which she writes not so much to tell the events of the day, but more to practice her writing because her author father (who hasn't written in years) was highly critical of the last piece that she showed him.As the reviews on the cover of the book claim, Cassandra is a very charismatic narrator. It is difficult to dislike her, though there were several points where I did truly want to. Her excitement for things is infectious, as is the romanticism of the castle in which she lives. Her endeavors to improve her writing lead to a very interesting and sometimes moving story.The main problem that I had with the story was actually something that was done well. The characterization was excellent, making it very believable that it was a young woman writing about family and friends that she has known for some time. They were well fleshed-out and seemed like real people. The problem that I had was that they seemed like real people that I just didn't like and at times that detracted from my reading pleasure.While I did find I Capture the Castle to be enjoyable for the most part, my dislike of the characters hampered that enjoyment. I found Rose to be very shallow, as was Cassandra, and I honestly wanted to see them foiled in their quest for husbands. I have little tolerance for people who are upset about their circumstances but don't do anything to change them, so the constant moping in the Mortmain household grated on my nerves after a while. I know that it was a different time, and perhaps that was more appropriate action then, but it was annoying to see all the women there so weak and unable or unwilling to do anything to improve their situation.The plot was also so much based around their desires to improve their situation that I had a small bit of trouble with it as well, but it was cleverly done, and there were enough side plots that I wasn't too overwhelmed by Cassandra and Rose's attempts to improve their position through marriage.I did find this book to be an interesting look into a different time period. I enjoyed reading about the idiosyncrasies that Cassandra focused on, as well as things about the village life and the castle itself. I also found the attempts to get Cassandra's father to write to be highly entertaining, particularly the last way they tried. I also enjoyed the characters that, for the most part, weren't involved in the husband-fetching scheme.Really, Cassandra was charismatic enough that she made up for most of the flaws in the story with the way that she told it and in the end, I did enjoy the book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about that time period."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I loved this novel. It seemed less like a novel than a real journal, where I could explore the life of a very interesting, astutue young girl on the cusp of first love. Cassandra and her family are funny, sad and infinitely real. I love the dialogue and also the descriptions of English country life. The first scenes of being down-and-out in a huge castle are beautiful and comic. But the novel moved me most in its moments where Cassandra finds herself desolate and heartbroken, asking God for comfort. This is an exquisite, gentle book. I will pick it up again soon."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book was extremely well-written, and quite entertaining. Though at some points in was a little bit boring, for the most part it was very enjoyable.

I did enjoy Cassandra's charactor a lot, though I also loved that of Simon. A great read for a Sunday afternoon or a rainy day."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle, by Dodie Smith, is really a story about a girl coming of age in a rundown, old English castle in the late 1940's after World War II. Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl, from a poor, eccentric family is trying to polish her skills as a writer by keeping journals. She tries to capture the personalities of those she interacts with and in doing so we get a sense of her own journey to maturity as well as her family's. As different people enter and influence the Mortmain household, it gives reason to reflect on the impact people and new relationships can have on any person.I thought I Capture the Castle was a thoughtful exploration of character. The plot wasn't very fast paced and only possessed, what I would consider, a few major highlights throughout the story, but the intricacies that were given for each character that developed over the course of the book were enough to keep me interested. The way Cassandra's character portrays the world around her is very poetic at times, and also very witty and comical as well. The heroine is instantly likeable and interesting and her personality and her family's personalities keep you turning the page with their sometimes unpredictable and boisterous behavior.My absolute favorite thing about this book is that the author is able to put the simplest, yet sometimes hardest things to describe, in writing. She captures those simple joys and wonders that we all posses and is able to put them in words, which is what made the main character so relatable in the story. One instance of this is when she is day dreaming, or imagining things, like she often would; She said she made herself stop imagining too far because the things you imagine happening usually never come true. Another, smaller example which I thought showed this was when she was recounting a dinner party with some new, wealthy friends. \\"I went through the whole evening - it was almost nicer than when it was actually happening...\\". I appreciated the honesty that the character was able to have because it was a journal; it made the experiences more real throughout the story.This book was written in around 1948, which I believe is one of the causes that the writing style is a little different than most of the contemporary novels that are being written today. This book is beautifully written, but if people are not used to slower moving plots, with heavy emphasis on descriptive passages, I would suggest that this book may not be the best for you. It isn't what we would consider a fast, easy read, but if you can get through it, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"My husband would call this \\"another book about British people with repressed emotions.\\" He is basically right--this book is very much in the spirit of Jane Austen (as the characters point out at several points in the story). The plot is completely character driven and, while interesting, lacks the grandeur of Austen.Though it wasn't neccessarilly a bad book, I was left with the feeling that I would have rather spent my time rereading Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I think the perfect time to read this book is when you are about 13, but I re-read it a few years ago, and still loved it. I bought the book most recently for my 13 year old niece. The narrator of the story is a teen-age girl who lives with her siblings, her brilliant but disturbed father and wonderfully eccentric step-mother in a crumbling castle in 1930s England. The family is on the brink of really going under, financially and emotionally, when two handsome brothers move into the near-by manor house and everything changes. I certainly found the characters and the plot totally believable when I was 13, and it really seemed to all still ring true when I re-read it as an adult."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"In the 1930s teenaged Cassandra lives in a dilapidated old castle in the English countryside with her older sister, Rose, her younger brother, Thomas, her eccentric father, Mortmain, and his bride/muse, Topaz, and of course, the former maid's son, Stephen. The supposed romance of living in a castle is quickly debunked and the reader sees all is not well - the father has not even attempted to work for years and the family is on the verge of starvation. The action really starts when their landlord dies and ownership passes to his two young and handsome American nephews.This novel is told in the form of Cassandra's journals, and very endearingly conveys her experiences trying to deal with her constricted existence, her bizarre family, and first love. I could not put this down and thoroughly enjoyed it... however, I could not help the occasional thought that another author would have made this story side-splittingly funny."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable story of two families in rural England in the first half of the 20th Century. And I agree with the cover quote from J.K. Rowling: \\"This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.\\"-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I was suprised by Cassandra's maturity and by her keen insights of the people around her. Cassandra is undoubtedly a character that belongs in the same category as Jane Eyre and Elizabeth Bennet: all three women are strong and not easily \\"broken\\" by money, men, or influence. Cassandra is intelligent but not pompous, reserved but unafraid to be blunt and direct. She has a sense of duty to her father and to her sister which I very much admire.This would make a great gift for a girl who is around 16/17. It's a very, very good book.Writing: 5/5Characters: 5/5Plot: 5/5"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I just finished this - thought it was great. Once the story got rolling I couldn't put it down. The characters are memorable - the setting intriguing. I'm sure I'll be picking this one up again to reread!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Dodie Smith's novel is captivating--from the first chapter, you feel like you know the characters, and you want to know what will happen with them. There are a ton of surprises in store, and the novel ends quite modernly. I did feel there were a few weaknesses, however, mostly in explaining relationships between characters that came out of nowhere. All the same, the book was great, and I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What a fantastic book. Touching, funny, realistic...a depiction of first love that probably anyone can place themselves in. One of the best books I've read in a long time. I checked it out from the library, but I know I'm going to buy it. This is a book I could read probably every year, and I have to REALLY like a book to want to do that! Even if you are older than Cassandra (I'm only two years older than her now, but I'm referring to people even older than that), you can really feel with her and relate to her experiences. Excellent. A must read for anyone. This is somewhat what I imagine Jane Austen would have written had she lived in the 1940s."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Life in the castle for Cassandra Mortmain has been a hard one lately since no more money is coming in from her father's only bestseller. When two young American boys inherit the mansion neighboring the Mortmain's castle, Cassandra's life and her sister Rose's will change drastically. Dodie Smith uses seventeen-year-old Cassandra's journal for the narrative perspective that creates a fresh, but sometimes cynical view of life. Ms. Smith utilizes foreshadowing in the beginning of the novel as Cassandra hoists her sister up to try to wish on the gargoyle high up above one of the castles windows. The reader never finds out exactly what Rose wishes for, but one can assume it is for a better life or just good fortune to come to her and her family. Rose's wishing foreshadows that the Mortmain's lives do take a turn for the better when the neighbors move in. The Midsummer Rights ceremonies that Cassandra and Rose perform symbolize their immaturity and innocence, as time goes on in the novel, the reader notices changes in the ceremonies as the girls get older and those changes show how they're characters have aged and matured. The castle in which the Mortmains live represents their unique lifestyle. Ms. Smith places the Mortmain family in a castle because without this unique setting the Mortmain family would not be half as intriguing or interesting. I enjoyed this book very much and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys coming of age novels that have a fresh view of the world and that let the reader enter the novel as if the reader were truly there in the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith was an excellent book.

I personally do not enjoy reading a book written as a diary. I like to feel a part of the story and not on the outside as an observer. If you are in the mood for a romantic story, choose Pride and Prejudice. The characters in Castle were not well-developed. I never cared about any of them. The ending leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I'm reading I Capture The Castle now and I'm trying to like it, I really am, unfortunately it's an uphill battle.The father is tiresome and is not written with sufficient charm to inspire me to care and sympathise with his plight.The man is arrogantly neglectful of his childrens well being and is luckier than he knows to be married to someone like Topaz who will treat those kids like her own and be a parent to them...FAR more than Mr. Genius ever does.I also take exception to the treatment of Stephen. I mean, this is a noble young man who worries that the drab sounding Cassandra is hungry!He takes it upon himself to SUPPORT this family and is gorgeous to boot what IS Cassandra's problem?Okay, okay, he doesn't sit around reading Jane Austen or the Brontes but for Pete's sake...he feeds this worthless crew...even the blasted FATHER!!The section where Stephen describes how as a very young child his mother told him not to approach the Mortmain girls because they were \\"young ladies\\" while he was the son of a maid brought tears to my eyes.He's so worth ten Mortmains put together.I shall fight on to the end but I do wish that Stephen and Topaz would run away together and leave the rest of them to snap and snarl over the carcasses of those Cottons.I fear I shall finish this book, toss it aside and just say...\\"So?\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the film (usually a pointless exercise, anyway). Watch the film!One small criticism: I love Bill Nighy, but I think he's a little shaky in this. He's better playing extroverted characters."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Smith's telling of the day-to-day experiences of young Cassandra reminded me of Jane Austen, but the plot was of no comparison. I just couldn't buy into the wealthy American brothers falling in love with Rose. I just don't think it would have happened, or perhaps not enough premise for this to happen was presented to the reader.However, while not as sophisticated, the book was much more compelling than Jane Austen, as popular fiction should be, and I forced myself to not peek at the ending - thankfully, for Cassandra's finale was wonderful.And, several scenes were so well told - the furs incident & the bathing incident in which the brothers make their appearance were hilarious, and several other episodes (especially between Simon and Cassandra) were a pleasure.Jagged edges in the plot, but still a delight for fans of British lit."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great \\"compare and contrast\\" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they \\"don't know how to do anything\\". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are \\"eccentric\\", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my book club. The glowing reviews on amazon captured my imagination and did not prepare me for the disappointment ahead. I think the book might be truly appealing...if you are younger than sixteen. For a middle-aged mother of college students, the love-starved 17-year old Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine totally at the mercy of her heart, left me untouched.The author did a wonderful job of capturing teen-age angst over unrequited love, but none of the characters were what I would call appealing, or even mildly sympathetic. Cassandra Mortmain, the heroine whose journal we as readers are privvy to, lives in an ancient castle with her father, step-mother, brother, and sister. The family is now dirt poor thanks to a writer father who was a one-hit wonder and does nothing now but hole up in his private gatehouse. The sister is busy batting her eyelashes as she really wants to marry a wealthy man who will save her from her life of poverty and the brother is never completely developed, though we do get inklings near the end that he may be the most normal of the family. Only the stepmother has any desire to help herself. While the rest of the family consider themselves too good to do an honest day's work, the stepmother travels to London and earns money as an artist's model. The others had rather sit home and munch on old bread crusts while bemoaning their plight. It was really hard for me to empathize with such a group.The book is very reminiscent of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" though it is set later, in 1940's England. It is very much a coming of age story of a young girl who, through the course of the novel, finds love, loses love, rejects love, and yet \\"captures\\" all the feelings and characters around her as she spends hour after hour writing in her journal as an exercise in teaching herself how to write.In the opening pages, Cassandra tells the reader that she will capture all the conversations, feelings, and characters in her life. That she does, but for this reader, it was a disappointing story that failed to interest me."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I devoured the beginning and couldn't wait to finish. The characters were eccentric and amusing; I found myself easily caught up in wondering what it would be like to meet the bohemian Topaz, sturdy Thomas, bold Neil, and innocent Cassandra. The descriptions were also marvelously evocative of a madcap family amidst a quaint life of genteel poverty. But then Cassandra's journal writing started getting bogged down since the imagery was written at an adult level, but the entries moved from descriptive passages to an adolescent emotional level. It was understandable because Cassandra was so naive but I believe I might have enjoyed it more if I were able to identify with or be interested in all the angst of who loved whom and who was doomed to disappointment in the maze of Stephen loves Cassandra loves Simon loves Rose loves Neil. Mainly I was VERY dissatisfied at the ending since there was no closure and I thought the last chapter was missing. What happens to Cassandra? What about Stephen? What about Simon? What about ...?Simon to Cassandra, \\"Because it's the essence of an enigma that one must solve it for oneself.\\" Very apt."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"While enjoyable, this book is overrated.

The narrator/main character is twee, irritating and too dominant when drawing out the other characters in the book. Her voice is never lost. There are a few nice passages but they often seem coloured a bit too brightly and don't quite hit the mark.Of all the varied books I have read in the last 5 years, this has to be the worst. It may stand as a \\"piece of its time\\" but there are other better books out there. I won't outline the ridiculous \\"intersecting love triangle\\" plot as it's described well in other reviews.

I like novels written as journals, because the characters and their stories become so much more personal. Cassandra's journal makes me want to write."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain has asked for very few things in life: that her family would never reach that point known as abject starvation, that her father rouse himself enough to pick the pen up once again, and that no one turn them away from that tumbledown heap of ruins called the Castle (and more familiarly known as \`home'). Even if they are practically *un*paying tenants.Sensible, fiercely affectionate towards her beautiful (if slightly temperamental) elder sister, Rose, and aware of the infinite magnanimity of the world as compared to the transience of one person's existence, she takes each day as it comes and never lets herself become *too* jaded as another dusk unfurls into another dawn, their family's fortunes seemingly not ever showing signs of taking a turn for the good. There is simple joy to be had in finding a spot atop Belmotte Tower, with a view of the wheat field spread all around glinting drunkenly from the sun's rays, and jotting down into her journal both the curious and innocuous happenings in her and her family's life.It is, however, with the somewhat surreal introduction of the brothers Simon and Neil Cotton that tumble Cassandra's relatively peaceful existence into disarray.As coming-of-age novels go, I would admit to not immediately seeing \\"I Capture the Castle\\" as one. In some respects, I was more riveted with the bits of quirks inherent in the story. There is the paradox of the cold isolation and the elegant deterioration of the Castle itself. Half-standing walls vie for the same space as ivy creepers which lend the estate a sedate kind of beauty. Mists that come out of nowhere can enshroud the ruins like something out of a gothic tableau, while the next sunny day bathes those same walls with a warm, comfortable glow.The characters themselves are a walking contradiction. The elder Mortmain sister, Rose, while blessed with looks, is filled more with bitterness for their dismal state of affairs. Their scrumptious stepmother, the glitteringly-named Topaz, has nocturnal forays atop the ramparts clad only in her nightgown, her \`commune with nature' an oddity that is aptly fitting with *her* own nature. And yet she has managed to keep this family from totally unraveling.Cassandra's father, who long-ago wrote a novel considered a masterpiece by the literary community (the contents of which are tantalizingly never fully disclosed), has now hit a wall and refuses to budge. He passes his days more like a hermit, his head up in the clouds, while his family is sunk deep in the ground with poverty. The only times there's a hint of animated life in his eyes is when he is quizzed by outsiders as to when they should expect his next novel.His response is a snarl.Simon Cotton is born in England but bred on the other side of the Atlantic, the resulting strange accent befuddling Cassandra at first. And if that were not enough, the jarringly peculiar and menacing dark beard he sports is at odds with someone his age, oftentimes preventing people from noticing how generous and kind he really is. His younger brother, Neil, is the full-blooded American. Jocular at one second, and brooding in the next. His American bent obvious in the sometimes faintly jeering attitude he has towards anything English. And yet he is quick to seek pardon if he thinks he has caused offense.Cassandra's encounter with these Americans and their ways of thinking would almost always rattle her, compelling her to remark silently that \\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"Then there's our young narrator. On the whole, content with her lot in life, yet she would not shirk from any opportunity that might just turn the fates in their favor. She is even-tempered and more tolerant than most, her vow to be a good writer (or, at least, a credible chronicler of the Mortmain family drama) making her an exceptional observer of events. On the outset, she knows her family more than, it seems, they know themselves. And yet, as the novel unfolds, she would find herself wondering just how much she might have misread the people around her.And, perhaps, even herself.Subtly engaging, unexpectedly poignant at times, and even witty with its bouts of one-liner maxims, Dodie Smith carves out a heroine worth adoring. Cassandra is on that ambiguous threshold of being a young girl who should have had so many teenage thrills as befits someone growing up, and being swayed headlong into full womanhood, as evidenced by the unnerving introspection she has had on occasion to indulge in. She can laugh and lark about just like any young, carefree kid, but she is also highly-sensitive of the feelings of others and is often crippled with annoyance with herself and with another person if they should cause her discomfort for being concerned over *them* in the first place.Unquestionably proud of her family, she could also be thrown into pits of despair and mortification when one of them commits a faux pas in front of \`sociable' company. More than once she has had to be the mature one among her relatives, while, at the same time, inwardly shaking with trepidation or embarrassment.And it is with the unfurling of the first seeds of romantic love that she realizes the depths of her passion. She discovers a side of her nature that would cause her joy as well as grief. She may look unchanged on the outside but within there brews a turmoil the likes of which just might shake the very foundation of all that she has held eternal.And what she fears most is the uncertainty of *who* might emerge by the time this havoc settles.A tour de force, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" would ensnare one's attention with a quietly plucky heroine. There are no high-blazing action scenes or spine-tingling suspenseful moments in this novel, but the unhurried exploits and simply clever insights in life make this a veritable treasure."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a great story narrated by a teenager, Cassandra Mortmain, who sets out to capture the crumbling castle she lives in with her family in a series of notebooks. Also living in the castle are Rose, her sardonic older sister, Thomas, her brother, her father, a writer whose first novel, Jacob Wrestling, is followed by years of writer's block, her step-mother Topaz, a flighty former model and Stephen, the eighteen year old son of their former maid who had nowhere to go when his mother died, now does odd jobs for the family and has a crush on Cassandra.The family becomes involved with two brothers from America, Simon and Neil, who inherit the castle they live in and the surrounding estate. They court the two sisters and through her involvement with them, Cassandra comes of age.Dodie Smith gives Cassandra a really unique and authentic voice with a strong personality and witty and somewhat innocent outlook on life. The story and the characters are charming with a very humorous cast of eccentric English characters. I was a bit sorry to see Rose, the older sister, lose her acerbic and hopeless attitude when one of the Americans begins courting her. And the ending was a little bittersweet with some desires left unfulfilled when Cassandra reaches maturity and gains the wisdom that comes from experience. Both the characters and the castle were great fun to be around."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Even if you've seen the film, please take the time to read this charming novel.

Probably should have borrowed it from the library rather than buying a copy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I know of few novels - except Pride and Prejudice - that inspire as much fierce lifelong affection in their readers as I Capture the Castle.\\" - Joanna TrollopeOne of my favorite books (outside of Jane Austen's canon of course), I Capture the Castle is a contemporary classic originally published in 1948, but still as fresh and vibrant today. Dodie Smith, more famously remembered for her children's classic 101 Dalmatians, has humorously assembled an eccentric cast of characters living in less than genteel poverty in a crumbling castle in England. The story is revealed through 17-year old heroine in the making and aspiring writer Cassandra Mortmain in a series of journals, an she attempt to improve her skills as a ticket out of her dire circumstances. Her sister Rose will use more avarice means to free herself from her parent's neglect by setting her cap for their wealthy new landlord Simon, and easily succeeds. Less of a schemer, Cassandra is attracted to his younger brother Neil and is hopeful for her own romance. As the wedding plans proceed, Rose's vain and selfish nature blossoms with her newly elevated social position causing conflict. Cassandra, left out of the plans and Simon, who Rose is treating as an annoyance are drawn into their own romance. Rose, on the other hand, is drifting away from Simon and secretly into the arms of his brother Neil. An elopement will cause a family panic, a change of heart and an unusual ending.Filled with allusions to Pride and Prejudice, this coming of age story is more a gentle nod to Austen's style than a copy of her novel. Witty and moving, Smith connects with readers through perceptive observation played against dry wit resulting in a moving and memorable story. It's what makes for great literature, and also what Austen is valued for today.

Now that it's back in print, it's on my gift list for half a dozen people. ICTC is intellectual without pretension, romantic without mush, comic without jokes. It's simply magic."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It might be considered a &quot;woman's novel&quot; in the vein of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Antonia White, or Colette. The protagonist, Cassandra, a very bright and sensitive 17 year old writer, makes one want to move to a medieval castle in England. She has a very perceptive and wise view of life for a young woman, and captures the pains and joys of falling in love to which women of all ages can relate. Just a fabulous book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a book you will read many times through your life. There is joy, sorrow. and humor. You will always be happy to have read this book. Try to find the author's other books- 'It Ends With Revalations', 'A Tale of Two Families','The New Moon With The Old', 'The Town In Bloom', and, of course, 'The One Hundred and One Dalmatians'."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"My mother had an original bookclub edition of this and I have it, earnestly annotated in my adolescent hand. My sisters now have copies collected at book sales over the past 30 years. My daughter loves it now. Seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain wants to be a writer and fills three journals with the tale of a year in '30's England...her writer-father in the middle of an unexplicable dry period, her step-mother Topaz who &quot;communes with nature&quot; in the nude, her beautiful but discontented sister Rose, Stephen the young hired-man and the exciting American brothers who inherit the great house in the neighborhood. &quot;Which do you like better, Jane Austen with a touch of Charlotte Bronte, or Charlotte Bronte with a touch of Jane Austen?&quot; is the kind of question the sisters ponder until real life becomes much more interesting. A lovely book that hasn't aged a bit."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Not just romance in terms of love (although there's plenty of that too - sweet, innocent, wonderful and heartbreaking) but the romance of the time and the setting and the characters are what's so great about this book. Swimming in a castle moat by moonlight; bathing in front of the fire; hot tea on a cold, dark, English night; a beautiful stepmother named Topaz. If that sounds good to you, you'll love I CAPTURE THE CASTLE!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This mid twentieth century novel of English girlhood moved me very much as a teenager; now, on rereading it, I appreciate even more its treatment of everything from hunger and nascent sexuality to the puzzles of literary modernism. Represented as a series of journals (with all the questions implied in that form) the novel has both the kooky charm of other midcentury social comedies (think Thirkell and Sharpe) and a much more serious love for and appreciation of the complications of female adolescence and literary creativity. Give it to your daughter and then borrow it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I found this book on my recommendations list on amazon.com and decided to give it a try. I ordered a copy and thought it might please me, although I thought it would never compare to Jane Austen or Fanny Burney. I began to read it, and was shocked at how well it was written, and in first person journal form. I immediately fell in love with the style of writing, but also with the main characters. This book has a little bit of everything, despair, romance, a coming of age story, a dysfunctional family, lies and deceit, pain and loss, mental illness, different settings. I read it twice, and then told all of my close friends to read it. I went on amazon and ordered copies and had them sent to my friends across the country. I couldn't believe that a book written by the same woman who wrote 101 Dalmations could be this good of a coming of age story for teens and adults. I am in awe of the story within this book, and I HIGHLY recommend reading it. I hope you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Why have I just now read this book, at almost thirty years old?

The first line of this novel, \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" often comes up on various book trivia lists. So my interest was already piqued when I picked up a remainder copy of the movie tie-in edition at Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. I was interested to discover that it was out of print for many many years and was triumphantly celebrated by the critical media upon its return to publication.17 year old Cassandra Mortmain is a charming and entertaining narrator. She is writing in a journal, but as it is practice for being an actual writer she tries to write her entries as she would a novel, with all dialogue recorded and true honesty when it comes to all the characters in her story, herself included.She attempts to \\"capture\\" the story of her family as they live in poverty in an old ramshackle castle in the English countryside during the 1930s. There is love, and bohemia, and mystery, and adventure and confusion and hilarity and a little sadness too. I really felt for these characters and was dreading the end of the story when I would have to leave them.I adored this book. I know I will reread it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I read the book, and watched the movie. I loved the book more. It is definitely worth your time. I read a long time ago, but I am still writing a review encouraging others to read it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"When it comes to literature, I am a very critical person but I capture the castle was a wonderful read. It is one of the best books and it is really a rare gem you will find. The character is a sharp, intelligent narrator who writes in a diary, telling the readers of her family life and problems.The scenes are very well written and they paint a very good picture for the imagination. it was not a book I could just breeze through. The only thing I didn't like was when the character at some point got confused in love matters and showed an interest in her sister's lover. So while the book was really wonderful, the ending I feel could have been different. All in all, it is definitely worth a try and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I love this book so much that I've probably read it a dozen times-at least once a year.I will caution that it is not a happy-go-lucky book. It's full of some self aware teenage angst, and that's part of why I enjoy it. It's a book I love to read when I want to feel bad with someone else, about someone else's problems- the main character, Cassandra's. But it's not a tragic book, and while you may cry a time or two (or possibly, I'm just one of those people who cries over books) you'll enjoy doing it.Two thumbs up, and five stars. Fully recommend buying a copy!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I have heard a lot of chatter recently about this book and I have been meaning to read it for quite some time now. I'm so glad I took the opportunity to purchase it and I am saddened that I did not read this book when I was younger because it has so much youthful hope for life and the ending shares with readers the beautiful transformation of a young girl into a young woman.The story is told through seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain who lives with her family in a crumbling castle in the English countryside. Her father wrote one popular and widely acclaimed novel but has not managed to write a second follow up. Needless to say the family is struggling to get by and has sold most of their furniture and other household items in order to survive. Cassandra and her older, beautiful sister Rose have fun comparing themselves to the Bennett sisters in Pride and Prejudice or characters from a Charlotte Bronte novel. To the family's surprise and delight two American brothers inherit the property next door and the relationships between the families lead to changing within the walls, first love and the discovery of self.Like Cassandra, I wish I could find the right words to describe how much I enjoyed this book but I know that I will never be able to capture all of the emotions and feelings I had while reading it. Cassandra fills up three journals with funny, witty and poetic observations about her life and the people she knows and lives with. She is a wonderful and fascinating heroine and I enjoyed every word she wrote. At first I had some reservations about reading this book because it is written as journal entries but I after reading the book I feel that this gave me such a connection with Cassandra. She becomes a wonderful and endearing character and as I got to watch this period of her life along with her I begin to learn so much about her and ultimately myself. Her assent into first love is so touching, sweet and sad that I begin to fear for her feelings and wellbeing almost as if I was experiencing falling in love for the first time again myself.At first, I found myself a bit disappointed with the ending because I wanted things to turn out well for her but looking back I realized what a wonderful ending to Cassandra's story it is. Be prepared, it is sad, but what Cassandra choses to do is so in tune with the woman she becomes I admire it and appreciate it more. It has been such a long time since I read a book that made me feel like a teenager again and affected all of my emotions. I know that I will be reading this book again many times in the future and it ranks up at the top of my list of my favorite books."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"J.K. Rowling says \\"this book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met\\"* which certainly influenced me to buy the book because I don't think I've ever seen a J.K. Rowling blurb on a book. However, it was a blog post by Elizabeth Bluemle \\"Characters You'd Let Your Daughter Date\\" (http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/shelftalker/?p=1503) that moved I Capture the Castle from the shelf to the \\"to-be-read\\" pile. I was curious about this Stephen character and his marriage potential. But that is just what caused me to pick the book up, there is SO MUCH more to love about it.First, it has one of the best first lines I've ever read: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" If that doesn't want to make you read on, I don't know what will. Second, the narrator is utterly charming. She is captivating, innocent yet serious, she knows who she wants to be but recognizes the challenges that lay ahead of her. She confronts first love head on and survives when both parties end up disappointed. She wants to be a writer and she invites the reader into her deepest thoughts, wishes and dreams and you love her for it. She's smart, funny, sarcastic and dramatic as she attempts to \\"capture\\" the castle.I'm neither the first person to say it nor will I be the last, Cassandra and her family will absolutely capture your heart. Here are few other of my favorite quotes:\\"I was wandering around as usual, in my unpleasantly populated sub-conscious...\\"\\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"\\"I only want to write. And there's no college for that except life.\\"\\"...I have noticed that when things happen in one's imaginings, they never happen in one's life, so I am curbing myself.\\"*this quote was taken from the back cover"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"It really kept my interest and I could not wait to get to read it any chance that I had.The author did a great job sharing Cassandra's adolescent issues in the first person. In fact, it was disturbing at times to be reminded of how difficult it was to be that age. A lot of the story and situation was far fetched but it portrayed an atypical dysfunctional family very well and I felt the frustration I feel when I see dysfunction in real families, including my own. It wasn't really a happy ending and I definitely prefer happy endings. In fact, as much as it kept my interest, I feel mildly depressed just having finished it.It's not \\"classic\\" material but it is definitely bestseller quality."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I love this book--this is my second time reading it and it is just as wonderful as the first. It is rare for a novel to transport me into its world as thoroughly as this one does. When I read this story, I am Cassandra Mortmain--I see what she sees, I feel what she feels. On every page, the author captures a moment or makes an observation that resonates with such authenticity that I am taken back to similar moments in my life and I remember that, yes, they are just like she portrays them. And what the author portrays so vividly is the agony of being a young girl in love for the first time. It's that awkward phase between girl and woman, the pains, the embarrassments, the enthusiasms--Ms. Smith puts them all on the page for us to relive and recognize. It's wrenching at times, but so absorbing that when I reached the end, I immediately turned back to the beginning so I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Cassandra and the Mortmain family.The story is told through Cassandra's journal entries, and I love how the author effortlessly guides the reader in out of the journal. For long stretches of time, it's easy to forget that we're reading Cassandra's diary. But then we dip back into it as Cassandra tells us she's tired of writing or notes how long it's taken her to record a particular event--and even in one case, how she waited too long to record an event and can only give us general impressions of it. The author has a masterful way of using the journal format to her advantage and never letting it limit the story. And I love how, even though the story is told exclusively through Cassandra's viewpoint, the author is still able to show us things through Cassandra's eyes that Cassandra doesn't necessarily see.The 101 Dalmatians, also by Dodie Smith, was one of my favorite books as a child, but I didn't discover \\"I Capture the Castle\\" until adulthood. I'm sorry I didn't have the pleasure of reading this as a girl, but I doubt I could have loved it any more than I do now."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The Mortmain family were once financially well off. James Mortmain had written a wonderfully successful novel, but that was a long time ago. Years have now passed and James has not written anything! Over time, his wife died and he was left with three children. However, he did find a new love with a beautiful and exotic model by the name of Topaz. When times were good, James had leased a castle for his family. A romantic endeavor, but now the family are very poor. The castle is terribly run down and over the last few years any furniture of value has been sold. James can't or won't write another story. His fans want another book and no one can understand why James can't produce one!Topaz dearly loves her husband and does her best as a step-mother. The children seem to have a good relationship with her. The daughters are Rose, who at twenty-one is quite beautiful, and seventeen year old Cassandra who is a wonderful and colorful character. Thomas, the only son is still in school, but anxious to grow up and see the world. A young handsome eighteen year old boy by the name of Stephen also lives with the family. His mother had been the family's maid during better times. After her death, Stephen has stayed on and worked for the Mortmain's doing any chore that was requested of him. He is extremely fond of Cassandra and she worries about what might become of him.The story is set in the 1930's and told by Cassandra. She's absolutely charming in her observations and descriptions of life. She records the happenings of daily life and analyses everything and everyone she interacts with.When the Cotton's, a very wealthy family inherit a neighboring estate, life changes for the impoverished Mortmain's. The girls are dazzled by their new American neighbors, especially Simon and Neil, the two very interesting sons of the family.One note of interest, the author, Dodie Smith also wrote the children's story, The Hundred and One Dalmatians."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Last year, my daughters (ages 12 and 14) and I went to Disney World.

It was a true joy to read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"As a sixteen year old girl, I found Cassandra very easy to relate to. A lot of the thoughts and emotions mentioned in the book really hit home with me, as I'm sure they did and will with other readers. Dodie Smith's writing style is amazing; I was never bored once, always turning page after page to find out where the characters would end up. If you love a touch of romance, a slice of comedy, and a lot of truth, this is the book for you. I Capture the Castle was a fantastic read, one that I will gladly repeat again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Rereading this book after 25 years might have been a disappointment, but it was as good this time and as a more mature reader.

Thank you for reminding me about it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I first heard of this book when Entertainment Weekly gave it an unheard of A+ rating, and thought it sounded fun. After reading it, I became a D. Smith ADDICT and quickly read everything else (unfortunately, thru the library as they are mostly out-of-print) she'd written. The comparisons to J. Austen are apt, but Smith has her own idiosyncratic style. Cassandra Mortmain is a heroine for all times, though and I can well imagine that I too, will become one of the book's devoted fans who will read and re-read and re-read this book for years to come. Yes it really is that good!!

I can't think of a better story about young girls confronting the complexity, wonder, and pain of growing up. I would put it in the ranks of Anne of Green Gables, and Little Women.

A wonderful story of a teenaged girl in 30s England.

I plan on giving copies to all my favorite people."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this book, having chosen it for its title, and it's one of the best coincidences that's ever happened to me. I devoured it in two days and was then stunned to discover that it was written in the first half of the last century; it could have been written today.The author deftly combines wit, humor, and empathy to deliver a well-developed picture of the narrator Cassandra's life. Cassandra is wonderfully real and insightful as she tries to \\"capture\\" in her writing the events that take place around her. It's a book about family, love, and growing up, and I don't think it will ever grow outdated."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I first heard about I Capture the Castle a few months ago, when it kept showing up on people's \\"favorite\\" lists. Interested to see what all the fuss was about, I bought a copy for myself...and was not disappointed.The book is written from Cassandra Mortmain's point of view...actually, the book is her journal. We see through her eyes her very eccentric family, which includes her odd and lazy father, her free-spirited stepmother, self-serving sister Rose, and stoic brother Thomas. Also living in their home with them is their \\"servant\\" Stephen. They all live in a crumbling old castle that is romantic as well as slightly creepy. They live very isolated, and on the brink of financial ruin when the rich Cottons move next door--two bachelor brothers and their mother from America.The descriptions of the ruined castle and the surrounding English countryside are superb, and my favorite part of the book. I also thought the author did a great job of seeing things through Cassandra's eyes.One thing I'd like to comment on--and other reviewers have mentioned this as well--is that at times the characters can get on your nerves. Rose in particular doesn't have many redeeming qualities, and (in my opinion), Mr.Mortmain had none. Even Cassandra acts supremely selfish and immature through out the book--I often felt she was 14/15 instead of 17/18. But, I kept reminding myself that things were different back in the 1930s, and didn't let it detract from my love of the book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I have read this book because it is in the BBC big read list, and I loved it. I think this book will always stay in my \\"All Time Favourite\\" List along with books like Pride and Prejudice. Even thought I usually dont like books that doesnt tell me exactly what will happen to the character, but this one is an exception because it made me always think of the charatcters and what might happen to them.Casandra is a really special character and you just feel like you are living with her when you read the book, she was just like a friend to me whom I have known for ages.I would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoy reading diaries and romance. Their are also many parts that will make you laught.I would say get it and have fun reading it. You will love it!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What a gem of a book! &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is a magnificent coming-of-age book, which reminded me of the best of the Brontes, &quot;Little Women&quot; and Jane Austen. It is just so good...Cassandra, the 17-year old heroine, lives with her well-born family in near poverty in a castle in England. Her father, a true English eccentric, once wrote a bestseller--but that was a long time ago. Her sister, Rose, is a beauty with ambition--to marry well. Her stepmother Topaz, a kindhearted and beautiful soul, trudges into London to pose nude for artists and bring income into this colorful crew.Cassandra dreams of becoming a writer. When two rich American brothers and their mother move in next door, well she believes that she has found her heroes and her story. And so indeed a story, actually several stories unfold into wonderful tales of adventure and romance in 1930's England. You see the world of well-born bohemians, subtle class snobberies, interwar London and lots of romance through the eyes of the young Cassandra. You also see-and feel-Cassandra maturing and growing into a woman through her experiences.I would recommend this book highly to individuals (most likely women) who enjoy coming-of-age stories, romances, and English life tales in the interwar period. A warning: this book is very well-written, but well-written through the eyes of a 17-year old. That may not be your taste--other reviewers have found it a young person's book. Yes it is--but you don't have to be young in years to enjoy it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The thing about this book is its unique voice. Tied up in the first person narrative of a seventeen year old girl keeping a journal so to hone her writing skills, \\"capturing\\" dialogue, character and action is a groundswell of comedy, cultural satire and dramatic irony, not to mention some sharp insights about love and coming of age. There are whiffs of a number of literary forebears and contemporaries such as Nancy Mitford, William Dean Howells, Shakespeare, P.G. Wodehouse, Stella Gibbons, and Jane Austen, but thanks to the inimitable voice of Cassandra Mortmain, this reads as if it were the first story about mixed up love or sisters whose once well-established family has fallen on sore times.The plot, so much as can be easily and fairly revealed: between the wars in rural Suffolk, the Mortmain family lives in a 13th century ruin of a leaky castle that was somewhat fixed up in the 17th century, with some remuddling by the Victorians. The father is a one-book genius who after an unfortunate moment with a cake knife, the humor of which escaped the judge, entered into writer's block. There have been no residuals from the book in some time. The household he is not supporting also consists of Cassandra's bohemian stepmother Topaz, Cassandra's older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen, the orphaned son of their former maid who has a crush on Cassandra and is also the only one in the household who is capable of producing the slightest income. The women troop about in odd costumes made from disintegrating wardrobes. For Cassandra, this is simply the way it is, and for Rose, it is a horror from which to escape. Enter the wealthy American heirs of the recently deceased landlord, two brothers and their family dynamics. A number of plot lines take off: Will both Rose and Cassandra find true love and with whom? Will father write again? Will Cassandra figure out what makes people tick, an essential component to writing? The plot complications are endless.This is smart, unsentimental, and often very funny. The secondary characters are well-defined and a hoot, too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"My friend recommended the movie, and I went to the web and found its website, which intrigued me into finding a used copy on amazon.com. I also did investigations into the other writings of Dodie Smith, and was entranced to know that her fame came largely from \\"101 Dalmatians\\".Well, my trade paperback copy arrived and I immediately plunged into the tale of the crazy family of Cassandra Mortmain, the story teller, and their state of poverty of the upper class in England. Actually, it is amazing that her father, James, a one book author now stymied by writer's block, should submit his second wife and three children to such an austere life, one that is supported by the son of a now deceased housekeeper that the family took in during better times.Cassandra's sister, Rose, plots to marry the property's rich owner, which leads one into an examination of the truth of intentions: money over poverty in the guise of love. And the seduction of Simon Cotton, landed gentry with American background, gives Cassandra quite a tale to tell.Cassandra is the love object of Stephen, the serving woman's son. And she dodges his determined suit, though touchingly receiving his gifts. His dedication to the Mortmains and to Cassandra in particular parallels a knight who serves the damsel in tales of old.There is remarkable strength in the character of lively Topaz, James Mortmain's second, and much younger, wife. She truly holds the family together, and the three Mortmain children seem to respect her as a step-mother who is not much older than they. In fact, the whole Mortmain family is oddity personified; yet, they are deliciously quirky and enjoyable. The setting of Scoatney Castle and the remains in which they live, horribly cold in winter, lacking light and adequate food, but rich in spring and summer, is as much a character as any of the cast.And the American heirs, the Cottons, contrast with the very English Mortmains in social customs and income. The lavish circumstances that Rose enjoys with Simon's family once they go to London gives off visions of a lively between-the-wars British society in dazzling costumes of the 1920's and '30's.I am so glad that I ordered this book. It kept me reading day and night for a couple of days. It swept me into Cassandra's world and into a vivid period of her coming of age. The honesty of its telling made it even more delightful.Now, I am ready to see the movie. I only hope it holds up to Dodie Smith's original book. If it fails, I still have my personal vision of the novel to satisfy me. How nice to discover another lovely read and to be captured by it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I stumbled over a 40-year-old copy of this book at my in-law's house last spring when they were trying to get rid of some of their thousands of books.

A year later, I can close my eyes and see myself as Cassandra, performing my Midsummer's Eve rituals.This book is utterly charming, without becoming drippy. The characters are gritty and real enough to keep from falling into stereotypes. On the one hand, the story is a conventional fairy tale of marrying off daughters to handsome, moneyed boys and solving the poor family's financial crisis, but on the other hand it is completely UNconventional, allowing the narrator to have very un-fairy tale-like thoughts and experiences.I am delighted to see this book back in print! It is a wonderful read, so just buy it and read it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend who is a voracious reader. I forgot about it until working at the library, a copy fell into my hands. I remembered the friend, and borrowed the book. For several days I slowly read it and was mad at myself for having neglected this fine work. The narrator, Cassandra, is a girl on the brink of womanhood in the middle of a sad and terribly amusing dysfunctional family. Her family includes her genius of a father, who spends his days teetering on the brink of mental collapse; her stepmother, Topaz, a ridiculous woman with a heart of gold; Rose, the sister, heartless until her heart breaks; and their loyal servant, Stephen, who is the only one on the premises with the brains and brawn to earn the money they so need so badly. They live together in a beautiful ruin of a castle, caught in almost a dream of poverty, until one day two vistors arrive and change their future forever. I fell in love with Stephen, and I love this book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book really has no equal. I first read it when I was fourteen, and find that I appreciate better now at 32 than I did then. I am delighted to see it revived. The boost it's gotten from J.K. Rowling, however, has proved a bit of a mixed blessing. Many people seem to infer from her endorsement that it's of a genre with her writing. In fact, this is not fantasy, but a beautiful evocation of the life of an observant teenager in 1930's England. Highly recommended for artists, writers, and Anglophiles. And may I suggest: &quot;The Death of the Heart,&quot; by Elizabeth Bowen, for an alternate existence to Cassandra's."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I first read I Capture the Castle in junior high school almost 30 years ago and then as a young adult I bought a copy of the 1948 published hardback from a bargain book table at an antique store for fifty cents. I was quite amazed when I found it by accident while searching on Amazon. I am so very pleased that it has been re-released because this is one of my favorite books and I'm happy to know there is the possibility for others to meet the main character, Cassandra Mortmain and her family. I have re-read it many times over the years and treasure my bargain copy. It remains as fascinating as the first time I read it and I can't recommend it highly enough.

I'm astonished and proud that it has lasted so long. I've written other novels and two of my childrens' books continue to be succesful, (paticularily The Hundred and one Dalmatians), but nothing (for me anyway) means as much as ICTC&gt; Where did those characters come from? They are not drawn from life. The Castle partly is but I changed it a great deal and I much prefer my own castle! I've been asked again and again to write a sequel to ICTC but I'm sure I never could. I don't even like to think of the future of the characters because I don't want them to grow older. I've been asked again and again to say whom Cassandra marries but I've no idea. I like to think of her just hopeful for the future and I shall let myself think you and I share this idea. I am now 89 and sometimes (but only sometimes) almost feel it, but not when I think about Cassandra. Thank You again for your letter which has given me great pleasure. And I like to think that in some mysterious realm of the imagination, the characters in my book are pleased to and send you their love-with mine.

I rarely react to a book so strongly that it leaves me with a pleasant glow days after I have read it. Magically, this book manages to be the warmest, most positive, least cloying story I have ever read (even the end is satisfying without being a cop-out). It is beautifully written with an amazing sense of place, atmosphere and character. Who couldn't fall in love with Cassandra with her quick wit, intelligence and unconventional outlook? I have rarely read such an unpatronising, accurate and positive account of a girl on the brink of adulthood. Read ICTC for the cleverly constructed plot. Read it for the descriptive passages and the evocation of time and place. Read it for the distinctive and endearingly eccentric characters, especially the narrator, Cassandra. Just read it.

(If you want a taste of author Dodie Smith's ability to write funny characters, bear in mind she is also the author of \\"101 Dalmations\\").Two wealthy American brothers move in next door; although they are initially blinded by sister Rose's classic beauty, eventually one of them (I won't say which) sees the depth of character behind the narrator, the more sincere and thoughtful Cassandra.Cassandra is an enchanting narrator (the book is a series of first-person entries into her journal) - she is witty, self-effacing, and completely authentic. The reader will absolutely believe she is a real, irreplacable person.I was so enamored of Cassandra that at first I worried for her when she fell in love - I was worried about a too-convenient fairy-tale ending. But happily the \\"happily ever after\\" is replaced by a more intriguing end; Cassandra's final decision is perfectly consistent with her chracter.I only wish I had read this when I was, like her, a teenager - it would have meant a lot to me to meet a character so ambitious, energetic, lively, funny, who still clearly has romance in her future."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring author, is keeping a journal in which she chronicles her life in a ramshackle old English castle. Life is not easy for the Mortmains. Most of the family's possessions and furnishings have been sold off, they do without electricity, and there is barely enough to eat. In spite of all this, the family keeps a cheerful outlook and manages to get by, thanks in part to the generosity of the wealthy American Cotton family who has inherited the estate upon which the castle sits and who have taken the Mortmains under their wing.The Mortmains are an offbeat family. Cassandra has flights of fancy and unusual schemes that often have unexpected results. Father, an eccentric and innovative writer, is suffering from severe writer's block and can no longer support the family. He spends his time holed up in the gatehouse reading novels. Stepmother Topaz is a flighty artist's model who enjoys roaming the estate in the buff. Cassandra's older sister Rose is tired of living hand-to-mouth, and she decides to find a way to marry the landlord's wealthy grandson. Handsome Stephen, a hired hand who stays on with the family even though the Mortmains cannot afford to pay him, has difficulty hiding his unrequited love for Cassandra.First published in 1948 and set in the 1930s, the story has an old-fashioned feel to it, especially on the subject of courtship and marriage. It also highlights the cultural differences at that time between the Americans and the British. Possessing a wisdom and maturity beyond her years, Cassandra spends much time analyzing the people and events that surround her and then recording her observations. &quot;Contemplation,&quot; she says, &quot;seems to be about the only luxury that costs nothing.&quot; Through her journals, Cassandra's voice is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always endearing as she describes her concerns, her hopes, and her first love. &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; is recommended for both young adults and adults as a warm coming-of-age story.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"After I read a very short synopsis of this book, I knew it was a MUST HAVE. The only dissapointment was that it was not long enough. Cassandra Mortmain makes you want to be seventeen again. She narrates to you the very width and depth of her life during probably the most important summer of her life -- the summer she falls in love. It is a story about growing up, getting on, and making do. The fact that it is set in a ruined castle on the English countryside just drags the reader in deeper and deeper into Cassandra's realm.I read the book in two sittings, then I passed it on to my best friend. She too fell madly in love with Cassandra Mortmain, her beautiful sister Rose, and all the delightful characters that come to life for the reader throughout this book.I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is a book for all ages. I kept asking myself, &quot;Why couldn't I have had this book when I was seventeen?&quot;Read it. You are guaranteed to enjoy it.

A while later she phoned to say: \\"It was SO perfect, I don't want to read anything else for a long while--I want to savor it.\\" We chatted about the multifaceted charm of this novel, and compared it favorably with the film based on it, which we both had seen on DVD.\\"On the 5th day of Christmas\\", 2006, I visited and found my friend dead in her bed--she seems to have died peacefully in her sleep. My book was on the table in her living room. In the days following I thoughtfully re-read the volume, thinking at every page how my late friend would have delighted at the offbeat wit and each nimble turn of phrase.--And for the first time, I was struck by the small but important role of the Vicar (who \\"looked like an elderly baby\\"), and noticed the \\"stealth comfort\\" he administers to the non-practising, nominally Christian protagonist, when late in the story she is confused and depressed by situations beyond her control. It may well have been the last reference to the comfort of religion which my friend read, which is felicitious; for she reminded me much of the main character in her views on God and religion.I am grateful to be granted the grace of giving my friend the pleasure of such an enchanting \\"last novel\\". I will savour that gentle and whimsical Providence (not unlike something which could have happened in the book) for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is the first sentence of _I Capture the Castle_, and it's got to be one of the all-time greatest first sentences (along with &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,&quot; from _Pride and Prejudice_, and &quot;There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it,&quot; from _The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'_).The narrator is Cassandra Mortmain, a 17-year-old who lives in a broken-down castle in Suffolk with her eccentric family: her father James, a writer suffering from a years-long case of writers' block; her stepmother Topaz, an artists' model who has a tendency toward outdoors nudism; her elder sister Rose, a beauty who desperately wants to escape the family's poverty-stricken life; her precocious younger brother Thomas; and Stephen, the son of a late family servant who is now the Mortmains' only breadwinner (and Cassandra's ardent admirer).Into their lives come the Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, from America; Simon has just inherited the nearby Scoatney Hall, and Rose immediately sets out to capture him, thereupon setting in motion the train of events chronicled by Cassandra.The foremost appeal of _I Capture the Castle_ is Cassandra's voice and personality, which infuses the book with her wit, charm, and innocence and makes you feel as though you know Cassandra and her family and friends intimately. I've heard people criticize the ending, which certainly does not tie it all up in a neat resolution, but to me, that's a strength of the book: you feel that the characters can continue beyond the last page, because their futures are in doubt, and you can conjecture to your heart's delight about what might happen to them."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Dodie Smith may be best-known as the author of The One Hundred and One Dalmatians, but she was the author of many hit West End plays and several best-selling books. If you enjoy mid-20th-century British fiction, may I recommend a perfect gem of a novel, back in print after many years a-languishing: I Capture the Castle, told in first-person narration by Cassandra Mortmain, the younger daughter of a family of impoverished eccentrics living in a small run-down castle in the British countryside, as she tries to &quot;capture&quot; her life in her private journal. Her father is a once-famous writer with a seemingly-insurmountable case of writer's block; her stepmother Topaz is an unusually-gorgeous former model with pretentions of artistry and a loving heart; her beloved sister Rose is hungry for some sort--any sort!--of change. Into this almost Austen-like situation comes Simon, the new landlord, an upper-class American from New England, along with his informal younger brother, raised in California, and their &quot;club woman&quot; mother, and suddenly the potentials and possibilities and coincidences become endlessly interesting...Will Simon propose to Rose? Will Mortmain ever write again? Will Cassandra's swain kiss her in the bluebell wood? Perhaps it doesn't sound like much, but it's engaging and endearing, a period-piece with &quot;good bones&quot; and long-lasting, pleasurable resonance, still holding up well after half a century on the shelves.On my top-40 list, certainly, if not my top-10. I can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"There are a lot of books out there with famous first lines. A Tale of Two Cities, for example: who hasn't heard \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\"?This book should be added to the list. I really don't think \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" could be improved upon in any way.And it gets better from there.I accidentally saw the movie first- which you should NEVER do. Seven-eighths of the charm of this story is in the first-person narration. The plotline itself is not all that impressive. In fact, when I explained the basic gist to Josh, it sounded a bit like a trashy grocery-store novel. Which proves, I guess, that you can never judge a book by its outline.It is the diary of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra's author father got a 40-year lease on a crumbling old castle in the English countryside, because he felt its romantic essence would spark his dried-up creative juices. On the contrary, his writer's block stretches over two decades, and the family's income dwindles to nothing. Cassandra and her sister Rose spend most of their time imagining their lives differently, until, one day, two wealthy brothers move into a nearby mansion.The ensuing drama unfolds in a predictable manner; but you won't mind, because the telling is so delicious. Cassandra's perspective brings so much whimsy and honesty and real-life-ness to an otherwise cliched and lachrymose tale. Each gleaming insight, every subtly hilarious description, along with the book's vaguely silly characters, adds up into an artfully winsome experience- a bittersweet yet somehow enormously enjoyable read. It's become one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is the 1930's coming-of-age story of 17-year-old Cassandra, who lives in rural Britain with a cast of simultaneously comic and tragic family and friends. During the spring, summer, and autumn months spanned by the story, she pens a diary that describes her first adult lessons about love, sisterhood, and friendship. Although the voice is believably adolescent, the lessons Cassandra learns are completely adult.\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is beautiful in every way a book should be. It's gentle without being sappy, humorous without being mocking, gorgeously (although a bit painstakingly) written without digressing into flights of narcissistic prose. The narrator is both an ordinary child and an extraordinary woman, and her greatest strength as a character is the believability of her weakness. The other characters are interesting and unusual and completely human. The setting, a barely-refurbished medieval castle, is very nearly a character in its own right, and it informs and interacts with the story in a way I've rarely seen outside of the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The book, with all of its lyricism and innocence and wise optimism, teaches a gentle and almost invisible lesson. It's about learning to love fairly and accept love gracefully, about being faithful to your friends even when it hurts, about who constitutes a family and how one goes about caring for them, about how growing up is not the end of a the road but the beginning. It's not a new lesson, but it's one we all need to learn a little more.But \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is more than a beautiful book, and more than a lesson. It's an experience. It's as if Jane Austen had been reborn 130 years later and rewritten \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with a compassion and magic her original work missed. Or as if \\"Little Women\\" had been written for adults: just as so many little girls start their own \\"Pickwick Papers\\" and take to eating apples in attics after reading Alcott's book, after reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\" I wanted to find a ruin in Britain, fit it with indoor plumbing, and spend the timeless days of summer sitting in the tower and penning a journal of my own days and dreams and loves."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful coming of age story! It is the story of the Mortmain family, as seen through the eyes of 17 year old Cassandra, as she chronicles her and her family's life in a series of journals. The family is one step from poverty, living in a falling down castle, when Neil and Simon Scoatney arrive from America. The Scoatney's live in the manor down the road, and actually own the castle Cassandra's family is leasing. Once they arrive, things begin to change for the Mortmains. Rose, Cassandra's sister, is determined to marry one of the brothers, hopefully to lift her family out of poverty. The Father of the family, once a brilliant writer, is reclusive and non-communicative, until Mrs. Scoatney gets a hold of him! Topaz, the girls' step-mother, is beautiful in an unconventional way, plays the lute, and communes with nature in the buff. As Cassandra chronicles the goings-on of life in the castle, she tries to &quot;capture&quot; her life and her family on paper, in hopes of understanding who she is and what it means to be a part of her family.

There's a lot more going on in this book than &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;charming.&quot; It's a brutally honest tale of a 17 year old girl coming out of that self-involvement phase and getting a good first look at the world around her. And it tackles the concept of understanding and portraying beauty in a very effective manner. Her father's puzzle exemplifies the puzzle of the novel....you have to pace through the book with Cassandra to get from point A to point B. There's no flipping straight to B for enlightenment. You must take the full journey.But it's a quirky, charming journey nonetheless. :)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This has to be my very favourite book. Cassandra is really easy to relate to, at the end of the book you are left longing for more of her thoughts and witty observations. This book captures its characters so well, that you could walk straight into the book and feel quite at home!The cover of this book does really not do it justice. I bought a different copy which had a picture of Cassandra writing her journal by the castle in the evening light, with warm orange colours, this is perphaps more suited to the magic and warmness of the book.Okay, so living in a castle and having rich guys come round bringing money with them seems a little convient and unrealistic, but the fantastic way in which this book is written persuades you that this could be a true story, with all its characters being believable and lovable.Face it, we all hate one romance after another in a book, with more mood swings then you can count, but Dodie Smith has exactly the right balance of romance, comedy, and emotion. It does have you crying in parts of the book, but nothing else is expected when you become so involved with the each of the characters.It is set at a time that isn't too far back that we cannot realate to it, but is far back enough to have a touching innocense, that creates a pleasant enviroment for its reader that modern stories simply do not have.Overall, I would say this is an excellent read, the best thing about it being its characters, and warmth.

Written in the form of a seventeen year old girl's journal, over the period of six months during which her life and that of her (rather unusual) family change dramatically, this novel introduces us to one of the most likeable voices in fiction. Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring writer, keeps the journal to hone her skills; she ends up, rather, getting to know herself and her surroundings better. Smith manages to keep her reader's interest effortlessly (or so it seems, though the hints given by Mr. Mortmain's struggles may indicate otherwise), through a carefully rationed supply of surprises, small suspenses, and the sheer curiosity she has created about the future of the Mortmain family. The most frustrating (though perhaps most amusing for Smith) part of the thing is that Mr. Mortmain is an author himself, the highly regarded author of a book of fiction, poetry, experiments, called &quot;Jacob's Wrestling&quot; that figures in &quot;Capture,&quot; but we are given tantalisingly little information about it. I expect Smith enjoyed doing that to us; i know i would. Though it has the feel of a juvenile book (the narrator is seventeen, it's about [among other things] first loves), this is an adult book; though teenagers can read and enjoy it, more will be discovered by the active adult reader."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is the most incredible book--it is an example of the way a book should be written. It is very hard to say something that hasn't already been said . . .this book has been receiving accolades for nearly half a century, and rightfully so.

It has everything--adventure, romance, humor, and a little bit of philosophizing thrown in for good measure. It is one of those books that when you finish it, you find yourself sad that it ended, and wanting to open it right back up and start again.

Oh, it's well-written and pleasant to read, with the usual assortment of eccentrics that only English authors seem to be able to create. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get interested in what happens to the characters in the story, even though I tried very hard. It's a good book to spend some quiet time reading, and it will relax you with its language and languid pace. Perhaps it's finally showing its age, being over a half-century old, and seemingly rooted in another world and time entirely. Don't be put off by what I say; read it and make your own determination.

Written in 1948, I Capture the Castle is a marvelous book about mid-20th century England. It is written in the form of a young woman's journal entries over the span of a couple of months, March to October. The Mortmain's are poor and hungry, though they live in a castle; it is mostly empty because they had to sell most of their belongings for money. Cassandra's father became famous for a brief time in the past with the writing of his book, but has since then stopped writing and acquired very strange behavior. Cassandra's mother passed away when she was very young.One day everything changes when two young men come to the castle. Rose takes a great interest in one of them, Simon, and he eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Cassandra knows, however, that her sister is marrying him for the wrong reasons: she only wants the money, for herself and for her family. Cassandra becomes quite upset and it is soon learned that she herself is in love with Simon!This book is written with wit, beauty, and the words flow so easily. It is impossible not to love the characters and the story. In the end, Cassandra truly captures the readers heart with her heartfelt and sincere entries. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I bought this book while on vacation and was looking for something to read. I admit that it was the simplicity of the cover that caught my attention. The writing style was wonderful and I always enjoy a book written in the first person narrative. The main character, Cassandra, was easy to listen to. A girl on the verge of womanhood, she showed wisdom, insight and sensitivity beyond her years. Considering that she lived in such a dysfunctional family, it was miraculous that she turned out to be so well-adjusted.The writing style was beautiful-not too wordy, but allowing for crystal-clear descriptions of the family and their surroundings. I did find that the plot was alittle predictable and events that should have taken time to evolve, happened at a whirlwind pace. At times I thought that months or years had passed, until the narrator indicated that it was actually the next day ( I just don't think that the kind of events described happen that fast in real-life).In general, I found this to be an enjoyable and pleasant book. No sex, no drugs, no violence - just the likable story of a girl coming of age.P.S.

The young girl, Cassandra who takes us through part of her life, maybe the most important part of her life is very charismatic in a way, she puts everyone's problems on her shoulder, and in the it was all payed back, but I felt realy sorry for her. I thought maybe she deserved better than the way she was treated, and even at the end, no convincing apologies were made. Not even by the people who really hurt her at times, when she didn't even realize it. The ending was really realistic. In most stories the girl and the guy get together after all they have been gone through, but in the end this doesn't happen though in thier hearts you feel some connection between them, each don't want to admit and they seperate.

While it was written with wit and wisdom I was bothered at finding the usage of the same extraordinary rare words over and over. I thought the story started out wonderfully; a girl loving where she is and loving who she is and being content while wanting so much more. It is the life of a young girl who wants only the best for her father, sister, brother, step mother, and friend/hand-boy. It was no surprise and I knew it was coming ... that she would fall for the wrong man which was disappointing. I hoped that there would be a better end; that somehow for once an author could actually pull it off. As the author had our young main character put it ... she loved a book that \\"left you wondering.\\" Some just do not care for the way it is done, I being one. Overall the book was worth reading and I did enjoy the time I spent."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I just read I CAPTURE THE CASTLE for the first time and it was definitely one of those &quot;Where has this book been all my life?&quot; reading experiences. It was a true joy. I had read A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS when I was a child and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this book because that wry, witty writing style is just as present in that &quot;children's&quot; novel. Cassandra Mortmain had such a strong voice and she's now one of my favorite female characters of all time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I suppose that I would have liked the book more, had I read it first instead of watching the movie first. I think this book lacked details that I look for in a good book. I did not care much for the time or place that it took place. I felt the book had a slow beginning. That was enough for my husband to quit reading it. Several of my book club members could not get past the fist sentence! As you read on, however, you find that the story gets better as it goes. There is so much drama between the two sisters in this book! It makes it really good! It has some laughs and some serious parts. There were some parts in this book that my book club members disagreed about as far as what Smith was trying to get across to the reader. Overall, I would say that it is worth a try, but I would not read it again. I would, however, watch the movie again!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I think I started this book with my expectations too high. After all the glowing reviews I really expected a book that would grab me and not put me down, or at least one that would make it onto my bookshelf as a favorite. It's a good book. The characters are interesting and involving. Maybe if I'd read it when I was a teenager the unrequited love angst (well-written though it was) would not have put me off so much. But from my middle-aged perspective it let the book down. So my recommedation is to give this book to your teenage daughters and nieces, and to take the glowing reviews with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The book came as advertised except for the stickers on the spine, which couldn't be removed completely. Other than that, the book was on great condition and came quickly."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"A charming coming of age story with equally charming, eccentric characters and wonderful descriptions of the English countryside and the day to day life in pre WWII England. Dodie Smith perfectly contrasts English mannerisms and etiquette with the American way of doing things, hits the mark even all these years later. She also beautifully portrays the bevy of emotions a teenager goes through when falling in love for the first time. The book is written in diary form, which allows for deeper insight into the musings of Cassandra, the lead character; the effect is to make her very real and believable. In fact all the characters are very believable; with exceptionally varied roles for the women. It's interesting that the unique diary form of the book while effective in adding realism and depth to the plot and characters also tends to make things a bit tedious as Cassandra records her daily happenings and thoughts, some of which are rather insignificant. It was a nice read but seems more appropriate for school \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I'll be honest. When I first came across this book in Barnes and Noble a number of years ago, I dismissed it as something I wouldn't like (literally, I judged a book by its cover, shame on me). I re-discovered this book a few months ago, and now I'm wondering why, oh why, didn't I read this book earlier.I Capture the Castle is the diary, kept over a six-month period, of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, who lives with her unconventional family in a decrepit, crumbling castle. She keeps the diary in order to strengthen her skills as an author. The novel is written not so much as a diary; rather Cassandra writes it very much as a story is written (aside from mentioning the month, she doesn't date her entries).Cassandra's strength lies in her recreation of her family members and the people in the small country village in which they live; even the dog has a personality. All of the characters have depth; take, for example, Cassandra's stepmother Topaz, a former model who is more complicated than she appears at first. Cassandra narrates this story with a great amount of humor; especially funny is the story about the bear. Cassandra and her whole family are charming, and I absolutely fell in love with all of them. I think if I'd read this book when I was seventeen, I would have loved it; but it's no less funny and poignant ten years later. It's a great coming-of-age story, especially since Cassandra's coming of age happens so imperceptibly over the course of the novel."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I'm a person who finds classics a bit intimidating because sometimes I find the language a bit rough to get through. So, I was a little apprehensive when I first picked up I Capture the Castle. Still, I figured a good introduction to the classics genre (I've only read a few) would be a classic young adult novel and I was right. I Capture the Castle is one of the most beautiful books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.I noticed that in other reviews, people stated that I Capture the Castle was really slow to get into at first. I didn't find it that way at all. From page one I was enchanted with Cassandra and her life at the castle. Cassandra is just so sweet and funny that you can't help but love her. Due to her flaws, she's also extremely real. I got annoyed at her when I read who she was in love with and at some of the things she did and then I remembered that most teenagers act illogical sometimes when they are in love. Cassandra wasn't really a heroine that was glorified. Because I Capture the Castle is written in the form of Cassandra's journal entries, we see her at her absolutely best, yet we also see her at her absolute worst.Cassandra wasn't the only charming character in I Capture the Castle. I found myself falling in love with not only Simon, but with Neil, and especially Stephen (poor, poor Stephen. I just wanted to hug him throughout the whole novel). I also absolutely loved Topaz and the way she was prone to dramatizing certain situations that she felt needed a bit of \\"drama\\" to be romantic. As for Rose, it was heartbreaking what she was willing to do in order to save, not only herself but her family, from poverty. I found my feelings varying from dislike to pity for her.The thing that I loved most about I Capture the Castle was the progression between how Cassandra was at the beginning of the novel up until the end. You truly see Cassandra grow up and become more of an adult. However, the feelings you get in regards to that are mixed because while you know she could use some growing up, you really don't want her to change from the enchanting person you met when you first started the novel. But I guess it really was necessary.I definitely recommend I Capture the Castle to everyone. It was an amazing classic novel that is still surprisingly relevant today despite that it was written so long ago. You can still relate to Cassandra and her problems and feel for her. You are charmed by her through every step of the way as she captures the castle and our hearts. Tremendous novel that I no doubt will read again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I, too, wish I had read this book when I was a teenager rather than my early 20s, but it is still a charming book that many women would probably appreciate. The narrator is likable, interesting and complex, and experiencing her first love, which is always an interesting thing to read about. Smith is able to keep the interest up until the very last pages - in some books the action is over too soon and the last chapter seems \\"tacked on\\", but that is not the case here. Cassandra's development and maturity really is the most interesting thing about the book overall.The other characters are also interesting, but realistic. Smith's commentary (via Cassandra) on the father, who is a post-war experimental writer is particularly interesting. As a scholar myself, I think it's always interesting to read about other scholars, whether fictional or historical, especially in a field like creative writing, where \\"genius\\" is a highly subjective thing.All in all, this was an enjoyable and rich book - but I think I won't be re-reading it until I have some daughters to read it too!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Remember when you were a kid, and reading a book felt so alive? You wanted to read it all the time, but you didn't want it to end? I don't get that feeling much anymore, but Dodie Smith delivered. The story is equal parts Bronte sisters and Jane Austen (as the narrator herself says) with a large dose of Little Women and some Shakespeare comedy thrown in for good measure. The narrator is as appealing as all get out, and then there's the pleasure of observing gentile poverty and the English weather and class system. Maybe a dash of Agatha Christie? And in the midst of all this sheer delight, a sensitive coming of age, sexual awakening story. I can't imagine a woman who wouldn't love this book, and maybe some men as well."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The author pulled me to the English countryside when romance was still romantic. I loved the characters and the castle. The Mortmains live in poverty for no reason except their eccentric father has writers block. The girls fall in love with wealthy brothers. At the same time I envisioned the story I envisioned a black and white film. This is a fun book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it. It is impossible not to love and admire the main character, and the story is impressively original, considering how stereotypical its plot appears at first glance. I could hardly put it down! I was a bit disappointed that the story ended where it did, but it made this book more interesting, more memorable. I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I really loved this quaint book. I found it funny and engaging, in a Jane Austen-ish sort of way. The characters are quirky and witty, and even though it would seem that not much happens in the castle, you can picture yourself there, and the story that moves with it is delightful."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. The narrator is a young girl, making the best of difficult, though quaint, circumstances. The novel is very funny as it describes the efforts of two young girls trying to find out who they are amidst difficult circumstances, and who the \\"meaningful other\\" is in their lives."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This is a literary gem that should, at the very least, be read by everyone who has a love for historical novels. It is a fantastic/appropriate read for both teens and adults, and I recommend it so much that I have had to buy several copies over the years - unsure of who has my last one when I find myself recommending it to yet another friend.I'm ordering two more copies today.The main character, Cassandra, is my favorite narrator of all time. She is witty, yet not overdone, and tells the story with an honest teen perspective. She is humiliated when a normal 17-year-old would feel so, and finds herself in completely realistic situations, rather than overly dramatic versions of reality. And yet there is SO much to laugh at, and feel agony over. The balance of wit and angst is perfect in my opinion.The ending is as surprising as any in literature, and still so real. It is not at all a novel where the story is wrapped up with a neat red bow, but rather one which makes you smile and say, \\"Ah, Cassandra, you are going to go places, my dear friend.\\" That is exactly how I feel about Cassandra - she is a dear friend who I wish could have told me story after story as her life progressed!This was a book that could have had many exciting sequels, but apparently wasn't as appreciated in its day as it should have been.Hooray for Dodie Smith - I wish she would have written 101 more novels :)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! Cassandra is such a great character, very carefully crafted and written. I can relate to many of the feelings and experiences she encounters.

I would totally recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story and a character with a great deal of intellegence and affection.

If the author had added a &quot;0&quot; to the sensational title and dealt with REAL WORLD facts and tips about making such a film this could've been a good book.

A lot can be said for taking that plunge into cold water and getting your feet wet. Although, some people want the prestige of a piece of paper from an institution. Most of the methods are sound, but the book is pretty much outdated for today's high tech world. Beginning filmmakers rarely shoot on film, but instead go for cheaper video.

BOTTOM LINE, this book should not be missed by anyone on the path to movie stardom! Yes, a few aspects may be farfetched, but isn't the whole premise of the book a lesson to those that want to break hollywood's stereotypical rules? After reading this book, the reader will at least come away with a well written, inspirational work that teaches many good tips on no-budget filmmaking. To try and fit no-budget filmmaking into any set of conventional rules is maddening and that was probably the problem of the others that trash-reviewed this book.

It covers everything from writing the script to funding and payment contracts to editing your final cut. However, due to the changing nature of the film business, after reading this book, you might want to move on to something more recent for more timely information.The datedness of the book shows in the financial guidelines (when it offers price quotes on services at a lab, for example), which are five years old at this point. It also shows in the section on editing. The author promotes editing on a work print of film rather than on a digital video system, such as AVID. It may have been more cost-effective to do so in 1995, but today non-linear editing is much preferred. The book has detailed instructions on how to edit film, but none on how to use one of these computer systems, which in many larger communities, are readily accessible.For a more realistic financial picture of making a film, try the more recent IFP/West Independent Filmmaker's Guide, which uses the budgets from the movie &quot;Swingers&quot; as examples."},{"Title":"Feature Filmmaking at Used-Car Prices: Revised Edition","review":"I bought this book about 10 years ago, from Amazon, but I still haven't read it.I switched career paths from film making to advertising.

And you shouldn't reject the content this book because of a typo (the other review says the book is dishonorable because it spells James Cagney as &quot;Cagny.&quot; I am just a regular guy, not an expert, and this book helps normal people, not people who are Hollywood stars already. Don't hold the book at a Hollywood standard because Independent filmmakers are trying to acheive that. The book does what it says it will do and more. Not only does it teach you how to write, produce, direct, film, edit, and produce a feature film for under $10,000, but there is also detailed instructions on how to make your own editing table to save money, how to buy a camera, and everything you'll need to direct/produce/shoot/edit/promote the film right down to the most intricate details. The only part I didn't like is the interview with Ray Carney, a film critic who is &quot;artsy&quot; and hates the films of Speilberg, Oliver Stone, etc. Skip over the interview if you buy the book.

Sure, it may never get onto film but what's the harm in trying?Secondly, addressing the question of how realistic the book is. I can't speak from experience but I think Kevin Smith can.

To understand Rick Schmidt's book it helps to know that a true independent production means that it is independent from Hollywood money (obviously) but also independent from it's influence, which is &quot;profits&quot; as the sole reason for making a movie. Most independent films are financed by major studios, and the same bottom line rule applys: to make money. That is why so much of what we see from independents is indistinguishable from anything else in Hollywood. To be truly independent means to be so in purpose and vision and approach. It is dishonest to call yourself an independent while all the time having one eye on the Hollywood &quot;bottom line&quot;. Rick's book seems to be designed for that independent spirit, people who want to make films as a means of truthfully exploring the world around them, and sharing a vision that is honest, meaningful,and real. John Cassavetes made films for this reason. So does Jon Jost, Charles Burnett(earlier films), and others.

The first period of jazz here was 1946-55, which pretty well coincides with the emergence of abstract art too. So during that post-war decade there was a huge revolution in public tastes, even though the first players were few and far between and not terribly with-it. In the 60s a number of the best jazz players were drawn to rock and pop - The Loved Ones and Peter Head (Headband) are good examples.Interestingly, there is no mention of Syrius's presence here ca.1970, even though Jackie Orszaczky is, in passing, as a funk player(see my review on two Syrius CDs here). In the early to mid 70s there was a huge interest in this music and it was being absorbed by players awake to its bounties. Bands like Mackenzie Theory (a heady and individual fusion of instrumental rock and jazz), the more commercial but talented Ayers Rock (Chicago meets Zappa and Weather Report on their 1st lp) and Crossfire (who later recorded with Michael Franks) showed the overseas influences surfacing here. Some of the best Oz players like Mike Nock, Roy Laird and Graham Morgan worked overseas.I recall seeing bands like Mahavishnu Orchestra, Eberhard Weber & Colours,Chico Freeman, Oregon, Dave Liebman Quintet (with Terumaso Hino), Weather Report, Miroslav Vitous with Stanley Clarke, and Herbie Mann in relatively quick succession. Later we saw Miles Davis, John McLaughlin (with Paco De Lucia and later his ca.1990 trio) but the big tours dried up from the late 80s.To me, Oz jazz started to get interesting from then, as local musos came to the fore. There was the odd great player, like Bernie McGann and Allan Browne who had stayed on, but now it began to take its place on the world stage. There are some of the most lively and interesting jazz musos in the world here: bands like Women and Children First, The Catholics, Clarion Fracture Zone, The Necks and Wanderlust have made or are making great music and plenty of recordings. I've even seen a guy I knew in Adelaide, Carl Orr, playing guitar with Billy Cobham.But Bodgie Dada tells a much wider story than the one seen through my eyes, even if it is a little skewed towards the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne. It's a lively tale from the Australian underground as one senses that jazz never really became mainstream here until the arrival of showmen like Vince Jones, Paul Grabowsky and James Morrison, and popular vocalists like Kate Ceberano. Loads of colour and black and white photos underscore my point about its serious rise to prominence and respect."},{"Title":"North to the Rails","review":"I miss Louis L'Amour. I first discovered him when I was in high school in the '80s, and I remember devouring his books one after another. I remember the sadness I felt when I found out he'd passed away. Though I prefer his Sackett stories (especially William Tell, my favorite Sackett), his chronicles of the Talon and Chantry families also make excellent reading. Heck, even his non-series novels are gripping (FALLON, FIRST FAST DRAW, BENDIGO SHAFTER, FLINT, REILLY'S LUCK...and these are just the ones off the top of my head; he's got many other fine novels). The very enjoyable NORTH TO THE RAILS is a Chantry novel.NORTH TO THE RAILS tells the story of young Tom Chantry, a businessman from New York who journeys to rugged Nevada and quickly garners a reputation for cowardice when he backs out of a gunfight. This hampers his attempts to purchase a herd of cattle as most folks in the Old West hold the quality of courage in high esteem, and no one now trusts Chantry. Tom does finally end up with steer when he makes a chancy deal with French Williams, a cattleman of canny but dubious nature. The deal is that Williams and his shifty cowhands will herd the beef if Chantry accompanies them for the duration of the cattle drive. If, at any time, Chantry falls out before the trail's end, then Williams gets every last steer for himself.Williams doesn't waste time in testing Chantry's mettle as he comes up with challenges and obstacles for Tom. But, here's the thing: just because a man doesn't believe in killing doesn't mean he won't fight for what he believes in. And Chantry may now be from the soft and civilized East, but he was born in the wild West, and his father, who had been a respected marshall, had taught him some things...Two things about the prolific Mr. L'Amour: he knew how to write bone-crunching action sequences which impact the reader on a primal level, and he was a master at conveying his great love for the West. Each western he wrote would inevitably offer rich and evocative passages not only about the land itself but about its people, its history, and its culture. Himself a self-made and self-taught man, he valued the quality of the hardy people who tamed the savage frontier.Here, he effectively delineates the difference between someone who inhabits the urbane and long-settled East, where culture and civilized living had greatly tempered one's survival instincts, versus a denizen of the brutal and uncompromising West, where one's life and livelihood directly hinged on one's ability to show valor, keep one's word, and, on occasion, draw a gun. I was glued to the pages as, with every escalating predicament, L'Amour inexorably peels away layer after layer of Chantry's civilized veneer. Tom starts out adamant in his refusal to sport a gun and he holds to this for a large portion of the book, until circumstances force him to re-evaluate his philosophy. He becomes progressively seduced by the West, until, late in the book, Tom glances at a mirror and sees \\"...a tall, bronzed young man with wide shoulders, narrow hips, and a quietly commanding way about him.\\" In Louis L'Amour's eyes, this is the very definition of a man of the West.NORTH TO THE RAILS is action-packed, believe me, full of fist fights and, later, gun battles. Tom Chantry proves to be a very rootable protagonist as he is battered and wounded and bushwhacked but remains resolute. The can't miss premise (that of a perceived naive and out-of-his-depth character who actually turns out to have \\"sand,\\" is resourceful, determined, and quite handy at kicking outlaw arse) hooked me in straightaway. The author, as usual, throws in a lot of nasty bad guys (there's even a female villainess) and a ton of peril down our dude's way. For the most part, L'Amour doesn't really take the time to flesh out his supporting characters so we're left with a lot of stereotypical cardboard cutouts here. He does give some much needed depth to French Williams and presents him with such an enigmatic stature that I didn't know which side he would ultimately be on. I also liked Sun Chief, though he was depicted in very broad strokes.In my life, there are only two authors in the western genre: Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour. I've tried other authors of the \\"Cowboys and Injuns\\" ilk but have since learned to accept no substitutes. NORTH TO THE RAILS isn't even in the top tier of L'Amour's best works. Nevertheless, it can't help but entertain its readers. And, if you want to read about Tom Chantry's dad, take a peek at BORDEN CHANTRY."},{"Title":"North to the Rails","review":"Tom Chantry came from the East to the West to buy cattle then bring them to the railroads at Dodge. But when he backs down from a shoot-out with a drunk named Dutch Akins, everyone takes him for a coward and a man who doesn't keep his word. Tom can't find anyone now to buy cattle from or even help move them to the railroads. Tom must learn that he is now in the untamed land of the west where there is no law but only a man's courage and his gun.Then Tom shocks everyone with how much nerve he has. He makes a deal with French Williams, a well-known man who everyone accuses of stealing cattle though there is no proof. He is said to be able to swindle anyone out of a cow deal. Tom says to Williams that if French Williams will supply the men to help take the herd to the rails, Chantry will give him some shares of the profit. Then Tom makes the deal more interesting. He says that if he himself can't keep up with the outfit and doesn't make it to Dodge City, French Williams will get all of the profit. Williams agrees to it.Now Tom must be sure to keep up with the herd. But everyone forgets that his father was the famous Borden Chantry and that Tom knows what he's doing. Though at first he is against having a gun, he buys himself a gun and a rifle. And not only does he know how to shoot, he knows how to fight. Local outlaws and gunmen mistake him for a victim but they were going to learn that he is no greenhorn and not a man to be trifled with.This is a great book to read!! When I first read it, I had such a hard time putting it down when I had to do other things. I couldn't stop reading it. It's very exciting and suspenseful. The character of Tom Chantry is really likable and I was rooting him on throughout the whole book. But probably my most favorite character in the book was French Williams. He is cool, smart, fast with a gun, and a very honorable man. He might steal cattle from others and swindle people out of a cattle deal, he still is very nice and trustworthy. Then there's also the character of Mr. Sparrow. He's very mysterious yet nice and kind, and strangely very attached to Tom Chantry, even though they hardly know each other. But if I tell to much about him, I'll spoil the story."},{"Title":"North to the Rails","review":"I used to wonder why anyone read L'Amour when all the plots seemed the same. At some point, I picked up one (probably on vacation) and now I'm hooked. Sure, they're predictable - but so are 98% of the shows on TV. It doesn't mean they're not enjoyable.I probably won't review many westerns, but this is a great one if you don't know which of his dozens to choose."},{"Title":"North to the Rails","review":"A pleasing, unusual Western from genre master Louis L'Amour, \\"North To The Rails\\" is a fast-moving account of a cattle drive up the hard country of the American southwest, led by a man from back East who must choose between a moral code that hates guns and showing his fellow cowboys he is tough enough to live through his assignment.\\"I believe a lot more can be done by reason than by guns,\\" says the man, Tom Chantry, whose father Borden was killed by the gun (and was the subject of another L'Amour western.) Arguing against that philosophy are several nasty cowpokes, including the cunning French Williams, who schemes to take Chantry's cattle away from him even as he goes through the motions of helping him out.That's not really a spoiler, as French is curiously upfront about what he's up to, in an amiably roundabout way. Williams is one of many welcome elements in L'Amour's 1971 novel, giving you what you expect in terms of the flavor of the Old West, but not in the expected ways.When we first meet Tom Chantry, he's about to be dry-gulched by the nasty Talrim brothers. \\"This is raw country,\\" he is told later, after he explains his policy about weapons. \\"The good folks are good because it's their nature, and the bad can run to meanness until someone fetches them up short.\\"L'Amour seems at times to be making points to modern audiences, as the early 1970s were about the time people began arguing about American firearms laws, questioning precisely those tenets of liberty and self-protection L'Amour's oeuvre espoused. For L'Amour, it's a question of circumstances. In the East, people can count on police and a code of refinement to keep them safe and unchallenged. But out West, in the years after the Civil War, there was no such civilizing insulation from life's crueler side, just the hard truth of it. Maintaining one's freedom depends on one's willingness to not only have beliefs, but fight for them, lethally if necessary.At the same time, L'Amour presents Chantry's side of the argument with fairness, showing it not only a deeply-felt position but at times a practical one. Again, it boils down to circumstances. Chantry's story becomes one of making choices, of showing he has the right amount of \\"sand\\" to tough out the challenges before him but maintaining a sense of integrity, of living up to the ideals he rode in with.L'Amour makes this dilemma entertaining, and at the same time sweeps you up on a good cattle drive story, one up there with \\"Red River\\" for all its shifting loyalties and plot twists. Like H. Bala pointed out in a March 2007 review, the supporting cast comes off a bit cardboard at times, not all of them producing a real payoff despite the care L'Amour puts into introducing them.But there's a nice through-line the whole way across the novel that leads to a somewhat offbeat if satisfying end. Everything in this L'Amour novel can be described that way, offbeat but satisfying, and it provides more than the usual enjoyment you get from reading the Old West master."},{"Title":"North to the Rails","review":"Tom Chantry (Borden Chantry's son) having lived in the east since his fathers death, now comes west to buy cattle for shippment back east.

Tom leaves town after being challenged to a gunfight, the word gets around, and everybody believes him to be a coward.

He inherited this belief because his own father had been gunned down when he was a boy. After his father's death, he moved to the east and that is where he grew up. As a young man, he came west to buy, drive, and ship cattle back east. He thought he would have no need for a gun, but soon became known as a coward because of his beliefs.

Louis L'amour wrote the book. It is a western. A young man from the east comes to buy cattle and ship them on the railroad. He buys 2,000 cattle and drives them to the railroad which is moving westward. His business depends on him and the cattle but he encounters many problems along the way. I have read many books by Louis L'amour and they are all good. This one kept my attenion very well and had a good plot. &quot;I am not a coward. I simply do not believe in carrying guns, and I do not believe in killing.&quot;pg.16. One of the main problems in the book is that the main character, Tom Chantry, will not carry a gun. That gets him in a couple of fights with people. That also makes him defensless against anyone who want to push him around. When he gots tired of people pushiing him around he decides to change his mind. He was not use to having to use guns because he comes form the east where there is law and order. In the west there is no law and people kill people and it is no big deal.

There are only four speeches total in this volume, so one hopes there will be more to come. At least the celebrated &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech of 1963 is featured in its entirety. The speech still gives me the chills after all these years and remains the standard by which all speeches should be judged. It is the greatest speech of the 20th century, and for anybody to include it complete deserves at least three stars for including it."},{"Title":"MLK: The Martin Luther King, Jr. Tapes","review":"This is an excellent collection of King Speeches. It begins with the 1963 Detroit Speech, where &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; was first heard. This is filled with raw, barbed humor that most people don't presently associate with Dr. King. Next is the March on Washington Speech, which has the better knonw version of &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;. Much of that is quite stiff before he gets to the Dream segement. Then we have the &quot;Mountaintop&quot; speech of 1968, which is all the more remarkable when you consider this was done without any notes. It conclues rather fittingly with Bobby Kennedy's eulogy of Dr. King, which is made all the more poignant since Bobby Kennedy was also killed just a few weeks later.

What I got is a portfolio of images of one mans's personal choices, and very little of universal interest. There is very little discussion of shape beyond the statement that \\"Successful woodturning ultimately stands or falls on the shapes used...\\" It tells us nothing about what makes some shapes better and others worse, or what a good shape is, or how to achieve one, and it tells us virtually nothing about the symbolism, or emotional impacts of shapes, their history, or ideas that might be associated with them.In short, Woodturning_A sourcebook of shapes, is little more than a gallery of images that illustrate Mr. Hunnex's personal production of a range of simple bowl shapes. Many of his bowls are nice enough, but most of them are conservative and traditional, and some, in MHO, could use some work. There is hardly a piece illustrated that could be considered groundbreaking, exceptional, or even very interesting.Hunnex's book may provide inspiration in one or a few cases, to try shapes one may not have considered turning before, but basically, there are many other books currently available, showing collections of much better, more artistic turnings, which should provide much greater inspiration, and much more enjoyable viewing than this one."},{"Title":"Woodturning: A Source Book of Shapes","review":"I checked the reviews on Amazon before buying this book.

However, I feel that this book will only be helpful to those who have never been exposed to anything but the most mainstream of religious ideas. Some of it is downright offensive -- Tom Sawyer is quite an arrogant character, talking about himself in the 3rd person, and he reflects, apparently proudly judging from the tone, on the days in his life when he frequently kicked people's a**'s and dominated his wife in a manner that is borderline abusive. Furthermore, he makes frequent contradictions of his own message (All religions are valid and God is unconditional love, BUT suicides (and apparently ONLY suicides) go to hell, even if they are retarded and not capable of making good judgments).Having read a great deal of NDE literature, it seems that Tom, just like many people who experience an NDE, believes that his wonderful experience was THE TRUTH (TM). It's worth noting that almost everyone who has an NDE feels this way, and many of those accounts contradict. I am not saying that I doubt that there is something real going on here. What I think, rather, is that God presents himself in the manner that will be most helpful to each individual person, and the experience of God is so powerful that people come back thinking they have the ONE TRUTH. Tom tries to avoid sounding this way, but it's obvious he feels it -- he claims that he went to Heaven (the real deal) while other NDE'ers who might contradict him just go to Paradise (some lesser Heaven that isn't really the abode of God -- in other words, not as real as his experience).Also, he makes a lot of predictions about what will happen to the Earth that, of course, never happened - the nuclear apocalypse is about 10 years late, by his reckoning. This is also something a lot of NDE'ers do.If you're going to read, tread lightly; soak up the message of unconditional love and use your own best judgment when considering the weird/bad stuff."},{"Title":"What Tom Sawyer Learned from Dying","review":"Tom Sawyer gives more insight into the workings of the universe than anyone I have read.

This play is one of his best, and is quite often revived for performance over in the British Isles. It is an intriguing story of love, friendship, hate, disloyalty, and treachery. Heywood skillfully walks us through the emotions, and there are few surprises lurking in the text, as not everything happens as we expect, and the price of honor turns out to be high, but not higher then of love. As is the custom of Elizabethean drama we have a main plot, and we also have a subplot, which serves to highlight the main plot. These two are complimentary, and highlight each others failings very nicely. When characters of the main plot make the wrong choices, the sub plot shows us the right choice in a similar situation, and thus the play is doubly effective. Highly recommended to see that there were other great playwrights besides Shakespeare in the Elizabethean drama, and that they are only unknown today, because Shakespeare was such a giant, that he overshadows, even very competent writers, who would have shinned brightly in any other period."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Adapted from Grimm's Fairy Tales","review":"Since this is a book taken from Disney's film version, I can see where much change was made.

The huntsman can't bring himself to do it, so he warns her and tells her to run, which she does. Finding a small house, with the help of forest animals who have befriended her, Snow White cleans it up in hopes of being invited to stay. The owners of the house, seven dwarfs, find her there when they return from work and decide that she should stay - and that she should be very careful from now on. When an old woman comes to the cottage, offering Snow White an apple, she fails to see the harm until it's too late. Certain that she's dead, the dwarfs give her a coffin of glass and gold and she lies there until her prince comes and wakes her with a kiss.ISBN 0717283437Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney's Wonderful World of Reading), ASIN B001KTSRIWSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs- 5 stars - This edition, from Grolier and Disney, has no author or illustrator listed. Adapted from the Disney film and taking images directly from it, this will be among the most recognizable version to young children. The storyline differences are few. This one begins with Snow White being born and mentions that Snow White's father died (but making no mention of her mother), leaving her living with her stepmother. Snow White, doing her chores one day, drew water from the well and wished for a handsome prince to carry her away. When he appears, falling instantly in love, Snow White flees. The prince never forgets her, searching for her until he finds her in the casket made for her by the dwarfs. This is the first time I've ever read a version with the prince making such an early appearance. Also in this edition, the dwarfs are called, by the animals, to return to Snow White's side and, on their way to her, they spot the Queen and chase her to the top of a cliff, where a bolt of lightning knocks her to her death just as she is about to roll a boulder at the dwarfs. No Disney's Wonderful World of Reading collection is complete without this classic.ISBN 0785310320Snow White (Little Rainbow Books)- 3 stars - This edition, A Little Rainbow Book, is all right but nothing special. The look of this edition clearly attempts to copy the Little Golden Books. The cover illustration, by Kenny Yamada, is the best of the lot. The inside illustrations, by Gary Torrisi are just about average, lacking in detail and a bit boring. The adaptation by Dorothea Goldenberg is fair. The text flows well and the words are simple, a plus for young readers. Several small differences in the story made it boring for me but might appeal to others. Snow White is simply banished to the forest - there's no huntsman and no threat of death at that point. Rather than jump straight to the poison apple, the Queen tries a poisoned comb first, which is a little closer to the original tale. However, it is very strange that, after that attempt, no special warnings to be careful follow. The gold and/or glass coffin is left out here, and the dwarfs place Snow White on a bed of rose petals and moss. The Queen is not killed. Those things add up to a far less violent/scary tale but, again, they make the story boring to me.ISBN 1845770773Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- 4 stars - This edition, from the Early Readers Treasured Tales series would probably merit a 3 star review, if not for the \\"points to help you teach your child to read\\" in the front. It's such a nice addition to this average re-telling, edited by Claire Black, that it deserves a star all its own. This edition begins a little earlier than the Disney one, with Snow White's pregnant, happy mother and how she chooses Snow White's name. There are questions at the bottom of several pages (\\"Why was the princess called Snow White?\\" for example). They are unobtrusive, so they don't interfere if you just choose to read the book, but are useful for comprehension - one \\"point\\" to help a child learn to read. Some versions leave out the Queen's order to the huntsman that he must bring back Snow White's heart in a box - this one does not omit that detail, but it does leave out the Queen's death. If the heart in a box thing is something you think your child will have issues with, this isn't your edition. The illustrations here, by Eric Kincaid, are very well done and more true to the Grimms Brothers version than the Disney oneISBN 0307010368Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- 5 stars - Having read a number of collaborations between Disney and Golden Books recently, I'm so happy to find them back on track with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The illustrations are standard Disney, the story is complete and well told. Unlike recent reads from Disney/Golden Books, Snow White hits every important note of the original without seeming hurried. I still think it's one dwarf, two dwarves... but grammar is nowhere near as important as a fairy tale! For those parents who stress about these things, there's no violence and the single presumed death is vague, to say the least. Well worth picking up for your little reader.ISBN 0786834285Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- 3 stars - Printed in China. Age range not stated. Adapted by Liza Baker and illustrated by Atelier Philippe Harchy. The text is simple, a bit boring and just doesn't flow very well. The illustrations are great, just a little small. This is a small book, slightly larger than pocket-sized, with a pillowed hardcover. Good for taking along when you're out. This edition has a number of details that are different from the others I've read. The story begins with the prince hearing Snow White singing. Though he tries to find her, she hides, so he serenades her from the courtyard. The heart in the box part is not in this book. When the Queen shows up at the cottage, the animals try to stop her and, failing, go to warn the dwarfs. Too late to save Snow White, the dwarfs chase the Queen to the top of a cliff where lightning breaks off the ledge she stands on (she disappears forever but isn't said to be dead).- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Search for Love","review":"First, let me say, I'm a huge fan of NR. This book just wasn't as good as most of her other stories. I just couldn't get into the storyline and felt the book was lacking some depth."},{"Title":"Search for Love","review":"Search for Love is about Serenity Smith, a woman who has just lost her parents, then travels from Washington D.C. to France to meet with her grandmother, whom she'd never known. There she meets Christophe de Kergallen, the Count of Kergallen, whose grandfather married Serenity's grandmother after they were both widowed with children.While Serenity is a fiery, vibrant, stubborn woman, Christophe is an icy, arrogant, and equally stubborn man. Serenity's independence and spunk makes her a fine heroine who you'll love, Christophe on the other hand can be hard to deal with, you'll either love him or hate him. At times you want to smack this hero with how smug and overbearing he can be and you can feel the frustration Serenity feels while dealing with Christophe. But through the story sparks fly as these two try to deny the passion they feel for one another. The secondary characters are great and I hope to see them in another book or two.Though this story is quite different from Nora Roberts usual tales, it still packs quite a punch and you can see how diverse she is in her talent. This is more a gothic tale than any of her others I have read. As a gothic tale, it is one of the best, as a Nora Roberts, while not her best, it is a very solid tale that is timeless. It may not be for everyone, but I'd say give it a try!"},{"Title":"Search for Love","review":"Search for Love has a very similar plot as that of Island of Flowers also written by Nora Roberts. I'm wondering if in the beginning of her writing career she used the same basic plot outline and tweaked it a bit for a new book? This seems to be the trend with romance novels from a couple of decades ago where the cookie-cutter plots were very evident, and could be a possibility of this one.Search for Love begins with Serenity Smith arriving in a foreign country to meet the grandmother she never knew. She's picked up at the train station by her French cousin, Christophe and driven to meet her grandmother.Christophe doesn't trust Serenity and feels she's only coming to meet her grandmother and renew family ties in order to obtain part of the wealth from the older woman and Christophe feels obligated to protect her. Standard plot, right? Well, there are a few differences...Christophe is technically Serenity's cousin, but it's a relation by marriage not blood - his grandfather married her grandmother. The landscaping of the countryside is magnificently described during this tale. Roberts goes into great detail about the flowing hills, gorgeous flowers, etc.; it's enough for a very vivid mental image. Soon, the beauty fades into accusations - a forged painting and family honor are a few of the reasons Serenity's grandmother disowned her mother and father.Even though Christophe is convinced Serenity is only after money, he's soon shown the true heart of Serenity with her quick flare of temper at the accusations against her parents. When her grandmother accuses Serenity's parents of stealing a very valuable painting and leaving a forgery behind in its place, Serenity is quick to come to their defense and plans on leaving the chateau immediately if her grandmother cannot refrain from such behavior. This flare of temper isn't as strong as what we've seen in more recent characters created by Roberts, but there is a peek of the strong female personalities that evolved later on in her career.The standard \\"opposing sides fall hopelessly in love\\" and the happy-ever-after ending are very predictable but it shouldn't deter you from reading this book. It's not a story that will tax your brain and can be read quickly. I'd recommend it if you need a short break, and want vivid images of the French countryside, a gorgeous chateau, a handsome characters, etc. It's a nice way to spend a few hours of \\"down time\\" and will let you catch your breath before you go back to the rat race of life."},{"Title":"Search for Love","review":"3.5 starsSerenity Smith had just lost her beloved parents when a letter from an estranged grandmother invited her to visit her. Excited to find new relatives, Serenity hied off to France to be welcome with a cold shoulder from her grandmother and her grandson, Christophe de Kergallen. Realizing the truth of why her parents were estranged, Serenity was going to prove her parents' innocence and maybe show Christophe that she was not interested in marrying him. How hard can it be?There was a constant tug-of-war of love and hate. I loved the heroine's confidence and honesty. However, I doubt her admission of falling in love so quickly when the hero have done nothing to deserve it. It was more like falling in lust than in love. I did enjoy the heroine's mercurial moods and her witty tongue but the hero robbed the show. The hero was an arrogant donkey's bottom, constantly abusing the heroine. And when she gave as good as she got, he would kiss into her submission, accusing her that it was her fault that he had to punish her all the time. What a jerk. He had no redeeming qualities and never really grew as a person as the story developed. This story could've been so much better if the hero was an actual decent human being but with him as a leading actor, the story failed miserably as a romance. The only light at the end of the tunnel was the plot, the writing and the rest of the cast. This is a clean romance.If you are a fan of Harlequin Presents and Silhouette Desire-type books and abusive heroes who like to push around the heroine, you will love this. Everyone else? This can be a miss."},{"Title":"Search for Love","review":"I really HATE it when I buy a book thinking it was a new one, only to find it written in '08.

While the characters don't blow you away, they aren't boring or tepid. Everything seems to flow quite well. This isn't Ms. Nora Robert's best by any means; in fact, it is unlike her typical writing style. Maybe this is due to the fact that this 1992 story is pretty early in her career.On the narrator...I really enjoyed Ms. Hendrix and I think she added to the story rather than taking anything away. I found the voices used for each character to be distinctive.Overall...I found the whole cousins but not cousins thing to be kind of weird. I couldn't figure out the relationship. I loved that the romance wasn't sudden and while the reader/listener could see it coming, it was understandable that the characters didn't.

It is thus an open question how much of the work comes from Welsh myths which have otherwise been lost. At the same time, the historical accuracy of the work is not very high.I rather liked the translation by Lewis Thorpe. His style is fairly matter-of-fact but nonetheless allows it to be read in a manner similar to the more challenging novels of today. All in all, I would highly recommend this work to anyone studying older Welsh material as well as those looking for the genesis of the Arthurian stories."},{"Title":"Why Are We Created? Increasing Our Understanding of Humanity's Purpose on Earth","review":"REEVIEW OF; ?WHY ARE WE CREATED,? BY Sir John Templeton and Rebekah Alezander Dunlap.This is a valuable book, a small one of less than 150 pages, it is packed with seemingly unanserable questions over which we may ponder, yet with many suggested pathways our thought processes might follow.There is much to be gained by pondering these questions, which makes the work far greater than its lack of bulk. It is a book about human potential, which builds evidence of humanity possessing a ?Splendor that can Shine,? as potential already achieved.The language gets lyrical, even within the introduction, talking about humans possessing , ?The ability to choose to move to a higher spiritual level of consciousness...?, (my italics,). It speaks of, ?A divine intelligence flowing through all of us,? and offers guidance on living this potential. It states, ?As we begin to elevate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of daily decision making in our individual lives, surely we will be making progress on the path of the sacred quest for all of humanity.?The book draws material from all major religions, and attempts as broad a sweep as possible to avoid seeming to favor any one path or philosophy. When posing the question about some creative source of the universe, it does lean toward a positive assumption to give life and meaning to the questioning process. Then poses a further question, ?Has our human concept of this creative source been too small??Much of the book hints at knowledge beyond our understanding, and things that are unseen being much more than that which is seen. This offers the reader a major puzzle to ponder, for if a thing lies beyond our ability to understand it, what might that thing mean to us?Living life with a purpose is a major theme in the myriad of questions populating the pages. It makes the statement that ?The most fascinating phase of the human journey is its spiritual development,? and then adds that, ?Purpose is already there within us...waiting to be discovered.?One major theme in the book has to do with a person having the opportunity to feel part of a vast cosmic experiment, one encompassing all of creation, including themselves, just by being alive.If giving reasons for a person to live a spiritual life makes this a religious book, then it is one of the most religious books I have ever read. It states, ?What we are is the creator?s gift to us. What we may become is our gift to the creator.? It then adds, ?The person who is willing to say ?yes? to experience is the person who often discovers new frontiers.?I personally found the concluding pages of the book to be a challenging summary of the material, and the many questions posed within. It is a book for the 21st century. The book urges a synthesis of the main themes within all major religions to be a new understanding for the 21st century human. One that will better equip that human to answer the primary question that is the title of the book, ?Why Are We Created.?"},{"Title":"Why Are We Created? Increasing Our Understanding of Humanity's Purpose on Earth","review":"\\"Why Are We Created?: Increasing Our Understanding Of Humanity's Purpose On Earth\\" by Sir John Templeton and Rebeka Alezander Dunlap is a four hour and ten minute audiobook recording on four CDs. Expertly narrated by Brea Brannon and Len Stea, \\"Why Are We Created?\\" addresses such issues as whether or not happiness is related to our purpose, or it our purpose is related to our happiness. If a person places a particular virtue such as honesty at the top of his list of personal ethics what benefit does this bring to him and to others around him? Sir John Templeton felt that there is more to life than what we may presently be experiencing and that we might be living successfully in the outer world, but that it was essential for our happiness to also live successfully in our inner world. Indeed, it was through awakening our spiritual faculties that we can begin to move closer to understanding our personal purpose in life -- and the power of that purpose to drive and shape our lives. \\"Why Are We Created\\" is thoughtful and thought- provoking listening for anyone trying to understand themselves and their relationship to themselves and to the people who surround them. Also very highly recommended from the Templeton Foundation Press are two other new CD formatted audiobook releases: \\"Wisdom From World Religions: Pathways Toward Heaven On Earth\\" (Sir John Templeton, 1932031839, $29.95) and \\"Possibilities For Over One Hundredfold More Spiritual Information: The Humble Approach In Theology And Science (Sir John Templeton, 1932031847, $14.95)."},{"Title":"The Staggerford Murders and The Life and Death Nancy Clancy's Nephew","review":"About as cozy as cozy can get, THE STAGGERFORD MURDERS has the feel of \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" crossed with Jan Karon's Mitford series. Written from the viewpoint of Grover, an ancient geezer; Dusty, an even more ancient geezer; and Ollie, Dusty's nephew --- plus a couple of others --- the first of the two novellas has a distinctive down-home flavor. The three main characters live in the Ransford Hotel in Staggerford, Minnesota. Grover manages the old hotel, a somewhat decrepit place on its way out. The other two live there and sit around, jawing with Grover to pass the time.One day, a letter is published in the Weekly, the local news source, asking for any clues leading to the whereabouts of Blanche Nichols, a woman who disappeared nine years before, and is signed by her daughter. Since the little town of Staggerford doesn't see a lot of mystery, the letter's intriguing request causes quite a stir --- at least among the hotel's residents. Through ruminations and revelations, the old guys stumble upon what happened, who murdered who, and what to do about it now.Author Jon Hassler writes with an easy style, making THE STAGGERFORD MURDERS a pleasant escape.In THE LIFE AND DEATH OF NANCY CLANCY'S NEPHEW, the book's second novella, the reader is treated to a glimpse into W.D. Nestor's rather unhappy existence. The saying goes that you reap what you sow, but W.D. doesn't seem to deserve what comes his way. True, he is surrounded by family and friends, but they could be more understanding and less indifferent. His daughter and son both have a huge gap where their hearts should be.Once upon a time W.D. had a great love, the mother of his children. Their lives together numbered too few, as she was taken from him long before he was ready to wind down. The days pass with W.D. becoming more and more curmudgeonly. Finally, he finds a friend in Kevin, a young lad he meets at the local library. For eight years, W.D. and Kevin fill a need in each other's lives. Unfortunately, Kevin grows up and enters the army. By the time they see each other again, W.D. has grown older --- at an alarmingly accelerated rate --- and his days are definitely numbered. Just as W.D.'s life had few genuine thrills, his death could have gone almost unnoticed were it not for Aunt Nancy Clancy.As in THE STAGGERFORD MURDERS, the characters make the story come alive.

In his latest offering, Hassler presents two novellas in very different tones. The first, The Staggerford Murders, is a farce of the first order. A letter appears in the Staggerford newspaper from Penny Jean Nichols, from Fresno, California, asking for information about her mother, Blanche Nichols, who disappeared from Staggerford nine years ago. Her father had been murdered in front of the local movie theater at that time, and her mother disappeared without a trace.The \\"detectives\\" in this case are Grover, the 81-year-old desk clerk at the run-down Ransford Hotel, and his two friends, Dusty Luuya, a resident who is limited in his abilities, and Ollie Luuya, his nephew, a former derelict, now a born again preacher. Unearthing a series of shocking allegations against Neddy Nichols and others, they, Penny Jean, and her husband are soon examining the man her mother married immediately after Neddy Nichols's murder. Bizarre natural and accidental deaths, and a murder trial for the murder of a dead body are among the absurdities Hassler features, as he piles irony upon irony and twist upon twist, revealing the dark underbelly of humanity, even in Staggerford.\\"The Life and Death of Nancy Clancy's Nephew\\" is totally different in tone. This sensitive character study focuses on W. D. Nestor, a seventy-two-year-old turkey farmer. Through vivid word pictures, the life of W.D. unfolds, detailing his marriage to his wife Lucille while she was still in high school, their contented, but uncommunicative, marriage, and W.D.'s late-in-life befriending of a young boy, the poorest player on the local Little League team. When he is eighty-two, he visits his Aunt Nancy, almost one hundred, and through this visit, shows the reader that this is the story of an old man assessing at his life just before his death.These two novellas, one hilariously funny and one sadly introspective, separately emphasize the two characteristics which make Hassler's novels so vibrant. His characters are often humorous and always believable, their dialogue pitch perfect. At the same time, Hassler details moments of touching sadness as he shows the high and low points in the lives of these ordinary men. Sensitive, full of wry moments, and realistic in the vision of small-town America, Hassler's novels are among literary America's best kept secrets.

Almost a decade has passed since someone killed Staggerford, Minnesota Chamber of Commerce employee Neddy Nicholls and his wife Blanche vanished. Neither mystery was resolved. Now their daughter Penny Jean comes from California to uncover what happened to her mother. Her former husband George follows her home. At the Ransford Hotel, several townsfolk discuss her ad in the Staggerford Weekly asking for help into the disappearance of her mom. The upbeat frenetic pace feels like it belongs in A Mad Mad Mad Mad World as not much is taken seriously but at times the tale is difficult to follow. Still, this is a good entry in the Staggerford folklore.Nancy Clancy's Nephew. Septuagenarian W.D. Nestor grew up on a prairie farm raised by an abusive father. As an adult W.D. hid his feelings with the only persons he cared about being his spouse Lucille and his two children. As he talks to a psychiatrist giving him the third degree, he reflects back over his miserable life to the one shining star the night he and Lucille wed during a snowstorm. He actually makes friend with a young boy, but finds no peace until a decade later when he visits his century old Aunt Nancy Clancy. Though well written this is not an upbeat tale as typically provided by Jon Hassler; instead the protagonist is a grim soul with little that is positive in his life.Both tales are well written, but seem totally opposites in outlook. Ironically, the murder-disappearance mystery is cheerful while the biographical fiction piece is depressing. Although fans of Mr. Hassler will enjoy the two novellas, readers will realize neither is quite on a par with THE STAGGERFORD FLOOD.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Playboy of the Western World (Audio Theatre Series)","review":"It is a wild, woolly, farcical, slapstick, poetic-philosophical comedy, which deserves a reading, as the Irish accents can be largely non-understandable.

It was well worth the wait. Myra Sims with her intriguing combination of strength and vulnerability is a character well worth the closer look we get in this book.

I was thoroughly impressed by the skill with which Janis Owens accomplished this without even a hint of redundancy. I was moved by this story of tragedy and victory set in a rural south so familiar I felt like it was home.

You'll share Myra's pain when she is torn between two brothers, Gabe and Michael, who love her perhaps too much. And you'll rejoice when Myra finds the strength to love herself in the end.

Myra returns the favor in her own version of the story in Myra Sims. By reading both books you are able to get closer to the bottom of what might be closer to the truth. Janis Owens can sure tell a story and what's even better is that she can tell a story twice. Readers will devour both books and after doing so might just become confused about which version to believe. One thing is sure, both books move you right next door to a real Southern family.

This story is a walk through the hell of abuse and its' long lasting effects. Redeeming in the telling is the long journey of survival, hope and sanity. Those who have lived in the dark pit will recognize it. Those who haven't would do well to listen to Myra's voice, for she hands out a good 'dose' of healing humanity."},{"Title":"Myra Sims","review":"Having consumed My Brother Michael in one sitting, I was looking forward to Myra Sims with great anticipation and was not disappointed. The author has an amazing way of drawing you into the world her characters live in with charm and skill. She carries you through her books like you're riding a tube down a lazy river on a sunny, summer afternoon; easy and seamless. You keep reading to see what's around the next bend. The voices of her characters ring true and their stories leave you thinking about them for days. I have read and re-read all of Janis' books and each time I see a deeper story emerge. She did a great job of re-telling the story without being boring or redundant. Instead the stories get richer, like many facets of a jewel; deeper colors and hues emerge as you move from book to book."},{"Title":"Myra Sims","review":"This excellent book fills in all the gaps left out by Gabriel Catts in the previous book, MY BROTHER MICHAEL.

It takes the reader to live with the Catts family and you don't want to leave. Janis Owens has a way of bringing small town USA to everyone."},{"Title":"The Net Dude","review":"I'll start out by saying that this book was an OK read. Not great, but not terrible, either. The story was interesting enough, but it was a little too fast paced with too many events packed into the few pages available.Having said that, I must admit - between the flurry of acronyms, the superfluous techno-babble and the overly specific inner workings of (late-90's) computer networking - I found this a difficult read. Unless you are an IT Network Specialist whose favorite pastime is reading Microsoft SQL user manuals for enjoyment, this may not be the book for you. I'm a professional computer technician and I was bored with the sheer volume of technical details presented on every page. It is (painfully) obvious that this was written by a networking guru.I did manage to finish the book, partially so that my review would be based on the entire work, but also to see where the story went. I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the ending. I won't give anything away, but I will say that, as a reader who just invested 150 pages of my time, I deserved better!Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of \\"the Net Dude\\" as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team.

I have a few of them and will try to write a few reviews so potential buyers know a little more about these classic works. I originally purchased this particular volume to help me with my Latin classes in college. The red Loeb volumes are Latin and the green volumes are Greek. The english translation is on the right page and the original text is on the left which makes these volumes perfect for anyone studying the languages. A little about this book.... Seneca was a philosopher of the stoic school and wrote several books on his worldview. These moral essays are a combination of his thoughts and ideas written as a letter to his friend Lucilius. They include On Providence, On Firmness, On Anger, and On Mercy. They were most likely written for the emperor Nero who Seneca tutored and ended up becoming one of his closest advisors and some argue he actually ran the empire for awhile. Nero eventually turned on him and Seneca was forced to commit suicide in 65 CE. There are not many books on stoicism and even less on Seneca. One very good volume is Roman Stoicism by E.V. Arnold. Long out of print, but you still may be able to find it somewhere. Another good one is Seneca: The Life of a Stoic by Paul Veyne; this is really the best biography of Seneca. Both very good books if you want to learn more."},{"Title":"Seneca: Moral Essays, Volume I (Loeb Classical Library No. 214)","review":"The surviving corpus of Seneca's Moral Essays are his earliest works, yet they contain many of his fully developed Stoic ideals. All the essays are generally short, with the exception of Seneca's treatise On Anger; and they are all moral exhortations written in a direct manner and in a style both convincing and charming. The contents of these Essays left their mark upon the writings of the Latin Church Fathers, of which many would have enjoyed seeing Seneca sainted; and they preceded the later burst of Plutarch's voluminous corpus of Moral Essays by just over a century and probably provided the great writer with an excellent model despite the disparity of language with Seneca. In this first volume the treatises included are (1) On Providence (2) On Firmness (3) On Anger (4) and On Mercy, which is addressed to the emperor Nero. These volumes are an important source for Roman Stoicism and they are recommended for students as a primer for the later philosophic finishes that they are destined to face."},{"Title":"The Old Detective's Daughter","review":"The old Dective's Daughter is a delight to read! It is a well done mystery that captures the attention and keeps you reading. But it is more than a mystery, it is a heart filled story beautifully weaves the past and present together, touching upon issues relevent to many of our lives."},{"Title":"The Old Detective's Daughter","review":"The characters and places are very vivid in this book. The story strikes a balance between standard detective story and the nature of family relationships. A.V. Spencer's description of the title character's encounter with the health care industry is particularly chilling."},{"Title":"The Old Detective's Daughter","review":"The mystery novel has long been a genre that authors have used to deliver a compelling story while also including a serious theme. This book interested me from the start because it used the genre so well, which is why I agreed to write the foreword. The story is certainly compelling--centered around an aging man's search for his long-estranged daughter. This is one of those stories where the detective herself (yes, a woman detective, as the title implies) is emotionally drawn into the case as discovering the whereabouts of her client's daughter also uncovers the detective's grievances with her own father. A.V. Spencer gracefully weaves these parallel stories together, in a tale that will take every baby boomer through the conflicts and victories that characterized their own generation. Do the fathers and daughters heal their old wounds and get back together? It would be unfair to both reader and author if I revealed that, but I can say there are intriguing and touching moments along the way."},{"Title":"The Old Detective's Daughter","review":"To steal a line from Studs Terkel, I couldn't put the damned thing down. The Old Detective's Daughter is that kind of book. Spencer has written a good work of fiction that held me in its grasp until the last page. While the book is only 99 pages, it is a multi-textured story about forgiveness and chance. Set in Chicago and Youngstown, Ohio, the main character T.J. Montegomery, a woman detective, is hired to help an older man at the end of his life find his estranged daughter. In the process of working on the case for the old man, her own father is dying of cancer. While she has to accept that her father is about to die, she can't quite make peace with the bad state of medical care he receives. The story winds up being less of a mystery and more about the relationship between father and daughter. The parallel plots of father and daughter draw you in as they move to wrap themselves up at the end. I like particularly liked TJ's close friend Karen. Spencer creates an intriquing character in Karen who helps TJ see her plight from a different perspective. This is a good little story that has me looking for more from this writer."},{"Title":"A World of Respect: : A Guide to Making It Happen","review":"I think that everyone needs to read this book.

Written in a modern, upbeat, non-metaphysical style, Mr. Doyle says what needs to be said without any gingerbread. The exercises are simple and incredibly enlightening.I passed this book around my circle of colleagues, and most said something to the effect of &quot;I wish I were teaching THIS! It's about how to deal with oneself in the real world, which we all need to know before tackling chemistry or English or sports.&quot;I've read all the texts and taught many, both good and not-so-good, and Mr. Doyle's &quot;little&quot; book is the best."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"In Before You Think Another Thought, Bruce I. Doyle III, writes that &quot;thoughts and beliefs are the basic elements of all creation. They exist as tiny waves of energy called thoughtforms, whose sole purpose is to carry out the intent of the thinker.&quot; He further explains that the lives we live, whether happy or miserable, are the direct result of what we think.Doyle uses real-life situations to show how our underlying &quot;core&quot; beliefs are developed, and how thoughtforms are created that support those beliefs. The thoughts and beliefs lead to feelings, which then lead to reactions. Those reactions determine our life's experience, leading Doyle to maintain that &quot;beliefs determine experience.&quot;He says &quot;the good news is that with the recognition that you are creating your own life, you can start taking charge--as the designer of your life, no longer a victim of life's random circumstances. You become self-responsible.&quot; He explains how developing a positive attitude can change beliefs, and thus change experiences. He offers suggestions for developing positive attitudes so as to get whatever it is that you want from life.He adds that we can't avoid unpleasant feelings, but we can experience them, and then move on. They don't have to hold us back unless we think they do. He also says that we need to be patient, as &quot;everything in your life will [not] change miraculously overnight.&quot;The appendix includes exercises for recognizing and removing your limiting beliefs and thoughtforms.Doyle says that &quot;every one of our thoughts is a thread in the fabric of what we experience in our lives. And each one of us weaves our own cloth.&quot; In Before You Think Another Thought, he offers readers &quot;new insights into achieving the life you deserve&quot; by teaching them how to transform their negative thoughts and beliefs into positive life experiences."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"This book is the most exciting and refreshing eye opener for me in 10 years. Some people say you have to see it before you believe it. I know that the way the universe and real life works is that you must first believe and visualize positive thoughts in order to see them created. This is the first step for people seeking to end hopelessness and self-pity. Don't overemphasize the negative elements of your life. Give more weight to positive and simple pleasures of life. This book would make an excellent gift to graduating seniors."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Lifeby Bruce DoyleBefore I go into the review proper, let me ask one question?Have any readers watched the award-winning movie, 'What the Bleep Do We Know!? Down the Rabbit Hole', starring Marlee Matlin & directed by William Arntz?It's part documentary, part story, & part visual effects & animations. but mind-blowing! In many respects, it's also controversial! It plunges the viewer into a world where quantum uncertainty is demonstrated - where neurological processes, & perceptual shifts are engaged & lived by its protagonist (Amanda, played by Marlee Matlin, a very fine actress) - where everything is alive, & reality is changed by every thought. Watch it, with an open mind, if you haven't done so.From this movie, I come to know about the work of Dr Joe Dispenza, one of fourteen scientists, researchers & thinkers featured in the movie.According to Dr Dispenza, \\"quantum science tells us an observer directly affects the nature of reality. Electrons behave like waves of probability until an observer looks for their position; then, they demonstrate characteristics of particles, i.e., solid matter. If observation - putting conscious attention on any one thing - can affect the material world, then by mastering that ability, can we have greater control over our future?Neuroscience is showing us how thoughts shape reality. The brain's one hundred billion neurons connect in diverse combinations called neural networks. When we welcome new thoughts and experiences, our neurons respond by wiring together, a learning process termed neural plasticity. Through concentration and repetition of thoughts, neural circuits become \\"hard wired.\\"Are we basing our thoughts on what we've already wired in our memory, restricting the level of mind with which we view reality? Is our familiar environment monopolizing our thoughts, producing only routine experiences? As observers within the quantum field of potentials, perhaps we are only limited by our knowledge and observation skills. If by developing these abilities we can rewire our brain, we should produce tangible changes in our life.\\"Dr Dispenza has also made this amazing observation:\\"Most people are distracted by the external world, so they don't use the frontal lobe properly. Everything in our environment in constantly feeding the brain information. Our senses are what allow us to interprete reality. As long as we believe the external world is more real than the internal, we'll always be using the same brain circuits to process information. The moment we accept that our internal world affects our external world, then we must begin to use our frontal lobe.\\" Wow!Why am I writing all about these observations in this review & what's the connection?Well, I have come to realise that this wonderful book by Bruce Doyle, which I have read in the mid-nineties, provides useful tools & strategies to help readers to rewire their brains & bring tangible changes to their lives.I like this book because it reinforces the fact that we have the power to choose our internal world, - & at the same time, the power to discreate it, if it's disempowering. Personal breakthoughs come from changing our internal world. The book is also very well written. It's crisp, succinct & yet illuminating! Best of all, the author offers some positive suggestions & simple exercises. I strongly recommend anyone who wants to take full charge of his/her own life to read it."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"This book is for those who truly want to take RESPONSIBILITY for their lives. So that means, one does not just read the book once and put it on the shelf to collect dust. This little guide is full of information and tools which one constantly needs to refer to and use on a regular basis. When I feel &quot;stuck&quot;, I ask myself &quot;what am I doing to create what is occuring at this point in time?&quot; Sometimes I have to refer to a certain chapter in the book and, combined with some introspection and self-discovery, I usually find my answer and move forward! Since reading this book, I have become increasingly aware of my 'limiting' thoughts (when they occur) and now have the tools to eliminate them! Thanks to the author for sharing some of his personal experiences and for caring enough to write such an easy-reading, enligtening book! I sincerely hope he is working on Part II!

It teaches the same things as the other metaphysical books, but with fewer words. Examples would be like the acronym F.E.A.R., false evidense appearing real; what you think about expands; staying positive and removing limiting beliefs by replacing them with a corresponding empowering belief. Example would be &quot;I am a good speller&quot; instead of &quot;I am a bad speller.&quot; If you don't want to wade through thousands of words on metaphysical truths but would rather have the short, abridged version of metaphysical self help, then buy this. Also Maxwell Maltz's book called Psycho-Cybernetics which I think was published back in 1960 would be a good complement to this one."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"Short and sweet.

It is easy to read and the thought process is well developed.There is no question that your circumstances are a direct result of your thought process. While this is a difficult concept for most folks to grasp, it is true and Doyle does a good job of leading the reader to this conclusion.The book is written in simple terms and has a fairly good set of exercises in the appendix.While the concepts are simple, like any process that requires you to change, they are not necessaily easy. In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new. But they are presented in a fresh and easy to understand manner and can serve as a great way to reinforce what you may have been taught by others.It is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life","review":"Although \\"Before you Think Another Thought\\" is a relatively small book (less than 125 pages), it's filled with amazing and easy to understand insights about how our underlying beliefs are creating our experiences on a daily basis.The best news is that, although our limiting beliefs have had a great impact on our lives so far, once we identify & explore them, we have the ability to CHOOSE whether or not to keep them as they are, or to change them. If we choose to change them, and replace them with an empowering belief, our lives will begin to change.Mr. Doyle has included many great illustrations & examples to help the reader better grasp the ideas he presents, and has also included an appendix that includes several tools for identifying, exploring and changing our limited underlying beliefs.Overall, I found this to be an interesting, easy to read book with far reaching implications.

To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our \\"thought vibrations\\" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete \\"how to\\" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book.

It was thoroughly entertaining, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next. It had lots of interesting &amp; memorable characters, and imagery that really brought scenes to life. Matthews' use of color &amp; cloud imagery to illustrate the psychic probing of others minds was especially captivating. I hope this book becomes available thru Amazon - it's what great storytelling is all about.

It concerns 2 brothers, Drew and Clay and their sister , Zoe who are separated on an \\"Orphan Train\\" back in the days of the Old West.The three of them are all determined to be reunited with one another but their hopes are dashed as Life \\"continually gets in the way\\" as a famous author once wrote.As they grow older Clay gets a job as a Town Sherrif, Drew becomes a Bounty Hunter and Zoe finds work in a Dance Hall.This is a novel about the enduring power of unrealized dreams(hence the title) and I consider it to be a Modern Day Classic. The author is an Australian who has recently returned back home and I say \\"Welcome home Greg!!!\\""},{"Title":"Power in the Blood","review":"I hate westerns. HATE them, I've never found westerns appealing in the least, so I was skeptical when my grandmother, partially from whom I got my passion for books, pulled it off her shelf for me to read. Putting aside my preferences, I read it for her.This is by far the best book I have ever read.The stories are deep, the characters are complex, the threads intertwine and have become a beautiful, moving masterpiece that will stay with me for a long, long time.The base story is about three orphans who are slowly separated as their orphan train travels westward from New York to Missouri. Things take grim turns for the trio as their foster families fall apart for various reasons, causing the three to strike out on their own in a quest to reunite with one another.I cannot express how much I want this book back in print so I can get my own copy.

I saw an earlier review that warns of not reading the synopsis that is on the book...GOOD ADVICE! All you need to know (if you must) is that it is about three orphaned siblings who go west. The book follows thier seperate lives as they each experience the American West.

Matthews' writing as usual is phenomenal. My only complaint is with the sci fi aspect of the story, a child with telekinesis talents which just do NOT exist, and I was surprised given Matthews' obvious athiestic views in every one of his books. Plus he uses this as a \\"deus ex machina\\" to save some of his characters who would otherwise be dead if the child hadn't come to the miraculous rescue with her gift.However this book has LOTS of characters who are colorfully written. Some of them just fade out, not sure why they were there in the first place (many needed chapters given to an artist who paints a nude portrait of a prostitute who wants to be the mistress of the husband of the female sibling in the story.) But this is probably because Matthews is so prolific he just can't stop writing.The story builds up to where there should be a huge climax, but kind of fizzles out. The train chase at the end went on for pages and I skimmed and skipped that. There was an epilogue so we know the fates of all the characters, but also kind of anti-climactical. For the page-turning ability of this book, I give it 5 stars, but for the telekinectic character, 4 stars.I read this in about a week, couldn't put it down, may appeal to fans of Stephen King (who I no longer care for.)Lots of carnage, incest, child rape, a really, really nasty serial killer, basic Matthews menu, but so, so readable!!!!!"},{"Title":"A War to Live For","review":"This BOok rOCKS!

What is the most promising way to proceed in order to find the intellectual structure within which at least some central questions can be formulated and reduced to problem solving? This volume suggests one avenue. It places at the center of the investigation some simple tasks of memory and learning, and advocates that these tasks be investigated by means of detailed computational models.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"The aspect of reasoning that we are particularly concerned with here is so called commensense reasoning. This is the process that humans use to cope with the mundane but complex aspects of the world in evaluating everyday situations. It is reasoning that is generally done subconsciously. It is perhaps precisely because we have no awareness of these processes that it has proved to difficult to simulate them in machines. No one has yet made a home cleaning robot that can execute its task with reasonable flexibility and commonsense.\\" (Pg. 159)\\"The major stumbling block at first seemed to be the philosophical problem raised by inductive learning, an aspect of cognition that seems impossible to evade. We believe now that computational learning theory gives an adequate view on this. It explains how it may be possible for a system to learn to cope in a world that is too complex for it to describe or understand.\\" (Pg. 203-204)"},{"Title":"Circuits of the Mind","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I am very much impressed.The author talks about this subject in a very practical way, unlike most of related books on this subject."},{"Title":"A Rockclimber's Guide to the Alabama Hills","review":"This guide to the Alabama Hills is a climbing guide as good as can be.First, it includes a lot of routes in the area.

There was just one route we could not find in our first weekend at the A. Hills (Magic Pig, Cattle Pocket). Third, the guide not only rates the difficulty of the routes (i.e. 5.xx), it also rates the quality of the rock, using a 3-star rating system. Last but not least, like many CA climbing guides, the guide provides some history of the development of the area.Concluding, this guide provided an excellent means to enjoy one of the few bolted climbing areas in Southern California."},{"Title":"How Yussel Caught the Gefilte Fish","review":"I originally found this in my local library 18 months ago. When we returned it after two weeks, my 2 year old kept asking me to read it again, so I bought a copy. We continue to read it often. It's a delightful story about Shabbat and family, and why it's all so special to a little boy. In addition to being a wonderful story, the illustrations are beautiful, and the typography is far better than most children's books. It looks like this book was an act of love for everyone who contributed to it."},{"Title":"How Yussel Caught the Gefilte Fish","review":"This is a \\"Shabbos\\" or \\"Sabbath\\" story: Yussel is invited by his father to join him for the first time to go fishing to allow his mother to prepare Gefilte Fish as she does each Friday for the evening meal for the whole family and guests.The story unfolds with beautiful illustrations that are colorful yet selective in what they display and on what they focus: the table, the early morning sun rise, the pail, the bread basket, the fishing rod, the lake, the fishs: carp, trout, pike, caught one after another, the meal itself and all participants.My two year old son could follow the story in its entirety after we read it a few times and he asked for the book so often from the library that I purchased it.The \\"special spice\\" about peace - peace within the family, peace with friends and guests, and peace offered by God (this is a Sabbath story after all) - is introduced at the end and as a fitting conclusion.This book is a true gem and a great gift. For a German Catholic such as me, the book also offers insights about a staple of my neighbors' cuisine next to our house in Bethesda, Maryland, (Gefilte Fish, which is Yiddish and hence sounds familiar to my ears). In addition, the book also contains a memory of Yussel's father as he was riding on a wagon to a lake with his own father when he was as young as Yussel. The depiction has an Eastern European aesthetic and it is perhaps no coincidence that a carp was among the fishs caught: my father, expelled from Silesia (Eastern Germany then, now Poland) after 1945 and his family always ate carp at Christmas, a Silesian tradition that we continue here in the US.The book is a quietly and beautifully told tender father-son story embedded in the larger context of our lives among the people we love."},{"Title":"How Yussel Caught the Gefilte Fish","review":"While it may be written for kids, many adults were smiling & enjoying as read to during a Family Shabbat Service.

The paper is thin and one can see through the next page in the back. Overall it was a good purchase albeit a little overpriced."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"This novel takes place in a remote Cathedral city in England; the reader is drawn into various peoples'lives, central among them the Dean of the Cathedral. It is the story of the way that this humble man, who is unaware of the impact of his simple love for God and his fellow man, deeply affects many in his city. It is a beautifully told story of the healing power of love. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"...I became enchanted by the tale Goudge tells. The setting for the story is a cathedral city in the fens. The city is populated with charmingly depicted characters that ooze quaintness from every pore. The main character is the old Dean, known in the town as a fierce and relentless man due to his hunting down of the city's corruption. And yet, the Dean is a misunderstood man. His love and fidelity are often met with indifference in the town, and this is even more true of his own wife who is deterred by his ugliness and who finds his devotion to her repulsive. Yet help is at hand, for the Dean owns a beautiful watch: a watch that becomes the starting point for a new friendship for the Dean, and new hope.Goudge's tale is clearly Christian in content. It is a tale of redemption, grace and love in a world of ugliness and pain. It is never, I think crass, and retains a note of ambiguity to the end, which is appropriate to her theme. Readers will find that something of this story can speak to them if they let it, and indeed, I suspect it speaks to Everyman. Yet it is never moralistic, didactic or triumphalist: often the worst sins of the Christian novel.A lovely tale, with enough depth to grasp sceptical readers like myself."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"This is my favorite Elizabeth Goudge book. I read this every December before the Christmas holidays. This is a very well-written story about people in a small English cathedral village thrown together by a humble clockmaker. Lives are being changed and we are told how and why. It's a gentle story, and told with much insight into human behavior."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"Elizabeth Goudge is a fine writer. Her language is rich as butter. All of her stories are interesting, but this one is beautiful. I believe that, after all the books I have read in my rather long life, books of all manner of styles and genres, this book is the deepest and best. Her characterizations are strong and complex, her consideration of the human state both honest and compassionate. There is great affection for humanity, even in her most honest and grieving portrayal of it. Beautiful writing, strong story, interesting and provoking characters - I enjoy so much the honor of spending a few hours with this woman and the depth of her faith, courage and love."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"My favorite by Goudge, by far. She takes you there on a flying carpet of words so that you can see, smell and hear, visiting the homes and lives of the rich and weak, the poor and strong, the bitter, the loving, the young, the old, and helpless. Central to it all is the Dean of the Cathedral, only now in his last year is he being truly changed under God's hand. And his &quot;watch&quot; is a timepiece, but also his alloted time on duty. Interesting things happen during his watch!There are characters we love, rejoice with, sigh for, and laugh at. We see the joy of a little girl receiving a gift of a parasol (though the Dean's joy in giving it exceeds her joy in receiving). But his wife, who has greater riches, does not rejoice in what she receives.Though non-Anglicans may need a bit of help with certain terms and concepts, grab the book and enjoy. Then share it with a friend, while you run off to get Goudge's Green Dolphin Street."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"Elizabeth Gouge is one of the finest wordsmiths I have ever read. Her stories are gentle, compassionate - showing her abiding compassion for human kind, with our flaws and our nobility equally recognized. A woman of faith, she weaves a magic through her tales--a twisting of earthly realities with spiritual mysteries, and she denies any limits on reality, knowing that there is more to this world, and to our being in it, than the \\"reality\\" many people insist on defining. There is humility in her work, but tremendous greatness. And her writing is as lovely as a Japanese ink drawing - deft, smooth, simple, evocative. She can handle a sentence like nobody else in the world--words sweet and rich as butter, a complete pleasure to run through the mind and the imagination. I wish she were still alive and I could write to her. I wish I could know her better. I'd love to hear what she might have to say about quite a few things, these days. This is my favorite book in all the world. That's the greatest praise I can offer."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"One of Goudge's last novels, The Dean's Watch, also exemplifies her view of life.Set during the 1870s in an unnamed English fen city, whose heart is a medieval cathedral, it tells what happens when an old clock-maker, Isaac Peabody, mistakenly places a printed motto in the antique pocket watch of the grim cathedral Dean, Adam Ayscough, and subsequently meets the Dean.Isaac is a tradesman and an atheist, brutalised by the hell-fire faith of his father who had been a Church of England priest in one of the city's churches. He is terrified of the cathedral itself, and would never dare presume to speak with such an elevated member of the gentry as the Dean.Yet, a man of profound faith, and enormous compassion for the suffering poor, the Dean is himself emotionally crippled by shyness. He is as lonely, and as isolated in his marriage to his unloving wife, as Isaac is in the household he shares with his sister, who is embittered by self-sacrificing spinsterdom and her shame for the Peabodys' descent from the professional ranks of clergy-gentry to working class tradespeople.Many other characters are pulled into the events of a few months; two teenage lovers, a near-decrepit elderly parish priest, a three-year old girl, a brutal fishmonger, and a woman in her eighties who lives amongst her fellow townsfolk as a kind of unrecognised saint.Goudge also does not hesitate (neither does Victor Hugo) to throw in vigorous chapters of cathedral and town history, and many flashbacks and reminiscences of the earlier years of her characters. The book is packed with incident, character, and landscape, despite its immediate action being comparatively slight and covering a short span of present narrative time.Of course, like all of Goudge's books, it is heart-warming. But it pulls no punches.Goudge writes about the hard gritty stuff of real people, complex, flawed and contradictory in a real world of hope, pain, accident, evil and suffering, cherishing the flashes of goodness which can be achieved by human love. The earth closets (one-holers, lavatories) in the slum backyards stink. Young children are forced by brutal masters to climb inside and sweep chimneys. People hate, or love, as their mood leads them, and often do violent things. Senility descends on the extreme elderly. The stormy autumnal tone grows from the book's references to Shakespeare's sonnets and King Lear and A Winter's Tale, to John Donne's sermons and the organ music of Bach, to the callous violence of the Norman Conquests, Henry VIII's brutal dissolution of the monasteries, and Cromwell's puritan destruction of the rich fabric of the ancient church.In such a dark world the creation of mechanically intricate and faithful watches and clocks, decorated lovingly with charming filigree or Dresden figurines or secret illuminated manuscripts, stands as a covert metaphor of the highest to which humans can aspire. At the same time the ticking of a watch and its sheer mechanical longevity stand as implicit reminders of the mortality of its maker, who labours to make the watch despite foreknowledge of his own death. (In our unthinking age of throw-away mass-produced digital watches Goudge's novel offers fundamental, old-fashioned values we do well to remember.)Even the title means different significant things: the actual heirloom watch, which triggers the story; the Dean's \\"ticker\\" or heart, which physically beats uncertainly, yet passionately loves behind the shyness; the Deans' \\"watch\\", as a navy term, in which he faithfully steers the ship of the city and cares for her people.All of Goudge's novels are \\"romances\\" in one important aspect: they hinge on moments of visionary insight for her characters, filled with that romantic longing for a strange beauty and joy which is known in German as \\"Sehnsucht\\". Dreams, glimpses of landscape, moments of weather, the sound of a voice or melody when no one else is present, sudden remembering of lost experience, or a poetry quote which stabs to the heart. These are frequently counterbalanced against moments of evil, terror, despair, emotional collapse, irrational rage or blinding hate. Most of her central characters are well educated and intellectually or emotionally gifted, although many are presented as frail, absent-minded, wounded. Yet not only are they bound up in everyday tasks, they are surrounded by salt-of-the-earth uneducated workers, heroic peasants comparable to the subjects of Hopkins' poems \\"Felix Randall\\", \\"Tom\\" and \\"Harry Ploughman\\", people of utter reliability and ancient Hardyesque virtue. Her characters' ages may vary from eighty to eight, or even younger. For Goudge there is little difference between adult and child except length of experience and acquired knowledge - their interests, emotions and needs are fundamentally the same. In some cases the children show greater maturity than the so called \\"adults\\", and even the animals, dogs particularly, owned by her characters show unspoken wisdom which may ironically exceed that of their masters and mistresses.John Gough -- Deakin University -- jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"I love this book. It helps that it's set in Ely, a breathtaking place (though she never actually names it, and changes some details, Goudge did confirm that the unnamed city is Ely). The author clearly loves her characters, even the somewhat difficult to love ones. The setting is beautifully described. And when she wants to insert historical details, she just puts them in using her authorial voice, rather than trying to force them into a character's voice.There's a nice balance of sad and joyous, serious and amusing. The sadness is what might be called \\"beautiful sad\\", as opposed to \\"ugly sad\\".A delightful book to sink into, like a warm and inviting armchair by the fire."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"The setting for the story is a cathedral city in the fens.

A growing option is ceramics. This growing use of ceramic materials requires a growing knowledge of their behavior under many conditions. One of this is corrosion. The knowledge of the corrosion and oxidation of ceramics is especially important given the fact that ceramics are often used where metal alloys cannot be used: high temperature applications where all sorts of chemical activation barriers are surpassed. This book, though old, provides a useful introduction to the corrosion of commonly used ceramics such as alumina, silica, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, and aluminum nitride."},{"Title":"Daughter of Light (Merlin's legacy)","review":"This is the third story in the Merlin's Legacy series and I must say it just keeps getting better and better.This is the story of Stephen of Valois and Cassandra the third daughter of Magician Merlin.

Most of the action took place in Turkey and Rumi came up as part of the plot. His poetry is beautiful and the book is perfect."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Rumi has been able to speak directly from the heart to the heart, and Coleman Barks has the sensitivity to the flavor and turns of ordinary American speech to produce marvelous lines, full of fspice and humor. Green's illuminations are works of art! This is an extraordinarily beautiful book - a gift to yourself? I have two copies, one of which I have taken apart so that I can frame each page - changing it every month or whenever I feel I'm ready to receive a new and wonderful message.Teachers/Librarians - It has been reported to me by a high school teacher:\\"Even my 12th grade \\"jocks\\" who thought they'd NEVER like poetry, has been swept away by Rumi. . . learned there was a bookstore in Anchorage. . . drove their in their pickup. . . and then learned that it is possible to order a book at a bookstore!\\""},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This book sends one in to a bright journey of the mysteries of the soul,we so much strive to approach with our mind and hearts.The subtlest portion of the ectoplasm touch that mystery,when creativity comes from feeling the door to the spiritis flung open, as we all have the potentially to discover.Rumi is rendered beautifully in words and a touch of goldin these inspired images give us a rounded glimpse.Thanks for this work, which takes me down so many trailswhere in a single sentence I find infinite rhymes."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I have ordered this company's Rumi calendar for several years now because the illustrations, entwined with the Rumi poems, are so incredibly beautiful.

It is one of those books I fall into when I've had a tough day and I just need to center myself. I highly recommend MANY MANY poems in here but a favorite would have to be Baby Pigeon on pg. 32"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I purchased this item as a gift, and will buy another for myself. The art is stunning, the translations bring poetry to life. A book to treasure for years."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Rumi, Coleman Barks, and Michael Green have collaborated on the most beautiful book I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). Rumi's poetry trancends the artificial boundaries of religion, and speaks to anyone sincerely on the spiritual path. He captures the burning, the longing for the end of separation from God.When I first became aware of Rumi's poetry, I was sure that it was about earthly love between humans here on earth. As I absorbed it more completely, I came to realize that all of his poetry, even his love poetry (which is very suitable for passing on to a loved one) is communicating with God.Coleman Barks has done an amazing job of giving Rumi's work an accessable voice. He has truly given a gift for which we owe a huge debt of gratitude. Rumi provides the music, Coleman's translations provide the instruments.Michael Green was obviously inspired by his collaborators to reach his own level of genius in the illustrations. I love the way he combines images from different cultures, different times, and from different disciplines both scientific and artistic! A desert oasis with a photo shot by the Hubble Space Telescope for the sky... The juxtaposition of fractal geometry with images from cultural art... I would gladly hang any of the original art from this book on the walls of my living room.This book has been and continues to be my favorite gift to people who &quot;get it,&quot; and I've probably handed out over 20 copies in the last two years. Do yourself a favor and buy it. I bet you'll be back for more copies."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This is a truly beautiful book - the artwork laid out with the poems is masterful. Its far more than just a book of terrific poetry - which it is by the way! I don't know how these poems read in their original language and forgive me but in this case that doesn't even matter - the writings represented here are beautifully written. I'm so glad I bought it. Its a real joy to read and contemplate."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Coleman Barks has a way with words, which for the past few decades he's put to use casting the poems of 13th-century mystic Jalaluddin Rumi into contemporary language. Though considered one of the greatest poets the world has ever seen, Rumi was relatively unknown in the West until a recent surge in popularity due in no small part to Barks's efforts. THE ILLUMINATED RUMI presents readers with a pretty package indeed: deep thoughts, stirred emotions and illustrations galore. Yet while this would do most poets proud, it's doubtful Rumi would feel that way about his treatment at Barks's hands, if only because Barks speaks not a word of Persian, the language in which Rumi wrote. Barks freely admits he relied entirely on academic translations to concoct his popularized renderings. This would be less of a handicap were Rumi merely trying to entertain or to convey feelings, moods and subjective impressions. But as Barks himself points out, Rumi was a Sufi; and Sufis maintain that, far from being the emotional outpourings appearance might suggest, their poems are actually precise and carefully constructed technical instruments designed to have very specific effects on the reader under the right circumstances. These effects, which depend heavily upon the language in which the poems were written (not to mention the specific audience they were written for, which is another matter entirely), are easily blunted by translation and other forms of tampering. Barks - in translating translations - would seem to be carrying this tampering a step further, despite his good intentions. The result, however aesthetically pleasing and emotionally evocative, is unlikely to be what Rumi had in mind - any more than the miming of a surgeon's hand-movements, however gracefully executed, is likely to heal the sick. Those interested in Rumi's still-relevant message would do better to read THE SUFIS by Idries Shah, THE LIFE &amp; WORK OF JALALUDDIN RUMI by Afzal Iqbal, or E.H. Whinfield's TEACHINGS OF RUMI."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I have been a lover of Rumi's poetry for some time. This combination of Coleman Barks' inspired translations and the enlightened illustrations are like walking through the infinite reaches of time and soul space. If I have a deep concern or question, I can pick it up and open it randomly as an oracle...For me it's wisdom transcends all boundaries. A beautiful gift for someone who can dance in the depths of spirit...or just for your Self."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This translation is better then other translations of Rumi that I have read. I have read this book several times and each time I discover something that I haven't seen befor. I would recomend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"A must read for the soul's journey homeward to the Self I read this work slowly, savoring the moments and the illuminations as sparks of awakening to my own soul.I was introduced to Rumi's writings in January 1999 and I feel as though I have come home to an understanding that I could not always put into words.As a writer/journalist myself, I find that often the words escape me, yet they are right outside of my mind's grasp. The writings/translations of Rumi and the pictorials in this book have moved me deeper than most work, inspiring me in my own world of words as I re-member to whom Rumi writes with such passion.Then, it brings me renewed passion for my own work.I recently married a couple and used this book as part of the service. As a wedding present, I gifted the couple with this book. What a beautiful way for them to start their lives. I highly recommend this as a gift for others and for special occasions where you want to give a fine work both in art and literature.On Mother's Day I shared this work with my oldest Son, age 26, who was also moved and he asked me to order this for him and his family...Thank you Coleman Barks and Michael Green! I am deeply grateful to them for all they have contributed.May we all live the messages of Rumi!"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"In the 13th Century, a Moslem scholar, philosopher and poet, from what is now modern Turkey wrote of the human condition The condition hasn't changed and the words still have the same impact as when written. Hence, he remains popular as ever. Perhaps one might think the terms philosopher and poet off putting. This is not the case. He writes in a style to encourage intuitive thinking rather than our usual logical Western style. This is the mode necessary to understand man's deeper nature. It is a style shared by those wishing spiritual and psychological enlightenment. Reading Rumi makes one a more thoughtful deeper person. Curl up with this book by yourself where you are free from distraction and have the time to let your mind wander. You will get nowhere reading this while commuting or watching TV!This is book is the place to start with Rumi. The illustrations notonly compliment the writing but are picked to give you a psychological study of what is being said. The current translation is the best I have seen for the modern American World. Coleman Bark's translation of an ancient language into our vernacular makes you feel like Rumi wrote the original English version.Richard Hunter, MD, Behavioral Neurologist, Atlanta."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This beautiful volume is a must-have for anyone who loves Rumi, and a fantastic introduction for those who are new to the poetry. It is not a scholarly work, although the light commentary is nicely done. Rather, the work is a lovely m&eacute;lange of Rumi's poems as translated by Coleman Barks, complemented by the stunning illustrations of Michael Green. It's experiential rather than academic. A tool, not a lecture.The overall effect is hypnotic. Excellent as a prequel to meditation, it is more evocative than stimulating. Read the poem, let your eyes flow over the pictures, and be transported. If you know and have studied Rumi, all you have read and learned will wash over you in the process. If you are new to Rumi, you will realize wisdom you didn't know you had.Understand, this transport is courtesy of the poetry. The illustrations provide a little pretty oil for the mesmeric skids. And just as Rumi transcends his Sufi origins to reach all faiths, so also do the illustrations contain aspects of all the organized (and unorganized) religions.\\"Come, whoever you are! Wanderer, worshipper, lover of learning. This is not a caravan of despair. It doesn't matter if you've broken your vow a thousand times, still and yet again, come!\\""},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I find some of the other rather pedantic reviews a bit troubling. I can, of course, appreciate that those who are more knowledgable about Sufism in general, and Rumi in specific, might be disappointed in what some obviously consider a lack of credentials on Mr. Barks part; however, as a relative newcomer to Sufism and the works of Rumi, I must say that this is an excellent place to start. No, perhaps the translation is not exact, but the combination of the magnificent illuminations, and the undeniable strengh and power of Rumi's poetry will move many newcomers like myself to do further, more in depth research and hopefully capture the true essence of the message. And isn't that the point? Start the neophytes slowly, so as not to overwhelm them; intrigue them, in order to guide them. Why else would I be here?"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"From beginning to end a true masterpiece. Always acurate and ever so gentle,pushing the boundaries of language and spirit. To slowly and gracfully unravell this oral poetry is the hardest of tasks. The translations in this book evolve with the silent tongue of the reader,eloquent,reading the reader. Rumi,shams,mean spirited roadhouses and the faint shimmer of a 13th century mystic pointing towards your spirit.Classic and captivating pictures interweave with prose effortlessly true. Thankyou................."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"It's often said you can't gain any true 'mystic experience' or 'hidden wisdom' from 'reading a book'. Often that holds true, but things like Rumi are the exception. I'm the sort of person who hates poetry. I relished the accidental \\"Cruel prank\\" done on the \\"Poetry Analasyst\\" in the late Mr. Vonneget's \\"God bless you Mr. Rosewater\\". But, Rumi moves me to joy, to tears to love and to feelings beyond. And this book is an excellent tribute to him. Well worth getting multiple copies, for you will likely loan them to people who'll keep them forever!"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I am very pleased with the edition of The Illuminated Rumi I ordered. The illustrations are excellent and the material inspirational and informative about a culture I know little about. The work of Rumi was recommended to me by a friend and as a fairly knowledgeable reader I am surprised I had not encountered the work of this fine poet earlier in my life.I share an e-mail address with my husband (Donald E. Rex) but this review was written by Marion R. Rex,his wife."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Read this book slowly, savoring each page and each picture. If you don't, you will miss much!"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Coleman Barks and Michael Green have performed a rare feat, combining words and images successfully. No small acomplishment considering the subject matter. I and many people I have talked to have commented on how many times one can derive new levels of enjoyment and fulfillment when reading and viewing these illuminated verses."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"My words to describe a GOD realized soul such as RUMI could never be adequate, but they can lead you to this book and that is my gift to you. The Illuminated Rumi is a DIAMOND reflecting the light of GOD."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I admit I was predisposed to be a little snobby about this book since I assume the pictures are there for people that are hesitant about poetry and lack the confidence in their own imaginations to draw up imagery--just putting that up front. But I found this book at a friend's house and was excited to open it since I was craving Rumi and looking for inspiration and I wanted to keep an open mind.The translations are fine. And the pictures in-of-themselves don't get in the way so much, other than that they are absolutely everywhere and create a chaotic, disorienting format-- more about that later. There are some reproductions of beautiful, period art work that enhance the book. Others are the cheesiest of New Age collages. What makes the book so confusing is the layout. Many poems are split up over several pages and it is nearly impossible to tell where a poem begins or ends, especially since every page has a heading over it, suggesting each page starts a new poem. And the font switches randomly, making one think a new poem is beginning. But it's the commentary that makes the whole thing a disaster. The commentary and interpretations show up on the same pages as the poems, in similar fonts--and worse--written in a flowery prose that sometimes tries to imitate Rumi's style. The commentary sometimes takes the form of direct advice on how to live, with no preface of \\"Rumi is saying that...\\" So you think you're reading the continuation of a poem or a new poem and it takes a moment to figure out you just swallowed another slippery wad of fortune-cookie advice or watered-down interpretation. I just hated the way it so forcibly inserted itself in and around the poetry. It's very hard to absorb oneself in the poem when one has to navigate all of these other elements.I'm giving it a \\"2\\" because it's great for people who need a lot of distractions and get bored very easily."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This book will disappoint anyone who has seriously delved into the writings of Rumi. It is hard to see where Rumi starts and Barks leaves off which left me totally confused. I believe that Barks took many liberties with the translation of Rumi writings. The art work was too \\"new-age\\" for me and did not really add any new insights into the life and writings of this man.A very shallow read."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I take something new everytime I read this work, the illustrations are delightful, and provoking. A creative entrepreneur will love it."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This is an amazing, inspiring book that brings the immortal words of Rumi closer and closer to your heart.

The poetry and the illustrations are divine!"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I gave this book to a soul-searching friend this year and a few weeks later was very pleased to get a note saying it was not only beautiful but very inspiring. I only had a moment to glance through it and I think I'll get a copy for myself, too. The page layouts are gorgeous and do not detract at all from Rumi's poetry. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Excellent job of portraying Rumi and presenting appropriate Rumi reminders throughout the year. So glad Coleman Barks is a part of..."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This book obscures the bold spirit of Rumi with a facade of emotionally dominated wishful thinking. Rumi should challenge, confront, transport and dare the reader - but this book merely panders. The text is liberally sprinkled with irrelevancies and contains several interpolations, mistranslations and historical inaccuracies, indeed, blatant balderdash in a couple of places. The poetry is generally well rendered but is a pre-digested selection of the &quot;soft bits&quot; - the bones have been filleted out. One also gets the vague impression that the English language has been &quot;dumbed down&quot;. The illustrations are well executed, except for the snapshot at the end, which is both irrelevant and uninteresting. This piece of self-indulgent drivel spoils an otherwise good collection of artwork. In summary, the reader will end up knowing more about Coleman Barks than about Rumi."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Pro:Rumi is 5 stars and beyond. Beautiful translations and interesting selection of his work. I do enjoy sitting down with this book mainly for the poetry itself, though I love the merging of art and poetry.Con:The graphic art style feels outdated. Also, the art sometimes makes it hard to follow the flow of the poem; sometimes the visual gets in the way of the poem instead of contributing.Overall:I am still crossing my fingers to find an art and Rumi collection that works timelessly together. This is definitely not that collection."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I got this calendar for my wife since she liked the art work very much last year. But ... she thinks that the art work is not as creative as last year. More perspicuously said, she is very disappointed. Did I say she is an artist and retired art teacher?"},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"As a lifelong bookworm, I've gotta say: this one is a gem. Incredible illustrations, and a caringly, lit glimpse into the mystery and depth of Rumi. One of those ones you want to pass on to the most special people in your life. The kind of literature that runs against the grain of our aggravating times and quickly reminds us of something higher to aspire to."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"COLEMAN BARKS IS A MODERN RUMI WITH THE SAME ECSTATIC SENSE OF THE SACRED THAT RUMI WAS POSSESSED BY -- AND THE COMBINATION OF BARKS' TRANSLATED TEXT WITH MICHAEL GREEN'S VISUAL CHOICES AND ARRANGEMENTS OF IMAGES TAKES RUMI'S POETRY TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL -- THE ISOLATION OF SINGLE WORDS AND SHORT PHRASES WITHIN THE IMAGES INVIGORATES, ENLIVENS, ILLUMINATES (PERFECT TITLE) AND &quot;DECODES&quot; THE SACRED &quot;LOGOS&quot; ASPECTS OF THE WORDS.

Rumi is--what?-- a fully enlightened mystical poet who somehow speaks through Coleman Barks right to our ragged twentieth century hearts; The wonderful art takes it into a realm beyond words. Are there prints available of his work? Should be."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Going through this book was my introduction to Rumi. And a profound one it was. Through the interwoven effect of Rumi's poetry rendered by Coleman Barks and the beautiful images by Michael Greene, I came closer to understanding the Universal meaning of The Beloved and Divine Love.This book somehow illustrated spiritually cryptic things for me: What does it mean to have compassion for The Other? What does Sacred Interconnection mean? How do we love our selves or others in that secret place where there is no ego, no fear, no illusion?Take your time with this book. Don't expect results right away. I found that I got some things from it almost immediately... And other things I had to come back to a few times in contemplation, or many times, to really appreciate.I found it amazing how Michael Green's collages of modern (colliding atomic particle paths), ancient, religious and astronomy photography, brought about inner movement and emotion within me.A great gift for yourself if you are a Seeker...and also to those of your friends who are, too, whether they know it or are about to find out.This book has led me to explore other translations of Rumi. Above all, it has helped get me to a greater appreciation of the universality of the Love of God, sans the human limitations that religion, culture, gender or language restrict the word \\"God\\" to."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"This book is a gem. I got 2 copies and gave 1 to my surgeon whom has been working closely with me for the past 10 months as a gift to say thank you and the other copy I gave to a cousin for her 30th Birthday.

Through the inspired heart-work of Coleman Barks and Michael Green, we, the readers, are gifted by the Gift Rumi received. Now we can meet and perhaps love Rumi and his, our Beloved. I am forever touched and grateful to know Rumi. His words and his living presence communicate the human condition and the spirit-essence of all, inviting us to love as we are loved by our Lover."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Some people who are more educated about Rumi complain that the translations by Coleman Barks are not accurate enough. I am no expert on Rumi, and I probably will not become one. I am a casual observer. This book with it's wonderful poems and exotic images is captivating. It is better than I expected, though perhaps less than compelling than Rumi's original words. But then, when any book is translated from one language to another, things are lost. However, I think this is a great introduction to Rumi. The poems in the book seem to be well chosen, and the images in the book are very fascinating. Consider it a beginning -- an introduction to Rumi, and also a book that might compel you to read more books of Rumi's poems. And as a coffee table book, others will pick it up and look. They too might be compelled to learn more about Rumi and his poetry.The poems are inspiring. The illustrations are most creative, and perhaps distracting from the poetry. They attract more attention than the poems. Still, however, the poems are the core of the book, and once you see an image, you'll want to read the poem that inspired it.Most of the experts on Rumi agree that there are better books, but this is a great introduction and it will inspire the curious to read more. This is a worthy hard cover, table top introduction. Buy it! The price is right. The poems are beautifully laid out. The illustrations are very captivating. When I first opened the package and took a glance at it, the only thing that I could say was \\"Oh my!\\" I think you'll be delighted with it too."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"I bought this book for my son for Christmas based on reviews of best books of 2009 in which one reviewer recommended it and said she used it as a sort of daily meditation. Reviews on Amazon are mixed, but since I have no access to the original language and i am not a specialist in the field, I decided to buy it anyway. Perhaps the translation falls short of the original, as is so often the case, but the book is exquisitely illustrated and the poems/commentaries speak to the heart and the spirit."},{"Title":"The Illuminated Rumi","review":"Green and Barks have created a wonderful book to interest anyone who is spiritually minded. Not sure if Rumi was translated perfectly or even in accordance with Sufism--there probably was a lot lost in translation as is always the case. However, the poems appeal to one who is interested in universal truth and the book moves you to think about the Infinite--and that may be the ultimate purpose of any spiritual work. This book adds beauty in artistry (right brain) and then asks the deep and pointed questions that get you thinking (left brain).I've given away over 15 copies and everyone has enjoyed this book.The Illuminated Rumi is in my all time TOP 10 favorites and I take it off the shelf often...and I must have over 20 books on Sufism that never even get opened."},{"Title":"Fat Man from Colombia","review":"This is one of Pattinson's better novels, a realistic but unsatisfactory ending is my only complaint. Fat Man from Colombia is the story of Daniel Kemp returning to civilian life after a long stint in the SAS. Not having seen his younger sister for years he decides to track her down only to find out she was brutally murdered by a Colombian drug lord who wouldn't take no for an answer. He considers vengeance and when he is shot in the head and assumed dead by two men who do not appreciate his enquiring his decision becomes clear. He will have his vengeance and kill the fat man from Colombia.James Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.Other great Pattinson novels are Homecoming, The Silent Voyage, Skeleton Island, The Time of Your Life, Away With Murder, Blind Date, The Murmansk Assignment, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang, Spoilers, The Golden Reef, A Car for Mr Bradley, Bavarian Sunset, The Sinister Stars and Life Preserver."},{"Title":"The Body Electric: How Strange Machines Built the Modern American (American History and Culture Series)","review":"A delightful history of our American obsession with self-improvement and reinvention, our love affair with gimmicks and gadgetry, and our unshakable devotion to the promise of the quick fix.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Body Electric: How Strange Machines Built the Modern American (American History and Culture Series)","review":"This book shows that our current obsessions with our bodies and machines have roots as old as the rise of consumer electricity.

In exploring the ways Americans have used their bodies to understand new technologies, she sheds light on the origins of our own interactions with modern machines. The author supports her findings with meticulously researched facts, and it is clear she spent exhausting hours in the archives, combing through newspaper articles, advertisements, and product materials. She does an equally thorough job of contextualizing her conclusions. By linking her findings to social and cultural shifts taking place at the same time people were drinking radium water or experimenting with electric belts, she strengthens her argument and is able to draw new and important conclusions about the ways Americans were using technology around the turn of the twentieth century. Her clear and concise writing style make the book a smooth and enjoyable read, besides being one that is extremely relevant to our modern lives."},{"Title":"The Body Electric: How Strange Machines Built the Modern American (American History and Culture Series)","review":"As I read this book, I marveled at the way in which Ms. Thomas de la Pena explained in detail the obsession Americans have had for so long with physical fitness and weight loss techniques; the belief by many Americans that their bodies, after use of some of these documented, extreme -- to us -- measures, would emerge greatly improved. This book helps us energy-bar-eating, aerobically-charged, iron-pumping 21st-Century individuals understand how it is that we got this way!"},{"Title":"Karate the Japanese Way","review":"Mark Groenewold's new book Karate the Japanese Way is definitely a &quot;must have&quot; for every karate student. Mark's conversational writing style makes this book very easy to read and enjoy. In contrast to so many other karate texts, Karate the Japanese Way gives the reader a sense of chatting with a friend, rather than being preached at by a self-proclaimed karate master. The book is very well illustrated and covers the entirety of Mark's training in Japan, from the day he met his teacher, Taniguchi-sensei, through warm-ups and stretching to what he calls the triad of karate... kihon, kata and kumite.This book does not go into too many details with regards to the execution of karate techniques, nor does it profess to. This is not a \\"how to\\" manual of karate. Instead it shows those of us in the Western world how karate is really taught and learned in Japan.I am not a \\"dan\\" level student in karate, nor do I even train in the same style of karate (Shotokan), as Groenewold-sensi, but I still think this book should be on the bookshelf of every karate student, regardless of rank or style."},{"Title":"Karate the Japanese Way","review":"\\"Karate the Japanese Way\\" written by Mark Groenewold is truly a wonderful book. Groenewold Sensei has torn asunder concepts of what Western Karate practitioners conceive how Karate is done in Japan. Mark has given us, best described in his own words, an \\"unadulterated perspective of what karate is like in Japan, how the Japanese train, and what are the key elements of karate from a Japanese perspective.\\" Not many of us \\"Dans\\" have ever trained in Japan, so Groenewold Sensei takes through a tour of Karate in Japan chapter by chapter. Answering many questions we might have about types of dojos, etiquette, types of instructors and so many other topics. By interweaving his own experiences through out the book makes the reading not only fun but very interesting. To be honest with you all, I am so glad my Shodan testing was nothing like Groenewold Sensei's. Please, do not misconstrue my previous statement.

Groenewold Sensei has torn asunder concepts of what Western Karate practitioners conceive how Karate is done in Japan. Mark has given us, best described in his own words, an \\"unadulterated perspective of what karate is like in Japan, how the Japanese train, and what are the key elements of karate from a Japanese perspective.\\" Not many of us \\"Dans\\" have ever trained in Japan, so we repeat what we have been taught by our American/Japanese Sensei's here in America. Not realizing that they may be modified due to the fact we are not a Japanese culture but Western (Question: is that the reason for repeating the Dojo Kun for adults???). So we repeat the customs of what were taught under the guise of \\"Well, that's how they do it in Japan.\\" Guess what! We are very wrong on some of our concepts and that not how they do it!Groenewold Sensei takes through a tour of Karate in Japan chapter by chapter. Answering many questions we might have about types of dojos, etiquette, types of instructors and so many other topics. By interweaving his own experiences through out the book makes the reading not only fun but very interesting. To be honest with you all, I am so glad my Shodan testing was nothing like Groenewold Sensei's. Please, do not misconstrue my previous statement. My exam was very demanding and grueling but it was not insane. What am I talking about.... well, buy this book and find out!I recommend this book to one and all. No matter what your rank is, one will learn from it.Frank Thomas4th DanMuskegon Karate AssociationMuskegon, Michigan"},{"Title":"Karate the Japanese Way","review":"As a student and teacher of JKA-style Shotokan karate who had the opportunity to train in Japan in the early 70's, I was very much impressed with this book. The information is accurate, presented in an engaging manner,and is very readable. This isn't your typical instruction manual (though there is an instructional section). For beginnning students, or people just starting to look for a quality, credible school in which to train, there is very helpful advice, advice which, to the best of my knowledge is to be found in print nowhere else. This is a look at how training is done in Japan, but the information is truly international. What makes good training there really differs little from what makes quality training and instruction here in US, or anywhere else. Were I to find myself transplanted to Germany or Great Britain, this would still be very solid advice. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in training in any traditional Japanese or Okinawan school of karate. Many instructors would do well to read it, as well."},{"Title":"Karate the Japanese Way","review":"The book is written in a way that does explain the Japanese karate training experience very well. I've done it for 35+ years and his book sums up a lot of things that take a long time to figure out. I was trained by a former JKA kumite champion who came to the U.S. with little english and a goal of teaching karate as it was taught to him and figuring out what he wasn't taught. He is still a great teacher although he has not reached out for the commercial aspects of karate.The book goes a long way in helping students understand the JKA and what is the essence of the karate training.It will be interesting to see if the author can write another book in 10 more years about what else he has learned."},{"Title":"Karate the Japanese Way","review":"A super good book for folks thinking about taking karate one of the best books out there on the subject. the cool thing about the book he was talking common sense.no fairy tell stuff.

This book, on the other hand, provides in-depth step-by-step instructions for both the basic and more advanced features available in MS Access.

Naturally, I have the CS package and that is just too new for this publication. When you run many many of the scripts (maybe most of them... I stopped using their examples after the first few) it hangs Photoshop or causes other errors. One \\"new document\\" script actually killed my G5 (first time ever I had to reboot from a crash!).I phoned the company who made the book (maranGraphics) and they were not helpful. There is no new version of this book planned nor is there an \\"updates\\" website or any further help.My advice: Unless you are working with only older versions of Photoshop and Illustrator, skip this book. Instead, use the PDFs that come with the CS package. They are as helpful as this book will be to you without the problems that will cause crashes.My advice to Maran: You should take a clue from other companies that make tech help books and provide a free \\"updates\\" site that includes differences between your book and later releases of software or any errata or whatnot. As it is, this book is only good for a few months and as specialized as this topic is, that means few sales."},{"Title":"Adobe Scripting: Your Visual Blueprint to Scripting in Photoshop and Illustrator","review":"Great book to get started in scripting.

She performs in the avant-garde theater masterpiece Deafman Glance by Robert Wilson. He is a well- known poet who spends in Paris several months every year and was amazed by the beauty of Deafman Glance as many other intellectuals and artists who had the opportunity to see the play in those times. They become friends. She assists him when he gets a fever and they have several conversations in his apartment mainly related to the play. But they meditate on past life experiences in their respective harsh worlds, as well. The book is the novel, often quite hermetic, of this dialog. She claims what really got her attached to Wilson theater was silence rediscovered. He reports a poem on her sitting in a throne-like armchair in the full light of noon with a black raven to her left during the first act of the play and defines it his snapshot of a black American girl. Deafman Glance transcends surrealism because it is really a world-model. In fact, Sheryl says she was in the right place for her when she was sitting on her throne. And that's why she broke into a sweat when she had to stand up. Pilinszky continues with the description of the other acts. There's a cut-out the size of a door in the sack curtain. During the second act, a wheat field can be seen in it. Then, it disappears and a sort of storeyed galleon with banks of slaves and long oars takes its place while a seal heaves itself in from a corridor and settles in front of the stage. The slowed-down movements of several mute characters are an essential feature of the play. The scene is becoming empty again and the \\"audience\\" is left alone in front of the seal for a long time. The third act is the most famous. With a low whine rising to the pitch of a full howl, a small creature rushes at the spectators. Sheryl comes in, gives the child a drink, pulls her elbow-high black gloves onto both hands and cuts the child's throat with a razor. A black boy, the same age as the one she has killed, blocks her way. Twice, a deaf-mute's characteristic howl breaks out from the boy and Sheryl claps her hand over the boy's mouth, producing silence. On a snow-white piano a black girl plays Chopin. Sheryl and the boy in her tracks disappear from our view. The fourth act takes place inside and outside a cave. Outside the cave Sheryl is sitting. The light inside the cave is at times paradisal, at times infernal, a purgatorial light at times. The face of a creature changes from an angel to a locust and from a locust to an angel. The fifth scene: Supper at the Frog King's, the closest to a fairytale, is about the anxieties of late childhood. Sheryl is not in this act. She shows up again in the sixth and final act with all the characters of the play. Every character gets burnt like a piece of paper and the play ends. They compare the theater of Deafman Glance to circus. Sheryl observes Wilson did not give his actors names, just as the most wonderful trapeze artist has no name either. She asks Pilinszky \\"are you really going to write our book down?\\". He answers \\"I'll do my best to write it all down, Sheryl\\" and they say goodbye to each other."},{"Title":"Last Heroes - Volume One Of Men At War","review":"An excellent first book in this series.

(I am 62 now) Re-reading it now, I am more mature, and realize the actual philosophy of this pilot. He was brave and capable to the n-th degree, but he was unable to recognize that we are all humans, and all have human rights.I believe the introduction or forward should have brought this out more. And there at the end of the war, he should not have been allowed to continue to use that Nazi salute.I did appreciate the knowledge that the captured soldiers were treated so badly. Once upon a time, I did not believe that Americans could behave like that. It just goes to show that anyone can succumb to the \\"isms\\" that force others to do things they would not normally consider. I became aware that one of my kinfolk would have supported the Nazis. It was unreal to hear this person spew the hatred, just like the Nazis. I never was able to reconcile myself to this. So although I believe Hans Rudel was wrong in his beliefs, I have come to believe that we need to educate ourselves to prevent the recurrence of such things.It is recommended that this book be read by others with an open mind, and to realize what exactly the author says and does not say. John"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I purchased this book because my old paperback needed to be replaced. I also wanted this latest edition that covered his life after the war and with all of the photographs that the original book did not have. This is a wonderful book with many photos but if you have read the original book this is not the same. It does not have anywhere near the text or his personal accounts and stories from his war experiences that were in the original and that is very disappointing. This is a very nice book but I wonder why his orignal story was left out as it was incredible."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"The only sad thing about this book is that Rudel, (or his nom-de-guerre, \\"Hannelore\\") fought on the side of the Germans. Granted, he mostly fought the USSR, but they weren't much better or worse than Nazi Deutsch. Also, Hannelore was a devout believer in Nazism and the Reich, and expouses his views about fighting the Asian hordes. It's too bad he wasn't fighting against the Nazis instead of for them. Having said that, I'll continue the review and concentrate on the story and the man without mention of governments and allegiances.This story is incredibly inspirational and tough. Hannelore's internal motivation and positive outlook on life in the face of monstrously huge opposition is so huge as to be unworldly.This book should be read by every US servicemember. It's not 'politically correct,' so it'll never happen, but maybe the government could throw in a disclaimer at the beginning or something at the front about how we're not trying to make our soldiers into Wermacht troops!Hannelore's quote, that \\"Only he is lost who gives himself up for lost,\\" is one of the best maxims I can think of in life.Outstanding inside view of the Luftwaffe, Hitler's high command, and fighting on the Eastern Front. A dash of humor thrown in with the horror, as well. This is a great read, one that I'd give to my troops in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a book to inspire your troops, this is probably more interesting and relevant than \\"Rifleman Dodd,\\" or \\"A letter to Garcia,\\" but a little more controversial due to the allegiance of the protagonist.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Quiet and unpretentious, Rudel gives an insight into a myriad of wartime German WWII topics seldom accurately or adequately discussed. Technical application of his aviation prowess is only briefly mentioned, but every fighter or attack helicopter pilot can relate. Trials of leadership under severe pressure are modestly described as he endured fighting and finally captivity in the clutches of a depraved and indifferent enemy. Should be manditory reading for all students of Prisoner of War disciplines. Finally, the ultimate cost of the war to his life is portrayed in the reunion he has with his former lover. Tragic, heroic, a most excellent read."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"THis is a wonderful book. So many photographs telling his life story. This is a must book fro any person who likes history."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Rudel is one of the toughest warriors the planet ever produced. His numbers speak well about that, but the book also shows how when he was out of his plane and alone and running for his life he never gave up. I recall reading this book when I was very sick and depressed and it lifted me with his mantra &#34;ONLY HE IS LOST WHO GIVES HIMSELF UP FOR LOST.&#34; And Rudel never gave up, not even when most of the civilized world was crashing down on Germany.His writing style is direct and easy to read and helps carry the reader through his book. He injects a constant enthusiasm in the book and it shows. He also has a quirky self deprecating sense of humor. I especially liked the business about milk being his beverage of choice and how he took razzing about it.Rudel flew thousands of combat missions. He was reportedly shot down over 30 times but never by another pilot. He rescued German pilots behind enemy lines. He fled miles in a harrowing effort to escape the Russians during one botched rescue attempt. He flew most of his missions in an outdated plane (the Stuka) and outflew much faster fighters. He was awarded the highest medals Germany could find and when they ran out of them they made a new one for him alone. He was injured and had part of his leg amputated and kept on fighting. Hitler forbade him from fighting (likely afraid that his death would dishearten Germans and be propaganda for the allies) and he just went right on fighting. He was a one man war machine. Even after the war, he wrote this book, played sports (he was an avid sportsman) and was reported to have climbed the 5th tallest volcano in the world, more than once! (with 1 and half legs!)Note: Rudel was a man who committed 100% to his cause. He believed the Germans and Nazis were right and fought for them with everything he had. I can disagree with him and be amazed at his ability at the same time. Ultimately he showed what a person can do who throws himself fully into a cause. Whatever else can be said of him he was a selfless, brave and strong willed man of incredible capability."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I enjoyed this book. I recommomend this book to other readers who are interested in the history of the world war II. This book is intersesing and I loved reading it."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Make no mistake: this guy was a devil in disguise, and he needed to be, in order to survive in the brutal Eastern Front in World War II.The ferocity, determination, audacity, skill and dareness he applied in his attacks against the Russians, since the start of the war, must mean that he supported (or was brain-washed, like so many) Nazi doutrination to the core, knowing or not knowing about the atrocities.Even if the text was bad (which is not, although completely avoiding post-war controversies), it would be worth jsut for the photso, which are amazing."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"This is the story of Hans-Ulrich Rudel's WW II flying career. It is a facinating read. Hans describes himself as a slow learner and by disipline and hard work became one of the greatest flyers ever."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I HAVE A PAPERBACK OF THIS BOOK WHICH PUBLISHED BY BALLANTINE BOOKS N.Y. IT IS A GREAT HISTORY OF NOT ONLY HANS RUDEL BUT ALSO WW2 EASTERN FRONT."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"... I will give an extra star for the writing style, not the accuracy, of this book, as well as its importance as a historical document.Rudel plays up many of his own missions, and it seems a little small of him to refer to his many rear gunners without knowing their names. Perhaps this was typical of a German officer, but the many I've interviewed or read about usually descibed relations within smaller units as intimate - certainly on a first name or \\"du\\" basis.In any event, despite this being a very \\"German\\" history long on heroics and short on contextual details, the book is an exciting read, and doesn't stray too terribly far from the facts. Rudel was the most decorated soldier in the German Wehrmacht (unlike Goering, he earned the highest decorations) - it is not too odd that any traces of National Socialism, anti-semetism, or thoughts of \\"untermensch\\" related to those he was fighting - and killing - are not evident. I would criticize this book for being sanitized more than I would for being exaggerated."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Hans-Ulrich Rudel was the ultimate aerial warrior, regardless of nationality. As the most decorated warrior to emerge from any nation during the war, his combat career was unparalelled and will never be equalled. However, stating these facts, the book should have gone into greater detail regarding Rudel's post war involvement with the ODESSA and his anti-Semitic views and activities following the war. Taking nothing away from his stellar record in Stukas, the book is lacking in specific detail that would have made it a more accurate biography."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I found this book to be both facinating and detailed. Rudel's bravery and skill can not be debated. I came away from the book with a better understanding of how and why the Germans fought. Rudel writes effectively that the German fighting man was fighting for his family and country--not the ideals of the Nazi party and derived his courage from his comrades. Towards the end of the war, he claimed to have known nothing of the Nazi attrocities that were committed upon the Jews and many other ethnic groups.With this in mind, my experience with the book was considerably diminished to learn that Rudel was actually one of the leading Germans who continued to finance fugitive Nazis living in South America after the war. At first denouncing the Nazi attrocities in the book, he went on to financially support and conceal the very people responsible for these attrocities. It leads me to question some of the accounts in the book, but still reccommend it as \\"must read\\" for WW2 history buffs."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"the lines between hero, fool and lucky are often hard to distinguish and more often ignored. rudel's accomplishments, as he remembers them, are indeed extraordinary. imagine a single pilot sinking capitol ships, destroying hundreds of front line tanks and thousands of trucks and artillery pieces all while flying an aircraft that was obsolete at the war's begining. in addition to rudel's flying stories, he also shares with the reader the more 'traditional' views of germany's enemies and its leaders both of which the author openly embraces. rudel is strictly 'old school'. i first read 'stuka pilot' at the age of twelve, it being the first of dozens of books i have read by enemy combatants over the years. i have found the book an excellent primary source to life 'on the other side' and during subsequent readings of the rudel book over the years i am always as impressed with his skill with an airplane as with his skill with a typewriter. rudel should be remembered for his accomplishments as both writer and pilot along with such other heros of the sky as billy bishop or gregg boyington."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Rudel rates as surely the greatest combat pilot ever. He was also brave, resolute and skilled.His exploits were totally exceptional. Rudel lacked any form of compassion, he was an enthusiastic Nazi and supported \\"Lebensraum\\" even after the end of the 3rd Reich. Only Germany or Russia could produce such a talented monster, a psychopath of his nature would have drawn attention to himself in the US or Britain. Rudel had an ability that was prized in the Reich and could have just as easily been employed in the concentration camps.Rudel was an epitome of the Nietzsche Ubermensch.That he was lionized after the war and was given a Nazi burial complete with Heil Hitler's and a Jet flypast, indicates that Germany is still a strange place. That Rudel was the son of a Lutheran Minister should be no surprise, He was a man of unquestioning faith, a shallow moral imbecile."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"As one of the few pilots to survive the entire war (especially considering the fact that he flew Stukas for the majority of the time) his experiences provide for and facinating and unique look at the nature of winged-warfare on the Eastern Front. While there is no denying that he must have been a brave and capable flier to be decorated as he was, one view what he writes with some measure of scepticism. If not fabricated, some of his recollections are without a doubt embellished. The nature of warfare in the air--as far as an arm-chair pilot such as myself can tell--is such that fully comprehending the chaos around one in the midst of combat makes it difficult for even the most astute person to have an accurate understanding afterwards of what happened. Successes were almost always exaggerated by pilots from all nationalities, and there is no reason to believe that Rudel just as prone to doing so. Whatever the case, the book is very interesting and is a must read for any WWII buff."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Considered on purely military grounds, the heroes of Nazi Germany's armed forces were as remarkable as the best fighting men anywhere. Fighter aces such as Adolf Galland, panzer commanders such as Michael Wittmann, generals such as Erwin Rommell, all enjoyed the unfeigned respect of friend and foe alike. The soldierly virtues of boldness, duty, martial skill, and dash transcended national and ideological boundaries.The most highly decorated man on the German side during World War II was Hans-Ulrich Rudel, stuka pilot, and this picture biography is a 277 page long valentine to him. He comes across as quite an alpha male in these pages. His lust for life brought him success in his military career, and his postwar mountaineering and sporting competitions.Now, if you're here, you probably already know the background of Rudel's weapon of choice, the Junkers Ju-87 Stuka divebomber. By the time the war started it was already obsolescent, beginning to be outclassed by fighters entering service with the Western allies. But in the early going it was the very outward and visible sign of Nazi hyper-aggression. The black crooked-wing craft even looked somewhat like a flying swastika. The whine of its propeller and the screech of its dive siren triggered terror in its victims. Though the Stuka was soon driven from the skies of the Western front, it served in the East as a most capable ground attack airplane right up to the very end of the war. Rudel's Stuka was equipped with 3.7 cm flak cannons, to make it a feared _panzerknacker_, or tank buster.This book relates in minute detail Rudel's many accomplishments. He and his squadron single-handedly beat back a Soviet armored assault. He rescued the crew of a downed Stuka from under the noses of the advancing Red Army. He was himself downed behind enemy lines and got back to his base in a masterpiece of evasion and escape. He even lost part of a leg and kept flying, was officially grounded and kept flying clandestinely. He finished the war with upwards of 2,500 combat missions, 500 tank kills, and one sunk battleship to his credit--an amazing feat given that he flew a slow, out-of-date aircraft in a theater where the enemy enjoyed air superiority from about 1944 onwards. Thank God his side lost, but the man deserved all the praise he got.The latter third of the book deals with his postwar career as an adventurer masquerading as an industrial salesman. While &quot;alive and well and living in Argentina&quot; he schmoozed with the Perons, climbed the world's highest volcano three times, and got in some high-diving--all this with one leg, remember. Curiously, the book makes no mention and includes no pictures of Rudel's funeral, though the German edition of this translation was published four years after his death. It also does not discuss his continued Nazi sympathies, and his recurring embarrassment of the West German government with his right-wing activities after the war. But be charitable: he was the greatest combat pilot ever, and should be respected as such"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"When I was 11 years old, back in 1984 or so, my Dad bought me this book in of one of those overpriced airport bookstores, probably to shut me up. Now it is 2004, and that same book, beat to all hell, sits on a bookshelf in my apartment. In the intervening 20 years I have probably read it once every year, faithfully, and it never disappoints. It was written in a different age, an extinct age, when it was possible for men to be great, and believe absolutely in their causes, and if it seems dated, that is probably a harsher judgement against us than it is against the author. It is not a political book, it has no \\"world view\\" and its only philosophy is the maxim of its author: you surrender when you die.Hans-Ulrich Rudel was the only son of a Silesian minister. An awkward boy, frightened of thunderstorms, addicted to athletics, a bit of a misfit, he was hardly the Aryan ideal. Pictures of him show a guy who looks more like Mandy Patinkin than Robert Shaw. As a young man he eschewed girls and beer in favor of sport, was considered a \\"queer fish\\" and found himself to be such a slow learner at flying that he spent the first two years of World War II gathering dust, deemed unfit for combat. On top of all of that, he found himself stuck flying the antiquated, ugly-duckling dive bomber known to history as the \\"Stuka\\" rather than the sleek fighter plane he had envisoned himself in as a kid, jumping out of his parent's second-floor window holding an umbrella. Not an auspicious beginning.Rudel was a classic example of a man making up for lost time. When he finally flew his first combat missions, in the fall of 1941, he took out all the frustration of being viewed as \\"unfit\\" on the Soviet army, who over the next four years learned to fear and hate the very sight of him, the very mention of his name. He was as much a boogeyman to the USSR as von Richtoften (the Red Baron) had been to the French and English twenty years previously. He was the man they could not kill, the man who came screaming out of the sky again and again from Leningrad to Stalingrad, hurling bombs and cannon shells and machine-gun fire down on them from an outdated old machine, killing without mercy and without pause, immune to fear, immune to pain, immune to wounds, fatigue, despair and the odds.How much of a bad-arse was Rudel? Well, let's put this in perspective. At the height of the air-war over Germany in 1943, it was considered a statistical improbability that a bomber pilot could survive 25 missions. Chuck Yeager, one hell of a fine combat pilot and tough, gutsy, ornery human being, shot down 12 German planes and flew about fifty-odd missions as a fighter jock. Tommy McGuire and Dick Bong, America's top aces of WWII, shot down 78 (confirmed) Japanese planes between them. Rudel, on the other hand, flew over 2,000 combat missions, blew up 519 Soviet tanks, sank the Soviet battleship \\"Marat\\" and a cruiser of 10,000 tons displacement, bagged numerous enemy fighters, and won so many medals that several had to be struck specifically for him, including his 2,000 sortie medal and the Golden oakleaves to his Knights Cross, of which he was the only recipient. During that time he was shot down six times behind enemy lines, took a bullet in the shoulder, a bullet in the leg and had another leg blown clean off....and kept flying. He kept flying despite orders not to fly, kept flying even when he had to work his control pedals with a cane, and when Germany finally surrendered, he refused to give up to the Soviets and had his entire squadron land on an American air base, \\"pancaking\\" their aircraft so the Yanks couldn't get their hands on them. In interrogations he was so arrognat (he insisted on behaving as if he were still in command, including giving and recieiving the Nazi salute) that he was written off as a \\"typical Nazi officer\\" but responded with the classic comeback, \\"Can't you see, I never fought for a political party, only for Germany?\\"Rudel's fight never really ends. Defeat, to him, comes at the moment of death, and the war did not kill him. Therefore, the war goes on. And on. And on.\\"Stuka Pilot\\" is written in a sort of battlefield-telegraph style, terse and spartan. Rudel is not a writer, but he has the occasional ability to comminicate more than the sum of his flight log entries. The most teasing parts of the book are his glimpses into the famous figures of history he met and worked with: Hitler, Himmler, Goring, Ribbentrop, Skorzeny, Riefenstahl, Speer, etc. If it has a drawback, it is that he doesn't spend near enough time fleshing his personal relationships out.Of course, it can be argued that without men like Rudel fighting and killing for him, Adolf Hitler would have been rendered harmless, a lunatic ranting on a streetcorner; and a case could be made that Rudel and his ilk \\"empowered\\" the homidical Fuhrer to do what he did. But according to Shakespeare, the other half of the argument goes like this: \\"If the cause be not good, our allegience to the king wipes the crime of it clean.\\" Rudel fought for his country with every fiber of his being, and if he never once stopped to consider the rightness of what his country was doing, it does not make his story less inspiring. This was a man who should have passed the war peeling potatoes, and ended up as the greatest pilot of all time. As Rudel says: \\"All one needs is a break.\\""},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Every so often you come across a book that literally makes you sad when you must put it down for the last time. Consider this one a nominee to head the list.Hans Ulrich Rudel was a remarkable individual. Though considered little more than a nuisance to his commanders upon completion of his training, Rudel went on to become Germany's most highly decorated aviator--&quot;the foremost combat pilot in the world.&quot; A survivor of gunshot wounds, plane crashes, and a leg amputation (he returned to flight status within days after even *that*), to call him incredible would be a drastic understatement.Physically fit, mentally astute, possessed with an incredible force of will, and amazingly confident, Rudel was a truly dynamic figure. His maxim, &quot;Only he is lost who gives himself up for lost,&quot; though deceivingly simple, is perhaps the finest ever translated into the English language. &quot;Ridiculous,&quot; you say. Pick up Rudel's tome, flip through a few pages, and soon you will agree that these words--this man's tremendous accomplishments aside--are an inspiration unto themselves. Readers will quote that line often, with conviction, as the events portrayed in this work flash before their eyes.Although the translation is somewhat rough at times (in a couple of spots I found sentences that simply made no sense) and the punctuation takes some getting used to, it is easy to become lost in the story. Rudel's narrative strikes a brilliant balance between the daily life of an attack pilot and an overall view of the war in Europe, and many of his revelations about the war on the Eastern Front are startling. Rudel also manages to paint Adolf Hitler less as a demagogue and more as a human, something I thought completely impossible. (Rudel didn't quite convince me, but he certainly showed a side of Hitler, evil as he was in so many ways, I'd never seen before.)Thought the Stuka was slow, old, and incapable? Thought a rear gunner was anachronistic and ineffective? Thought the Soviets steamrollered the German Army with impunity after Operation Barbarosa ground to a standstill? Thought stubbing your toe on the floor was the definition of &quot;bad day?&quot; To give details would spoil this fine work. Pick up a copy. There's many a surprise here! (Note to those unfamiliar with Europe and Asia: find a good map and have it close at hand as you read &quot;Stuka Pilot&quot; as there are no maps in most versions of this book.)Some will insist Rudel's commentary is self-aggrandizing, that his recollections are tainted and innaccurate. Though this may very well be true, one must consider that history is not written by those defeated in battle. In this light, one must also concede that winning does not exempt the victors from being biased themselves, and we would serve ourselves well to read tales written by those on the short end of the proverbial stick from time to time. I cannot think of a work better suited to this purpose.This story provides its readers with a perspective on the war rarely--if at all--seen. More importantly, it stands as a testimony to what one person can accomplish in the face of insurmountable odds. An absolutely wonderful, wonderful, wonderful autobiography. Worth every dime.&quot;All one needs is a little luck,&quot; Rudel wrote....That, and the courage to try..."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"This book details Hans Ulric Rudels personal views and experiences as a stuka pilot during World War II. It is based on his recollections as he had his Pilot Log stolen from him by Americans after he surrendered.An exceptional man, who never gave up under the direst of circumstances. During the war he sunk a Battleship, destroyed around 500 tanks, shot down around 20 fighter planes and evaded capture behind enemy lines.He shows us how one man can always make a difference."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Despite his post-war political activities, Rudel still stands out as the most noteworthy soldier of the war, arguably the greatest combat pilot (Marseille was probably the best fighter pilot) in history and possibly the greatest pilot. He was apparently known to some as arrogant and unpleasant. He was the only soldier in the German armed forces to receive the Knight's Cross with golden oakleaves swords and diamonds, and was by far the most successful dive bomber. He destroyed, among other things, 519 tanks, over 1000 other vehicle, 70 landing craft etc. He flew 2530 sorties, was shot down 32 times but never by an enemy aircraft and survived the war less a leg. Many of his incredible exploits are in this book. His story is good reading on the war and is a compelling story. One can only imagine how much his signature would cost had he been killed in action. Book is well-written & translated, and the pictures are good. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I can only reiterate what the other reviewers have stated about this outstanding work. It is well worth the effort to track down a copy if you are interested in the eastern front, Luftwaffe pilots, or just fine combat stories, read this one!Mr. Rudel missed The Battle of Britain, was not even considered a great pilot during training. Regardless, he entered combat when Germany invaded Russia in'41 and survived 4 brutal years of warfare. By '43 he was flying a Stuka that mounted 2 37mm cannons under it's wings and began gaining his great reputation as supreme &quot;Tankbuster&quot;. The Stuka, already dangerously slow was even more so with these guns attached. I think he got credit for around 500 tanks destroyed, about the equivelent of one entire Red Tank Army's inventory.Rudel was one of Hitler's personal favorites, and when he decorated Rudel with a high award he ussually forbade him any further combat. Of course Rudel always found a way around that. In fact, his final award, the Knight's Cross with gold oakleaves, crossed swords and diamonds was pretty much invented for Rudel, as Hitler had run out of awards to give him.Apart from straight up combat flying the book has numerous survival stories. Rudel several times landed behind lines to pick up fellow pilots (a habit Hitler eventually strictly forbade of him). On one of those occasions his plane got mired in the muck and a incredible evasion and escape adventure begins. In the final weeks Rudel is flying FW-190s, one legged. Rudel was, perhaps understandably a sore loser and shows this at the end, when he flew to an allied field to surrender. At his command, he and his fellow pilots locked the brakes and collapsed their landing gear to render their planes useless to the allies. A futile gesture that still demonstrated his defiance to what was a bitter end for his Luftwaffe career. I can't recomend this great book enough."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Printed by Schiffer Publishing, an assurance that it is top quality. There are other books that deal more in Rudel's life, both the good and the questionable post-war, but this one pretty much has everything that all but the most ardent reader would. Enough text to please, and many, many splendid photographs. Most people don't realize that the greatest Lufwaffe pilot didn't fly fighters, but the Ju-87, and man, did he ever fly it! He had no equal. Whatever his post-war activities, I'm not here to judge, but this is a splendid book of perhaps the most accomplished pilot of WWII."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"STUKA PILOT is the autobiography and Second World War adventures of Hans Ulrich Rudel. Rudel, one of the most highly decorated officers in the German Third Reich, was Hitler's favorite soldier. His unbridled passion was to be a pilot and keep flying. Wounded severely several times, he continued flying combat missions until the end of the war. Often incorrectly stereotyped as an \\"Unrepentant Nazi,\\" STUKA PILOT's emphasis is on Rudel's experiences as a Luftwaffe pilot and commander. Born to humble circumstances, Rudel struggled to gain acceptance into a Luftwaffe officer candidate program. Though an exceptional athlete -- and often a dare-devil -- Rudel chose a dive bombers as his piloting career field.The book follows Rudel through his early frustrations in missing out on early campaigns and being grounded by unforgiving squadron staff officers. The invasion of the Soviet Union offered Rudel the opportunity to hone dive bombing operations to a fine art. Rapid promotion followed. At the end of the war we find Rudel commanding anti-tank dive bombing units as just about the only force remaining to stem the Red Army.STUKA PILOT provides excellent military history reading along with lessons in leadership. Though highly recommended, the book does harbor shortcomings. Rudel's printed story is too closely translated from German and the verbiage is sometimes confusing. Rudel's narrative also sometimes strays from a chronological recounting of events. As noted in other reviews, most versions of this book lack maps of any sort and so it is difficult to appreciate the extensive geography involved in this story. Rudel's story also abruptly ends with the end of the war. It is too bad that he did not append later version with his post war activities.Do not expect to find much about Rudel's personal life in this volume. This book is devoted to Rudel's wartime exploits. Consider STUKA PILOT a military classic. If you enjoy military aviation books about World War Two, this book should find its way into your collection."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I first read Stuka Pilot when I was ten years old, back in 1965. I re-read it recently, and was still inspired. Even during my darkest hours I remembered Rudel's axiom: &quot;Only he is lost who gives himself up for lost.&quot; In spite of the fact that he was on the other side of the war, his message is a message of encouragement to anyone who is faced with life's difficulties."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I am an attack pilot for the US Marine Corps. I found Rudel's story so motivating that I had to pass the book on to others in my squadon. All my peers give it rave reviews as well. So many have read it now that it is starting to fall apart and I will probably have to order more copies soon.Although times and tactics have changed, the warrior spirit and leadership that Rudel showed is still an inspiration for attack pilots today"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Stuka pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel demands respect, no matter which side one was on. He was an unapologetic German who defended his country to the very bitter end. Flying a slow Ju-87 bomber, he somehow survived a record 2,530 operational missions. In a war which went through pilots like a wildfire in a paper-doll factory, Rudel was shot down more than 30 times. Showing an indomitable will (\\"Only he is lost who gives himself up for lost!\\"), he was wounded at least five times and lost his right leg below his knee, but refused the direct orders of Hitler and Goring not to fly so he could stay with his squadron and defend his homeland in an obviously losing battle. He destroyed a record 519 Soviet tanks, the Soviet battleship Marat and a cruiser, 150 gun emplacements, and more than 800 combat vehicles. His awards included: the German Golden Cross, Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, Oak Leaves, Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, Diamonds, Golden Pilot's Medal with Diamonds, Golden Front Service Medal with Diamonds and the highest German award for bravery, one which was made specifically for him -- the Gold Oak Leaves with Swords and Diamonds to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, not to mention being the only foreigner to receive Hungary's highest award: the Medal for Bravery, an award only seven others had earned. \\"Hard to kill\\" is an understatement, even with the vastly numerically superior Soviets targeting him (\\"the Nazi Swine\\") specifically. Rudel rightfully offers no apologies for his loyalty to his country (It wasn't like he lit any ovens -- he flew planes). Told in a matter-of-fact narrative, Rudel doesn't embellish or exaggerate. As a reader of World War II books for 40 years, I found his story the most compelling of all. As far as pilots go, I was left even more impressed with him than Manfred von Richtofen -- the Red Baron -- of World War I fame, and that's saying a lot. Rudel was a pilot's pilot, and along with every other nationality in the war, a hero by any definition. PTSD? What's that? A one-of-kind, ultimate warrior, one who penned a must-read book, which offers a different, unique view of the notorious Eastern Front. Highly, highly recommended, Why not a 5-star review? I'm a writer and its writing doesn't match its subject. Then again, nothing could. Forget that Rudel was a Nazi and look at the man. An incredible story."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"It was a really great book and I enjoyed it very much. A very good read and recommend it to lovers of ww2."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Excellent book. Fasinating first person experience of the war in the East from the German side. Insightful and thilling!"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Hans Ulrich Rudel completed 2530 combat missions, almost all of them at the controls of a Ju-87 Stuka dive bomber. Germany's most highly decorated pilot of the war, Rudel proved also to be a great innovator in close air support tactics. He was credited with killing 510 tanks and one battleship. In combat, he had to level-off just above the ground and fly at a tank's turret and fire on it with wing mounted 30mm cannons. Technological advances by 1991 would allow the Fairchild A-10 to find it less daunting, though just as exhilarating in the Gulf war. Stuka Pilot is an exciting story told unashamedly by a great warrior"},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"The Ju-87 dive bomber was already obsolescent after the Fall of France and Holland, but in the hands of skilled and courageous pilots like Rudel it continued to strike terror into the infantry, armor and warships underneath it's siren-screeching vertical plunge. Some have recoiled at Rudel's dedication to the Nazi cause, but as the British fighter ace Douglas Bader says in his foreword, one cannot easily demonize raw courage and skill merely because its practitioner fought for a morally corrupt cause. Rudel's postwar career, first in Argentina then upon his return to Germany in 1953, shows that his admiration for Hitler's \\"military genius\\" and the Nazi cause was undiminished. On this account, he had a difficult time finding a German publisher for his war diary. But by then the Cold War and German industrial regeneration (in which Rudel played some part) made many German politicians and military men look the other way.In the early 1950s anti-Bolshevism was back in fashion as the Soviet menace overshadowed any concerns about German \\"de Nazification\\".However controversial his political views, Rudel was a highly skilled, audacious airman and adventurer and it's these qualities that shine through his fascinating narrative of close air support missions in the face of daunting opposition. One of the little-known facts about Rudel is that his advice was sought by US Air Force planners when developing the close air support plane that eventually became the A-10 \\"Wart Hog\\" --one of the most successful CAS aircraft of modern times and a worthy successor to the likewise gawky but deadly Stuka."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"Following seriously delayed delivery, the book was received in excellent condition. Great reading and rare insight into the nature of human conflict. Very inspirational in how taking sides in a conflict is inconsequential to the victory with one's own limitations, strengthening one's will and resolve to accomplish one's goals against any adversity."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"'Stuka Pilot' is an amazing read. It's the autobiography of German dive bomber pilot Hans Rudel in WWII. Flying the slow JU-87 Stuka he was the most successful and lucky military pilot in history. He survived over 2500 missions mostly against the Soviet military. He sank their battleship Marat, and destroyed hundreds of tanks. Shot down numerous times, once captured for an instant by 3 Russians, he bolted and was shot during the escape. He still made it back to fly again. Later in the war after getting his leg shot off, he continued to fly with a prosthetic leg.Truly a story of extreme courage and even more incredible luck to have survived it all."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I read this good book, here in Brazil.The author, a german pilot fought during World War II.In fact the author fought more than 2,500 combat missions;the biggest number in all human military history.Even losting part of his leg, and having adventures above any fiction movie, the author never claims any regrets for what he did fighting for nazi Germany.There's nothing about Shoah or something similar.This book is good and a pilot such as this never will come again."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"This book is terrific in terms of action as recounted by the most decoated soldier of the Third Reich. After an inglorious beginning, Rudel's star shined on the Eastern Front where he flew 2,530 operational sorties and destroyed a huge amount of enemy material. In this book he analyses many of his tactics, the conditions in Russia, the loss of many of his comrades and his narrow escapes from death and capture. He received his higher decorations from Hitler himself, thus he can also give his imrpessions about the dictator and the private conversations he had with him. Rudel was a real killing machine and he didn't stop flying even when he had his right leg amputated from a direct anti-aircraft hit. The book ends with his months of capture in England and France. Rudel states emphatically that he fought for his country and not for a particular Party, but many times in the book he repeats his horror seeing the \\"asiatic hordes\\" invading the German soil and his sorrow that the Western Allies didn't side with Nazi Germany to save the European civilization! Apart from this propaganda moments though, the book is an excellent first hand account of the colossal battles on the Eastern Front and the great carnage that experienced fliers like Rudel caused to the advancing Soviets. The only serious drawback of the book is that the English translation made a lot of errors regarding the Luftwaffe units nomneclature. Thus the Gruppe became a Squadron and the Staffel became Flight, which is absolutely wrong. The same applies for the highest command echelon, which became just Group. The ranks were also translated to their RAF equivalents (correctly this time) which is really absurd for most of the readers who are not familiar with this system. There are also some minor mistakes regarding aircraft types, which shows a lack of a good editing."},{"Title":"Stuka pilot","review":"I recently read this book and I started wondering how it would to be there and fly the real planes in the real war.

Set aside the sad truth that he dedicated his talents to the service of The Third Reich and instead focus on his individual achievements, which set him apart from nearly every warrior of history, except perhaps Achilles.I was simply unable to put the book down. Rudel's experiences from bombing Soviet ships, to blasting Soviet armor, to cliff diving, river swimming, foot racing from the enemy to flying with one leg are just a sampling of the adventure this man lived. It's no wonder that he alone bears the highest version of the Knights Cross of all Nazi Germany's many talented warriors.Rudel's exploits will inspire the reader with unapologetic admiration. His politics were flawed and remained so for the remainder of his life, but he never wavered from his dedication to Germany and to his own ideal of National Socialism. For this too, a man can be admired.

Indeed, the book is an enthralling story for anyone about one of the most accomplished military pilots in history.

All of his actions occurred on the Eastern Front against the Soviets. With over 2,500 sorties in total and over 500 Soviet tanks, a battleship and six enemy aircraft to his credit he is unmatched anywhere. Towards the war's end he lost a leg in combat but returned to the air with a prosthetic limb as soon as he could such was his courage and dedication.

Others have come close to its fame, and others perhaps even surpass it in their ingenuity, (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd;And Then There Were None) but \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is the one story in Christie's vast collection of detective novels that absolutely everyone has heard of.

Oddly enough for this time of year, the train is full of passengers of varied nationalities, including a man known as Samuel Ratchett. Ratchett approaches Poirot with a request: having received several anonymous death threats, the American wants Poirot to investigate the situation and provide some semblance of protection. Disliking the man, Poirot refuses.The following morning, Ratchett is found dead, having been stabbed twelve times in the chest in a rather erratic manner. To make matters worse, the train has become stuck in a blizzard in Yugoslavia, and Monsieur Bouc begs Poirot to investigate so as not to involve the added complication of governmental red tape. Poirot obliges, and what follows is an investigation that relies almost solely on Poirot's interviews with the passengers. Ascertaining that Ratchett was in fact a gangster responsible for the kidnapping and murder of a child, Poirot plumbs the psychological depths of his fellow passengers in order to see who had the motive and opportunity to do the deed.The novel is based on two true events that happened in Christie's lifetime, the first being the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son (an investigation which involved a maid of the household committing suicide after being interrogated by the police on suspicion of her involvement), and the second being Christie's personal experience on the Orient Express in 1931 in which she and other passengers were trapped on board due to the flooding of the track (during which she was said to have met a woman who directly inspired the character of Mrs Hubbard). In the 1970s it was adapted into what is considered the most successful movie adaptation of a Christie novel ever:Murder on the Orient Express, starring Albert Finney as the Belgian detective. There are current plans to adapt it for a second time in the David Suchet television series.The real Orient Express is shrouded in intrigue and glamour (featuring in Bram Stoker'sDraculaand Ian Fleming's James Bond novelFrom Russia with Love- heck, illusionist David Copperfield even made one of its dinner carriages disappear!) and Christie only adds to its mystique with this novel. As such, this is one of Christie's more atmospheric novels, as well as her most sophisticated. The claustrophobic conditions of the snow-bound train somehow heighten the sense of darkness and mystery, and the circumstance of the event that drives the entire plot (the death of a little girl) imbues the entire book with an inescapable sense of tragedy and grief.Make no mistake; this is Christie at the height of her powers. You'll never forget \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" and there's a reason it's described as \\"the perfect murder\\"... a description that even takes into account Poirot's presence on board."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book!!!

It involves the detective skills of Hercule Poirot who is traveling on the Orient Express train and stumbles upon a murder which seems quite impossible to solve. But of course he is brilliant and will piece together the jigsaw puzzle, even though many of the pieces don't seem to fit.

Given repeated readings I know exactly whodunnit and every twist and turn of the plot but it doesn't matter.

Not now. When it's all over. When its behind us -- then --\\" This quote is essentially the spark that lit the long, winding fuse leading to the explosive labeled, \\"AHA!\\" The person who spoke these intriguing words was Miss Debenham. Hercule Poirot, the main detective in charge of the whole investigation of Rachett's murder, overheard this being said. He started to wonder. This is my favorite line out of the whole book mainly for its meaning and spark. After this was said I automatically knew someone was going to die, hence \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\". I also knew that the two people talking, Miss Debenham and Colonel Arduthnot, were close and may later turn out to be accomplices. In the book it says that Poirot heard this and started to wonder. This says that Poirot is very observant and pays attention to small details and what they could mean. One thing I really liked about this book was how there were three parts. Part one was essentially the story, that is, everything before the murder and the reactions of the people after. Every chapter in part two was an interview between Poirot and one of the passengers from the Calais coach. Part two is when Poirot gathered the bulk of the information he needed to narrow down the murderer/murderers. In part three, all of the pieces were beginning to fall into place and in the end Poirot found out who it was. Or so he thinks. I won't spoil it for you. Another thing I really liked about this book was when you read this book, you don't only read it from one perspective, you get to see what happened from many different perspectives, some more reliable than others. But reliable or not, it still makes the book a lot more interesting. A third thing that made this book very fun to read was that is wasn't that difficult of a read, it was easy to understand and the writing flowed very easily. There was one tiny, unnoticeable downside to this book. Well, I wouldn't even call it a downside. At least half of the book is dialogue so it can get pretty confusing if you get distracted. This is the best book I have read in a very long time. I really enjoyed reading this book and following along with Poirot's train of thought while he was investigating. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and enjoys mystery."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"You willl never guess who did it. There is not a dull moment. The book captivates the reader as if you were actually on the train."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express was a good book. It had me thinking the whole time. The story takes place on a train. There is a world famous detective that gets on the train, and the first thing he notices is all the different nationalities of the people. Then after switching trains a few times he gets on a train that is headed for a snow storm. The train is stopped and the detective notices a few weird things goin on. The next morning he wakes up and the guy in the coach next to him has been murdered. It was not of the famous detectives best interest to investigate the murder, but since the train was stopped and his friend had convinced him, he really had no other choice. So the detective got to his usual business and started investigating the scene of the crime. Then he interviewed everyone on the train. After interviewing he came to no conlusion, untill he added bits and pieces together. He then interviewed everyone another time. Which is when he came to his conclusion. The victim, which was not a well liked man in the first place, was stabbed thirteen times. There were fifteen passengers, and it ended up that the victim was killed by thirteen of the fifteen passangers, and each of the thirteen passengers were connected to the victim in some way or another. So the end was a little surprising but it was very good."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Well Agatha Christie is a Great author But the start of this book....Bleh!....It started to speed up in the 5th Chapter.But it was unbarably hard to read.

I needed more elaboration in order to see the scene, the characters, etc. I also thought that the structure of the book was too \\"fill in the blank.\\" By this I mean that the book lacked transitions and it was as if the various parts of the book were written independently of one another and then were strung together at the end."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book was a good book.

The book was good and it kept u intrigued in each chapter mostly."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I read about 60 Agatha Christie mysteries in my teens. It took me about a year to realize that she's a mediocre writer. It seems like she owes her fame to the lower demands placed on escapism in a different era. I can't imagine that if she started her career today the results would be the same. She's not real challenging. I don't remember much about them, except that she averaged one good book for every 15 I read. The 4 that still distinguish themselves in my memory are Crooked House, Towards Zero, Roger Aykroyd and this.This generally reads like an outline. I mentally checked out after about three pages. That's how I recall her, years later; an author that \\"checks out\\" once she gave the formula a crank. The middle of this book has been described as \\"inert.\\" Each page offers slim reasons to continue on. A crime occurs followed by a long sequence of interviews. That's just not very engaging and probably causes the books main problem; It doesn't build. Only in the last three chapters does Poirot get things moving again. Her writing doesn't draw you in. It doesn't offer much to envision. Her characterization is not strong. She avoids writing in which characters aren't speaking.(Spoiler)You actually do have a better chance of guessing the solution here than in the 1974 movie (which is enjoyable for other reasons). Remember until the last few pages of the book the red herrings are all a reader has, and it's a long trip though those phoned-in middle chapters. The apparent mystery is just not interesting and it's solved with about ten seconds of thought, so why waste 23 chapters on it? It would have been a better book if she had constructed those middle chapters with more complexity.People probably don't admire this book for the writing. Ignoring the fact that these characters probably would not have been able to assemble anonymously, the book is a clever solution that deserves a better lead-upSide note: It seems like you'd have to have some very poor taste, to include the Lindbergh kidnapping (\`32) as a major plot point just two years after it occurred. Christie also took actress Gene Teirney's exposure to german measles (and subsequent retarded & blind child) at an Army canteen and used it in The Mirror Crack'd."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The book arrived within the scheduled arrival time and in good condition.

I am a great fan of hers, but I have to say this book sort of dissapointed me. I found it boring. 18 chapters in total were all just Poirot interviewing the suspects. And I didn't find the end surprising at all. To me, there wasn't any climax, and all in all it was pretty boring. I really don't see why this book is so popular. Some of my favorites are Easy to Kill, And then there were none, and N or M."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"To her credit, Agatha Christie surprised me with the solution to this locked room murder mystery, but in my defense, that's because the solution was entirely nonsensical.Without getting into any spoilers, this mystery novel has its good points. There is a certain 1930s charm to it, especially with a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" subplot about a thinly disguised Lindbergh Baby story, and an assumption that every woman on the train wears a \\"dressing gown\\" to bed, and an assumed knowledge of how servants are expected to behave in the estate of a wealthy family. There is some (unintentional?) humor as characters pat themselves on the back for how socioeconomically diverse the train's passenger list is.. before they (And Christie as narrator) proceed to show condescending contempt for the second-class passengers and Italians. And Christie's portrayal of Americans is great (for example, an American man wears a loud suit, smacks his gum, and says \\"OK\\" a lot, although at least a little of this is revealed to be an intentional misdirection on his part). I spent most of the book frustrated that some of the second-tier investigator characters weren't noticing some of the big obvious clues, but Christie surprised me when Poirot got around to explaining the meaning of the clues.**MILD SPOILER ALERT**The solution to the mystery, though, is simply nonsensical and unfair to the reader. It is clever and brings an element of artistic/moral satisfaction, but it just doesn't correspond to human behavior at all. However, I am intrigued by the almost postmodern way the solution challenges a reader's presumptions about mystery stories and presents almost an epistemological crisis (how do we know what we know? We presume that the murderer is lying, but I think we implicitly trust at least a little of what other suspects say, especially when we see confirmation, and Christie rocks us with an ending based on layer upon layer of lies and manipulation.). I can't exactly recommend this book, as the ending is too frustrating and the characters are too unbelievable along the way, but I find myself intrigued by the (I think) unintended philosophical challenges..."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder On the Orient Express was a story about a detective by the name of Hercule Poirot.

The victim was stabbed twelve times. The body was found by the attendant when the victim didn't show up for dinner in the dining car. Could it have been Mrs. Hubbard in the compartment next to him? Perhaps it was Colonel Arbuthnot who had a silent, suspicious air about him?Murder on the Orient Express leads you through an entire murder mystery, like a fly on the wall, observing everything as it unfolds. There is a brutal murder that takes place on the train while it's in transit to its destination, but who could the killer be? There are a number of killer prospects, because they were all on the train at the time the murder was committed and the killer could not have left the train since it's been stopped by snow drifts on the track, so we know the killer is still onboard.We follow Mr. Hercule Poirot, detective, throughout the whole book, as it's him who's doing all of the questioning, and solving this unbelievable case. As the book goes on each chapter has more twists than the last, and it grows more confusing until you don't know which way is up! The people who you suspect have evidence that proves them innocent, and the people who could never be the killer are suspected for the murder! And just when you can't make heads or tails of who to suspect, and who to throw out, Hercule sits back and reflects on all of the evidence, alibis, and clues, and solves the mystery in his head.This mystery keeps you guessing until literally the very last chapter.

Worth the read!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Agatha Cristie does it again, in her Hercule Poirot mystery, Murder on the Orient Express. Known as Mystery's #1 Best-selling Author Agatha Cristie writes the astonishing mystery about a detective, Hercule Poirot, on vacation when a snowstorm brings his train to a standstill a murder takes place in the cabin next to his own. Agatha Cristie has great talent when twisting plots and this is no exception.In the beginning of the book, chapters two and three, Agatha Cristie leads you on to suspicious characters before the crime even takes place. In this specific case some of the members on the train are built even before Hercule gets on the Orient Express. He encounters a man and a women on his previous train of whom he is suspicious of and even the victim and his co workers, all of which he quickly decides to keep a close eye on. A few pros and cons with this technique are as follow. The con, at some points you feel as the story will never continue, that the whole time all you will know about is this persons paranoia. The pros, firstly, you feel as though you must continue to read because something is bound to happen. Another point is you began to think you know who are the bad guys and as mentioned early Agatha Cristie knows how to twist a plot.Towards the middle of the book, chapter 63, another story is introduced. One of a crime that took place a few years back. The second story, is brought up from a piece of evidence, it is about a three year old girl who was kidnapped and turned up dead, weeks later. When it is first introduced it could tend to be a bit confusing and also a little frustrating because just when you think you know who the murderer is in a single chapter you know there's more to it then you originally thought. This does however add a bit of excitement to pick the book back up after a couple of informative yet on the boring side chapters. This gives the detective his hunch that this kidnapping case will lead him to the murder.The next section in the book is labeled the Evidence. In which Agatha Cristie introduces you to every member in the coach. She goes through and gets to you to feel sorry for some and suspicious of others. This part is great, and is why the characters being built before the crime is no longer a necessity. This part leads up to some great discoveries made by the detective and evidently the unusual and surprising outcome.Agatha Cristie is able to teach and put morals into the most unusual stories in this case she incorporates pay back, love, and the common never give up ideas. Though this is not my favorite mystery of all time I have no regrets in reading it and do plan on reading future Agatha Cristie novels."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" By Agatha ChristieThe book I read was \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\" I liked this book a lot. It is very suspensful and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. I love the way Agatha Christie writes. She makes her stories so good that you cannot put the book down until you finish it. This is one of the good books written by Agatha Christie and is enjoyed by people from all over.I liked the book and enjoyed reading it, because Agatha Christie writes books so well. When she made Hercule Poirot the main character,it made the book even better. I love the way he solves mysteries and the way he asks questions. He is so good at asking questions that he gets the person he is talking to, to answer the question correctly. He is also very good at solving mysteries and is correct in his guess in the end. I like the way M. Poirot speaks. Agatha Christie writes so well that you could hear his accent when you read the book. In the book he said some things that made it seem like you could hear him talking. Here are some quotes: \\"You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute my inquirities,\\" he said with a twinkle.This is on page 146. Poirot emergered \\"Nothing,\\" he said. \\"Not even a compromising bequest!\\" This is on page 187. \\"I like to see an angry Englishman,\\" said Poirot. \\"They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel the less command they have of language.\\" This is on page 232.The main theme of the book is: \\"If someone jumps over the bridge, would you jump too?\\" The theme is saying, just because someone committed a murder, it does not mean you have to go and kill them back. You should not go so low and be just like the criminal. Then, you too, will become the criminal. One person was going to kill Mr. Ratchett, but then he called more people and they all listened to him. They should not follow the person if they believed it was not the right decision to make. Another theme is: \\"You should not get revenge for your hate.\\" This means hate is the reason people want to get revenge. The last theme is: \\"Hate can come back and haunt you.\\" Mr. Ratchett killed someone from hate, and the hate came back and killed him. I do agree with the main theme. It is very true and people should believe in their heart and not do what other people tell them. Also, I agree with the other themes they are also true.I would recommend the book to others, because it is such a good book. I had a fun time reading it. It teaches you about life and to be a good person. People should not tell lies, like the characters in the book or they will be caught in the end. It is so mysterious and a book everyone will have fun reading. If you like mysteries, this is a good book to read. Each page is filled with clues to find out who the murderer is.

The world famous case of the \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (MotOE). It is so famous, even people who have never read Christie know who did it. I first read it 12 years ago even though someone had already revealed to me the identity of the murderer. I've never forgiven him. But I read it anyway to find out for myself how Agatha Christie constructed the story in order to fool her readers.Christie was probably inspired by the true story of the 'Lindbergh baby' kidnapping. Charles Lindbergh (he who flew across the Atlantic alone) had an infant child who was kidnapped and murdered even after the ransom had been paid.The background to MotOE is also similar to the Lindbergh case. The victim is revealed to have been involved in a kidnap-murder case a few years back and got away with it. Was he punished for his crimes at last? Was he murdered for something totally unrelated? Or was he a victim of mistaken identity?The usual suspects remind one of the typical English drawing room murder mysteries: an English colonel, a Russian princess, a count, a beautiful mysterious woman...they are all here. And Hercule Poirot has to discover who the murderer is and why, all by using his \\"little grey cells, mon ami.\\"The revelation in the final pages will surprise the reader yet it will not strain belief too much. MotOE has been accused of being incredulous and downright silly but I disagree. Those who feel that way probably forgot that they are reading a fiction novel. I am sure one will find it a lot of fun if only to find out who from among the varied cast did it. You'll be gobsmacked, I assure you :)The solution will also show the reader why MotOE is famous in its uniqueness and has never been copied (no writer dares to).Another Agatha Christie mystery that features an incredible revelation and giving an \\"I would never have guessed that\\" feeling to the reader is \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". Both the Ackroyd and the Orient Express books should be in the Murder Mysteries Hall of Fame, if there is one."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"If I had to select a single Christie novel to read again for the first time, this would be my choice; more than twenty years after my first encounter with the novel I can still recall my complete amazement. I strongly urge those who have not seen the film version to avoid it until you have experienced the sheer pleasure of being being tricked by the master trickster herself. For MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, superlatives are not enough."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"One problem with audiobooks is the dialogue. Very often an author does not supply the &quot;he said/she said&quot; before or after each quotation and the listener is often at a loss as to who is speaking. David Suchet, the ultimate Poirot, gets around this by using a different voice for each character. He had accomplished this in his reading of the complete &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for Audio Partners and he does it again with a superlative &lt;Murder on the Orient Express&gt; for that same label.This set was designed for a release to coincide with the CBS dramatization of the classic whodunit, but Audio Partners need not have bothered. That telecast was an utter disaster with a lusterless Poirot, a cast that for the most part could scarcely create a character, and an updating of the decor (among other ludicrous changes) to the present. So the older film with its starry cast can rest unchallenged; but the public is entitled to enjoy the original and this audiobook is just the ticket.Christie uses the usual &quot;closed environment&quot; setting (an island, a cruiser, a train) to give us a small number of suspects; and then she hits us with Poirot's &quot;gather everyone together while I explain the solution&quot; scene. One of the gimmicks of this novel is that Poirot comes up with two solutions! But for the sake of those very few who do not know the ending, I will say no more. And even for those who do, there is always the joy of Suchet's reading.I have the CD edition, a format that makes it difficult to find where you last left off since each full chapter is usually given a single track number. Here Audio Partners has thoughtfully broken each chapter into several tracks so you pretty much can get back to where you were with a minimum of trouble.

Monsieur Bouc, the director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, asks his friend, and fellow passenger, M. Hercule Poirot to solve the case.It had been about 25 years since last I'd read Dame Agatha but I now remember just how good she was. Her dialogue is flawless; it flows in the natural style of conversation, particularly multi-lingual conversation. I'm reminded, too, that her books were written in a time when the middle- and upper-class English had, and may still have, a rudimentary understanding of French so no translations were made in the story. Her humor is light and deft. Her characters, Poirot particularly, are fascinating representatives of certain classes of the time. Her clues are deftly placed and it such fun to watch Poirot engage his \\"little gray cells.\\" Dame Agatha is definitely deserving of the term \\"classic.\\" I'll not wait another 25 years before reading another of her books."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie novel I have ever read, but it will not be the last. The detective in this book is the Belgium Inv. Poirot. He boards a train to London, the Orient Express and during the trip one of the passengers is murdered. The passenger approached Poirot before his murder asking to retain his services, but Poirot refused. When the train is delayed due to weather, Poirot, his friend M. Bouc and a physician decide to figure out the murderer so when the police are able to get to them, they will already have it solved. It is discovered that the murdered passenger was travelling under an alias and that he was an infamous kidnapper who killed a child from a prominent American family and changed his name and took the ransom money on the run. This provides our motive and we just have to find the killer and the means of the murder. They interview each suspect one by one and inspect their luggage. They find several clues but as they dig deeper they find things are not always as they seem. There are suspects from various nationalities and economic backgrounds. Alibis, motives and movements are accounted for and then discredited leaving the reader wondering if the crime will be solved. I can say one thing, I too often can predict the ending of a book, but I was totally surprised by this one. I don't want to tell too many details because it would ruin the ending but it is an excellent story."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Fourteen passengers and Hercule Poirot on a train, stuck in a blizzard in a mountain pass on the way from Cairo to Calais. Breathes there a crime fiction fan with soul so dead that she isn't familiar with this story? Still, they call them \\"classics\\" for a reason, and Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express was one on publication in 1934. It was at that time an entirely new take on the locked room mystery, and the little gray cells of the Belgian detective with the magnificent moustaches are put seriously to the test.Must reading for any fan of the genre, and made into an iconic film in 1974 starring a host of instantly recognizable faces, including Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, and Ingrid Bergman, who won an Oscar for her performance. The best adaptation of a Christie novel and I checked: It's out on DVD."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is almost certainly the most famous Agatha Christie novel and may well be the best-known novel from the entire mystery genre. Despite the fact that I had been told the solution to the case many years ago, I decided to go ahead and finally read the book and am very glad that I did.The basic plot, for any who don't already know, involves a murder on board a train with a small, but colorful, group of passengers. It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case. The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting. My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting. The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This beautifully crafted murder mystery ranks among Agatha Christie's finest. The dapper Belgian detective finds himself investigating the murder of an American businessman on board the Simplon Orient Express. The death occurs in a a manner that implicates one of the twelve passengers in the Stamboul-Calais coach. Poirot carefully interviews the suspects, all of whom have cast-iron alibis. The case appears impossible to solve, until Poirot, using nothing but his wits and a few tiny, seemingly insignificant clues (including a monogrammed handkerchief, a pipe-cleaner, and a Hungarian passport), assembles one of his most brilliant explanations.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is not just another Agatha Christie book. The plotting is as skillful and ingenious as her best, filled with even more baffling twists and turns than usual. This novel has even more to offer, however: a delightful international cast of characters, an entertaining train setting, and gripping suspense. This is edge-of-your-seat reading from the world's foremost mystery writer."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is one of the best murder mysteries i've read. Guessing the end is really quite challenging and hats off to anyone who actually does. This is a slightly 'intellectual' thriller, meaning there is more to think about but not too much 'happening' in terms of action. Poirot prefers to trust his 'little grey cells' to solve any case!!The story : Contrary to his plans, the famous detective Hercule Poirot ends up on the Orient express along with an assortment of fellow passengers of various nationalities. One of them approaches Poirot to help save his life, but Poirot declines the offer. The man is found murdered next day, stabbed in 12 places. The blows are such as to suggest at least two different people delivered them, and other clues are bewildering to say the least.Further, since the train's stuck owing to heavy snowfall, the murderer(s?) must be on board, making the task of discovering their identity/identities all the more urgent.Now the story really starts moving, as the passengers give their 'evidence' one by one, and Poirot proceeds to analyse, understand and deduce. He unravels a web of lies and deceit and soon it is apparent that many of the passengers know more than they're letting on and there is much more to it than meets the eye.Before you know it, the story builds towards a stunning climax and the ending is truly memorable, which is what ultimately makes or breaks a thriller of this genre.All in all, an expertly crafted murder mystery which will keep you thinking all the while as you're furiously flipping pages. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"A crime has just been committed, and it is up to Agatha Christie's renowned detective, Mr. Poirot, to solve this one. This time the victim is a passenger on the Orient Express, a famouse early twentieth century passenger train. By coincidence, Mr. Poirot ia also traveling on the Orient Express, and quickly takes on the task of finding the killer. His task, however, is not an easy one, because, as he digs deeper into the case, he finds some suspicous information concerning the victim and his fellow passengers. The Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's truely excellent novels. Agatha Christie uses her innate talent for writing to develop some wonderful characters. My favorite, Mr. Poirot, has such class and intelligenge. He uses his charm to his advantage in solving the case. The reason I enjoyed this book so much is, it was written so that I could speculate on who committed the crime, however when the criminal was revealed to me I was in shock. The case seemed so complicated, yet it was really quite simple. I am very much looking forward to reading more of Agatha Christie's work."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is Agatha Christie at her finest.

It was a pleasure to reacquaint myself with Hercule Poirot, her unassuming, unlikely detective. When Poirot is called back from the middle east to London, he finds himself aboard the Orient Express with a wide cast of characters, unlikely at such a dead travel time of year. When a passenger is found murdered on the third day of the journey, Poirot sets himself to the task of figuring out who is responsible.With the train stopped by an unexpected snowstorm, Poirot is convinced that the murder, or murderers, is still on board. He begins by fortuitously uncovering the true identity of the murder victim, then proceeds to interview the passengers as to their actions the night before. With no way to check their stories, he and his fellow companions must use their reasoning to figure out the mystery at hand. Yet with each interview that precedes, more and more information is brought to light that confounds, rather than enlightens, the detective process. With several well-placed red herrings and a few 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' clues, Poirot is able to dispell the mystery surrounding the murder and present the solution, or solutions, to everyone on board.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a well-written and fast-paced novel. Agatha Christie knew how to throw in twists that at once confound the facts at hand but never distract from the story. Hercule Poirot, easily unlikeable (in the hands of a lesser writer) for his know-it-all pomposity, is perhaps Christie's best known and best liked detective with good reason. The case she has conceived for him in this novel is a mystery lover's dream."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is, closely followed by \\"ABC Murders\\", the best book I have ever read. Amazingly well written, unpredictable and genious are the right words to describe it. I didn't really like the beginning so I was quite tempted to put it off but the story gets really interesting after a few chapters. Who is the murder? Every person that is involved seems to have strong alibi and it looks like it has been made a perfect crime. A murder without mistakes. That's the way it has to look like.

I enjoyed it thoroughly because the plot was complex but the author made it easy to follow. Agatha Christie is a gifted writer and she makes you feel as if you personally know the characters. It was easy to get engrossed in this mind-boggling mystery. In some Christie's many other books she uses the same detective but entirely different plots. You solve the mystery right along side the highly revered, French detective Hercule Periot in this intriguing tale. I would recommend this book to anyone with an appetite for a juicy mystery and would also like to recommend some other books by this proficient author. Also see: Murder on the Nile, Evil Under the Sun, And Then There Were None, and the Ms. Marpole collection.

Christie uses irony in her novels, which makes her novels even more interesting, such as how she gave so many possibilities for the solution, yet the right solution is the easy, unexpected one.

But I paid for this book, and the number of typos in it was astounding. The most common error I found was in spacing -- words run together -- but I also found errors in punctuation. There was one place where the first half of a sentence was missing altogether.The publishers would not, presumably, put up with this kind of sloppy editing in a print version. What makes them think it's OK to put out an electronic version with this many errors?"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I will not discuss the book which is, in my opinion, one of Agatha's best. I would like to mention a clue that seems to be overlooked by Poirot. This message does not reveal who the murderer is, but you should not read it unless you already read Orient Express, because it might spoil you the fun.The clue is about compartments in the railroad car. As you know, the murderer(s) wanted to book up all the compartments in the Istanbul - Calais car, but the compartment number 1 has been booked months before, by the company's director, Mr. Buck (Poirot ended in that compartment later). Now that implicates that the compartments were allocated sequentially. Mr. Rechet got the compartment number 2, his valet Mr. Masterman got the bed number 4 (the first available bed in the second class) while his secretary Mr. McQueen got the bed number 6 in the next second class compartment. All that implicates some kind of the plot, since the car was obviously empty (except for Mr. Buck) before Rechet and his escort booked their tickets, and then all the sudden the whole bunch came.Let us proceed. In his statement Mr. McQueen states that the valet always traveled second class, but he (McQueen) usually traveled first class, so that his employer, Mr. Rechet could use McQueen's compartment to store his own luggage. But on this occasion all the first class compartments were booked, so McQueen had to travel second class. Now that is a highly suspicious statement - Rechet got number 2, and McQueen and Masterman got the first two class 2 compartments. It seems like first class compartments 3 (etc.) and the complete second class was empty when Mr. Rechet's ticket was bought and that McQueen did not want to be in the compartment number 3, next to Rechet's, for some reasons of his own. He also did not want to share the compartment with Masterman, since they could probably have booked beds number 4 and 5. All that strongly points to some kind of the conspiracy engineered by McQueen who, as a secretary, was in charge of booking tickets."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Though I had heard of Agatha Christie and her classic Murder on the Orient Express, I didn't know much about it. However, being a fan of the Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series, I was quite excited to read another classic mystery novel. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the book my disappointment started to set in.The problem with this book is that there is absolutely nothing driving the plot forward. Even with the old \\"the murderer is still aboard the train\\" plot-line, Christie manages to make this story as boring as possible. We know, for example, that there is no present danger to any of the current passengers because we learn early on that the murder was for the sake of a very specific revenge. We also learn early on that the murdered man was a despicable and infamous character, so none of the passengers were very distraught over his death (in fact, many of them seemed happy about it). Even the detective, Christie's famous Hercule Poirot, seemed like he was only interested in the case because he had nothing better to do at the time.To add to this, Christie's writing is tedious. The structure of the novel consists of interview after interview (and even several re-interviews) of every passenger on the coach. There are interesting red-herrings, but they obscure the plot too much and they all seem to only be revealed at the very end (rather than slowly throughout the course of the novel). I didn't enjoy this book, and, frankly, it makes me want to avoid Agatha Christie's books altogether."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I feal a bit bad giving such a low rating for one of Christies mysteries,but I found this book to be slow moving and draggy in the middle and towards the end. This is worth the read, but you may get a bit bored!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book was OK. It kept my attention and was really easy to read, but I wasn't blown away. It's probably a good read for a first Agatha Christie experience, but it definitely didn't make me want to read more of her books. I would recommend it to someone who wants to read something quickly and not have to think too much. I liked the character development and the final scene."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book was ok, the begining was really boaring then it got really interesting. The evedance is really fun to read. But, i didn't like the end. It sounded like Christie just gave up and desided to stop writing the book. It was a fun read and i do recomend it to other young readers."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is one of the best books I have ever read. It really keeps you hooked until the end. I'll tell you one thing- the ending is suprising. This book is the first Agatha Christie book I've ever read, but now I think I'm going to read a lot more of them."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Great plot and story, a very unsuspected ending to me at least. I just love how Agatha Christie describes all the details of the characters and how you can picture it in your mind so well. Also I just like Poirot's approach to the case. The Miss. Marple mysteries are ok but Hercule Poirot books always seem better."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"What a find! I am a Christie fan, a NEW one and this mystery is among my favorites. It is true, the movie and story are famous, so the ending is not a surprise. Still, it led me to buy a few of the smallish paperback novels and they are much better than the made-for-television movies. The characters come alive much more in print, and the humor much sharper.After reading this, do read _The Murder of Roger Acroyd_ and after all the others, _Curtain_. The endings to both are not easy to guess, but the last will send you into mourning, just like countless others, I'll bet, when that book came out years before us."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a foundation upon which Agatha Christie's reputation rests. It is the famous story of the murder on the train loaded full of suspects. It has been made into several films, and I have enjoyed reding this book several times."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I haven't read a mystery of this ilk in a long time and it was a breath of fresh air. Agatha Christie wrote this book in 1934 and it's a beaut! It stars her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. It seems to me many books and movies like 'After The Thin Man' have stolen Agatha's idea of gathering all the suspects for one final interrogation to solve the case. Can anybody do it better than Agatha, who has out-sold every published work except the Bible and Shakespeare? Maybe the only character that can challenge Hercule Poirot is Agatha's other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. Since this book was written so long ago, it gives the reader the flavor of the times, such as the European attitude towards America, the style of clothing, and the reminiscence of long train trips.The story starts with our hero boarding the Orient Express in Aleppo, Syria, after a successful investigation for the French Army. He meets one of the directors of the company that runs the Orient train, M.Bouc. Hercule Poirot joins the other thirteen passengers, M. Bouc, a Dr. Constantine, and one conductor in the Athens-Paris Coach. And folks we are off to the races!! One of the passengers, a Mr. Ratchett, who is of vile and dubious character turns up dead on the first night of the trip. He's been stabbed twelve times in his bunk. To make matters worse, the train is now at a standstill, snowed-in by a blizzard. That means the killer is stranded on the train and posses a threat to the remaining twelve passengers on the Athens-Paris car. As you probably guessed, the director of the train, M. Bouc, engages our lovable and pyknic detective, Hercule Poirot. Let the Lumosity exercises begin! The rest of the novel is a cat-and-mouse game between the twelve passengers and Hercule. I tried to figure out who the killer was and I didn't even come close!It's amazing to me how Agatha Christie can make the reader visualize all seventeen people on the train in only 265 pages. I liked the way Agatha has Hercule use the director ( M. Bouc ), and the doctor ( Constantine ) as a sounding board to test his theories. He actually makes them think that they are helping him solve the mystery. This is a very sound novel and completely enjoyable. I am totally drawn- in to this series and hope to read 'Death on The Nile' in the very near future. Do yourself a favor and read A Hercule Poirot novel right now, especially this one."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"So I have rated this title 5 stars for the story, however I feel that the Kindle edition deserves four stars for these (relatively minor) reasons:1) There were randomly missing spaces between some words (5-6 times or so in the whole book). This never impeded understanding, but I did find it a minor distraction/annoyance. I have no idea if this is also true of the print copy of the book or not.2) I wish this edition had footnotes with French translations for those of us who are a little rusty in the subject. The usage of French throughout the book is minimal, and really you can probably get the general gist from the context in most cases, but as I like to know exactly what is being said I was still pulling out my phone to use Google translate as I read."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is the perfect place to start if you intend to read murder mystery books with any regularity. The story has been done in plays and movies and on TV for decades but it is only in reading it that you catch the early clues and nuances of the characters. Your knowledge is broadened to the allure of foreign languages and refined mannerisms of different nationalities.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is an easy read. The foreign expressions are brief and easily researched if one wishes to translate them. The descriptions of clothing, appearance, and behavior are easily visualized and not a hindrance to the flow and enjoyment of the narrative. Certainly I would recommend this book to eighth grade readers and up. Murder is a serious crime and in reading this story young readers become acquainted with the deductive and methodical system of reasoning. Education is advanced when \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is required reading in class."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a true classic of a murder mystery. Ms. Christie chose Hercule Poirot to try to solve this puzzling mystery.Someone has been killed. The someone is not so nice. The murder took place on The Orient Express, a famous European train. The train is, at the moment, stranded in a snow drift. The cast of suspects is varied and unusual. The solution to the mystery is pure Agatha Christie.I have, also, seen two or three different video versions of this mystery. The book seems to have some advantages over the video versions. Still, it is obvious that this mystery weaves a spell over its fans.This may be one of the best murder mysteries of all time, but I have never been thrilled with it. Things get too confusing in parts. Also, Hercule's accent and unusual character sometimes adds to the confusion. Finally, it does take effort to follow how the murder must have happened. I wish it were possible to make this story flow a bit better.Read the book and watch any of the video versions. I do like Hercule's fi9nal resolution. And, that says something about us humans."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"In her autobiography, Dame Agatha wrote that when she journeyed on the orient express, nothing more exciting happened than that she had to kill a few bed bugs. The journey, however, provided ideas for one of her most ingenious and tightly-plotted books.So brilliant is the construction that she manages to have Poirot concoct two possible explanations of what happened and who did it - each involving a dozen suspects. Expect to find Poirot present on almost every page, a wide range of characters who \\"talk up\\" well in the requisite interviews, some humour, and a resolution that bypasses the need for justice to be done.Only one film adaptation of this book has been attempted so far. It premiered during Dame Agatha's final year and she pronounced herself well-satisfied with it. More satisfying to me has been listening to David Suchet's reading of the book. Adopting and switching between perhaps twenty different accents, male and female, while reserving a clearly recognizable narrative voice, he easily feeds my imagination with travellers, a train, and a tale.In the 1930s, writers of detective fiction still retained the earlier convention of including, towards the end, a survey of who might have committed the crime, considering motive, opportunity, alibi, etc. This happens here. I registered a falling off of interest while this occurred; otherwise I was a willing and vastly entertained captive."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"After watching the different movie versions (repeatedly) of Murder On The Orient Express over the years, I finally got around to reading the book.

From the very beginning of the book I was hooked. The murder happens early in the story making it a \\"page turner\\" from the start.

To do so, Poirot has to question every member aboard the Orient Express letting you get to know the characters. The ending of the book is wonderful, with a surprise no one would have guessed from the beginning. Agatha Christie does a great job of laying down the identities of the characters and letting the reader choose whether that identity is real or fake."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"My first Agatha Christie book, and it was AWESOME.

Mr. Poirot, a Belgium detective who was in charge of the inspection, tries to investigate and interview with all passengers, trying to discover decisive clues from the passengers, but the accurate evidence never shows up anywhere and all reasonable possibilities of a murderer are gone. The murderer gets far away from the solution as time passes. After all, he found that all of them are related to the specific person. Who would know that all passengers were murderer and connected with the Armstrong's family whose young kid were kidnapped and killed? They conspired to kill Ratchet who kidnapped the little young girl. They take the same train and killed him. I was surprised to get to know all truth at the end of the book.

When I was an eighth grade, we had to do a book report on a mystery from the school library. I ended up grabbing this book at the last minute just because I needed one. I've never regretted it. This book has introduced me to Agatha Christie and this is her at her best.You have a wide assortment of nationalities all stuck on a train, on which a murder has just occured. Hercule Poirot happens to be on the train and takes up the case. His only clues are a match, a burned note, a handkercheif, a pipe cleaner, & a broken watch. Poirot manages to solve the case with just those four clues and information from interviews with the passengers.I'm typically pretty good at solving mysteries half way through the book. Here, I was stumped. One page made me certain it was a American and the next it was an Italian. And then there's the HUGE twist at the end. I didn't see it coming and you probably won't see it coming. Unlike many mysteries, this twist actually made sense and was the perfect solution to an apparently perfect crime!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I had a really fascinating traveling experience by reading this Agatta Christie's novel. She just converts the reading process into a thinking one by using a singular mixing of characters from different countries and social status; a Russian Princes, an American young man which works as a secretary, a French count, a British valet, etc. A murder was committed at the Calacia car of the Orient Express during its travel from Istanbul through Paris. All the 13 passengers have alibis. Only a pipe cleaner, a scarlet kimono, a monogrammed handkerchief and a watch pointing to 1:15 a.m. are the physical evidences. You will be able to follow step by step the inquiries of the famous detective Poirot, who by interviewing all the passengers discovers a strange relation between the victim, the Armstrongs which are a wealthy American family, and the murderer. By the end of the novel, you'll discover that all your assumptions were far away from the most unexpected answer."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Review of Murder on the Orient ExpressThe book has for a protagonist a detective called Hercule Poirot, a famous little Hungarian detective with a funny mustache, who is always complaining about the people. During his stay at the Stambul Hotel he is called to go to London to solve a case. The problem is that when he is inside the train that is going to transport him to his destination, a murder is committed, and he has to solve the mystery before the police arrive to the train that it's stuck in a snowdrift. He is sure that the murder is inside the train, for all the clues that are in the site of the murder. He begins to interview with the passengers and maybe one of them is the real murder. All the passengers give him different opinions about the murder, and their relationship with the Armstrong Family. A lot of mystery and clues would help him to solve this strange murder of a famous gangster (Ratchett) and finally find the culpable. During the whole book the question is who did it? And all the clues are going to show the answer for that question. I liked the book, for all the funny way of Poirot's interviews and how he interacts with the people also I liked how the line owner and the doctor during all the interviews thought that the interview was the murder."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"You are going to love this book it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

As he talks to the passengers he goes back to a kidnapping case that happend yeas ago. Will he find out who caused this death or will the criminal leave without being caught."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This was definatly one of Christie's best mysterys. She made it so everything was intertwined with one event and made it so you were always guessing. It just starts a little slow, but that's all that was wrong. It has something that makes you keep reading from the very begining and not put it down. I definatly like Christie's way of doing mysteries and wish she was still at it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"When a murder is committed aboard the Orient Express, it is up to Hercule Poirot to find the culprit. Mr Poirot certainly has his work cut out for him. There are twelve suspects, but none seem to have a strong motive and most have an alibi. There is a major clue pointing to the identity of the murder in the beginning of the book. After finishing the novel I found myself laughing that I could have overlooked something so obvious. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining read. So many clues, so many suspects, yet Mr Poirot and the two men who assist him with the mystery, the doctor who examined the body and the director of train, come up with nothing but dead end theories until the end of the book. Truly genius!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Ms. Christie had a clean, crisp writing style that suits this genre very well. There are no flowery prose to be found in-between the covers of this mystery. It has been over 30 years since I read 'Murder on the Orient Express' while in high school and I still clearly remember the unusual outcome. But despite knowing the surprise ending, revisiting this classic and observing Ms. Christie's remarkable ability to place clues and red-herrings throughout made me appreciate her talents even more. As usual, another great, entertaining read by a master of the whodunit."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Not my normal type of book. But I was at my aunts and she did not have many books to choose from. Once I started I could not put it down. The story was good, a detective book. With clues from earlier chapters you can try and solve the crime your self."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I read this book on a long train ride and I enjoyed it. I find it very odd that this was the first book I ever figured out the ending to though. (the other odd part is that the second book I figured out was Murder of Rodger Ackroyd but the rest of the books I couldn't figure out) So my point is, I don't know if it's easy to figure out or if I just had a lucky guess, but either way it's worth the read. The setting and characters were interesting and for a lot of the book I was sitting there reading reasons that changed my suspects and then changed them back. This is defiantly one of better Christies books. Not my favorite but still very good. It really zips along."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Oriental Express is a fantastic book. It starts out with world famous Hercule Piorot becoming supicious of a young lady who said she was a governess. Piorot tried to book a train, but it was almost entirely filled when at least he got a bunk. Shortly, the train gets stuck on a snowdrift and cannot move for a day or too. However, something of greater worry is that someone has been murdered, and is still on the train.This wonderful mystery makes you look at every possible clue, every hint, every detail, and there is still no answer. Hercule struggles too, the suspect could be anyone on the train, but then he realizes, maybe the answer is right under his nose."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is arguably Agatha Christie's best known novel, which is a status it more or less deserves. The book features Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in one of his earliest appearances (his eighth novel). The plot is a clever one -- a murder takes place on a luxury train and one of the 12 passengers must have committed it. Poirot is travelling on the train, and he is drawn into the mystery by one of the executives of the train company who knows Poirot and also happened to be on the train. A few of the passengers seem like obvious suspects, but Poirot takes his time and does not draw any rash conclusions.Many of the plot devices in \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" have been borrowed from Christie by later, lesser authors, so the novel may not seem as fresh as it once was. I'm a relative newbie to Christie's writing but enjoyed this book quite a bit, particularly the colorful and interesting characters. I marked it down one star because some of the plot twists are not very believable and the novel relies on a few coincidences. However, even with these issues, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a very good to excellent mystery novel that is sure to please fans of the genre.I read the rerelease version by Black Dog & Leventhal. They have done a nice job with this hardback series, including an attractive dust cover and quality paper. However, I'm not sure that the novel is worth the extra price you'd pay for a typical soft cover version."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is almost certainly the most famous Agatha Christie novel and may well be the best-known novel from the entire mystery genre. Despite the fact that I had been told the solution to the case many years ago, I decided to go ahead and finally read the book and am very glad that I did.The basic plot, for any who don't already know, involves a murder on board a train with a small, but colorful, group of passengers. It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case. The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting. My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting. The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is one of Poirot's best mysteries. On this train, everyone is a suspect and there are few clues.This book dosen't have any boring parts. It's allways fast-paced and intriguing all the way."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Possibly one of the most famous (possibly due to the fine movie of the same title) in the Hercule Poirot series, this classic little mystery has survived since its first publication in 1933 -- maybe that says it all! The plot is fairly familiar -- during the night on a several day train trip across lower Europe, Poirot's seemingly unpopular sleeping car neighbor is murdered. Rather than little or no clues or suspects, almost everybody aboard the train is a suspect; plenty of clues float around besides. Since the train is totally stalled due to a heavy snow, no resources other than sheer brainpower are available to our intellectual Belgian sleuth. Poirot gets by without his familiar sidekick, Capt. Hastings, but \\"adopts\\" a railroad executive and the traveling doctor as foils upon which to foist his evolving theories. After Poirot very cleverly determines that the victim is a hated child kidnapper/killer from America, the plot thickens as the interrogations proceed -- first one and then another and then another of the passengers seem to be related somehow to that long ago famous case. Could it be a conspiracy? You'll be turning the 200 pages rapidly to find out!As usual, Christie's \\"economy\\" of words dwells on little but the straightforward story telling, but we're soon cast under her spell. Like most of her stories, there are more than ample pointers for we readers to take a decent stab at the solution ourselves, but we suspect it will be a rare person who beats Poirot to the task! The book concludes with an unexpected conspiracy of another sort -- will a murderer be tried and convicted or will justice prevail through some other method? Try this entertaining story for a wonderful, perplexing, and charming whodunit !!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I read murder on the orient express for an english assignment.

Poirot is determined to find out the truth about who killed this man no matter what it takes. With many unexpected twists and turns, this is an excellent novel and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. So who did kill Mr Ratchett?... You'll just have to read it to find out!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Classic Agatha Christie -- nearly to the point of being campy, but remaining entirely charming. I love the way her writing moves through stages that seem to pull in even the most experienced mystery/detective readers, presenting each possible conclusion as perfectly acceptable before revealing the next twist. In the isolated setting of a snowed in railway, she does a great job of pulling you first to one conclusion and then the next, all of which ultimately pale in comparison to the big reveal-scene. And of course, her characters -- as always -- are wonderfully illustrated and never fall too-neatly into the generic roles of their genre. Christie's writing never dates itself as far as technique is concerned, and I don't think her contributions to detective fiction are ever likely to lose their charm."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Agatha Christie is of course a wonderful writer.

After solving some case in Syria, Poirot hopes to unwind in Turkey for a few days, but receives a telegram urging him to come to London immediately. With some difficulty, he secures a berth on the train, finding himself surrounded by a lively cast of characters from Europe and the United States. Not long after departure, one of them is found dead, and Poirot is tasked with determining who of his fellow passengers is the culprit.Agata Christie did not become one of the world's bestselling authors by writing particularly deep characters or original narrative. Poirot's international companions on the train are ethnic caricatures, with the Italian initially fingered as the murder because of that nation's supposed blind passion, and Americans portrayed as uncouth and rustic. The solution is in many respects a deus ex machina. Nonetheless, the novel is an entertaining enough read if one wants some light to pass a couple of hours. Christie's depiction of her protagonist, ambiguous in his sexuality and lacking fashion sense, is always amusing. The investigative methods used will also provide a chuckle in how they violate the rights of suspects and ignore local laws."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on The Orient ExpressAuthor: Agatha ChristieGenre: MysteryPages: 245Murder on The Orient Express talks about a detective named Monsieur Poirot, who tries to unpuzzle the mystery of the death of Mr. Ratchett.

The detective had only three clues to work with. He then began to find many of the passangers on board knew more than they told. The killer is quite ironic and very hard to guess.

If you are not sure which Agatha Christie to start off with, choose this book! Hercule Poirot is a mastermind at work, and beware, Agatha picks the person who least expect.

Read some of her other books too, they're just great!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"A train ride, a murder, 12 suspects, and one decision. Hercule Poirot must investigate the crime and solve the mystery. Monsieur Ratchett was found dead in his compartment with the window left open. But that wasn't how the murderer got out because it was snowing and there would have been footprints. Ratchett was stabbed 12 times so it obviously wasn't a suicide. Mrs. Hubbard claims that there was a man in her compartment that night. Turns out that when M. Poirot came up with a solution to the murder, he was correct. All 12 people on the train had stabbed M. Ratchett one time each. It's a wonder how everyone on the train at that exact time knew who Monsieur Ratchett was and why would they all want him dead so bad? Well, Ratchett wasn't his real name. That was an alias, his real name was Cassetti. He was on the run for kidnapping and murdering a little girl named Daisy Armstrong. Everyone on the train had set everything up so they all would be there to all stab him once each. Everyone had some sort of connection to the Armstrong family. I really enjoyed this book a lot because it's very suspenseful and you never know what's going to happen next.This is a very interesting book. I like it a lot because it's very suspenseful. Every time M. Poirot thought that he had something figured out, something else would pop up. Like when M. Poirot thought that a woman most likely killed M. Ratchett, the Italian man said that the killer was a short man with dark hair and a womanish voice, a description that didn't fit anyone on the train. Then when M. Poirot thought he had figured out that there were only 2 killers, he found out he was wrong. M. Poirot also automatically decided that Mrs. Hubbard could not have been one of the killers because the weapon was found in her bag and if she did kill Ratchett, she wouldn't have hid the weapon in her own bag. And also because she stated that the murderer had escaped through her compartment. But M. Poirot found himself wrong again.This book by Agatha Christie is also one of my favorite books because you never know who to suspect as the killer. First you suspect Mr. MacQueen because he seems suspicious and he's Ratchett's secretary and he seems to know Ratchett the most. Then you suspect the Italian man because Ratchett is Italian and he seems to know Ratchett a lot too. Then you suspect Countess Andrenyi because her husband made her book suspicious. And lastly you suspect the Wagon Lit Conductor because there was a missing button found in Ratchett's compartment and on the conductor's suit, there was a missing button. I like this book a lot. I like how everyone is guilty and how you can't tell who the murderer is.I also really like The Murder on the Orient Express because it is very creative and unique. I absolutely love the way Christie set this murder up. Everyone on the train was related to the Armstrong family somehow. Whether it was a maid, cook, friend, butler, etc. Everyone's story fir together perfectly and it was well planned out. Countess Andrenyi changed her name (and smudged her passport to make it unreadable) from Helena to Elena because her handkerchief was found in M. Ratchett's compartment and she didn't want them to know that her real first name started with the letter \\"H\\" because on the handkerchief her initial was sewed onto it. Everyone on the train denied smoking a pipe except for Mr. Hardman because there was a pipe cleaner found in M. Ratchett's compartment also. And Mr. Hardman's pipe cleaners didn't match up with the one found. They hid the weapon in Mr. Hubbard's bag because they knew that she was less likely to be suspected. And the dragon kimono robe was placed on top of M. Poirot's bags so he wouldn't find out who owned the kimono robe. All the timings were precise for when interviewing with M. Poirot. Someone even set M. Ratchett's watch onto a certain time (1:15) so they would confuse M. Poirot which didn't work. This book was one of the greatest mysteries ever. I love this book.Overall this book was definitely one of my top 3. It's just a fantastic book. Agatha Christie is a wonderful author who knows what she's doing. This book was well planned out and very organized. Everything fit and everything was perfected. This is a wonderful book and you should read it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha ChristieAgatha Christie has become an antique. She may once upon a time have broken ground for her genre. She certainly became its poster child, selling unbelievable numbers of book and becoming the go-to comparison for any female mystery writer who aspired to greatness - Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham, P.D. James.A catchy tune or two and some good PR can go a long way - think of the Monkees, and all the boy bands that have proliferated since. But four BILLION copies in circulation, and claiming the third rank behind Shakespeare and the Bible as most widely published? Those are truly awesome numbers.I decided to read Murder on the Orient Express (or MotOE) because we recently got a boxful of Christie books at an auction. I enjoyed them when I was younger, and first started reading mysteries. They were often stuffy and slightly dumb, but it was a stereotypical stuffiness that defined \\"British\\". Part of the magic of Christie is that she introduced into that perfectly conventional scene the convention defying. I refer to the slightly subversive quality of the characters she made famous: Miss Marple, the wise old everywoman who never misses a trick while hiding in plain sight, and Hercule Poirot, the fussy little foreigner who was amusing until he had your nuts to the fire.The problem I find after reading MotOE is that I enjoy watching the BBC version of Poirot's adventures more than I enjoyed reading the book. The reason is simple - it only takes an hour to watch, which is about right for these stories. What you lose in the translation is a lot of red herring dangling, and a load of outdated British-isms.I have been thinking about how to reduce the number of books on our shelves to make room for, well, more books, and since I finished MotOE I have been eyeing those Christie's, which are occupying a long stretch of bookshelf real estate. All of which brings me back to Dame Agatha being an antique. One of the things that make antiques worth keeping is their value, and that is often dependant in turn on their scarcity. This is where Christie's publishing history starts to work against her - with 4 billion in print, it's going to be a long time before they are worth anything at all. Now that I think of it, the DVD's of the BBC versions are thinner than the books, and they have three episodes each. Hmm ...."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is one of Christie's finest books. With a great plot, it's one you can't put down. If you pay very close attention, you will probably figure it out.Also Recommended: And Then There Were None"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"After my daughter read it for a report, I wrestled the book away from my wife to read it again for myself. Fortunately, I'd forgotten the plot in the two or three decades since last reading it.It did not disappoint me. The plot is ingenious and the characters come alive. It falls a little short of five stars because of the inclusion of some objectionable stereotypes of women, Italians, and various other nationalities including the cold-fish British. Also, Agatha Christie generally includes misleading details in an unfairly dense profusion for those of us trying to guess the truth in the plot, although that was consistent with the plot in this case.A story that should be read by anyone remotely interested in murder mysteries."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The plot is intricate, fascinating and suspense filled. You will find yourself turning page after page to discover what could possible happen next. The plot moves fast and the conversations are full of clues. Pay close attention. Enjoy.If you are new to the mystery genre or if you have never read this book, even if you have seen the movie -- you must read this book. It is a true masterpiece of mystery writing."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"To begin with, do NOT buy this book from Amazon. The mass market paperback is priced in the bookstore at $5.99, but on Amazon it is $6.99 plus shipping. Just go to the bookstore and pick it up.This is one of the most interesting murder mysteries I have ever read. Every little element, every little slip of the tongue by each of the suspects, every piece of evidence - real or faked - will keep you guessing right up until the end. I just kept reading and reading late into the night because the evidence and suspects were so confusing. I changed my mind about who was the true murderer at least four times. I won't reveal the actual plot, but it will surprise you right up to the last page.This is actually the first Agatha Christie mystery that I have read (surprisingly) and I'm glad that I picked it up. Although there were times that I considered everything about Hercule Poirot to be almost cheesy, in the end his methods were justified, and I really enjoyed the story. I will definitely pick up a few more Poirot mysteries in the coming future."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a \\"motley crue\\" - Poirot employs \\"the little gray cells\\" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.There is nothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is the greatest mystery book I ever read. It has a magical ends, it seems unbelievable, but actually followed tips really well."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I've been thinking quite a bit recently about MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, the first adult mystery I read--too many years ago. I thought then, and I still think today, that MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the perfect classic mystery. Christie created a murder in a stranded railroad car--a murder her sleuth Hercule Poirot must solve. She has a classic collection of suspects, and a crime supposedly impossible to commit. Poirot, of course, solves the crime, and I still admire this book decades after I first read it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"When Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express he is surpised by the loud diversity of people on the train. From a Russian Princess to an English governess the train is filled with different classes, and nationalities. THe last thing he expects is a murder to take place. But when it dose, only he can find the killer. As Poirot shifts through the clues and interviews every member on the train he finds out the case is connected to a kidnapping mystery that took place in America year ago. Thus complicating things ever futhur. Can he solve the case? Or will the killer slip between his fingers.When I saw the book assigned to me on my summer Junior year British Literature reading list I was happy to actually get to read a decent book. And when I read it I was swept up in the mystery of things, trying to find the real killer myself. Poirot is an interesting and clever charecter. This was my first Agatha Christie book but it won't be my last. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is probably Agatha Christie's best-known book (largely because it is the only one that made a really good movie). It is an exceptionally atmospheric book; there is something haunting about a train caught in a snowdrift miles from nowhere. The solution, oddly enough, is not really much of a surprise; Poirot's investigation proceeds in such a way that you do see the solution coming before it is revealed. But I think this was intentional on Christie's part (her plotting is so beautifully precise that it is hard to think she would make such a slip). Also, the lack of surprise at the end is more than made up for by the exceptional (even for Christie) attention to detail shown here; this is certainly a triumph for Poirot as well as Christie."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book that I have ever read and believe me, it really made me wanna read much more. The beginning started off a little slow, but as soon as I got to the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. The basic plot is that a murder has occurred on a train filled with strangers. It feels terrible to know that you will be stuck on a train for at least 2 days(this is because of a snow storm) on the same train as a murderer. The victim is an American kidnapper, so detective Hercule Poirot tries his best to question all the passengers, trying to find someone who is involved with the kidnapping case. The end is very unexpected, but I wasn't too happy with it. Overall, I suggest that anyone who loves mysteries and suspense read it soon!!!!!!!-Reviewed by Preethi"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I first read this book a half-century ago, and, in my youth, I was very impressed by it. I've just read it again, having forgotten most of the details of the plot, and did not find it nearly as good as I had remembered.The novel did not seem to be &quot;fleshed out.&quot; The denouement was a bit too bizarre. Poirot is just a trifle too facile in his logic. The characters seem leftover from a dozen other works.The British train was, for some reason, the perfect setting for a murder mystery and was employed many times for that purpose. The Orient Express does provide an excellent backdrop for this study in murder, not entirely separate from the Lindbergh case that was the &quot;crime of the century&quot; when this was published. The method of laying out the plot is quite good, if a little too thin. Most books tend to be overwritten--&quot;too many words.&quot; This one needed more, somehow. As I turned the last page I found that I just was not convinced that this could have happened. And being convincing is the key to the literary success of any work of fiction."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is the benchmark for all crime and suspense novels. An instant classic by the Grand Dame herself, it sucks you into an intricate web that you fail to entangle. A train moving through the orient, a list of passengers representative of many segments of the population, the extremely modest Hercule Poirot. What more could you want? Watch for the stunning climax that will leave you in awe of Agatha's unique gift. Her greatest talent i think, it the way she satirises her readers through the &quot;pathetic&quot; Poirot"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is probably one of Agatha Christie's best known mysteries, thanks largely to the excellent movie based closely on the book, but it's also one of her best mysteries on its own. Here is Hercule Poirot, the rotund Belgian detective, whom we meet in the restaurant car \\"trying to keep his mustaches out of the soup\\" as the Orient Express is about to begin its run across Central Europe. Also on board are an English governess, a British colonel, an American pseudo-philanthropist and his multilingual secretary, a Russian grande dame, a Hungarian count, a garrulous American matron of certain age, and others representing various countries and nationalities. During the night, one of the passengers is found murdered in his bed, and we learn the next morning that the victim was a vicious child kidnapper and murderer who richly deserved what he got. But who gave it to him is the mystery to be solved. It's the typical English parlor mystery transplanted to the exotic setting of the Orient Express, and it's a brilliant switch. Enter Poirot, sifting through the facts, half-facts and outright inventions, until the mystery is unraveled and we find out not only whodunit, but also who Poirot's fellow passengers really are. It's one of Christie's most satisfying novels, perfectly crafted, concisely written, and totally on target from first to last."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"As I said elsewhere I am not a Hercule Poirot fan. I bought it because this was made into a movie. But unlike my experience with Death on the Nile. I could not get into this book. I saw the movie but I could not hear them or see them as I read. It was different."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book was definitely not my most favorite book but it was alright. It was very slow in certain parts of it but at other parts it really sped up & I was very interested. I also thought it was too organized & it made me think very hard but over all I really did like the book."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I'm combining this review of the book and movie together because the stories are so closely related, and I think that anyone who likes the movie will be interested to know about the book, and readers who have enjoyed the book may like to get some details about the movie. The 1974 movie is a true classic, and along with many others I look forward to the time when it will be digitally restored and issued on blu-ray disk.I love the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express movie and have watched it several times over the years on TV and DVD. I've only recently read the book for the first time on Kindle, and was frankly quite amazed to see how faithful the movie was to Christie's novel of the same title written in 1934. Since most of the story takes place on a train, it was relatively easy for producers to keep the movie closely aligned to the book even in many small details, and I'm grateful that they did. After reading the book and seeing how Christie portrayed Poirot as being a more quiet and low key personality, I can appreciate that some criticize the selection and performance of Albert Finney as Poirot because he is often quite emotional and demonstrative, as well as physically different than the Poirot Christie described. This is the only major difference between the 1974 movie and the book, though it can be a crucial difference for Christie fans. I have not seen the later version starring David Souchet as Poirot, but from the reviews on Amazon it seems that at least some changes were made to the story so it apparently does not adhere as closely to the book. I won't comment further on this since I haven't seen it.Christie's story is loosely based on the actual kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's 20-month-old son in 1932. A $50,000 ransom was paid but the baby was murdered and his body was found two months later. A household servant who was suspected by the police of playing a part in the kidnapping did commit suicide.In Christie's story, Hercule Poirot is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. The train is halted at night because of heavy snow and a passenger is found murdered in his bed the following morning. A doctor happens to be on board and tells Poirot that there are twelve stab wounds in the body. Everyone in the coach is a suspect, but what was the motive? Poirot must wade through the maze of contradictory clues and apparent impossibilities, some of which make him recall a child kidnapping/murder that happened a few years previously.The 1974 movie was stylishly done with great performances by an all star cast, and the music is also wonderful.

It can be frustrating when everything is so obvious to Hercule Poirot as the reader is disadvantaged by being in the world of non-fiction. The disadvantage makes the book no less entertaining.Clearly borrowed from the story of the Lindbergh baby, the plot of this novel sees the kidnapper get what he has coming. On the run after murdering a child that he kidnapped, Ratchett is aware that his days are numbered. On the Orient Express, he continues his attempt to flee, even seeking the assistance of Hercule Poirot. When the train becomes stalled in a snow embankment, Ratchett is murdered. While there exists no clear line to the killer, many seem to have some loose connection to the family of the deceased child. Noting the fine details, Poirot makes a stunning revelation in the end. And while the ending may be known to contemporary audiences, watching the plot unravel makes it more remarkable.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is one the better known works of Christie because she is at her best. Veterans of Christie novels may see the ending coming more easily, but will certainly find reading enjoyable."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This classic mystery combining Agatha Christie's knowledge of the early Twentieth Century Middle East, with one of her most intricate plots,keeps you turning the pages and enjoying every word.

Christie has used estates of the wealthy, as in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, but she also set many of her stories at resorts, on islands, on boats, and on trains where one of her detectives happens to find him or herself.The Murder on the Orient Express is a brilliant counterpoint to her, island based, And Then There were None. Christie further isolates the famous train through use of a track-blocking snow storm which allow Hercule Poirot to exercise his resolvent powers.This novel transfered very well to the screen, but the book can be read with enjoyment even by those of us who have viewed the film also.Of Christie's eighty-some detective stories, this one rates with her best.I have no hesitation giving it 5 stars. I love it and will read in again."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"The Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a perfect mystery novel by Agatha Christie where Hercule Poirot is the detective.

When the train is approaching Yugoslavia a murder occurs and near that time the train has to stop because snow blocks the way. The train staff leader Monsieur Bouc wants Poirot to solve the crime before the train reaches Yugoslavia.This novel is one I would definitely recommend as a detective novel. It is very European in feel. Agatha Christie writes comfortably with both male and female characters and I wouldn't have known her gender by her writing because her portrayal of men is dead-on correct in the manner in which men act.

Christie separates the later chapters into individual interrogations with each suspect, which makes the book seem like less of a novel and more of an evidence log, bringing to mind shows like Law and Order. However, I liked this method; it made me feel like she was presenting me with the facts so that I could deduce what happened.The dialogue was a bit stiff, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the story is set in the early 1900s, when people were typically more articulate.

It's a seemingly endless recitation of interviewing everyone on the train, then searching everyone's luggage, then interviewing everyone again and again. It was very tedious to sit through multiple interviews with every single person of interests on the train.Part of what I, and most people, enjoy about a mystery is trying to guess \\"who done it.\\" But the large number of characters and red herrings in the story, and the amount of time spent on them, made me give up trying to figure out the puzzle and what to just skip to the last chapter so it would be over with.All in all, its still a Christie novel so that makes it a good one, but I'll never read it again."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Length:: 5:48 Mins"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"It was a pretty good book because it kept me wanting to read it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"In Murder on the Orient Express (or Murder on a Calais Coach, whichever you prefer), Agatha Christie once more succeeds in building an apparently inexplicible case and then blowing all your theories to pieces with a simple explanation that you never would have suspected.

This &quot;who dunnit?&quot; is about a detective, Hercule Poirot who is on a train when an infamous mobster is murdered. Poirot takes the case and is determined to catch the killer. Everyone on the train is a suspect. Christie's work is brimming with imagery and details that keep the reader captivated. She draws a meticulous picture in the reader's mind of each character by portraying the appearance, personality, and voice through her book. For example, one of the characters is a fat Italian man who has a thick accent and has a habit of gesticulating with his toothpick after he has removed it from his mouth. Many of the expressions and words that she selected are so humorous, I found myself smiling every few minutes. However, I did not like the fact that she uses French expressions in the story. Who knows what, &quot;Voil&agrave; ce qui est embetant,&quot; means? I did not have the slightest clue what was being said. Another aspect of the book I didn't like was the fact that many of the clues in the story were written in italics and were easy to point out. This made the story seem rather predictable to an extent. However, one would have never guessed the surprise ending. Although thecrime story was ingeniously thought out, I didn't think the structure of the book was. Each chapter was dedicated in interviewing a certain passenger on the train. I found it tedious boring because I anticipated what would happen in the next chapter. Despite this, each chapter leaves the reader hanging and lures him or her to read ahead. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read mystery books that aren't too scary or violent. This is a murder mystery that will not give the reader nightmares! I also think that people who are entertained by humor will enjoy this book. However, those who like reading books that just get down to the vital facts, skipping over details and imagery will not find this book very fascinating. I urge everyone to try to experience the book because I truly believe that Agatha Christie has done a praise worthy job on it. As said in the end of the book, &quot;I made one fantastic suggestion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book is great. the begining was awesome then the middle kinda dragged cuz it was just information after information. but then the ending is unbelievable. this book should be bought by becasue you will want to read it more than once to sum up the clues. great book."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"A wondefully written mystery. Taken place aboard the Orient Express with a full crew of unlikely murderers, or so it seems. That is until a man is murdered in his own room. The way of the murder puzzles everyone including the reader. As you attempt to follow along with the detectives observations you continue to wonder how could any of these people possibly be a murderer. You may think you have it, but the ending is sure to be a surprise."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book I read and it was really good. I don't typically enjoy modern mysteries, so I was hesitant to try a classic one... but as in most cases, classic books are winners. This book was a winner. The ending was not predictable and I love that."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is one of Poirot's travel mysteries, resembling to a large extent \\"Death on the Nile\\" and \\"Evil Under the Sun\\". A murder happens on a train. Everyone on that coach is suspect, and the murderer must be one of them. Furthermore, the isolated setting means there is no official police, and no means of fact-checking other than the statements of the characters, which can have truths or lies. Definitely one of Christie's best, you're rewarded with a twist at the end, and admiration for Poirot's delicate handling of the whole affair."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This book is great. we saw the movie years ago and had forgotten the whole story. It is so well written, humorous and Agatha Christie keeps the mystery as always to the last!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Shame on me, but I only read it when I had to during my LIT327 class.The story is thrilling!The shipping was fast, and the book's condition was mint.Thank you."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The plot has been summarized by several reviewers so I will not. I read this book before I saw any of the movies based upon it. Christie has three of the most ingenious mysteries I have ever read because she blew all of my assumptions out of the water. They are this one; &#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; and &#34;And Then There Were None&#34; (also known as &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34;). Even non-mystery fans should read them. I will never forget the astonishment I felt when I read all three. This one is my favorite. The Orient Express, especially in the period this book was written (1934) evoked a sense of mystery and intrigue. The cast of characters represented many classes and nationalities, which was an important clue for Poirot, but I will say no more. This book is not dated in IMHO because it provides an evocative glimpse of a fascinating and often glamorous time (at least for those who travel on the Orient Express)."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This unabridged reading of one of Agatha Christie's best-known and best-loved books is great fun. David Suchet, the perfect TV Poirot, here gets to show off the amazing range of his acting talent. There are about 15 characters in the book, half of them women, from a variety of different countries and Suchet manages to sustain a different voice and characterisation for each. Yes, occasionally he goes a bit over the top (the Russian Princess for instance) but that adds to the enjoyment - Suchet understands that Christie's books are first and foremost light-hearted fun.Christie shows off her usual winning formula here - a baffling crime, a limited number of suspects, each interviewed by Poirot, and then the d&eacute;nouement as Poirot reveals both murderer and method. What stops the books from becoming repetitive is that there is usually an unexpected twist and this book is no exception. Once you know whodunit, it's easy to look back and see that Christie, more perhaps than any other crime-writer, plays fair with the reader - all the clues are there, we see everything Poirot sees, but can we work it out before he does?I downloaded the audio book from Audible - but discs or download this is a first-rate reading of a deserved classic of the mystery genre. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Definitely enjoyed this one. No way to figure out in advance how it's going to end. As the book went on, I started thinking that the plot was extremely implausible, but all was explained at the end and it wrapped up quite nicely."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express (alternatively titled Murder in the Calais Coach) is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries featuring Hercule Poirot, the detective with the egg-shaped head and the little gray cells (along with a big ego in a diminutive body). I find it difficult to rank books, but it is certainly one of Christie's top five Poirot mysteries. Murder on the Orient Express has everything a good mystery should have: a great plot, excellent characterization, a surprising d&eacute;nouement, and an interesting (albeit immodest!) detective.When it was first published, some critics grumbled that the solution wasn't fair. That wasn't the first time that critics complained about the d&eacute;nouement in a Christie mystery. Her earlier book,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), had many critics (and some readers) up in arms complaining that her solution was unfair. As far as I'm concerned, Dame Agatha always played fair; she just came up with unique and innovative solutions (and that's really what the critics and readers were objecting to).Murder on the Orient Express is an unusual Poirot mystery in other ways. It is told in third person narrative mode, while most other Poirot stories are narrated by Captain Hastings, Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Hastings invariably provides some comic relief as well. Never fear: there are a number of humorous moments to be found, even without Hastings.One of the marks of a good book is that it stands up to re-reading. This is particularly difficult with mysteries, since you usually will have remembered the solution. One of my pleasures is re-reading Christie's better works from time to time. Even knowing the solution, there remain nuances to be discovered.For my permanent collection, I have the Black Dog & Leventhal low-priced hardcover 2006 edition (Murder on the Orient Express: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)), which I recommend without reservation.I also highly recommend Sidney Lumet's marvelous 1974 screen adaptation,Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. Lumet and the all-star cast do justice to Dame Agatha's book. Just make sure you avoid the horrible 2005 made-for-TV remake (Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express)."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Fascinating, with so little to go on to solve, with many misdirecting clues and hints manufactured to throw the detective off."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Hercule Poirot is back, and this time he's aboard the exotic Orient Express, a passenger train traveling between India and Europe. A murder is committed, but then the train is delayed due to a snow drift, and suddenly the murderer cannot easily escape. Poirot is in his element as he rounds up an eccentric cast of suspects to question.This novel presents itself more like a word puzzle mystery game - the clues and evidence are presented in a logical matter and summed up accordingly throughout the story. Everything is pretty much laid out on the table for the reader to draw their own conclusions. I couldn't guess whodunit, but maybe you can. Personally, the real enjoyment is watching Poirot stumble upon that 'Aha!' moment and then seeing how he cleverly chooses to reveal his thinking to us."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The book is very interesting, and with every chapter's end you want to go on. It really makes you think and guess a lot, and the ending is very surprising.This is a MUST for detective story lovers."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"If you are a mystery reader, this is a classic must-read.

This is the most famous A.C book with the Murder of Roger Acroyd, Ten Little Indians and The Mousetrap(and other stories). After all, my personal favorite book have still remained after reading these &quot;famous&quot; books through. And this magnificent book is very, very exciting TOWARDS ZERO which is I suppose so, terribly overlooked and forgotten masterpiece. If you want to have a real murder thriller, where the murderer is throughly evil, intelligent &amp; mad, then you should read this &quot;Towards Zero&quot;. You propably won't regret reading it. Read some reviews of it and GET EXCITED."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is a very exciting book with a really unexpected ending. Hercule Poirot (the main character) solves yet another puzzling crime.The story takes place on the unusually crowded Orient Express (A prestigious Euroean train), which is forced to stop practically in the middle of nowhere because of a snow storm, and nobody can get in or out of it, again, because of the storm.On the train, in the Calais coach, where the murder was commited are some very unusual characters: A big Italian man; The killed man's valet; The killed man's secretary; A Russian princess; A count and a countess; A detective undercover, who pretends he is a dealer of typewriter ribbons; A loud American woman; Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc, and Dr. Constantine; And some more unusual characters.The murder is commited sometime in the night, and on the next day, Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc (Poirot's friend, and manager of the train company), and Dr. Constantine (another one of Poirot's friends) start questioning the suspects (in this case, everybody) and looking for evidence. They know that the killer is very clever, and still on board.When I got this book I thought, well, I'm just going to read about the evidence and stuff like that, and that will be all. Well, it wasn't. The first part of the book (first 50 pages) really isn't very interesting even though I enjoyed it very much. But after page 50, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it. I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning and read all 200 pages in one night, because I said to myself &quot;I won't be able to go to sleep until I know who the killer is.&quot;Get this book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is a great book for both children and adults. The rest of my 6/7th grade class and I recently read it and it was great!

The price was fair and the condition of the book was accurately represented. Shipped and arrived on time."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is only the second book by Agatha Christie that I have read, but it cemented her as one of my favorite authors. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. As it is only the second of her books that I have read, I can't be sure, but I can see a pattern to Christie's writing; she seems to definitely draw from a certain formula in her writing. Even with what appears to be a predisposed pattern to her writing, these are still enjoyable reads.Murder on the Orient Express is a Hercule Poirot mystery, one of her more colorful recurring characters. Like The Mysterious Affair at Styles (the only other Christie book I've read), Poirot finds himself in an unexpected situation; traveling to Paris on the Orient Express, there is a murder, and Poirot is pressed into service to try to solve the mystery before the killer can escape!There isn't much thinking involved on the reader's part; most of the clues are clearly presented, but Poirot doesn't make the connections until the end, but he clearly illustrates how the crime was committed and who did it and how he came to the conclusion.Agatha Christie obviously enjoyed writing her books, as that enjoyment is passed directly onto the reader. 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a clean, fast, invigorating reading experience, just as enjoyable as its most famous adaptation: the 1974 film by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. Interestingly, the elegance of the \\"Orient Express\\" experience was a thematic addition to the film. Here, the now famous traveling experience is described as little more than a long train ride laced with the usual inconveniences of an extended trip. Either the Orient Express wasn't in reality all that sumptuous or such richness was taken for granted when Christie wrote her book.The details and resolution more or less play out as they do in the movie, though the book has a few extra layers of detail and a few small differences in the murder's solution, though there's nothing hugely different in either case. The book, in fact, makes one appreciate the movie even more, in that was it able to faithfully tell the book's story with only a minimum of simplification and consolidation.As the years go by, however, the book has gained one added literary benefit beyond the pleasures of its mystery story: with its dozen or so characters who represent many nationalities and political positions, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" presents to the modern reader a sharp snapshot of the world stage just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Sometimes the best time capsules are those that never aspired to be such, and that's certainly the case here. So, while modern readers will certainly enjoy the mystery story on hand, I think many will also be fascinated with the journey back to a period when the clouds of war were still somewhat in the distance, but- as personified by the uneasy comments and offhand worries of one character about another- were nevertheless slowly creeping closer."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a \\"motley crue\\" - Poirot employs \\"the little gray cells\\" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.There is nothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I am 12 years old and I'm a big Agatha Christie fan.

He is able to find evidence that is out of the ordinary"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"What gets me every time reading these detective murder mysteries is the amazing ability of the detective (Hercule Poirot in this case) to observe and make educated guesses about whether this or that happened; which clues are significant and which are not. The hero of these stories is in fact Poirot, not any of the characters. He is like Sherlock Holmes: he sees what other people do not see. He observes with 1000x magnification while others must be content with 2x. He logically deduces conclusions with agility, while others are left dumbfounded. In short, Poirot's reputation is well deserved. We, as readers instinctively root for him because we know that he will always get his man.Christie concentrates on character development. While Poirot is a familiar figure, the other characters are completely new to the reader. We have the villain Ratchett contrasted with the other passengers: Hardman, Col. Arbuthnot, Princess Dragonmiroff, Count Andrenyi, Countess Andrenyi, Mrs. Hubard, Greta Chisson, Mary Debenham, Hildegrade Schmidt, and Hector MacQueen. Each of the characters has their own peculiarities and their own reasons for being on the Orient Express. When Ratchett is murdered on board the train, it is Poirot's job to discern who the murderer is. In this case the conclusion is very unusual.On the whole, I enjoy reading Agatha Christie mysteries. This one in particular is iconic and makes for a good character study. It also helps to see the movie to better appreciate the subtleties of the book. The book is organized to a tee and draws the reader in to drawing their own conclusions before the end of the book. Astute readers will identify the culprit (probably early on in the book), but will still enjoy the book nonetheless. Agatha Christie maintains her reputation with each book she wrote. While the book is somewhat formulaic in the overall structure, it is nevertheless enjoyable."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Great Book Highly recommend!

A good read for a vacation - I recommend."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Reading Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is like calling up an old friend. It is alway a familiar comfort. This book is so perfectly Christie. All of her favourite character types are here as suspects and the action is stripped down to Poirot simply interviewing one of these suspicious characters after another in his own inimitable style. The solution is joyous, but almost sublimely ridiculous, and many of the clues with which Poirot uses to solve the crime are denied to the reader but still this is one of Christie's more elegant reads (to speak nothing of the perfect film version which even improves on the book). This is the one to pick up and read again and again to get away from any of the stresses of a long day. Simply the best."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"this would be a good choice.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is one of the most well known mysteries of all time, and for good reason, it is brilliant. The story begins with Hercule Poirot beginning a journey on the famed Orient Express. His fellow travelers are a mixed lot; an American businessman and his secretary/assistant and his valet, a Russian Princess and her maid, a Hungarian Count and Countess, a governess, a missionary, a British military man returning from India and two salesman, one American and the other Italian.On the second night out one of the group is murdered, murdered several times over by multiple stab wounds. The train is also snowbound. Poirot quickly discovers that the murderer must still be on the train and works to solve the crime before the train is freed and the killer able to escape, or kill again. He soon learns that the victim is not exactly who he seems, and in fact was connected with a famous kidnapping/murder case.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is an example of how Christie took the events of her day, in this instance the Lindbergh kidnapping, combined with her own experiences (she traveled on the Orient Express many times) to write her novels. Christie also pushed the rules of detective fiction in this one, as she did in THE MURDER OF ROGER AKROYD earlier and would again later in AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (TEN LITTLE INDIANS), to come up with a novel solution."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Inspector Poirot is at first confused by the murder which occurs while he is on the Orient Express. The man who is murdered is traveling under a false identity as Mr. Ratchett, while he is actually the man who murdered a baby in a notorious case in America. While Poirot questions each person, he begins to form an opinion as to the solution to the murders. His friend M. Bouc becomes increasingly confused as he hears the passengers' testimonies, and some stories seem to contradict others. He changes his mind several times as to who he thinks is the murderer while Poirot remains ever confident that he has the solution. This is one of Christie's best-known works and it was made into a movie many years ago. It is recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This particular mystery is actually a little slower and less engaging than other Christie novels. For one thing, the author gives Poirot an ascendant over the supposedly-expert medical examiner on board the train, making the doctor second guess himself a little too often (a nationality bias on Christie's part). Second, the victim is a hated man, making the murder less sensational, but the fact that the train is snowbound and that no one can escape the Express makes for a less-than-exciting notion that the killer is still on board (though everyone acts as if under sedation during their &quot;enforced captivity&quot;). As the mystery is unraveled, the entire truth appears on the instant, abruptly ending any suspense. This is my 2nd Christie mystery after &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; a much more gripping book."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The Murder on the Orient Express is a book that fascinates everyone who reads it.

The beginning started off a little slow, but as soon as I got to the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. The basic plot is that a murder has occurred on a train filled with strangers. It feels terrible to know that you will be stuck on a train for at least 2 days(this is because of a snow storm) on the same train as a murderer. The victim is an American kidnapper, so detective Hercule Poirot tries his best to question all the passengers, trying to find someone who is involved with the kidnapping case. The end is very unexpected, but I wasn't too happy with it. Overall, I suggest that anyone who loves mysteries and suspense read it soon!!!!!!!-Reviewed by Preethi"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This type of book is fit for the sort who enjoy reading murder mysteries. I thought this book was at a medium difficulty level and was suitable for ages ten and above. The protagonist (Hercule Poirot) was a wonderful edition to the story. His cunning plans and charming attitude made him the perfect detective to solve the crime. The book overall was a fabulous thriller with twist and turns making you point your finger at every suspect."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I have never really read many mysteries but after reading Murder on the Orient Express I have decided to start reading more. This novel is so great for many reasons. First off, the murder occurs fairly early in the book so you are not bored by tedious non-important facts. I also like this book because it lays out all the characters at the beginning, so you can flip to the front if you get confused. This murder is so full of twists and turns you never know what is going to happen. This mystery keeps you guessing until the end. When the murderer is finally shown you are shocked and bewildered. I think that Agatha Christie did a fantastic job of writing a great mystery. She developed all of the characters so that the reader was acquainted which each of them .She made it so the reader truly cared about figuring out who killed the horrible murder victim."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Hercule Poirot, a distinguished European lead detective, inadvertently finds himself on a train where a diabolical event is about to occur. The only problem is that Poirot is the only person on the train who seems to notice that something horrific has happened. In Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie, a rich American man on his way to Paris is found dead from multiple stab wounds. Minutes after the murder took place, the passengers on the coach, who all have a secret about the murder, are wondering who has done it. Along with M. Bouc, his trusted friend from Europe, Poirot begins to interview his fellow passengers. Will Poirot be able to solve the most intense case of his career, or will he have to give up and let the dreadful murderer get away?Murder on the Orient Express is an excellent murder mystery. I was continuously intrigued by the complex plot. Christie makes the reader dwell over the book, through clues and quotes, all provided by the different vivid and interesting characters. For example, while Poirot was interviewing Miss Debenham, a neatly-dressed and composed English governess, she told Poirot that she had seen someone in a scarlet kimono embroidered with dragons, on the night of the murder. This left me wondering whether the murderer was a man or a woman. This book really did not compare to any other book that I have read in this genre, such as Ten Little Indians by Agatha Christie, because it was so much more compelling from the start. Within the first few chapters the murder occurs, and for the rest of the book I was trying to figure out who the killer was. Another reason why I liked Murder on the Orient Express was because the author made me feel like I was in the book, and like I was Poirot. Because the book is written from his perspective, I was picking up different clues and pieces of the mystery along the way just as he was, and in the end they all came together.I recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries and who is looking for a complex, but fast and exhilarating read. So go out and get one of the best murder mysteries of all time written by Agatha Christie, Murder on the Orient Express."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I first read this book when I was 13. 17 years down the road, while reading it for the 20th-odd time, I'm still amazed at how Agatha Christie managed to blend everything so flawlessly amidst a sea of clues and red herrings. So much so that I've decided to write a short review about it.Using a real life crime as its foundation, the book puts celebrated detective Hercule Poirot in a stranded train, with a dead body to boot. There are 13 suspects, and each one of them have a perfect alibi. If you haven't read this before, the solution will really be a surprise to you, and gives a total different meaning to the term \\"whodunnit\\".What I like about this book is that it's nicely structured in three parts. The first was used to establish the characters up till the actual crime. The second part was used to gather evidences, mainly through interviewing the suspects, and the last, Poirot's proposals on the truth. This style of writing gives an order to an actually very messy affair, and is perhaps the only way to reduce one's confusion.To make it a more pleasurable read, Christie also sprinkled some humor throughout the story, which provides some light-hearted moments. On the whole, I thought this was (and still is) a very enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"An unusual crime takes place in a unique setting: a train car where no one can get on or off, yet the murderer remains a mystery. I listened to the audio version and the narrator was one of the best I have heard. He takes on the character of Poirot with total enthusiasm and convinving emotion. This is a classic that is anything but typical."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Suspensful novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So many suspects and yet none of them seem to be the murderer. Hercule Poroit keeps you guessing till the end. A must read novel that you won't regret you read."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Hercule Poirot, planning to do some sightseeing in Istanbul, is called back to France on urgent business. He books passage on the Orient Express, and becomes an earwitness to a murder in the adjoining sleeper compartment. A desperate criminal attempting to escape some unknown retribution has been stabbed twelve times in his sleep. The train becomes snowbound and Poirot is asked to solve the mystery while the passengers await rescue. It begins as a locked room mystery with all the possible suspects possessing ironclad alibis. Poirot labors mightily in unraveling the Gordian Knot. As the plot unfolds, the circumstances become more and more bizarre, until at the end, Poirot makes perfect sense out of everything.Poirot's insights appear more intuitive than logical, but he proves to be a shrewd guesser. He doesn't seem to have the deductive powers of Dupin or Holmes, but he makes a quite satisfactory detective nonetheless.The audio dramatization published by BDD was excellent. I had a long drive on a business trip, and the miles went by much faster as I listened to the story, staying several steps behind Poirot throughout. It proved so good that I listened to it again on the way home.One quibble about Christie's work. She wound up giving a very logical explanation for almost all the improbabilities that occurred in the story, but she (or at least the audio version) overlooked one very salient feature of such a stabbing. There would have been bloodspatters all over the victim's sleeper and probably trailed down the hallway of the sleeper car, and the killer would have been unable to dispose of his/her bloody clothing. In reality, Poirot should have been able to solve the mystery by following the killer's blood trail or canvassing the train for the bloody clothing."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is a great book! If you have never read an Agatha Christie book before, read this and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. It is very good and you have no clue who did it in the end. Poirot is one of the greatest fictional detectives ever."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"The novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie, is a riveting and impelling book which chronicles the adventures of a adroit detective traveling on an unusually crowded train, The Orient Express, at the time of a murder. When this detective, M. Hercule Poirot, takes on the investigation, he realizes immediately that the killer is a deceitfully clever and ruthless individual who leaves a trail of false clues designed to keep him off track. The suspects, a diverse, international collection of travelers, are marooned by a snowstorm, preventing the escape of the murderer. M. Poirot takes the passenger's testimony, examines evidence, and through flawless logic and ability, begins to unravel the crime. The story builds up slowly, gathering momentum as it approaches its startling, spellbinding conclusion.Through an intriguing plot, an unusual setting, and realistic, detailed descriptions, the author makes this an appealing book to read. The plot is somewhat slow in unfolding, yet the emergence of unexpected evidence and revelations compel you to keep reading. In addition to the plot, the atypical setting of this book, depicted with detailed imagery, focuses your attention as you seek to uncover hidden clues. The characters are brought alive through detailed depiction of their appearance, personality, and manner of speech.I would highly recommend this book to people who enjoy mysteries and crime stories that are not too scary or violent. M. Poirot is a intriguing main character who takes you through the evidence as if you were actually the detective trying to piece the puzzle together. Yet one can hardly predict the incredible and thrilling resolution to this mystery! Thus, for people who savor suspense and enjoy trying to put clues together to solve crimes, this is an exceptional book to read."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This is not the first classic mystery I have read, nor is it my first Agatha Christie mystery. It is, however, the first featuring M. Hercule Poirot. This is clearly a work in the classic English mystery tradition. It tends towards the cerebral, so it will likely not appeal to those who prefer action, violence, and gore. And it probably is also not well suited for those who like to play armchair detective, since Poirot often observes fact not previously mentioned. Still, it is a well written classic which kept my interest until the very end."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"It is hard to find anything bad to say about this classic -- it must have been thrilling when it first hit bookstores."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"You can see the dated phrases in this mystery, but it is famous for a reason. You will be glad to have read it."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This mystery is one of Agatha Christie's best, if not the best. On a luxury train, filled to capacity, a murder happens that is not entirely unpredictable, but the solution to the baffling murder certainly is. A snowdrift has stopped the train, and while the passengers wait for the track to be cleared, Christie's little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, goes to work and finds the improbable solution to the mystery."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" was not the first mystery novel by Agatha Christie but it was one of her most famous. Some criticized it for its novel ending. This book also has an unconventional ending that should surprise a reader. It is another variation on the \\"locked room\\" murder mystery which takes place on a sleeping car in Europe. Some of the comments reflect life in the 1930s. Hercule Poirot's visit to Syria may reflect the events of that era when it was part of the French Empire. Poirot's trip on the Orient Express finds it packed in the off-season. Then a passenger is found stabbed to death. Has anyone left the train? If not, the murderer is still aboard! Poirot is asked to investigate as the snowbound train is isolated from the authorities.In Part II Poirot interviews all the people on the train. Could anyone be connected to the dead man? Seemingly not, unless Poirot can uncover any facts not disclosed by the passengers. Yet we know it had to be someone on this train. In Part III Poirot considers the testimony and poses Ten Questions about the murder. [Did you pick up any clue?] If any of the passengers have a connection to the murdered man could it explain the crime? In Chapter 9 Poirot assembles the passengers to explain his solution. [This was the common practice in many mystery novels.] Poirot offers two solutions. The first is that Ratchett's enemy entered the train at the station, stabbed him, then slipped away before the train left the station. Poirot explains the second solution to his audience of varied nationalities. Could such a fantastic plan be possible? The Director of the Wagon Lit company chooses the first solution and all the passengers agree. Case closed, the murderer was not found.This clever story is one of Agatha Christie's best. The murderer of Roger Ackroyd was never tried. This story is an example of clever deductions by finding the undisclosed clues. The description of Ratchett as traveling armed tells about the right to keep and bear arms in Europe before the 1940s. One fault of Christie is her description of American citizens as \\"subjects\\". That hasn't been true since the War of 1775."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"I picked up this book second-hand, and was it worth it. The version I have is an older version than I could find here, but same text. Either way, this book kept me reading until the end. Agatha Christie is definitely on my top five writers after that book.The way the mystery is put together is extraordinary! If you have read any other Christie, you might not be as surprised, but if it your first Christie novel, you will be blown away. The cast of suspects was a classic, but the ending was amazing. The last piece of the puzzle slapped me in the face like my alarm clock.I liked this book because it kept me reading until the last page. Also the way the demise of that unlucky person, and how he died was pretty amazing. Lastly, the background on the murdered was based on a real event, not to mention the train they were on is real too."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"It's been such a long time since I've read a mystery novel...so, either I was willing to be pulled in by this story (whether the plot sucked or not), or I found this \\"whodunit\\" really absorbing. Since I literally could not put this book down, I think I'm going to believe the latter. I have not watched the screen adaptation and am not interested to--the reading experience was more than enough...this was a very enjoyable snuggle-into-your-bed-and-read-till-the-late-hours-of-the-night mystery. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This terrific mystery novel from 1934 defines the whodunit genre. For me, Christie builds on Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels by introducing the culture and mores of the twentieth century, including nagging doubts about our own ability to discern right from wrong. Although one knows that Poirot, like Holmes, will crack the case, Poirot's flaws (vanity, unimposing stature, and lack of power to bring anyone to real justice) introduce some dramatic suspense. In addition, Christie uses the genre to explore the culture, manners, class tensions, and national rivalries of the day.The twist of this whodunit is remarkably clever and ties in well with some of the disillusionment of twentieth century man with the ability to tell right from wrong and with the limits of rationality. There is a wonderful irony to all this given Poirot's Holmes-like belief in reason.The novel is dated but reads very well. Great fun as well as containing literary merit."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Agatha Christie is one of, if not the, most prolific mystery authors to date. With a handful of captivating protagonists, ingenious plot devices, and unusual settings and cases, she managed to single-handedly establish the core of the mystery genre. And this book that I am about to review is one of her most famous works.When Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express he has no idea that he is about to descend into one of the most baffling cases of his career. After he makes eye-contact with a passenger by the name of Ratchett, he knows immediately that this man is no good, possibly even downright evil. With his sentiments echoed by everyone on board, it is not so much a surprise when Ratchett comes to him with an interesting proposition. He is being targeted for death by a private enemy and would like to enlist the detective's help in the detection of the culprit. M. Poirot refuses the case and thinks no more of it until the unfortunate Mr. Ratchett is found murdered. But as the case progresses, it comes to light that the circumstances are not so unfortunate as \\"Ratchett\\" was most certainly the despicable man everyone thought him. Armed with the knowledge that the murderer must still be on the train and the certainty that all the passengers are more than happy to see Ratchett dead, Hercule Poirot must sift through a handful of clues to track down a murderer.I myself love the work of Agatha Christie, although some might find her stories a bit dated and outlandish. Sometimes the leaps of logic are a bit hard to follow, but that's what makes Detective Poirot such a formidable crime-solver. And the ending is superb. A must read for anyone who wants to acquaint themselves with classic mystery!"},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"Originally published in 1933, this story has some historical references that will be of interest to historians, but fortunately have only minor relevance to the main track of the plot. These references are to ethnic and national personalities and biases as well as the British dominance of India and Iraq.In this case, M. Poirot is traveling on the Orient Express, the train that connects Western Europe with the Balkans, Turkey and the Middle East. He boards in Syria along with a cosmopolitan group of fellow passengers. Since the group contains such a variety of people the comment is made at the time that it us unusual for so many nationalities to be aboard the train in the winter season.A murder is committed, and the odd point is that the man was stabbed 12 times. Given the nature of the wounds, it appears that some of them were caused by a man and the others by a woman. Since the train has been stopped by a severe snowstorm, the murder had to be committed by someone in the same sleeping car.M. Poirot is called on to solve the case and as he interviews all possible perpetrators, he finds that everyone has an alibi, each person has others that can vouch for their innocence. Therefore, after the first pass through the interviews of the 12 people, the only conclusion is that it is impossible for any of them to have murdered the man. However, M. Poirot is able to determine that the victim was a vicious criminal who had kidnapped and murdered a young girl. Although it was known that he committed that crime and no doubt other similar ones, the kidnapper was able to escape from the clutches of the law.While this knowledge does not help pin down the murderer, when told of the victim's true nature, all twelve of the people express joy at his death. Some express it more emphatically than others. After a second round of questioning, M. Poirot starts extracting additional facts and of course he is led to the path of identifying the killer(s).This is Agatha Christie at her best, the story at first leads to an impossible end, although the path there deposits many clues to the solution. Once M. Poirot starts the second round of questioning, the clues begin to pop up rather quickly and the structure of the murder plot becomes evident."},{"Title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; prevented me from doing most of the things on my regular daily basis because they were so good!

Great tools to make the material sink in!"},{"Title":"Le Rouge et le Noir (French Edition)","review":"Il etait une fois... once upon a time, the two essential avenues for advancement for a poor youth in France were the military and the Catholic Church, symbolized by the red of the army uniforms (yes, before the machine guns of World War I made them change their pants) and the black of the clerical gowns. Stendhal, the nom de plume for Henri Beyle, had his classic work published in 1830, just as Louis-Philippe d' Orleans was restored to the throne. The protagonist is Julian Sorel, of - dare I use the word - \\"humble\\" origin, the son of a carpenter, born in Franche-Comt&eacute;, a rugged area of France that borders Switzerland. He was determined to \\"make his way in society,\\" and Stendhal says that Hercules was an inspiration; it was not a question of a choice between vice and virtue, rather it was one between the mediocrity of an assured well-being and all the heroic dreams of youth.Post-Napoleon, Sorel felt that his greatest chances of advancement to a high level of society were in the Catholic Church. Remember, it was a very different time, far away from the empty cathedrals that only tourists visit in France today. And as the novel adequately describes, the sexual hypocrisy of the male clergy was focused on women, and not the alter boys of today. Yet the \\"eternal truths\\" of the novel require only the modest substitution of Wall Street for the Catholic Church, and the rest, the careerism and political opportunism, the cynicism and the hypocrisy remain remarkably the same. Sorel decides to \\"utilize\\" well-placed women in his rise in society, starting with the wife of the mayor, Mme. De Renal, and later, one of his pupils, Mathilde, who will bear his child. Though Stendhal does not use the particular phrase, \\"hell hath no wrath like a woman scorned...\\" he does use the expression, \\"these terrible instruments of the feminine artillery...\\" which in the end exact the ultimate in revenge.As other reviewers of the English language translation have pointed out, this is one of the very first \\"modern\\" French novels. There is the in-depth psychological drama of Sorel's moves as he struggles up the \\"ladder\\" of society, and there is also Stendhal's acerbic comments on the society itself. Anticipating Sinclair Lewis' \\"Main Street\\" by over a hundred years, Stendhal says: \\"The tyranny of opinion, and what opinion! It is as foolish in the little villages of France as in the USA.\\" Or again, \\"In their eyes, he was convicted of this enormous vice - he thought, he made judgments by himself, in place of blindly following authority and example.\\" Stendhal anticipates the anti-clerical sentiments of the Third Republic with: \\"In the ordinary positions of the life she hardly believed in religion, thought Julien, she loved it as very useful to the interests of her caste.\\" Likewise, \\"My faith, if I find the God of the Christians, I am lost, it is a despot, and as such he is filled with the ideas of vengeance.\\"Wise and insightful of the human condition, consider a few other Stendhal observations: \\"The Russians copy French morals, but always 50 years later. They are now in the century of Lousi XV.\\" Or, \\"My faith, not so foolish; each for himself in this desert of egotism that one calls the life.\\" And foreshadowing his own doom, and rendering a stronger metaphor for that aforementioned feminine artillery: \\"An English traveler retold the tale where he lived with a tiger; he raised it, and caressed it, but always on the table was the loaded pistol.\\"I love well-chosen epigraphs, and Stendhal has them \\"in spades,\\" in three different languages. \\"The Red and the Black\\" was written over 180 years ago, but remains marvelously insightful of the human condition, including all its hubris and petty revenges. A solid 5-stars."},{"Title":"Le Rouge et le Noir (French Edition)","review":"This is a classic French novel that I had wanted to read for a long time. I was not disappointed.

In short, I feel sad that Gilles is no longer with us, what an awesome personality and a warm, friendly person. This book left me wishing I could meet him and wondering what Gilles would've been doing today in his fifties! Stunning book!"},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"This book is still today a classic, and an absolute must for any motor racing fan-- independently of their favourite category. Beautifully written, it narrates in detail the life, times, and racing of one of Formula One's most intriguing drivers. It is full of interesting anectodes and important facts about Gilles Villeneuve's racing and his all too brief presence on the international scene. It is full of interesting notes on his character, personality, and private life-- never crossing the line, however, in morbid curiosity or tabloid cheapness. You will read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"Let me be clear: this is simply the best racing driver biography ever written. It's complete, well written, touching and objective at the same time, respectful to the dead. It's an amazing book. No doubt the writer is a big Villeneuve fan, but he managed to avoid being totally partial.It's full oof data, anecdotes, funny parts, tragic parts, competition, brief technical analysys of the cars, a lot of famous drivers in diverse categories... Well, this is the book."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"It is rare to come across a biography of a famous sports personality that will keep you reading on and on and on compulsively, but Gerald Donaldson has written one. The book combines all the passion and excitement of Gilles' short career in a thorough and superbly readable biography that takes you right behind the public image of Gilles Villeneuve. In short, buy this fantastic book! It more than lives up to its reputation as the racing classic."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"This book will make you feel a shiver up your spine! It's all there: the racings, Villeneuve's determination, the real facts, his family, all put together in a reasonable way that makes you read the book non-stopping. There's no need for another Villeneuve reference book, you must be sure!!!"},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"The book is strictly written in chronological fashion, but Donaldson weaves in opinions and quotes from many people who worked or lived with Gilles. It gives us a good impression of Villeneuve, both as a racing driver and as a person.Personally, I'm not that interested in learning about the private life of racing drivers, hidden as they are behind their helmet. It's their driving that's important. Consequently, I didn't much care for it in this book, either, and it upset me here and there. But then, I'd have missed out on the hilarious accounts from people who were passengers in Gilles' road cars.The racing action in this book is magnificent. Like being there in person.Really well-written, this book literally made me cry and laugh. I can only recommend this one."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"The sad fact is that, despite the popularity of F1 now, nobody since has demonstrated Gilles' control.This book is a good representation of him- it doesn't fawn on him, he's not without his flaws and I think it does a pretty balanced job of showing all sides of the man. If you're into Villeneuve's style, and want to know more about him, you will not do better.In Montr&eacute;al on GP weekend, they've a display of Gilles' suit on Crescent Street. The guy looks all of 5 feet all...a tiny giant among drivers..."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"This book is impossible to put down, if you are or are not aGilles fan this is a must. The book is very well written withtons of insite to his years of racing as well as lots ofliitle known information about him and his family. I found myselfmaking time to get a few more pages in before I would have toput it down. I was at six of the races mentioned in the book,Watkins Glen and Canada, not only did it bring back greatmemories, but I learned more about those races than I knew thenwhen I was there live. Buy it and god bless Gilles"},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"I've read a lot of racing books, but never one better than this.

I still can't believe he lived that long while reading this book .

You won't be disappointed ."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"Gerald Donaldson has written a great biography on the life of one of the greatest racing drivers of all time. It's one of those books that's very difficult to put down once you start reading as it is very entertaining, informative, and moving. You come away from this book with a great deal of respect for Villenueve as he overcame incredible odds to become the man known for his unbelievable car control/driving skills and his tremendous heart. The book covers all aspects of his personality including his warm side, his shortcomings, and his quirks as well as providing a detailed account of his career from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"Perhaps the definitive biography of Gilles Villeneuve, Donaldson writes very entertainingly, and the book will make you laugh and feel sad. He covers Villeneuve's personality well with quote's from freinds and family, and provides a balanced view of a warm, freindly, but sometimes naive and thoughtless person. Some of Gilles' exploits will shock, but it's amusing to hear from those on the receiving end. Covers his life and professional career chronologically and very well. Excellent and revealing book."},{"Title":"Gilles Villenueve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver","review":"The author does a great job of capturing the man behind the legend. Gilles Villeneuve was in F1 for a brief period of time - only 4.5 years - but left lasting memories for legions of fans worldwide.He was pure racer in all senses of the word - always on the limit, never settle for points, etc. He was easily the fastest driver in his day as acknowledged by his peers.This book traces his journey from drag racing at stop lights and other road based shenanigans to his single seater career. His fighting spirit and passion has been very well documented.If you are a fan of Formula One, then you owe it to yourself to read this book. But before you do so, go to youtube and check out the video showing the last couple laps at Dijon with a tremendous battle between Arnoux and Villeneuve. This will get the juices flowing and put you in the appropriate frame of mind while you devour this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"El Trono Codiciado (Booklet) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Jean Plaidy, known to her legion of fans as Victoria Holt, continues her \\"Queens of England\\" series of books with this, her sixth volume. It is the Spanish text edition of \\"In the Shadow of the Crown\\", a well written and engrossing work of historical fiction written as a first person narrative by Mary Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII of England and Queen Katherine. Mary would eventually become Queen of England in her own right and leave a legacy whereby her subjects would remember her as \\"Bloody Mary\\".As the only child of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, the future seemed rosy for the Princess Mary. She lived a fairytale life until her father, obsessed with begetting a male heir, fell for the charms of Anne Boleyn. From that moment on, life would never be the same for Mary. Her world was torn asunder, as her father became someone whom she did not recognize. His cruelties to her and her mother, Katherine, would leave an indelible mark on her life. Divorcing her mother to marry the notorious Anne Boleyn and splitting from the Catholic Church of Rome, Henry would set England on a course that would change history. It would also serve to reinforce Mary's Catholicism, the faith of her pious, long suffering mother.Upon the death of her father, Mary would, along with her half sister Elizabeth, daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn, become a pawn in the political intrigues of the day in which religion would become a focal issue. When Mary became Queen after the premature death of her sickly half brother, Edward VI, son of her father, Henry, and his hapless third wife, Jane Seymour, she tried to make England return to the Catholic Church of Rome. Under the guidance of some of her advisors, she would make horrific examples of those who would fail to embrace what she viewed as the true faith, a policy that would not endear her to her subjects. This, unfortunately, would be her legacy and would, ultimately, shape the future religious identity of England.This is an absorbing story of one woman's struggle to survive the vicissitudes of life, the feckless love of her father, the King, the political intrigues of her day, the threat of imprisonment and death, and a loveless and childless marriage to Phillip of Spain. It is the story of a woman whose road to the throne was paved with many obstacles, and her ultimate acquisition of the crown would confer little happiness upon her. It is a spellbinding account of a life lived entirely in the shadow of the crown."},{"Title":"Sarkhan","review":"In 1967 and 1968 I was stationed with the U.S. Air Force at a secret base in north eastern Thailand. I picked up a copy of Sarkhan in the BX. I had been making covert trips into Laos where I started reading the book while waiting to be picked up in the afternoon by Air America. The book was &quot;fiction&quot; but I felt I was &quot;living&quot; each and every page I read. It was eerie to say the least. No other piece of &quot;fiction&quot; has stuck so steadfastly in my 58-year-old memory. When I returned stateside I searched in vain for a copy so I could read its haunting message again. Years later I discovered that the U.S. Government had &quot;pulled&quot; the book from sale during the Nixon administration. IT'S PAGES WERE TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH and the book was considered a threat to our national security. After NIXON had resigned and the Pentagon Papers digested the book wasonce again put out for sale. (Thus SARKHAN has some historical importance as well as being a good story). Yes, it can and did happen in America. I never forgot the book and I accidentally came across a copy at a local library book sale. I paid 25 cents. I would have gladly paid $25. The story remained unchanged, as it had in my mind for 32 years. Today this book is one of my prized possessions. If you want to see how our government works under the cover of U.S. Aid, you should read this book. The descriptions and story has been continued until this very day."},{"Title":"Sarkhan","review":"Unfortunately, the main and multiple plot lines of this book remain almost as applicable today as they did when the book was published in 1965. Sarkhan is a small and very peaceful kingdom in Southeast Asia, while the country is not wealthy; the people are doing reasonably well, as they have for generations. Unfortunately, Sarkhan is being placed in the middle of the global struggle between the expansion of Communism and the free world led by the United States. A small group of brutal Communist insurgents have just started their attempts to destabilize the nation and the United States is concerned.It is also a time of transition for Sarkhan, the current and popular King Diad is about to abdicate in the traditional manner and his equally popular son Prince Lin will succeed him. Both are neutralists in the global struggle, seeking only to further the ends of their nation and keep it peaceful.Two Americans, a businessman named Coldstream and a Professor named McAuley have lived in the country for a long time and understand it well. Both are veterans of the U. S. military and speak the local languages, even to the point of being able to use the regional dialects. McAuley is the foremost American scholar on the country, having written books on the history of Sarkhan that have impressed Prince Lin. The American ambassador is a well meaning man, but he is not up to the task of truly understanding what is happening. Hobson, the director of the American intelligence agency, is a ruthless man who sees only Communist threats in a strictly us-versus-them situation. Cogswell is an old hand at the global political game and has the ear and confidence of the President of the United States.The Communist agents in Sarkhan stage a mock invasion of the country by North Vietnamese troops, they manage to keep the Prince in seclusion and in his absence the Sarkhan government requests massive American aid. Even though the American intelligence community knows that the invasion is phony, they welcome the chance to save the nation from Communism. The meeting in the American embassy where Prince Lin, Coldstream and McAuley present their eyewitness accounts of the phony invasion is an amazing and depressing story. Even though high-ranking American military people and Cogswell take their side, nothing can stop the forces in play and in the end, Prince Lin, Coldstream, McAuley and Cogswell are all destroyed.Reading this story in the light of the American invasion of Iraq and the subsequent revelations of deceit, faulty and outright deceptive intelligence, the ultimate outcome and the way the careers of some good people have been destroyed, you see how accurate it is. Although the story is fiction, Lederer and Burdick understand all too well how things can go wrong when people take a ruthless and simplistic us-versus-them mentality when looking at the world."},{"Title":"Sarkhan","review":"Unfortunately, the main and multiple plot lines of this book remain almost as applicable today as they did when the book was published in 1965.

Drawing on years of hands-on experience and passionate commitment to uncovering hidden stories, she explores the paradox that Jewish life and culture is vigorously alive in regions where actual numbers of Jews are comparatively few.She examines everything from music to food, scholarship to jokes, culture to kitsch, and shows intimate knowledge of countless Jewish communities thriving throughout Eastern Europe. She describes how Jewishness in the region has triumphed over the twin traumas of the Holocaust and Communism to reconstitute a vibrant culture recognised and admired throughout the Jewish and non-Jewish world.This is a great book, sensitive, scholarly and life-affirming, of interest to anyone who cares about roots, history and survival. I loved it."},{"Title":"Virtually Jewish: Reinventing Jewish Culture in Europe","review":"A colleague of mine (also a professor) recommended this book to me, and I am glad that he did. This book is a first-rate portrayal of the complicated world of European philosemitism and strange attempts to re-create a lost Europan Jewish world. As a graduate student working on German-Jewish history, I lived for several years in Germany, and I witnessed this complicated and somewhat peculiar phenomenon first-hand. Gruber explains so well what I witnessed and have struggled to explain to others. In particular, I would recommend Part 1 to my students and to others wishing to find suitable course reading on this topic."},{"Title":"Virtually Jewish: Reinventing Jewish Culture in Europe","review":"Ruth Ellen Gruber is an excellent writer. She sneaks up on you and manages to make a subject in which you think you have no interest absolutely fascinating-- and interesting! It takes much talent and erudition to do this and Gruber appears to have both in abundance. The subject of this book, at first glance, seems of minor importance, or probably even boring. Instead, Gruber draws you in and before you know it you can't put it down. For anyone even vaguely interested in Jewish culture, and/or modern European history, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Six Nonlectures","review":"The nonlectures are titled:i & my parentsi & their soni & selfdiscoveryi & you & isi & now & himi & am & santa claus.A list of readings of works referred to in the text concludes this collection."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes and the Boulevard Assassin (Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)","review":"Following an outrageous crime in Paris, where a criminal claiming to be Sherlock Holmes plays an pivotal role, the real Great Detective and his trusty biographer head off to the continent where things are far more complex than they first appear...John Hall writes a reasonable Holmes book, relying upon the known plans of Professor Moriarty and featuring the French thief, Arsene Jupin, in a strong supporting role.His writing plays to a desirable strength: Holmes and Watson are truly portrayed as detectives, accumulating clues and investigating leads, as they try to uncover exactly who is behind the plot and where to find him. In this quest they utilise both the services of the French Surete and the contacts they develop in the underworld. However, the relative ease with which they move through the organisation of the French master criminal makes him seem a little less formidable than would be desirable.There is nothing wrong with the portrayal of Holmes and Watson, but be the same token they are not very exciting or notable.Arsene Jupin (as Arsene Lupin is called here) is a bit bland. Lupin, as originally portrayed, had a bit of a hard edge that reduced as his stories went along. The portrayal here is Lupin at his most boring.A reasonable read for Holmes fans, not so interesting for those who want to read Lupin."},{"Title":"Jack of Eagles","review":"Danny Caiden is the Jack of Eagles. However, when the novel starts, Danny is just a writer working for a trade publication. He has always had the talent for finding things. An example is given of a drunk friend at a party ringing up and asking where he has put his ski wax, and Danny tells him immediately what it has fallen in to.Encountering another friend, he gets to talking about probability, and decides to see what else he can find. In a probability sense this means gambling, on the stock market, and horse racing.This brings him to the attention of some gangsters, and avoiding them he decides to find out more about psychic abilities, contacting some researchers.Soon, he learns there is a secret society, the Brotherhood, all composed of people like him. Danny's abilities are growing, making them want to recruit him. He opposes their politicals and ethics of superiority to normal humans, and escapes to discover there is an opposing force to these people.With abilities rapidly increasing, and the understanding of the mathematics of probability and psi abilities, Danny is able to venture through different realities to attempt to thwart his opponents, and get the FBI to believe he is not a criminal."},{"Title":"Jack of Eagles","review":"\\"Jack of Eagles\\" is a good book about Danny Caiden who discovers that he has esp,i.e., psychic powers, and decides to learn more. He soon finds that the ratio of 'scientific' fact to psycobabble is rather small. However, he also crosses paths with a dangerous group of psychics and is forced to try to use his developing powers to 'save' the world. It is a good and satisfying story that ties up a lot of loose ends by the happy ending.The novel was written in the early 1940's or there about and has an air of the times about it. The 'girlfriend' who attaches herself to Danny is quite decorative and interestingly gypsy. At the time that WWII started, the normal card deck temporarily acquired a fifth suite of cards, called eagles. Since the eagles suite was an oddball, the Jack of Eagles would be even odder than the other Jacks, and, thus, even wilder than the phrase, \\"Jacks are wild.\\" might suggest. In any case, this is the title used in Britain. A different title was used in the USA (possibly; \\"Esper\\". Though I am not sure my memory got it right.)I liked the story because it treats psychic powers with a 'scientific' mode of thinking, much like anything to which engineering might be applied. In that respect, the story is more of a science fiction story in concept than a fantasy. And, an actual science-based object is used as a central concept in the story.Whether you like science fiction or fantasy, read this story."},{"Title":"Jack of Eagles","review":"It's all about Danny Caiden, who discovers that he has ESP.

The pages are filled with Scripture quotes and also quotes by well known ( and maybe some not so well-known ) Christians of yesterday and today.There are statistics sprinkled in to add to the sense of urgency of the mission.Each page brings a penetrating challenge and adds fuel for a passion for mission.The title page calls this,&quot;A Mega Motivating Crash Course On God's Heart&quot; and I think they have not exaggerated.If you are up for a challenge personally or if you want a tool to challege others in the cause of Christ then this is the book for you.As a pastor and mission leader I plan to use its &quot;morsels&quot; often."},{"Title":"God's Great Ambition","review":"In God's Great Ambition the authors are rockin your missionary mind to reach a hell bound world for Christ before it's too late. If you're thinking about being a missionary then read this book to fuel your fire, it's like holy nitroglycerin. It has writings from Billy Graham, Carey, Luther, Hugh Myrr, and the list goes on and on. Every page has at least one dynamite verse from God's Holy Word also.

It has everyething -romance, action, and a very intresting plot. The hero - Pierce Wolverton Lord of Darkridge is just perfect- neither too harsh nor too gentle. Just the way I like my heroes. I also love the way the heroine is portrayed - adventurous and brave and full of spunk. A definite must for all lovers of Shelly Thaker's books.

Looking forward to reading the rest of shelly's books!"},{"Title":"Midnight Raider","review":"The story idea is OK, but the characters' continuous denials of the obvious and not saying what they mean gets old quick.For excellent Shelly Thacker reads try _His Forbidden Touch_ and _Timeless_."},{"Title":"Midnight Raider","review":"From the back cover:Dangerous alliance...By day, she is Elizabeth Thornhill, lovely young widow; by night, cleverly disguised, she becomes the notorious Blackerby Swift, riding a mission of vengeance against the ruthless villain who condemned her to a debtor's prison. But she is not alone on the shadowed highway...Pierce Wolverton, Earl of Darkridge, travels the same roads in search of the same scoundrel--the man who stole his family fortune. Darkly handsome, Pierce is known as the Night Raider, the most feared highwayman in England, and he'll share his prey with no other. Until he encounters his infamous rival, Blackerby Swift...and discovers an exquisite beauty whose reckless determination fills him with both fury and desire. Thrown together in a game of intrigue and revenge, they dare not trust each other. Yet they are compelled to dance a dangerous duet, tempting fate with a passion that will either destroy them...or unite them forever in a alliance that will thunder with the overwhelming power of love.And my review:Well, first off, I want to say that I am a huge fan of Shelly Thacker. Before I read this book, every single novel I'd tried by her had been one I'd loved. So I expected MIDNIGHT RAIDER to be yet another winner by this talented author. I was so shocked that the hero in this one was a horrible person! Even now, I can hardly believe that I'm about to give a negative review to a Shelly Thacker novel.Usually, I love Shelly Thacker's characters. In fact, I find that her greatest strength is in creating honorable people that, while they have their human flaws, are basically good people that the reader can cheer for. And while the heroine in this book was a person I could cheer for, the hero wasn't.Where to start? Well, for one, I didn't like the way he almost immediately decides to seduce the heroine, whom he believes is married. She's actually a widow, but he doesn't know that. His reasoning? She must not really love the guy, since he's away all the time, supposedly travelling. So cheating is okay if the marriage is loveless? Not in my book. He believes that the heroine is married, yet the thought of committing adultery with her doesn't even register as a blip on his moral radar. That was a big turn-off.But what really sealed his doom was when he tries to force himself on the heroine. He only stops when she screams that what he's doing is rape. Okay, okay, he does stop then, but still, that he would actually get to such a state is disgusting! I can't have any respect for a man who would ever even THINK of trying to force himself on a woman, let alone almost do it.Also, I couldn't really understand why the hero and heroine couldn't just team up to destroy the villain. Since they both hated the guy and wanted to see him suffer for his crimes, why not work together to achieve that mutual goal? After all, as the saying goes \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\". The story would have made more sense that way, rather than having the hero and heroine fight amongst themselves.I cannot believe that this book was written by the same author who wrote the wonderful HIS FORBIDDEN TOUCH, A STRANGER'S KISS or the very enjoyable INTO THE SUNSET. Try those books for a true test of what this author is capable of. All of the heros (and heroines) in those books were good, honorable people. No raping or domineering jerks masquarading as heros in those books. Even if you're a die-hard fan of this author (which I am), don't buy MIDNIGHT RAIDER. Try one of the other books I mentioned, but stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Practical Mushroom Encyclopedia: Identifying, Picking and Cooking with Mushrooms","review":"This is only book that mushroom lovers need.

Not recommended !People should only pick wild mushrooms if they truly know what they're doing - or better still, go in the company of a trained expert (mycologist) who knows what they're doing.All it takes is a search of the internet, a flip through the phone book, or perhaps a few phonecalls to areas colleges or culinary clubs, in order to find the name of a local mushroom expert who's willing to take people on picking forays.In any case, this is still an enjoyable book, and if nothing else it'll whet your appetite for dishes like risotto w/porchini, cream of mushroom soup, etc."},{"Title":"The Practical Mushroom Encyclopedia: Identifying, Picking and Cooking with Mushrooms","review":"This is a lovely book, but it is not a substitute for a good field guide.

This is the pre-dummies and pre-idiots book that we all really need."},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"I bought this book and a dummies book for my 73 year old father who had never used a computer in his life before. He read both and learned more, and faster from this book - First Week with My New PC. His comment was that this book was the one geared to the complete newbie. He felt that the dummies book required a knowledge base that he, as a brand new user, did not yet have! Definitely highly recommended!"},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my 89 year old father. He got a new computer and was completely overwhelmed. After attempting to read several other computer books he was about to give up. He is thrilled with this one and is very excited about using the computer again. He said \\"Finally, a book written in clear, easy-to-understand language that I can follow. This is the best!\\""},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"While The First Week With My New PC was written for the author's 85-year-old mother who is now a PC master, it can be enjoyed by any - including business managers who have resisted the lure of the computer screen. From how to watch the stock market and produce a document to emailing and formatting work, this is packed with fine basics in simple language any can readily understand."},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"The book is well written. The author writes to those who are not computer literate. Examples are helpful as well as the step by step instructions."},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"I returned the book. It is way out of date. Copywrite of 2000 and has not been updated. Netscape is no more, no mention of Google,RSS feeds plus many more features now available."},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"My mom said this book helped dispell some of the fear about getting started with her computer. She says it answered a lot of her questions in a format that was easy to understand. She would recommend this book to other seniors getting started with a computer."},{"Title":"First Week With My New PC :A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults & Everyone Else (Capital First Week)","review":"Found this book on the internet and checked it out at a local library. It helped me explain things much better.I am helping 2 persons over 65 get started in using the PC and the internet. One had no exposure at all. After helping her select a home computer and setting it up, I realized how much it all frightened her.I purchased a book for each to help them when I am not around. They both love the book and are becoming confident in their exploration. There may be other books out there, but this one is doing the job for us.Tony H."},{"Title":"First Hunters: Ohio's Paleo-Indian Artifacts","review":"This book is a great primer to understanding the Paleo-Indian culture. However, there are many gramatical errors and errors in the use of certain words. The book is difficult to read. A second edition is in order. The pictures of the paleo artifacts are good, but descriptions are difficult to understand since many pictures of the black flint tools are void of visual detail. A bibliography would be helpful, and a list of definitions would be more that helpful."},{"Title":"The Black Middle Class-","review":"This book asks if sociological findings on the black middle class in the first half of the 20th century are true in the latter half. Some of the hypothesizes are so bourgeois, it's hard to believe that any black person actually believed them.Still, this book focused only on presumably straight, black men. It doesn't interview black women, even though blacks have debated whether Friedan's \\"feminine mystique\\" even applies to them for decades. Don't let James Evans' position on Florida's working fool you: most black women were not barred from working by their husbands.Next the book lists the marital status of the black interviewees and just assumes that all of them would want female marriage partners anyway. Yes, this book was published only two years after the Stonewall Riots, but it still feels painfully heterosexist as a modern reader.Still, if you like books like \\"Black Metropolis\\" and \\"The Black Bourgeoisie\\", you might as well read this too. I just wasn't pleased by this text generally."},{"Title":"The Warmth of a Song: A Love Story About Freedom Set During The Battle of The Bulge of World War II","review":"As soon as I received Helen von Erck's novel, \\"The Warmth of a Song,\\" I found I could not put it down. I had bought for my husband who served in Vietnam. Since the book takes place during the Battle of the Bulge of WWII, I thought he might be interested in it. Little did I know that \\"even though I am a girl\\" I loved all the action, the characters seemed so dear and real to me, and the sweet spritual story that tied up the novel, hit a tender spot in me. I highly recommend this book to both men and women young and old as there's something that everyone will love about it!"},{"Title":"The Warmth of a Song: A Love Story About Freedom Set During The Battle of The Bulge of World War II","review":"Dear Ms von Erck:Just a quick note to let you know how much I enjoyed your book \\"The Warmth of a Song.\\"Great job on historic accuracy. I always thought the tragic Cocoanut Grove fire could be a subject of a World War IImovie - and I hope someone approaches you for movie rights.Best wishes and congratulations,Paul A.

And it speaks so eloquently to those of us who werethere. I wish you great success with it.Dr. Duncan Trueman, Chaplain106th InfantryHelen,I read \\"Warmth of a Song\\" in a couple of nights and will tell you that I think that it was well done. I wouldn't be surprised if the \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame Theater\\" didn't come looking for you.Best, John SchaffnerVeteran 106th Infantry Div.Dear Helen:I don't have must time for reading. However I finished your book. I must congratulate you on doing such a fine job.I have received your Autograph, with that fine message. I want to thank you for that. It will go into my book.I have emailed John Kline and advised him of my approval to advertise the book in the \\"CUB\\" our quarterly magazine.The choose is his, weather he will do it or not, I hope that he will.Your research was most impressive. The conditions that existed at the time were so bad, that even trying to describethem to friends, I don't think they grasped how bad it really was. The way that you have described it in your story was well done. I know that anyone reading it will get a good idea of how it is to dig a hole in the frozen ground, crawl on your belly in the snow, go without warm food and sleep for days, seeing your buddies being killed or maimed, constantly being shelled or shot at and the freezing cold, that never left you. Only those that where there, really know what it is like. These are things that we endured as teenage kids, that should have been getting ready for College, or a trade. Also enjoying the parties and dances that go into finding the girl of your dreams. Lost to us forever.Now, look at the position that we were in. Coming home at the age of twenty two, no trade, no education and having tostart at that age, while all of the others, that didn't go into the Army, are well on there way to a career.I have no regrets, I did what I had to do. I met and married a terrific girl, had a good career in Aero Space Manufacturing. I am now retired and enjoying life to the fullest.Your book brought back many memories. Years ago I would have never read such a book. I did not need to be remindedof those terrible days. Now I can look back and say, God Bless America.John Gatens\\"A\\" Battery 589th FAB. 106th INF DIV"},{"Title":"Talking In The Dark (Push Poetry)","review":"I'm a lesbian. I'm 20, not really a teen. But a friend told me about Billy Merrell's TALKING IN THE DARK because she knew I loved poetry, and it has since become one of my favorite contemporary collections. And not only that, but I found in Merrell a place to feel comfortable. Not only because I'm gay and so is he, but because he happens to be gay, and so do I. He is so wise for his age. My mother is reading it now, and that is what she told me.The poems are smart, emotional, revealing. Merrell strips his life down to amazing, telling lines that left me wanting it to go on and on. I've read it twice already and am taking my time reading it a third time now, and there's always something new and beautiful to find in the rereading. My favorite poetry is personal, careful, and spiritual (not religious, necessarily, but intensely in touch with the world). That's what the poems in TALKING IN THE DARK are like.If you know someone, anyone, who reads poetry, this is a book that will affect them, always."},{"Title":"Talking In The Dark (Push Poetry)","review":"i read \\"talking in the dark\\" over a year ago and it has still stuck with me. even though this memoir is told through poetry, it is very easy to read and understand. you can really relate to what merrell has gone through. this book is definately an amazing undiscovered gem. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Talking In The Dark (Push Poetry)","review":"~*AMAZING*~ My girlfriend loved TALKING IN THE DARK and MADE me read it, which I don't usually do.

And my girlfriend likes me to read her parts, especially SHHH and HISTORYS.
