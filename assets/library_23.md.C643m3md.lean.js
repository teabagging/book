With this book (2005) he wants to show that there are many problems with the doctrines of atonement in Western Christianity. Although he interacts with scholarly works written in English or German, the books remains quite accessible to a broad readership.The first chapter ( sacrifice and scapegoat , p. 11-38) presents the different kind of cultic rituals, which can be found in many religions and in particular in the ancient Palestinian religion mentioned in various fragments of the Old Testament (OT): sacrifice as a gift to a god, as cleansing a believer from an impurity or a sin, as cleansing a holy place. Finlan distinguishes six levels of spiritualisation that is of religious reinterpretation and abstraction of sacrifice (although he gives OT, Greek or Hellenistic examples, these distinctions may remain a bit too abstract...). He explains the difference between typology and allegory. He finally deals with the expulsion / scapegoat rituals, showing the contrast with sacrifice (which involves a manipulative relation with gods) whereas scapegoat rituals are entirely magic in the sense that a bad thing (sin, curse, disease) is transmitted to a pure animal which takes it over and is expulsed to a wilderness demon. As in other parts of the book, Finlan mentions in footnotes all relevant scholarly work. He succeeds in remaining short because he masters the subject. This short part of the book may be a reason to buy it for anyone interested in the OT, especially given that the equivalent part in his newer book,Options on Atonement in Christian Thought, 2007, is only 10 p long.Much more on this can be found in his breakthrough PhD research work which is presented in the bookThe Background And Content Of Paul's Cultic Atonement Metaphors (Paper), 2004, e.g. the six levels of spiritualisation are more detailed (p. 47-69 of Background... instead of about 8 pages presently). This main part of that research book (p. 70-224) is condensed into the second chapter ( Paul Use of Cultic Imagery , 39-62) of the present book. The basic idea is that Paul uses all kinds of ritual metaphors: scapegoat, sacrificial, judicial, economic (purchasing the freedom), Hellenistic heroism (self-sacrifice...), which strongly contrast Jesus' views in the gospels: Citing 1 Cor 9:22, Finlan explains that Paul's motive was to win converts, thus to use metaphors that worked (p. 62). So when Paul wrote that Christ died for us, he conflates many different, actually antinominic, concepts, even often in one single sentence. These insights illuminate enormously the New Testament (NT), motivate to purchase his last book,The Apostle Paul and the Pauline Tradition, 2008, where Finlan uses his insights to explain the Pauline letters. But this leads also to the following chapter.Given the many different metaphors used by Paul, one can expect confusion. This is what Finlan shows in the third chapter, Atonement after Paul (63-83), starting with the pastoral Pauline epistles and ending with the reformation doctrines. This is known from other books, so I mention only a few points. Finlan introduces the doctrine of theosis. He exposes the weaknesses of the Western doctrines, as denounced by Western proponents from other doctrines, e.g. a powerless God needing to buy back humans from the devil, the legal view introduced by Latin thinkers such as Augustine (who introduced also the doctrine of original sin), Anselm's feudal and tarnished God requiring a payment for his offended pride, and worse of all, Luther's and Calvin's divided God, with the angry Father's horrifying transfer of divine wrath to his undeserving Son. The irrationality of the later view led Luther to become anti-intellectual.The last chapter, Rationalising the atonement doctrine (84-116) exposes and criticizes some recent attempts to solve these problems, e.g. by Wheeler, Girard and his followers, Hofius, Hamerton-Kelly, J. G. Williams, Winter, Waever, Wink, Brown and Parker... After looking at the last options, Finlan comes back to Jesus: did He have to be killed? what was His own soteriology? He ends with Jesus' rejection of OT cultic rituals in the line of the prophet Hosea. A weak point here is a cheap, gratuitous rhetoric related to Anti-Semitism and Nazism which weakens a bit the quality of the book. This applies also sometimes to names he uses in his books, e.g. calling mistaken thinkers lesser minds , etc.Everything Finlan dealt with is well exposed. Although Finkan has kept his book short (144 p. with indices) he has totally succeeded in exposing the unresolvable problems with the doctrines of atonements in the West. Luckily there is hope: the last pages of the book are used to remind that atonement, unlike the incarnation from which it is derived, is not an essential Christian doctrine. Finlan ends by introducing the Early Church's doctrine of deification / divinisation (theosis), still quite alive in Orthodox Christianity: by recapitulating human life in Himself, the divine Son restored the potential for union with God, a gradual transformation which will be fulfilled in the afterlife. Actually the greatest Western Christian thinker also accepted this doctrine, e.g. see A. N. Williams'The Ground of Union: Deification in Aquinas and Palamas, 1999,or Luc Thomas Somme's Thomas d'Aquin: La divinisation dans le Christ (1998) at amazon.fr.In conclusion this excellent book is extremely important breakthrough for Western Christians. It is still worth buying in spite of Finlan's more recent similar bookOptions on Atonement in Christian Thought, the later having a somewhat different emphasis and interaction with not quite the same thinkers."},{"Title":"Problems With Atonement: The Origins Of, And Controversy About, The Atonement Doctrine","review":"Along with his Options on Atonement, this is a highly readable and satisfying survey of atonement theory for the layperson.

Congregations sing at the top of their lungs: 'My sin, not in part but the whole, has been nailed to the cross, so I bear it no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul' ! ..... The priestly work of Christ separates Christianity from Judaism and Islam.\\" -- Dr. Mark Dever, pastor Baptist Church, DC*A Short History of Atonement:Atonement in Orthodoxy, is all about sanctification and transfiguration, humanity becomes 'divine' by participating' in God. In Alexandrine Orthodoxy, where the Epistle to the Hebrews, played a central theological theme, the intercessory character of our Lord (high-priestly office) is transferred to the heavenly condition and work of Christ, where the relation of Christ's work to man's condition is still continued in the heavenly place. The atonement of Christ, initiated our participation in eternal life, by making the Father known to us, John 17:3. In progressive transformation, our unity with the Father was based on John 17:11 \\"... may we become united in You and You in us. \\"Thus Your saying will be fulfilled, That they all may be one with Us.\\" The Coptic Liturgy of Saint Cyril.Western Christianity Atoning :In Late antiquity Roman Catholicity the main atonement models in use as an emerging novel concept were conceived as Christ's work, presented to God as an oblation. While Ransom was universally dominant over this period, with Christ as teacher being taken for granted, and Christ-as-gift popping up occasionally. Anselm, challenging Christus Victor/Ransom-from-Satan drew up a theological version of the Satisfaction thesis (Christ the gift) to replace it. The offense given to God by human disobedience was made up for by Christ's faithful obedience to God. Peter Abelard who objected vigorously to Anselm's reasoning, attempted to reinvigorate the Christ-as-Teacher model, which became \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" in Thomas Kempis classic.Reformers Penal Substitution:From this point on, Western Christianity generally dropped the ransom model and became split between Satisfaction and Moral Exemplar. Anselm's satisfaction thesis was based on the idea of God as a Feudal Lord, acting according to social standards to accept Christ's faithfulness, as a substitution for our disobedience. His ideas were reshaped, as society passed out of feudalism, using a legal paradigm of \\"Penal Substitution\\". This added to Satisfaction the idea of Christ suffering for deleting our punishment.The Reformers adopted the Penal Substitution theology of their day whole heartedly. Original Sin was strengthened by them back to the Augustinian view, and predestination teachings were reinstated. Lutheran salvation by 'faith alone' while works were annexed as auxiliary 'sanctification' which became tangible to the salvation process. \\"Justification' was redefined, to mean a righteous status declared by God that was adverse to our state of sinfulness.Finlan's Problems with Atonement:Dr. Finlan, Problems with Atonement, has three theological milestones, quoted hereunder:\\"Atonement theologies confirm two fundamental and universal instincts about life and divinity: the belief that nothing is free, that there must be give-and-take in the spiritual economy as there is in the material; and secondly, the intuition that ritual establishes order. (pp. 80)\\"The problem is not what all this says about Jesus but what it says about God: if God wants to save, why is such intercession necessary? Why should Jesus' pleading for humanity only be effective after he had been murdered? It does us no good to perceive Jesus as heroic if we are forced to view God as sadistic.\\" (pp. 97)\\"...atonement is intertwined with many important and essential Christian teachings such as the compassion of God, the fact of the divine Incarnation, and the certainty of eventual vindication of the just. Many people instinctively fear the loss of these belief if atonement is surrendered.\\" (pp. 116)Finlan's atonement thesis:Finlan provides in his thorough thesis a comparative analysis of atonement dogmatics which developed since the Church by Patristic fathers and follows its progress within the medieval Church and the impact of the reformation. He starts by explores the metaphoric meaning found in the Hebrew, and parallel rites of sacrifice of their Gentile neighbors. He traces sacrifice as an offering, a precious gift of the best to please and/or appease God. On another level Hebrew sacrifices were used as form of purification, sacrifice came to be seen as a means of expiation, bringing forgiveness, dealing with sin. An early example of substitution, hinted at in Hebrew Scriptures, would be the replacement of human with animal sacrifice. It is not uncommon to hear that atonement (and thus kipper) means most literally \\"to cover.\\" The blood accomplishes kipper by eliminating that defilement. The Hebrew concept of \`kippering', translated into the English word \`atonement', is described as payoff, ransom, turning away potential retaliation.Confessional statements and scholarly discourse on atonement may have been later metaphors of atonement have been uncritically conflated and calls for a re-examination of life, death and resurrection through the view of the doctrine of incarnation. Metaphorical use of cultic terms is found in Paul's reference to the body as the temple, and uses multiple metaphors and models to illustrate the meaning of the death of Christ. Paul refers to Christ's death in terms of sacrificial, sin-sprinkling and sin-bearing, scapegoat. He goes on to use social metaphors to describe the beneficial results of Christ's death for believers: justification (from the legal court), reconciliation (diplomatic metaphor), and adoption (family metaphor), and ransom (freedom for slaves). It was in the combination of the metaphors that the concept of penal substitution began to emerge. Finlan stresses that the concept of scapegoat must be distinguished from the concept of sacrifice. Sacrifice, he reminds us, \\"has nothing to do with punishing the animal but with the purifying power that the lifeblood is thought to have\\".Finlan concludes, \\"this means that some incompatible religious ideas were yoked together. ...; but this has caused confusions to later Christians.\\" Finlan is concerned that the primary Christian doctrine of the incarnation has been interpreted through secondary doctrines such as substitutionary atonement, rather than the other way around. He acknowledges the concern that the rejection of such secondary doctrines can lead to a wholesale rejection of all doctrine. He acknowledges that much of Paul's writing points to the life and death and resurrection of Jesus in terms of atonement metaphors. Finlan hopes to convince his readers to read the rest of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures without imposing the \`penal substitionary atonement' model on them. He concludes with the thought that the early Christian doctrine of theosis may be a useful way ahead in developing a deep and useful understanding of Christ. The most radical expression in the complete rejection of sacrificial practice, seen in writing by Isaiah, Jeremiah and Hosea.A Jesuit Scholarly Review:\\"By 'Atonement' Finlan means those secondary doctrines or theories that, at their bizarre worst, entail 'God as sacrifice-demander and Jesus as punishment-bearer,' and at their best with their overemphasis on the implications on judicial, cultic, economic, social or other metaphors, manage to veil or even undercut the mystery of God's self communication in Jesus.\\" Robert Daly, S.J.Stephen Finlan:Dr. Finlan wrote his Dissertation in Pauline Theology, to the University of Durham, UK. His investigation of \\"The Background and Content of Paul's Cultic Atonement Metaphors,\\" gave him the inspiration to examine the writings of the Church Fathers.

We can follow the trail from second Clement, Ignatius of Antioch to the Ephesians, the epistle of Barnabas, and the shepherd of Hermas. While Clement addresses salvation as justification, he also writes on sanctification. Irenaeus on atonement(Adversus Haereses) writes,\\"God became man, and it was the Lord himself who saved us.\\" Tertulian expounded Irenaeus on 'Atonement by Incarnation' in Adv. Marcionem ii, 27. Clement of Alexandria started its salvific tradition in the work of Christ; Salvation by the example of love in the incarnation and passion (Quis Dives Salvetur). In contra Celsum, Origen initiates the Alexandrine deification as exemplified in Christ's humanity, exploring most issues in present day salvation theology, including the Orthodox deification as the culmination of Salvation. DidaskalexIncarnation for Atonement:In the closing chapter of his study, Dr. Finlan writes, \\"Atonement too, was a common category of religious belief. Atonement is not unique in Christianity. It was able to catch on in Christianity because it drew upon a pool of ideas common to the religions of the region... When the incarnation gets attached to old notions of punishment, a collective stain of sin, and God responding to ritual, then the incarnation gets taken over by concepts of atonement.\\" He then concludes,\\"Neither is it only the incarnation the incarnation and Passion of the cross by which this marvelous exchange has been effected, but also by the entire human life of Christ, most especially by the essentially impassible Word's adoption of human Passion.\\"Problems with Atonement:It was Didaskalex, my Amazon Friend, who proposed to me reading Stephen's 'Problems with Atonement', before reviewing his other book on Theosis. Stephen Finlan, who looked for Theosis through participation with the divine, has ultimately uncovered what Atonement by the Loving Lord means in the Apostolic Church of the Fathers, thus joining the company of the great Alexandrine Soteriologists. Ansalm's legal satisfaction concept has been now put in the docks of Theological clarifications and amendments.In reply to Finlan's own exclamation, that calls for support, pp. 81, \\"Is my interpretation overly modernizing and negative about atonement?,\\" I say that yours is a revival of the basic concept of atonement by uniting with God in Jesus Christ, atonement by incarnation.

There are so many negative associations with Pollyanna in the culture, that a person if half afraid to read Eleanor Porter. I thought, her books might be too sentimental, to pollyannaish :) -- But, have you read Pollyanna? Yes, it's sentimental, but it also looks the ugly world in the eye. After reading a handful of Porter's books, I notice a theme of the saintly orphan. Each character has a horrible loss, usually it's parents, and they rise above in an almost superhuman way. The main character of this book, Margaret, is a bit more three dimensional than other Porter characters. The storyline reveals the ugliness of child labor before it was outlawed. Plus, I think Porter is a good writer, there a some quite good poetic passages, and the revelation of plot events is timed with a certain punctuation of rhythm. It's kinda sappy, yes.

I personally lived with the pseudonymous \\"Krishna Brethren\\" as a young teenager during 1970-1975 and personally witnessed some of the events and all of the locales mentioned in the book. The writer's impartial description of the drama was a real eye opener for someone like me who was too young at the time to fully grasp the psychological and political issues that were invoked by the conflict. I do recall how the rival group was demonized by the Krishna Brethren during some of their lectures and Meetings, especially when the JM leader refused to capitulate to the Brethren's demands.

Looking through two of the titles I recognize every recipe I see from earlier books. While Rachael is the nominal author of these books, I fully believe they were assembled by her publisher and a copy editor with maybe a day's input from Miss Rachael for all four books together.This is becoming a common practice among major cookbook authors, with Mark Bittman's re-releasing his 'How to Cook Everything' in three volumes, cumulatively more expensive than the original book.One may for a moment equate these books with the music world's 'Best of' releases, but the experience is simply not the same. A 'Best of' album's tracks are based on a genuine audience vote with their purchases and air play. These recipes are simply Rachael's opinion and that of a few of her colleagues. The parallel also breaks down in the sense that listening to, for example, 'The Who's top twelve hits introduces you to a whole new experience of listening to 'My Generation', 'I'm Free', and 'I Can See for Miles' on the same album.My 3 star rating is not based on the quality of the recipes. It is a warning that these volumes are, in fact, reprints and not new recipes. So, if you already own many or most of Rachael's books already, you may be disappointed if you buy these books.One other consideration if you do NOT own any of Rachael's books is that for not too much more money, you can get 10 times as many recipes in her 'No Repeats' book of almost all new recipes.In every way, this is a better purchase than one or all of these minibook samplers."},{"Title":"Guy Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"Many young men mainly subsist on cold cereal, take-out pizza, and macaroni and cheese meals they make from a box.

Here Spinrad writes of a future threatened by a sexually transmitted disease that started in Africa worked its way through the gay and drug communities and now is at large in the general population. The term &quot;AIDs&quot; is not used at all in the story, only mentioned in the author's afterword. The disease is particularly deadly because as each successful vaccine is found, the virus mutates to a resistant strain almost immediately. Spinrad's story follows 4 characters: A soldier in a military division of the infected (nicknamed The Army of the Living Dead), a fundamentalist Christian politician who heads a new Quarantine Bureau of the government, an infected young girl who tries to bring sexual solace to as many of the infected as she can, and a research scientist looking for the ultimate vaccine. Because the disease requires repeated vaccines to counteract the many mutations, the drug companies don't want this &quot;SuperVaccine&quot; found. Starting with these vastly different characters, Spinrad spins a web of intrigue until the story culminates in the quarantined San Francisco. The story is tense and exciting. All the characters grow, for example, the girl becomes almost a religious icon to the infected. All of this is set in a world where sex is done through machines and various interfaces to protect the quickly diminishing ranks of the uninfected. This is an excellent SF tale with an adult theme and frightening settings."},{"Title":"Journals of the Plague Years","review":"Spinrad is a bit like Michael Moorcock. Whereas Moorcock started his career with fast-paced, closely plotted and high octane fantasies, Spinrad started off with that kind of science fiction, culminating with the tremendously dark and unforgiving classic, The Men in the Jungle. After considerable success with these works, both starting going off various deep ends, becoming more and more literary and varied in style, genre and general weirdness. Both wound up as multi-million seller international icons, with a batch of major awards/nominations between them. In fact \\"Journals\\" was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula as best SF novelette of the year.The story, which would probably run only 50 or 60 pages with a more typical font, consists of very short paragraphs, reminiscent of the John Dos Passos's USA, or John Brunner's Jagged Orbit or Stand on Zanzibar. Each paragraph is told from the viewpoint of one of the main characters, which include a wacked-out Zombie-like soldier, a brilliant geneticist, a beautiful young nymphomaniac, and a religious zealot politician. All are defined in terms of their involvement with a terrible AIDS-like plague that is devastating the entire world. As the story races ahead, all of these characters converge together to a delightfully melodramatic conclusion.There is a great deal of sex and violence, but very little world-building, imagery, symbolism or description. One of the reviewers said the story reads pretty much like an outline. I don't think so: it isn't incomplete or sketchy, just very short and unfrilly. I read the whole thing in an hour, and enjoyed it quite a bit. In tone and execution it was a lot like one of the many Zombie books out now, but pretty much all of the action was instrumental to the plot, and the characters, while certainly not complex, were interesting enough to keep the reader involved."},{"Title":"Journals of the Plague Years","review":"Don't bother tracking this one down... it's a politically correct fantasy about the AIDS epidemic, complete with equal opportunity victims and a melodramatic happy ending. The cure is being hidden from the people, typical politically correct hollywood style ... cliches. Sure, this is a sensitive topic, so sensitive, few would dare do other than to pat Spinrad on the back. The book is intentionally an unrealistic depiction of the disease, a melodramatic fantasy.The novella(?) is also pretty uneven, since it is basically a rough draft. Older Spinrad is better."},{"Title":"Communication and Emotion: Essays in Honor of Dolf Zillmann (Routledge Communication Series)","review":"It's just another textbook that is rather boring.

(Studien zur interkulturellen Philosophie 11) (Studies in Intercultural Philosophy)","review":"Africa exists as the image of the colonial powers who eviscerated and shattered what they found, when and where they found it. But it also only exists as the inverse of this image - a strange hybrid of destruction/creation in the form of derision: the west finds its undoing in the \\"doing to\\" of others.Enough has been \\"done to\\" Africa. But similarly, \\"the West\\" - or at any rate, the tutelage of the Enlightenment - has done enough to itself. The impossibility of African philosophy then, resides not in the negative exclusion of possibility (an African philosophical articulation does exist), but in the articulation of its autonomy.As Praeg puts it, \\"An autonomous African philosophy is not possible - in any sense of the word \\"autonomous\\" that would justify the distinction between African philosophy and any other philosophy\\" where autonomy is conceived as \\"constituting an independent African thought system to be founded on authentic epistemological structures of thought and practices.\\"Such a thought system is properly the realm of the ethnophilosophical \\"desire to represent and give content to the pre-colonial or the pre-political\\" in reaction to colonisation.The book problematizes this uncritical notion of autonomy (and here the reader can construct an interesting possibility for the formation and specifically excessive nature of the State in Africa) as being \\"undecidable\\". That is, such an autonomy can only be constituted, conceived, and legitimated within the context of \\"post-coloniality\\", even though it is \\"post-coloniality\\" itself that enables such an autonomy in the first place, through nationalism.Praeg holds that \\"the continuous and critical re-appropriation of the traditional African past [is] indispensable to African philosophy.\\" As such, he sees no value in attempting to resolve the \\"undecibable\\" aspect of this debate.The \\"re-evaluation\\" of autonomy will be the difference between a Western and an African philosophy. This re-evaluation itself, will be the very active/critical component of African philosophy. This is why Praeg suggests this challenge using the term \\"impossibility\\" - not because the re-evaluation itself is an impossible task, but because it is the re-evaluation itself, which can never be anything but a continuous activity.To put this another way, and to address the fundamental problem of nationalism as the short-circuit of such a critical re-evaluation (in both thinking and in politics), one can say that nationalism is blind to this double thought (that is, the thinker's thinking is not independent of, or neutral towards, the \\"thought about,\\") required for true autonomy and instead achieves an \\"illegitimate\\" (or simulated) autonomy through violent sacrifice of the \\"other\\".Africa today - the \\"post-colonial con-text\\" as Praeg puts it - is articulated by a rhetoric of emancipation, an emancipatory narrative - the \\"disfigurement\\" of Africa and its thinking about itself.\\"...the rhetoric and assumptions [underpinning narratives of] \\"repressed knowledge\\" and \\"the need to liberate knowledge\\" are not the condition of possibility of \\"talk about Africa\\". Rather, it is a \\"thinking against the self that constitutes the subject of African philosophy\\" that needs to be \\"incorporated as an historical necessity\\" into philosophy.And so to the new type of philosopher required for Africa. No longer the pro-State happy diplomat exporting African philosophy to a \\"United Philosophical Nations\\" which would function \\"both as regulative ideal and source of legitimating\\" but one whose \\"responsibility before thought consists ... in detecting differends and in finding the (impossible) idiom for phrasing them\\" instead of collapsing them into litigations \\"for the sake of political hegemony\\".Disfigurement - the non-alignment of meaning to things, things to meanings, and language to itself, things and meanings - is productive insofar as it enables the formulation of untimely questions.And so the call for the ethical re-evaluation of autonomy.African philosophy's embrace of its own impossibility as an autonomous body of knowledge based upon a very specific notion of individualism and epistemology (both of which become undone), and the incorporation of an ethical awareness of the presence of the other will be the new (state of) autonomy.In order to kick-start an embrace of impossibility, Praeg shoots African philosophy like an arrow into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), not to kill it (we're talking philosophy here, nothing but philosophy) but to read it (heuristically) as a (new) social contract. The arrow is the new quest for the autonomy of an African philosophy concerned with constructing differends (their conditions of possibility) through phraseologically impossible idioms: philosophy in action.A differend is \\"a damage accompanied by the loss of the means to prove the damage.\\" It is an idea borrowed from Jean-Francois Lyotard. This \\"case of conflict, between (at least) two parties, that cannot be equitably resolved for lack of rule of judgement applicable to both arguments\\" is an attempt to limit the damage - the disfigurement - transcendental conceptions of justice inflicted on those who have suffered a wrong.The TRC then is viewed as a social contract, one that privileges the properly \\"African\\" ethical imperative of telling stories - \\"because their telling will re-enact the social, bond which in turn is good because it constitutes an act of love\\" - thereby leaving behind the temptation to \\"resolve\\" that which is seemingly unresovable.Such public grieving (receiving as it does/did the racist slur of being a circus or exhibition) is antithetical to the \\"western\\" interiorised experience of subjectivity, and short-circuits anxieties such as the commodification of suffering.Narrating the nation in this way reconciles the \\"traditional value of ubuntu\\" (I am because we are) with the Christian \\"koinonia\\" (the function of confession as enabling forgiveness and allowing reconciliation with the community) and enables this reconciliation through a limited, or highly provisional, nationalism.The value of a work such as Praeg's is in its insistence on bracketing the production of meaning until such time as its constitutive conditions have become transparent to a sufficient degree to neutralise or at least \\"bracket\\" their clamorous insistency.And to ask untimely questions, or, to ask for the impossible, brackets the short-circuit of philosophy and politics into a murderous Nationalism or Statist philosophy, opening a space within us, rather than between us."},{"Title":"Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: Wwii Pacific Theater","review":"This is my favorite Combat Flight Sim.

They are not as clear as one would like and in many cases, you can not see the details that the author is trying to point out. I expect that this is a limitation of the size of the graphic and the printing process. Regardless, the text is understandable enough to guide you through the steps that will lead you to a solution. The graphics displayed when the software is run are exceptionally clear and crisp so you can bounce back and forth between the book and the software and see exactly what the author was trying to explain.I found the book to be a great reference guide to the software.

I recommend it highly. I have some experience with CFS2 and have studied the tactics and plane specs closely. I found CFS2: WWII Pacific Theater very informative. The author is a pilot and obviously has a great deal of knowledge and insight on the tactics he describes. I only wish chapter 7, Combat Maneuvers and Aerobatics, had more depth. Chapter 5, Takeoffs, Landings and Advanced Flying goes into great depth including several demonstrations of concepts that you can fly through. If the same depth had been given to the Combat Maneuvers chapter the book would have been unbelievable. As it stands the Overhead Attack and High Side Attack merit only one short paragraph. I find these two maneuvers of particular usefulness and the lack of analysis is a letdown.Another area where the book is somewhat a letdown is in \\"tweaking\\" CFS2. The book flatly states you can not fly AI aircraft. This simply is not true - you only have to make a minor modification to add these wonderful aircraft to your inventory. Still the author devotes a good deal of attention to these aircraft and if you choose to fly them you will find good advice in the book. I just wish the author had devoted some time to the tweaks in CFS2.If you play CFS2 you simply must have this book.

Just about everything, even religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism which pre-date Christianity, are compared extensively to the Christian faith. The trouble in this is, as any student of subaltern groups knows, that the reader cannot develop an organic understanding of a religion, but rather can only see religions as measured by the yardstick of Christianity.For example, the section on Buddhism is broken down into the following categories: History, Teachings, God, Sin, Salvation & the Future, Morality, and Conclusion. In every section except for History and Conclusion, Buddhism is compared to Christianity, even though Buddhism predates Jesus by hundreds of years. The authors do not even attempt to hide such bias, openly declaring that they will portray Buddhism only through Christian lenses on page 42.The section on Christianity itself is almost laughable. The masturbatory, emotive waxing on the noble history of Christianity (and its inherent correctness!) in the conclusion is hilariously sad. \\"Yet despite persecution, moral laxity, heresies challenging it both from within and without, the church of Jesus Christ prevails... It has experienced dark moments, but even as the darkness of the first Good Friday gave way to the brightness and splendor of the resurrection and the empty tomb, so too has the church experienced a glorious history with a future that will be brighter still when Jesus and the church - that is, when the bridegroom and the bride - unite forever.\\" (Page 72)If you want a comprehensive list of religions, cults, and sects, this will do - but if you want to understand them and see them from a relatively neutral viewpoint, go elsewhere.P.S. Zoroastrianism doesn't have its own encyclopedic entry. Hello!? The People's Temple (the organization/cult of Jim \\"Purple Kool-Aid\\" Jones) which had perhaps 1000 members at its height gets its own section, but not a religion which heavily informed both Christianity and Islam and which still boasts 200,000 members world-wide today."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Cults, Sects, Religions and the Occult","review":"Most of us buy books to educate ourselves and NOBODY wants to spend time researching false facts that only make us grow more ignorant and misinformed. Yet that is exactly what this so-called dictionary attempts to do; promote ignorance and slanderous lies (when it's not simply providing partial truths).The authors clearly did NOT research the occult or much about the other religious groups they write about. Not only do they repeatedly credit Satanism for beliefs completely unrelated to that Sect, but they mutilate any respectable definition of the peace sign -- calling it the \\"Satanists Pentacle\\" (when penta is the prefix meaning \\"five\\" and there are no five points inside a peace sign).Regarding the Wiccan Rede -- the authors erroneously attribute it to Aleister Crowley who had NOTHING to do with either Wicca or with the Rede, as an ethical principle that's regularly drummed around many neo-pagan circles. Many would argue Crowley had nothing to do with ethics at all. In fact, he purported \\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole law\\" (feel like having sex with your neighbor's infant? Do it!) while the Wiccan Rede states \\"An it harm none, do what ye will.\\" The authors also falsely claim that Satanists follow the Rede, when they are not at all compelled by Wiccan dogma, but (according to the Satanist Bible) follow their own rules to do whatever's the OPPOSITE of Christianity.The two examples, provided above, are but the tip of the iceberg for how inaccurate is this dictionary.

Having complied with such a demand, would the Latter-day Saints find themselves in total agreement with Protestants or with Catholics? Would they believe in apostolic succession or in the priesthood of all believers? Would they recognize an archbishop, a patriarch, a pope, a monarch, or no one at all as the head of Christ's church on earth? Would they be saved by grace alone, or would they find the sacraments of the church necessary for salvation? Would they believe in free will or in predestination? Would they practice water baptism? If so, would it be by immersion, sprinkling, or some other method? Would they believe in a substitutionary, representative, or exemplary atonement? Would they or would they not believe in &quot;original sin&quot;? And on and on.It is unreasonable for other Christians to demand that Latter-day Saints conform to a single standard of &quot;Christian&quot; doctrine when they do not agree among themselves upon exactly what that standard is. To do so is to establish a double standard; doctrinal diversity is tolerated in some churches, but not in others. The often-heard claim that all true Christians share a common core of necessary Christian doctrine rests on the dubious proposition that all present differences between Christian denominations are over purely secondary or even trivial matters-matters not central to Christian faith.

There is an excellent selection of case studies, many of them of fairly recent vintage. There are great discussions of theoretical concepts including models of social involvement (from the likes of Friedman, Goodpaster, and Rivoli) and \\"groupthink.\\"The book falls short in the otherwise promising subtitle: A Judeo-Christian Approach to Business Ethics. Rae and Wong present a variety of different ethical approachs and find merit in nearly all of them. For instance, ethical egoism is found to be consistent with a Christian world view because, after all, each of us must be concerned with the future of our own soul. What we seem to get is a generally eclectic view of ethics. In the end, the authors give the greatest weight to virtue ethics. However, it is highly debateable whether this view properly characterizes the \\"Judeo-Christian approach.\\" While concern for one's soul, virtues, etc., certainly are part of the Christian life, many Christian ethicists might characterize the overall approach in terms of a modified divine command theory. In any case, after laying out all these approaches, and picking their favorite, the authors fail to apply virtue ethics with any regularity to their subsequent commentaries and discussions.In my class, students much preferred the other textbook we used: Richard C. Chewning, et al's \\"Business Through the Eyes of Faith.\\" This is a very different kind of book from \\"Beyond Integrity,\\" but it seemed to speak directly to the students' personal situations. We might have been better off using a standard secular text on ethics, together with Chewning et al. However, \\"Beyond Integrity\\" is the book to use if you must have a top-flight business text with a Christian point of view.Few doubt that we need to raise the level of honesty and integrity in the workplace. Given that most Americans proclaim a belief in God, and at least pay lip service to the Bible and Christianity, it makes sense that we should be calling on our employers and employees to \\"walk the talk.\\" Arguably, a properly practiced Judeo-Christian ethic can provide the resources to build a better business environment."},{"Title":"Beyond Integrity: A Judeo-Christian Approach to Business Ethics","review":"I had to read this book for my Business Ethics class and the stories are a good length and definitely makes you think!

His name along with that of Joeseph D' Apollito is among the most recognized.In Loudspeaker Recipes he sets about incorporating proven design techniques from his own Loudspeaker Design Cookbook to come up with practical application in a series of two way (woofer-tweeter) designs.The designs are all good (hey, what else do you expect from Vance Dickason?) but the passage of time means that not a few of the drivers chosen for these projects have either been modified by their makers or discontinued. If you are looking for a practical kind of guide, this is still a great book. Just don't expect to build exact copies of the designs you find here. Be sure to grab a copy of the 6th edition of his Loudspeaker Design Cookbook. That one is money well spent."},{"Title":"Graph Connections: Relationships between Graph Theory and Other Areas of Mathematics (Oxford Lecture Series in Mathematics and Its Applications, 5)","review":"Wilson and Beineke have compiled a wonderful volume. Each chapter outlines a topic or area in mathematics and its relation to graph theory. Number Theory, Codes, Groups, Geometry, Topology, Computing, Artificial Neural Networks, Probability & Statistics, Knots, and more are treated. There is even a section on International Finance (exchange of currencies). Wilson provides a good introduction; a brief survey of the basic concepts and definitions of graph theory. (For more detail, Wilson has a couple of other well-written introductory graph theory texts).The chapters are well-written, although the styles can be different as each has a different author. Proofs are omitted, for the most part, and most chapters do not assume a great deal of background knowledge, but the book does get into some deep mathematics, including current areas of research.I highly recommend this book for inclusion in undergraduate mathematics library collections or for anyone interested in graph theory and possibly doing research in the area."},{"Title":"The Other Woman in Your Marriage: Understanding a Mother's Impact on Her Son & How It Affects His Marriage","review":"I bought this book to learn more about my husband and understanding his relationship with his mom.

Yes, there were birds I saw more than once that weren't in the guide, but that's to be expected, considering the ground the guide covers and the size (and excellence) of its illustrations. Not only is the book a field guide to identification, it's full of readable, informative essays on the country's ecosystems and the fauna to be found there. They ain't Sibley, but then, Sibley doesn't cover capybaras.I've used both the Ecuador and Peru editions of this book, and recommend them highly to anyone with even a passing interest in bird spotting and wildlife watching. My only slight gripe is that the heavyweight glossy stock is great for durability, but the weight of the thing, along with binocs, water, and incidentals, made for a semi-burdensome daypack while hiking in the thin mountain air. And oh, yeah, it really could use more on insects.As was the case with other reviewers, our guide in Tambopata - who hadn't seen the book before - immediately wanted to know where he could get a copy.

The main strength of these guides is their relatively low price. Illustrated field guides for exotic destinations can easily cost over $60. These guides, by comparison, are a steal at just under $20. The main weakness is that they are not comprehensive. They provide information and illustrations for common birds, reptiles, mammals, and insects, but not for exotic species. Hence, serious birdwatchers will also need to purchase James F. Clements and Noam Shany's \\"A Field Guide to the Birds of Peru.\\"In every other sense, however, the Pearson guide is marvelous. The introductory chapters on Peru's ecotourism business, its geography and habitats, parks and reserves, and ecology and natural history are extremely well-written and highly informative. The second half of book is a field guide with pictures on one page and descriptions on the adjacent page. The descriptions are brief and to the point. They also contain symbols for the habitat types each species prefers. For common bird identification, I found this guide to be much easier to use in the field than the Clements and Shany guide, which provides pictures in one part of the book and descriptions in another. This book worked well as a companion to Clements and Shany because it enabled me to focus on common birds first and if I could not find my bird in the Pearson list, I then cracked open the Clements and Shany guide.In addition to the Peru guide, Interlink Books also publishes \\"Traveller's Wildlife Guides\\" for Australia, Costa Rica, Belize and Northern Guatemala, Brazil, and Ecuador and the Galapagos."},{"Title":"Peru: The Ecotravellers' Wildlife Guide (A Volume in the Ecotravellers' Wildlife Guides Series)","review":"I purchased this book to take with me to the Manu Reserve in Peru.

The illustrations and narratives are well done.I wish the section on snakes was larger and the guide just touched on plant life.My biggest wish is that the insect section would be expanded. There are 1,000 kinds of butterfly in Manu alone, yet the guide hardly touched the subject.An all inclusive guide to all the plants, insects and wildlife would be far from portable, so if you are looking for a travel guide this does its job nicely.

Other than that it is one of the best series I have ever read"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Upon initial reading I also considered Lord of Chaos to be the most worthless book in the entire Wheel of Time series. No hyperbole, I thought it the worst. A few years later I returned to the book to reconsider it, mostly because there is one event in this book that impacts every book hereafter.That event is the battle at Dumai's Wells.Dumai's Wells is the largest battle in the World of Robert Jordan since the Aiel War approximately 20 years earlier. It is a focus point for Perrin and his conflict over the half moon axe he carries at his side. It is the first battle in which Aiel Wise Women fight against other Aiel. It is a crucial point in Rand's character development. His distrust of all Aes Sedai now that Moiraine has disappeared is forged and founded here.This book, once my least favorite, has become one of my favorites.

However, it's not too late to turn back. Life is to short to read bad books."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I must say I'm somewhat disturbed by all these comments I've been reading insinuating that Jordan's female characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts displaying his deep, deep hatred/fear of women. Rather, the females in WOT are incredibly rich, detailed, and unique characters each with their own distinct flavor as only Jordan can write it. I thought the following guide might help enlighten those of you who think otherwise. I've created several female character types to help us understand the genius that is Robert Jordan when it comes to character development. Enjoy.Type #1: The experienced veteran.General description: this female has been around the block, so to speak. She's seen it all and won't take any crap from the noobies. Generally having a high opinion of herself, she is pretty much always right - to the Pit of Doom with anyone else's opinion. You don't want to cross this shrieking harridan. She doesn't hesitate to resort to unjustified violence when things don't go her way, and it's generally the fault of the nearest male character.Common characteristics: snooty, arrogant, insecure despite her experience, hates most men (or at least thinks they're equivalent to chimps), self righteous, whiny, and generally intolerable. Often described as \\"handsome or beautiful, with an impressive bosom\\".Examples: Moraine, Siuan, Nyneave (first few books), any Sea Folk, any Kin woman, any Wise One, any Maiden of the Spear, any Aes Sedai having the shawl for more than 5 seconds, any innkeeper, any wife... hmmm... that pretty much covers 95% of the female characters. I may have to rethink my thesis statement here. But moving on...Type #2: The determined rookieGeneral description: She may be inexperienced, but watch out! This female is determined to succeed! Except when confronted by any kind of difficulty. Then she'll retreat into her insecurity and plan her passive aggressive assault on the offending character for the next 5 books while fretting over more important things like what dress to wear, how to brush her hair, and how much she hates men. Generally can be heard muttering about \\"decent clothing\\", she'll take any opportunity to dress/act like a prostitute that she can.Common characteristics: snooty, arrogant, extremely insecure, regards men as babbling retard gorillas (or \\"woolheads\\") self righteous, whiny, selfish, cowardly, violent, and the most intolerable of any character type. Almost always beautiful with a \\"memorable bosom\\", or showing \\"considerable cleavage\\".Examples: FAILE! Also Elayne, Egwene, Min, Aviendha, Nyneave, Birgitte, and other ridiculously annoying main characters.Type #3: The VulcanGeneral description: thinks completely logically. Tries to ignore emotion. Uses the term \\"that's illogical\\" more than Spock. Because many people like this really exist, obviously.Common characteristics: snooty, arrogant, dislikes men as a general rule, self righteous, subtly annoying, impossible to distinguish from any other character in this category. Usually \\"coldly beautiful, with a large bosom\\".Examples: The entire White Ajah. Seriously, they're all exactly the same character.Type #4: The CastratorGeneral description: this type might seem somewhat redundant, but the Castrator takes it to a whole new level. Of questionable sexuality, the Castrator is basically a violent man-killing machine looking for any excuse to be annoying and spiteful in their quest to castrate the entire male population. No one like the Castrator, even others of the same category. Fortunately, there aren't too many of them, and their blind rage often gets them into sticky situations.Common characteristics: snooty, arrogant, despises men (as well as most women, puppies, food, water, and air), self righteous, cowardly, in-your-face annoying. The least beautiful of the female category, they still possess large bosoms, and are often described as \\"bosomy\\" or find themselves in situations with \\"heaving bosoms\\". Man, Jordan really likes him some boobies.Examples: The entire Red Ajah. Once again, they are fricken identical. Notably Elaida, but Galina runs a close second in terms of annoyance.Well, looking at my list, I guess maybe some of you were right. They do seem pretty similar. Now don't get me wrong, I actually liked Lord of Chaos. The battle scene at the end is one of the best in the entire series hands down. However, I feel it is in this book that the females really start to become intolerable - especially Faile. God I hate her. So for those of you who have yet to continue in this WOT series, expect every single female character to become 10x as whiny, annoying, insecure, and all around miserable and hateful as the books progress. If you take my advice, by the time you get to Winter's Heart and Crossroads, just skip right over any chapter featuring Elayne. Seriously. She needs to die."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Okay, before all you hard-core Jordan fans beat me blind for daring to give it less than a four star review, or for all those who are disgusted with the series thus far, let me explain. No, I am no blinded by my love for the series; no, I am not angry at having to trudge through a thousand pages all these books. I don't care. I love this series, and I am dreading the day that the final book comes out, and am rooting along with everybody else for Jordan to decide that he actually will write fifteen books instead of twelve (and maybe even more.) I love longer books, and I love detail. Also, I want to point out that Jordan isn't on the same plane of detail as Tolkien was. Tolkien described scenery; Jordan describes actions. That's a bonus on my clock, because I like actions more than scenery. This book was amazing, and shame on the people who said that nothing happened.So why am I giving it three stars? Because Jordan should have either made this book five hundred pages or two thousand, and I'm beginning to see a pattern here. In the beginning of the series, Jordan took painstaking time to write battle scenes and war scenes. And they were breathtaking, even for me, who prefers characters over war any time. He knew what he was talking about, since he was actually schooled on warfare. Starting with the Fires of Heaven, he's focusing too much attention on the women, who aren't doing anything. Their chapters would better off be blended into one large mother-chapter. If Jordan included half the stuff that goes on in Lord of Chaos, then it would be two thousand pages, and I would prefer ten thousand pages if it included those missing events.Jordan writes the afternoon-tea well, I'll give him that. I'm not saying they suck. But when that's the majority of what we're getting, it starts to become a problem for me. Random arguments between husband-and-wife, petty insults between women, are just not Jordan's forte; or not nearly as well as he does battle, as he proved to me when he wrote the last chapter. Those events let you see more of the character's personalities, of course, because of how they react to the situation. But the situation itself is what makes it all useless, irrelevant filler. They could have been nice laughs if they were tossed in here and there, but Jordan is starting to give details on things that he shouldn't be going into so much detail on, and summarizing things that deserve a long and decent chapter.Less time is being devoted to the Last Battle, and more time is being given to the personal issues that are dragged on far too long (Faile's argument with Perrin goes on for chapters on end). Jordan takes a particular interest in describing the problems the characters are having with love, but as he does with all other personal situations, the situation itself is ridiculous. Where did Lan and Nynaeve's love come from? I still haven't figured that out. What happened with Egwene was the final straw for me; no time is spent to the actual falling in love; it's always love at first sight. Jordan has lost about ninety percent of the urgency that was shown in the first three books. The characters are dawdling, loitering, and mingling with other characters. They aren't doing anything. And when they are, in order to complete it, they need to do more dawdling, loitering, and mingling (the siege at Tar Valon, the Bowl of the Winds...)I would recommend this book, because all in all it's a good read. It's just not the best of Jordan's capabilities, skirting the important issues, and tracing the unimportant. I don't know whether Harriet is editing too much out, or if Jordan is just neglecting to write more, but either way, he's chopping off far too much things that are happening in his books, and I'm hoping that maybe he's going to start collecting those fallen pieces and continue on his streak of breathtaking battle scenes."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"\\"Kneel, or you will be knelt.\\"Has there been a more powerful or significant sentence in this series? The seeds of mistrust have been sown in Rand, and we have to wonder if the 'Chaos' in the book's title refers to the events that mistrust engenders, or the maelstrom in the Dragon Reborn's mind. Before that moment, we have rooted for Rand, empathized with him... But now we are more aware than ever of the power he wields, and the delicate balance he struggles to maintain between sanity and insanity.LOC is RJ greatest accomplishment to date, a complex, involving book with a dizzying number of subplots, plot twists, and powerful scenes. Take Egwene's character: she admits things and meets her toh with an Aiel's courage, then uses the world of dreams to get to Salidar, then find out someone wants her for something, then begins to manipulate them with a skill that would make Moiraine proud. Now consider that Egwene was basically a MINOR character in this book, and you can see how detailed LOC really is. RJ stuffs a lot into 700 pages (hardcover) and none of it seems extraneous or indulgent.PLOTTING: So many things happen to advance the main plot that I have to wonder how RJ keeps track of it all. Does he have a big blackboard at home where he diagrams the whole thing, or what? LOC has enough plot threads to weave a sweater with, and he manages to cover everybody important. The opening prologue is an excellent example of RJ getting us up to speed on what minor and major characters are doing, and he does the same thing in the epilogue, too.CHARACTERIZATION: We thought Rand was a hard man before, but after Dumai's Wells...Wow. Talk about your earth-shaking psychological impact. We also see Egwene settling into her role as a forceful, crafty leader, and Perrin as the reluctant hero, while Mat unwittingly becomes a father figure to young Olver.PACING: Despite juggling so many plot threads, RJ never slows the pace, using alternate threads to create an ebb and flow effect. For example, right Rand gets kidnapped, RJ jumps to Ebou Dar to heighten the suspense of the former thread.BEST SCENE: It has to be Dumai's Wells. No scene in the series has been more powerful, or more unforgettable. I can still see the Asha'man exploding the Shaido to bits in my mind. (Try getting that by TV censors!)MOST POV: This is a tough call. It's probably Rand, but I'd have to count chapters to be sure, because Egwene, Min, Elayne, Mat and Perrin all get a lot of attention. Then there's all the minor characters, from Pedron Niall and Morgase to Sammael and Graendal, who get paragraphs and chapters.OVERALL: For better or worse, LOC is the book that all future volumes will be compared with, and I know that sounds unfair, but...Let me put it this way - I just finished reading it, and I could read it again right away. That's how much I loved reading LOC.Sorry for my rambling on, and making the review so long. Hope it helps!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In general, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series has been sharply criticised in two ways. 1. There are so many plotlines, and the characters sit around and talk so much, that nothing happens. 2. Male-female conflict, which is apparently the main theme of the books, occasionally supercedes any rules of logic and common sense. Fortunately for this, the 6th book in the series, the latter is severely muted. Unfortunately, the former is in full flower.First, the good points. Even up to 500 pages in (out of 1000), I was enjoying this book more than the previous four in the series. It occurred to me that most of the plot-related sources of irritation in the series involve the romantic couples. In this volume, Nynaeve is separated from Lan, Aviendha is often separated from Rand (as is Elayne), and the much-maligned Faile only arrives somewhere aroung p. 700 (but after that is as annoying as ever). This gave the narrative a surprising spring, where new conflicts could arise (especially through the split in the Aes Sedai, which occurred in the previous book). Overall, I found this volume much less repetative than the norm, and with an overall better reading flow.Unfortunately, by the time p. 800 rolled around I was too exasperated to enjoy the smoother prose. I am willing to give an author a lot of leeway if I think the buildup is leading somewhere. And I understand that it takes time to re-connect with the large and varied cast (the prologue is something like 60 pages in and of itself!). I even understand the repetition of traits (Nynaeve's hair-pulling, Mat's gambling, Leanne's flirtations), to help the reader keep track of the enormous cast. However, it was clear that nothing was really going to happen in the book by the time p. 800 arrived. For example, the first half of the book seems to be leading up to a confrontation between Rand and one of the surviving Forsaken (Sammael). However, the author seems to totally forget that plotline in the second half of the book, filling it up with treacle about Faile getting jealous of another woman, Elayne and Nynaeve running around trying to find an artifact (and never finding it!), etc. That's not to say that no important events occur - I will not reveal them because they are rays of sunshine in the gloom of tedium - but they are short and the only battle in the book basically starts on p. 960. Or, put another way, 5% of the book is action, the other 95% is filler. And Sammael is STILL around to be dealt with in Book 7.There are other, more insidious problems with the book, ones that I mention because I think they are manipulative on the part of the author. The most obvious is the disappearance of Asmodeon at the end of Book 5, which is the cliffhanger of the book. Why kill him off in such an abrupt and mysterious fashion, but then never solve the crime? What's worse, Rand never seems to notice that Asmodeon is gone. Surely if your teacher in the One Power abruptly disappears, the student would be very concerned, especially if they were a turncoat enemy, as Asmodeon was. Another irritation is the ongoing battle between the sexes. I'm sure lots of people regard the the opposite sex as the enemy - to be conquered and ruled over whenever possible. However, it appears that every single male-female relationship in the entire world of Jordan's is poisoned by this anti-social attitude, especially after 5000 pages (counting all 6 volumes) and counting.Of course, anything I say in this review is not going to change the mind of someone planning to buy the 6th book in a 12-book series. In spite of it all, when these books are at their best (i.e. the last 100 pages), they are fantastic. Unfortunately, the price you pay is often 800 pages of filler."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"while this book is still good, it pales in comparison to the earlier books in the series. Too often Jordan draws out scenes that are useless, or he could do without. I found it almost unbearable to read at certain points because of boredom. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its good points, it does. But another complaint I have (about the series in whole, and particularly at the end of this book) is that Jordan seems afraid to take risks. The series is becoming very predictable, i wont reveal what happens at the end of the book, but it had potential to really shake up the plot and Jordan abandoned it very quickly. It seems that the main characters are invincible (save one certain woman back in book 5). In all, the book is decent. If you've been reading the series then you are undoubtably going to read this installment, but be warned that it in no way can compare to the greatness of The Eye of the World, and The Great Hunt. recommended"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When I put my nose into the first book of this series I could hardly take it out again short of someone snatching &quot;my precious pages&quot; from my hands. The same goes for the second and third books. But sadly, in the forth through sixth, there seem to be twice as many pages, half as many things happening. I would not go as far as to say the latter books have been boring. Far from it. But my nose doesn't seem to sick to the pages quite as much as it used to. I would call any who drop the series for a decrease in action a fool. Well maybe not a fool, people like and dislike whatever they want, but something has to be wrong with them. I truthfully really, really like these books. This book, and all the others. There is no place to start but the beginning. And if your tastes carry you off to someplace else by the end of the forth book, so be it, i'd bet you had fun with the first three. All coming together, I should have given the review 5 stars; There are only four because I thought the first three books were a star better.Hmm, not very helpful to someone actually wanting to know what this book is like... Oh well, anyone looking at this review must have read the books before this. (Why anyone would want to start a series in the middle of it is beyond me.) And by using the others it shouldn't be hard to figure out what this one is like."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lord of Chaos was an excellent continuation to the WOT series--exciting and entertaining--but if I have to read someone described as &quot;plump&quot; one more time, I might throw the book out of the window. It made me laugh to read other reviews in which people pointed out the things that I had noticed: his fixation with the word 'breasts', how horribly rude Nynaeve is without any reedeming qualities to her, and the strange relationship between men and women in Jordan's books. I'll keep on reading, of course. It's a nice way to pass the time."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I have read some of your other reviews and as far as I am concerned, they need to come to terms with the fact they are not quite right in the head. This book was a masterpiece and a rare one at that. R.J has a multitude of small plots that have thier ends netly tied up in this book, more so than in any other. I have not yet read the 7th book, but I bought it. And even if that book is the worst book ever written I will continue to read the series until it is complete. I also suggest for those fantasy lovers to read Tamora Pierce, Piers Anthony and Garth Nix. They are just as good as the Wheel of Time if a little less complicated and a little more humorous."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Three fantastic novels in a row, this is very special! Lord of Chaos is my personal favorite in the series so far (I've read through Path of Daggers)! In this book, Rand becomes a SERIOUS force to be reckoned with politically due to his Black Tower and his budding domination over the Aes Sedai!Sure, Rand's a blabbering paranoid freak, but he's still got enough wits to hold his growing empire together. Perrin returns to prominence. The three lads from Emond's Field seem to no longer be the best of friends, their lives have separated to a great degree. The Aes Sedai who fled the White Tower upon Elaida's ascendancy are regrouping in Salidar and plotting a return to power.This book is very long, but the first 75% is basically a build-up to the last 25%. This last couple hundred pages of the book is where Jordan delivers some of the best fantasy action I've ever read, masterfully tying together a couple threads into a brilliant culmination of events that leaves the reader gaping in awe. The ending is pretty sudden and although only a few Aes Sedai are sworn to him, the precedent is set and there is a sense of overwhelming (though bloody) victory.Most of the concepts in this book won't make sense unless the reader has completed the previous novels. The first three books are great, but to me books 4-6 are the best. Just read them ALL! Unfortunately, the pace set in this book is dramatically altered (for the worse) in the next two books."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Despues de los problemas que hemos soportado en Espa&ntilde;a para poder leer la serie, ver como un autor frena el relato para contar lo que sucede alrededor del heroe consigue que sigas pendiente no s&oacute;lo de la historia central sino que siempre esperas noticias de los dem&aacute;s"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"i really enjoyed this book except for one thing. those weak, soppy, romance covers have got to go. i envision rand and mat and perrin to look somewhat dark and intruiging, and instead the cover portrays a 'i can't believe it's not butter', hair flowing in the wind, shirt half buttoned to reveal hairy chest, day time soap opera star. i would prefer a plain black cover over these cheesy illustrations. (also, what's up with the cover on the great hunt? are those creatures sneaking up on loial and the others supposed to be trollocs? did the artist even read the book? these are supposed to be scary creatures, not some humans clad in armor. wack.)overall, the series is great. i've been buying the hardback versions of the books and i end up throwing the book jackets away because i hate to begin a story with a disapointing illustration."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The reason that I first picked up the first book of the Wheel of Time series, was that I was waiting for Temple of Winds to come out. I have grown to trust Tor Fantasy as a decent source of reading, and I had heard good things about Jordan's work, most of all the Wheel of Time series. To tell the truth, Eye of the World was not a very interesting read. The world that Jordan did display was impressive, though. I finished the next 5 books rather quickly, and I believe that Lord of Chaos is one of the better reads. The institution of the Black Tower was my personal favorite, and I must say that I am looking forward to Crown of Swords. The complaints that Jordan's stories are drawn out are justified. I agree that most of these books could be about 200 pages shorter, but the world of the Wheel of Time, is definitely worth the extra pages. Overall, a very interesting read, worthy of the cost of this series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the 6th book in the Wheel of Time series, Lord of Chaos, and several months have passed since the end of 5th book, The Fires of Heaven and it is now nearing winter or what should be winter but the land is going through an unnatural heat wave (in which many characters suspect is the Dark One's doing). Almost 2 years have passed since The Eye of the World.The Lord of Chaos can be slow-going, there isn't much action (not until the very end), but there is a lot going on with the various characters. Rand gets the most page time in this book, as well as Egwene, with portions told from Nynaeve & Elayne's viewpoint, as well as more page time devoted to some of the Forsaken. Mat and Perrin are given some chapters devoted to them, but not much.At the end of The Fires of Heaven, Rand has conquered two nations, Nynaeve has captured one of the Forsaken, Moghedien and both Nynaeve & Elayne have found the gathering place of the rebel Aes Sedai, and Moiraine perished with one of the Forsaken Lanfear (or did she?).In Lord of Chaos, Rand divides his time between the 2 nations he conquered and dealing with the politics that come with it, Nynaeve & Elayne make strides in the One Power and discover an object that could alleviate the weather problems facing the world and head off to Ebou Dar to find it, Egwene is summoned to Salidar, where the rebel Aes Sedai are gathered, and Mat now is commander and general of a unit of soldiers called the Band of the Red Hand.Throughout the previous book, Rand had glimpses of a past life and memories of a man more than 3,000 years dead, a man that was called Lews Therin, the Dragon. In Lord of Chaos, this manifests as a \\"voice\\" inside Rand's head and he struggles with his approaching insanity that comes with wielding saidin, the tainted half of the True Source. Of course, Rand believes this voice is a separate person from himself, but well there are all sorts of theories out there on Rand's sanity. IMO, it is a symptom of touching and wielding tainted saidin.I feel Lord of Chaos is a turning point for Rand in how he will view all female Aes Sedai from now and into the later books. Rand has never been very trusting of Aes Sedai, but after an event that occurs in this book toward the end, any inkling of trust he may have had has disappeared. In fact, I think he has more hatred and contempt for the Aes Sedai in this book than he has had in previous books. To counter the female channelers, he forms a school devoted to gathering and training male channelers. A false Dragon named Mazrim Taim is given the task of over-seeing the school, and Rand distrusts him immensely (there are also theories on Taim as well, but that is a discussion for later books).Egwene continues to become more Aes Sedai and I think this character also reaches an important turning point here. She becomes something \\"more\\" in this book, and you get a glimpse of Egwene in transition, but you can be sure in the later books she becomes more confident of herself and her position. Besides Rand, Mat, and Perrin I think she is the next most significant character in the series.Even more so than the previous book, you get more page time devoted to some of the other Forsaken we haven't seen as much, such as Sammael and Graendal. You also learn that 2 Forsaken previously thought dead have been given new life by the Dark One, and no one knows they are alive, not even the other Forsaken as they have been given new bodies. I found it very interesting to read the schemes and intrigues each Forsaken used against the other. Although they all are loosely allied, in that they are all against Rand, they continue to plot against each other because there will be only one that will stand below the Dark One when he breaks free from his prison. And all the remaining Forsaken want the job.Anyways, from reading the various viewpoints of the Forsaken, it was obvious they were getting conflicting orders from the Dark One on what their orders were in the world in combatting Rand and his allies, and you as the reader are privy to it all. The Dark One enjoys pitting his underlings against the other, and so it made sense in a way they'd squabble, but yet were still able to fulfill their orders. You see more of the work of the Dark One's hand in affairs of the world in creating the chaos (title of the book, Lord of Chaos, some believe the title refers to Rand, others to the chaos the Dark One creates) that is supposed to keep the forces of Light divided so as not to present a unified front of strength to oppose him in the Last Battle. Basically, he's trying to make it as difficult as possible for Rand to gather the people of the world together. So he gets his agents, the Forsaken and other strategically placed Darkfriends to counter Rand.Like I said before, this book has a lot of events occurring and can be slow-moving, and I have only mentioned a small portion of the whole of this book.LOL. I still enjoyed this book despite the slow pace. If you've reached this far, you still have a long way to go. The next book after this one is A Crown of Swords."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Surprise of surprises, the 6th book of the seemingly never ending Wheel of Time series is not nearly as ridiculous as the previous two. While a bit wordy, and ultimately anti-climatic considering the buildup, this book does a better job keeping the narrative moving, while not making the same mistakes he made in the previous two.As I said above, this is the 6th book in the Wheel of Time series. If you are reading this review, I can assume you recently finished the fifth book and are seriously considering giving up. Well, six is better than five, for what that's worth. Overall, it does little to move the story in a direction I would call forward; lateral might be a better description. Considering the nearly 1000 pages of text, this is a considerable feat. Still, the lateral movement does enough to keep you interested in the characters. If you are wavering, it might be worth the investment, since you've read 5 books already.The good? To start, the book is well written. I don't think Jordan lacks the ability to put words together in a very readable way. When you pick it up, the words flow. Granted, he goes a little overboard at times and proceeds to describe absolutely nothing in 5-10 pages. Still, words are a strength of his in this book. Additionally, there are fewer instances of blatant nudity in this one, though his gratuitous references still exist. Nevertheless, the story is compelling enough to keep you reading.The bad? Well, my biggest complaint would be that nothing is remotely close to wrapping up. The intricate weave of tales only grows, and nothing ever comes to a resolution. With the sheer number of story lines, it would help the reader keep his sanity if some of them were spun out. Also, the near-neurotic immaturity of some of the women in this book is beyond absurd. It's his biggest downfall as a fantasy writer, IMO.Overall, it's a decent fantasy narrative. The story moves quickly enough with a few bumps here and there. As I mentioned, many of the problems present in the preceding books do not manifest themselves in this one. Plus the story does move, albeit sideways a fair amount of the time.The book is decent, probably worth reading if you're on the fence after the fifth one."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I loved Wheel of Time books one through four. Five got on my nerves, but I liked it. But this, the sixth in the series is a yawner. Either plot or character (and hopefully both) moves books. This one has little of either. I am still waiting, at page 824, to become more than mildly interested. Apparently there are some people who will read anything as long as the secondary world is graphic enough. But grocery shopping is just as boring in WOT, Hobbiton or the real world. And Jordan likes to tell us all of those details--the carving on the chairs, how a woman's hair was done, the color of every character's dress, eyes, decolletage and a million other details that make us feel like he is just filling up space. Jordan's has succeeded in creating a vast secondary world, but the dramatic tension seems forced, especially in his conflict among the main characters. And his characters still do not seem to grow up. It is almost like reading a novel of a video or RPG. That might please 15 years olds, but not me.I give the novel 2 stars as a nod to the prior novels in the series. Perhaps Jordan rescues the last part of the novel. But really, it should not take this long to tell the story. Knowing that I am only half-way done with the series daunts me. I want to know what happens, but the ride is not nearly as fun as when it started."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's world has so much potential that's why I am so disappointed about this book. I can't believe that these books average 800+ pages when the majority of the material is repeated and repeated. Jordan is fixated on making sure we know that Nynaeve likes to tug on her hair. That women can't agree on the amount of cleavage to show. That Aes Sedai are all knowing and the rest of civilization should just follow along. That all the women can't find a skirt that doesn't require straightening. How many more times must Jordan mention these ridiculous recurring themes? If I were to read one more time a phrase placing men in the idiocy category while women are ALWAYS right...I think I'll scream.Sorry Jordan but you lost me. Your plot lines are erratic and you have so many that you can't even remember them all. I'll read the remaining books if they're gifts. Jordan is milking this series for everything he can. Too bad TOR Fantasy can't see it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In book 6 of the Wheel of Time Series Robert Jordan has fallen into a groove - the groove he remains in for the next 4 books or so. Book 5 was a little slower then the first 4 books, but the end sped up considerably. In book 6, Jordan reveals his true pace of writing: slow.After reading the first 5 books of this series I called it my \\"favorite series of all time\\". After reading book 6 and visiting a few WOT hater sites my opinion has changed. The series is good, at times VERY good, but it isn't a Lord of the Rings. The reason for this is Robert Jordan's writing style. Instead of describing a room as \\"A room\\", he has to include details about the panelling, the flooring, and every visible object in the room. He also loves to describe and give names to every single character encountered in the story. This isn't terrible. But it is monotonous. After reading 6 books of this, many people quit this series, and I can see why. It is - at times - BORING.But... (and this is what WOT haters don't include in their wild rantings)This series does have its moments. Jordan, although he has some major problems with description, creates interesting and detailed characters that live within an interesting and detailed world. He can create suspense, and he can juggle many storylines at the same time without ruining all the careful plotting he has done to build the suspense. I'm not going to go into detail about the world that is the Wheel of Time, but I can say that Jordan does have his moments and so far he has kept me reading the books. Not to say that the Wheel of Time surpasses something like Lord of the Rings - I agree with the other reviewers, quantity does NOT mean quality. In Lord of the Rings Tolkien wrote three books that do more for me then Jordan's stack of 10 books and growing. The Wheel of Time is good - but not good enough to match the \\"Lord\\" of fantasy.For readers new to this series, I recommend that you either read up to book 5 or be prepared to endure the lengthy descriptions in books 6-10. If book 5 annoyed you, don't read any further. If book 1 had you struggling to stay interested, don't even think about reading anything else by Jordan. However, if you can handle Jordan's spread-out storylines, there are some rewards and some great fantasy moments. So my advice is: Read the series, but drop it if it ever annoys you. And don't get too sucked in -- there are many, many other better books out there that deserve your time and attention.So the ratings are:BOOK 1 - The Eye of the World - 5 starsBOOK 2 - The Great Hunt - 5 starsBOOK 3 - The Dragon Reborn - 4.5 starsBOOK 4 - The Shadow Rising - 4 starsBOOK 5 - The Fires of Heaven - 4 starsBOOK 6 - The Lord of Chaos - 3 stars"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lord of Chaos is the best book in the wheel of time series.

In this book the rest of the Forsaken are introduced, Moghedien escapes (at the end), and two unnamed Forsaken who have died are somehow brought back to life. Other than this, (and the Forsaken do not seem very dangerous anymore), nothing happens. There is absolutely no suspense when Aes Sedai capture and shield Rand, he's obviously going to escape, and all it does is show what a fool he really is to continue to trust them. Elayne and Nynaeve must find a ter'angreal to combat the heat which Shai'tan is causing, but until some enemy besides the weather is found the book has no real interest. Padan Fain, one of the few characters I found compelling, (although he is obviously never going to get close to Rand), only appears once.

Although it somewhat bores readers with repeats that is not necessary, but if you've read tireless bambling about nothing (half the book is about things readers already know) in Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series before this then you'll learn to appreciate Jordan trying to be as short as possible while informing new comers who's skipped through several books in the series. I don't see how that's possible considering how complicated the series is however. And the battle of sexes in the book was refreshing at the beginning but now it's a little tiring. Also Jordan is trying to carry too many plots at once within the series and sometimes it's too confusing for readers and it's probably confusing Jordan himself since some of the plots mentioned at the beginning gets forgotten long into the series. And so many changes of viewpoints is frustrating as well.As he has shown throughout the series, I feel that his climax is a bit rushed in all the books. It goes on and on about certain things then doesn't leave enough space for the climax and ending to be as effective as possible. He should cut down on descriptions that don't give the reader anything but more words to read and give more to the climax and the ending, which is some of most important parts of a fiction.And it's about time Padan Fain gets killed or something, I am sick and tired of his obsession with Rand al'Thor. Let them end it somehow. I would find a great pleasure in learning it ended in book seven or eight. (I felt some satisfaction at seeing Pedron Niall get killed at the beginning of book seven though.) And nine books in a series is about enough.Overall, it's not as great as some people make it out to be but it's still a good read and it deserves a four-star."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is good at his writing and a great series however some reservation regarding his female characters. Firstly he seems to make them arrogant and women who channel seem to have too much self interest and an over inflated sense of their own rightness. The male characters seem to be alot better and although flawed which is expected as we don't want to read about perfect people do have a human streak in them. Rand is getting on my nerves but I know he will come through triumphantly in the end. The Two River Women are being painful and it is time to either send them back or at least let them slip up on their backsides. Elayne is also ready for a fall.

I am sick of how these characters fail to have the one aspect of reason that makes people humn---the ability to learn. I have investd 5000+ pages and $40+ so I will fifnish this series, if our lovely friend Bob ever can finish it. I find myself wondering who some of the character are sometimes, because we never hear from them (Perrin in Fires of Heaven, and Lan in this installment). Advice, from me. read this series, but when there are no quotes from the characters, just skim it. That way you do not read Jordan's repititious language too many times. The story is good, the idea is different, the writing is getting on my nerves. Is it just me, or is Bobby J. paid by the word???"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this book had several good chapters, and some more empty one. story seems to be getting a little drawn-out. great ending though!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The hype on this book touts it as dominating the world Tolkien only began to reveal. But frankly the level of MUNDANE details I think could as easily be left out without damaging the series at all. Things such as the day-to-day business of running an empire would probably better be left ot a page or two of synopsis-style narrative, rather than following Rand through every detail.Heating up conflict between Rand and the Aes Sedai, and even the Asha'man and the Aes Sedai, I think is good, though. Better than having them all get along like you hope they will eventually. Keeps a good dramatic tension.Over all I say that, as with the earlier books, this one is overstuffed with details we could just as well do without, but over all still a good, engaging read."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Hm, this book is good, no doubt. But reviewing the book, I have to say that the first chapters are really boring. Rands life as a king is hard and busy, I understand after these pages.

I have read it once and am now listening to it from the begining on CD. I find this book most tedious. It waste so much time and words. It could have been summed up in one very short book, been a continuation of the prior book, or the book to follow. It is much too wordy. A repeat of much of the same information and a ripoff of your money. Hopefully you can find it at a library.

What I mean is that you should read in the moment. If you read each book with the goal of getting to the next one then you will be disappointed. Read each book for itself. The Love of the world your in will feel like a vacation. I read one of them then I put the series down and read something else. When I come back to it is like visiting with old friends.As for this book. I loved it! The women have probably their best story yet. The rest of the gang is her as well. They tell me that the series gets worse. I hope that doesn't happen. Right now six is one of my favorites. One thing I noticed that runs through this book is about the decimation of information. In one chapter one character does something. Then a couple chapters later another character will hear about it, but by the time it gets to them it is changed. I loved how that kept happening throughout this book. It made it fun wondering how certain characters would view the others events."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love this series. This book is not the best in the series - it's part of Jordan's mid-series slump.That doesn't entirely explain my low rating.This book is obviously an OCRed scan. Thom Merrilin regularly shows up as Thorn. Stern becomes stem. The first page begins with a stray > character. These aren't the only slip-ups. This doesn't make it unreadable, but they obviously didn't proof-read it after they scanned it, and did only minimal QA on the ebook conversion.

A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lord of Chaos by Robert Jordan is a great novel. The ending is one of the most dramatic he has written. I even think the bulk of the book has a stronger plot than the books four or five. Jordan still writes annoying conversations between Nynaeve and Elayne, but they seem to be doing something important for the first time....ever. Perrin character seemed to completely change. I don't think Jordan has the same mindset for him in book six as he did in book one, but Perrin and Failes parts of the novel were also better written than usual aside from Perrin's conversation with Faile's father. I also enjoyed the increased focus on Matrim Cauthon. He is becoming the most interesting character. And the best part of the novel is that we no longer have to read about Aveindha sharing Rand's bed chamber.What happens. Rand travels around, and the black tower is created. Rand doesn't accomplish much beside learning not to trust Aes Sedai. Mat is a decoy headed to Fight Sammuel but ends up in Ebou Dar. Egwene joins Elayne and Nynaeve. Nynaeve and Elayne make amazing discoveries. Perrin is pulled to Rand. Not much really happens.I also noted something about Loial's speech. He speaks Noun, Verb, Rest of sentence. Every sentence, that makes him sound different compared to the rest of the novel. Just an observation. Good book, I hope the next one is as good."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Actual Rating: 4.5 starsThis of course is the 6th book in the wheel of time series. I will rate and review it on its own merits and not be influenced by opinions of later books.Though this book would be hard to understand (if not impossible) for someone who hasn't read the previous 5, it still fits in as a stand alone book. The beginning is pretty clear cut, Rand needing to consolidate things after conquering Cairhien and Caemlyn. The ending is also clear cut with the events of Dumais Wells. There are still unresolved threads at the end, though, so I understand anyone arguing with my \\"stand alone\\" comments.What I liked:*Introduction of Demandred*Introduction of Taim and the Asha'man*The intrigue surrounding both White Tower factions courting the favor of Rand.*The return of Min*Dumai's Wells*Mat's open mouth-insert-foot moment in Salidar*The return of Perrin and his meeting with his in-laws, the Bashere's*Alanna's surprise (didn't see that coming and I think anyone who says they did is a liar!).What I didn't like:*Nynaeve, Elayne and Birgitte storyline is still slow paced and tedious (though it does pick up once they get to Salidar).*Gawyn's brainlessness.*Egwene's brainlessness while with Gawyn as well as her \\"I know what's best\\" attitude.In Summary:Overall, it was a quite enjoyable book. The slow parts, though tedious at times still have some relevant events in them that add to the overall story. And the ending at Dumai's Wells made up for any other shortcomings! I still had to take one star away for the over description of some scenes which at times took away from an otherwise great story, though.

With the last two books, the action was fast-paced and there was very little down-time, but Jordan reverts to his long -windedness again in this book.As for the characters, Rand, The Dragon Reborn, has started a school to train men how to channel. He has also sent Mat and his group to find Elayne and bring her safely to Andor so she can assume the Sun Throne in place of her mother, Morgase. (By the way, what exactly happened to Morgase?)Egwyne and Nynaeve have been risen to full Aes Sedai, with Egwyne being risen to the Amyrlin Seat of the Salidar Aes Sedai. The Tar Valon group of the Aes Sedai still recognize Eladia as their Amyrlin Seat. Nynaeve has also discovered how to heal stilling, and she cures Siuan, the former Amyrlin who was stilled by Eladia and her cohorts.The Salidar Aes Sedai and the Tar Valon Aes Sedai are both interested in Rand, and Eladia is determined to have him before the Salidar group. Her group does indeed sieze Rand, and they put him in a cage to be returned to Tar Valon.Perrin, Faile, and Loial are all brought back in this volume after being left out since book four. I was happy to see these characters returned to the story,as they are some of my favorites.Unfortunately, the series has slowed down a little again with this book. The series slowed down after book three, but picked up again with books four and five. I was disappointed with this book, and I would rate it as only average. I found myself struggling at times to get through it, and I was glad when I finally finished it. Hopefully, book seven will re-energize the series the way book four did."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was the last book I read in this series four years ago. I didn't even finish it, and I will tell you why. The moment I stopped reading was when Egwene was made head of the Aes Sedai. This just passed any point of ridiculasnes that had occured in the other books (I was humoring Robert Jordan until that point). There was no reason that the Aes Sedai would choose Egwene. She has little experience and is obviously unfit for such a duty. Why would Robert Jordan decide that this would make sense?Because he is a creator of schlop and is a hack, so therefore the plotline must be schlop and reflect his hackiness. I also honestly could have cared less if any of the characters died. In fact, I hoped they would, because by that point, I hated them all. I also had heard that Rand was going to hook up with Min and Elayne and have a three way relationship later on that both girls were perfectly all right with. Robert Jordan must be living vicariously through Rand or something. What a piece of crap."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As you may have read in other reviews, Jordan's books start to go downhill around the 6th book. The 5th book was a very worthwhile read; it had a great ending just like all the other books. But the 6th book is more of political things such as dealing with the Aes Sedai. The 6th books ending is not what I expected either but it wasnt bad. There are several annoying things also. One of which is how Perrin somehow manages to smell peoples emotions with his advanced senses he got from being able to talk with the wolves. Who ever heard of emotions giving off smells? Another annoying thing is Lews Therin being an idiot inside Rands head. Always telling Rand to kill anyone who can channel and mourning of Ilyena. But I believe this book and a couple of the next ones are just leading up to a fantastic ending and some other suprises. So if you've made it this far in the series you might as well go on and read the rest. Besides, each of the next few books have their own neat little suprises and developments....."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I started reading &quot;the Wheel of Time&quot; books a long time ago; I think about 8 years ago. I stopped reading after the seventh, and recently started up again as I saw the release of the 9th book.

It has no purpose, nothing happens, nothing is really resolved. I can see Jordan sweating, trying to squeeze out another book in this already bloated series for the money.The last conflict in the story is pretty cool, but it takes about 400 pages of prolix, incredibly irritating &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus&quot; lolly-gagging to get there.If you want a better series, read Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.

People who have donned this as a &quot;just another filler&quot;, in my opinion probably did not make it to the end. In my opinion, none of the series so far has been boring, or needless.

The climax is quite good but I could not say that it worked out economical to have to read hundreds of pages just to get a few brief parts of interest and a exciting ending.

But...have penny, will toss.Admittedly, Bob nearly lost me halfway through this, the sixth book, of the WOT series. I wondered if his editor had taken one coffee break too many; it seemed he had been given extravagant license to take the plot on various bunny trails. I found myself mentally editing his work, something I never do with Jordan. A needless sentence here and there, overstatement and his seeming self-indulgence with unnecessary description made me more than once toss the book aside in frustration. However...I kept reading for two reasons: a neighbor and I are reading the series together, and she finished the book before I; she did handsprings to let me know it got much, much better. The other reason is that a writer as brilliant as Bobby deserves, on book 6, a chance to bail himself out.This book made me realize how important it is for the writer to serve the reader. Self-indulgence comes through when a writer refuses to edit, or allow himself/herself, to be edited. I am usually satisfied with Jordan's work; this book left me unhappy in the middle, and greatly happy at the end. For those who may be tempted to set it aside halfway through--trust me, it's worth the time.I read his work to learn more of the craft of writing, and I have learned that even the masters err at times; I don't know whether to be relieved that Jordan is indeed human or not. I do know I'd share Mallowcups with Bob in a heartbeat. I am very thankful for the gift he has been given. For my own base and inglorious selfishness, I hope he lives to be 100, writing himself silly."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit.

Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I guess this series went down hill from book 4. Its all just mindless rambling on a seemingly interesting world.Since when is the world dominated by women? I makes me wonder if this is just some pathetic fantasy world where men and women keep their distance but fall in love at first site anyway. These people don't love each other. Its a very sad excuse for fantasy and romance.The men are terrible. They are actually pushed around by women.Rand - always described as handsome and stubborn. Why do all the women fall in love with him and why does he push them away? He should just die or disappear.Mat and Perrin- very much the same as Rand. Send them back to the Two Rivers, JordanLan- loves Nynave? What the HELL??? WHY????Moiraine- thank the Light she's dead (or is she?)Egwene- thats the funniest name I ever heard. Pathetic, full of herself, somehow loves Gawyn (or was it Galad? I barely even remember what happens in this book) Send her back, too.Elayne- what morons would actually allow her to rule a kingdom? Send her to the Two Rivers.Nynave- god, someone kill herFaile- kill her tooBy the way, if you're still devoted to all this garbage, you've got another 4 books to go. And they get worse and worse. From book 3 to 7, its like reading an episode out of a superhero comic- in each one, Rand fights one forsaken at the end. You expect almost every single thing and the ones that you don't are missed anyway.This whole series is like an RPG- a very long, boring one.Its very overhyped and overrated."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A friend gave me the first six books of WOT. I read all of them, and now I don't really understand why I wasted my time.Jordan has built a quite respectable and interesting world, and the plot isn't worse than others. But the abundance of clich&eacute;s make for a tiresome read. Why is the moon *always* waxing? Why does *everybody* lick his/her lips now and then? The list goes on and on.Another irksome fact of WOT is the silly conflict between the sexes throughout the whole series. In WOT, women tend to think that men are wool-headed lummoxes, and men despair because they really don't understand women. These facts are repeated hundreds of times, in case you didn't understand them the first time. Jordan must think that this is amusing, but it's just annoying.Well, in a nutshell, I must say that I don't care what's going to happen to this band of peevish &quot;reluctant heroes&quot; any more. Jordan lost me here. There are many good fantasy writers out there (Guy Gavriel Kay and George R. R. Martin come to mind), so there is really no need to bother with hacks like Robert Jordan.

At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon: 1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged. 2. A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3. A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock. If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers. He gave the superhero super weapons. Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books. Solution: make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines. They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something. The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters. When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is book 6 of the 12-book Wheel of Time series (book 12 will be released in 2008 or 2009, depending upon the author's health and ability to write -- he has a serious blood disease). Each of the previous volumes weighed in at 750-900+ pages paperback as do the ones that follow, and this one is also no afternoon read. Worse yet, it changes the pace and focus of the story.After learning his identity and embracing his destiny, Rand al'Thor the messiah figure and primary character in the story slows down. Instead of seeking to conquer the rest of the continent after his successful campaigns to date, he tries to hold what he has while the nations he has not conquered are thrown into chaos. He does, however, establish the Black Tower -- the yin to the yang of White Tower.The other villagers who left Rand's hometown with him are the primary foci of this tale as Nynaeve makes tremendous discoveries and Egwene's life changes momentously, setting up the White Tower/Rebel Aes Sedai thread that pervades books 7-11.Ultimately, however, both changes (focus, pacing) are negative: the story slows from the breakneck adventure of books 1-5 as Robert Jordan sets the stage for the remaining volumes. But those volumes are even slower, longer and less interesting: book 7 introduces yet more plotlines that bog down the story, in book 8 Jordan adds a new capture-and-rescue issue that takes until book 11 to get sorted out with no significant advancement of the overall plotline despite about 500 pages devoted to it. Worse yet, book 10 consists of 800+ pages of day-in-the-life updates on the characters with nearly no plot movement.The end of Lord of Chaos is explosive and thrilling, fully worthy of the previous entries. But it engenders a false hope that the next volumes would build upon the momentum. They don't. Instead, the series wallows as Jordan concentrates too much on peripheral plotlines, devotes far too little attention to Rand, and increases the cast of characters beyond belief. Book 11 starts setting up the end-game, but it's a lot to ask for a clean and complete ending to this series in book 12."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just got done with this book after struggling through it for a LONG time! By far it's the most boring in the series compared to the previous 5. Several interesting ideas come into play, but I felt they were poorly executed for the most part. The only worthwhile events were Egwene being chosen as the new Amrylin, the introduction of the Black Tower (which I thought was brilliant), and Nynaeve developing the new Talent of healing the stilling/gentling effect of those who can channel. I felt that the story kept dancing in circles, really not going anywhere. The Forsaken just kind of appear but play no important role, which leaves us with a lot more useless minor characters, and little conflicts with the Cairhien and Andoran Lords/Ladies. I've noticed a pattern developing that Robert Jordan kind of feels that he needs to keep the books the same length, and just kind of kill of the book as almost an afterthought. The first 4 are by far the best fantasy novels ever written in my opinion however."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A piece of advice to surfers reading these reviews: a rave is one thing, but one that seems so worshipful of the text in question as to be nearly orgasmic should be highly suspect of being less a neutral review and more an advertisement submitted by paid employees of the publisher."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Somehow, personally, I think it was by mass hypnotism Robert Jordan has managed to convince thousands of readers that the wheel of time series is a good read. Apparently I was unaffected by this strange phenomenon for I can clearly see the trash for what it really is. Not to say that the original concept is bad--it isn't--but Mr. Jordan has stretched out his limited plot far too much. If he had put everything into one 1,000 page epic rather thatn 8 1,000 page epics, it would have truly been a masterful story. But he didn't mostly due, I've no doubt, to his love of money. I read through the first five books of the series and started the sixth by convincing myself that something important and interesting would happen eventually: that I would be rewarded for wasting hours and hours of my life reading drivel. But it just didn't happen. I'm not going to bother to tell you not to read the series because for every person who hates it there are at least 1,000 people who treat Jordan's word as if it were some sacred new form of the Bible and spend all their time memorizing the ridiculous plot twists and place names. But I will say this: if you are currently reading the series because you expect something interesting to happen don't bother."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I will keep this review brief, because I am not proud of the single star I have to give and neither of the message I have to give you.Books 1, 2 and 3 took me into another world. An amazing world. I thought this book series was on a par with the Lord of the Rings and would potentially surpass it. Then books 4 and 5 came out, which were awesome too. Alas, then there was book 6. This book was a warning sign of a very bad thing to come: a completely wasted epic story.Why wasted? Because it is overly elaborated in an additional 8 books full with more useless details than anything in this world. And it still hasn't come to an end! Now the author has died and other people continue the crap instead of finishing it.If I lay dying one day, my biggest regret will be having read through books 6 to 12 hoping for the tide to change until finally I threw them all away."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Apparently the next 2 books in the series aren't very good - this one did leave me pleasantly surprised. Many of the characters seem to have matured/developed (definitely a big milestone in the series), although not all. The divided Tower plotline was especially good, followed closely by - surprisingly - the dealings of Nynaeve and Elayne. The ending was also great, Jordan's reached epic proportions here. Unfortunately this means he must go on topping himself with every new book. Furthermore, in this one we especially see how the infinite number of plotlines start to overtangle and make progress in the story impossible. The story of the ter'angreal doesn't have much going for it and yet it takes all of this book (and apparently the next few as well). It's probably an improvement on book 5 but I could feel the seeds of the series' downfall..."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Plot summaries are available elsewhere. What seems notable to me about this book and series is that each volume is like an episode in an old-time serial: it is truly one long story, not a string of sequels. I am continually amazed at Jordan's inventiveness, as well as his ability to juggle so many different characters (more are added with each book).However, he is woefully inadequate as a creator of character. They have a few stock reactions which cover every situation. If you've made it this far in the series, you're probably sick-unto-death of everyone, absolutely everyone, muttering under their breath. Women all \\"sniff\\" to show disapproval. They endlessly smooth their skirts. They blush at the slightest suggestion or thought of sex. Nynaeve yanks on her braid until you want to scream, \\"just cut the damned thing off, already!\\" Men and women misinterpret each others' motives over and over again. Women think, \\"Men always . . .\\" and men think, \\"Women always . . . \\" Rand, Mat and Perrin each think the other two are smooth ladies' men. The universal epithet is \\"wool-headed.\\" Emotions are seldom subtle or moderate; usually as broad as in a cartoon or children's story. Every woman treats every man as if he were a little boy in need of a spanking; men find all women unfathomably mysterious. (How Jordan slipped up and allowed Perrin and Faile to find each other and get married is a REAL mystery!)How Jordan manages to make the lives and adventures of these cardboard cutouts so interesting deserves a spot on \\"Unsolved Mysteries.\\" Yet, somehow he does."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time series is one very good series, if not the best currently out there in this genre. I read other reviews complaining that the series was long, drawn out and that the characters never seem to grow. These people don't seem to realize how little time has passed for these characters, in spite of the grand adventures they have had. In showing us how these characters are reacting to events, and detailing their personal thoughts, Mr. Jordan has created a very believeable group of people.Tolkien only wrote five books on Middle-Earth, and his plot was much more straightforward than Jordan's. It takes a long time in order to fully develop such a convoluted plot, and when new major characters are introduced in every book (Ther are NO minor characters) the plot becomes infinitely more complex. If this tale takes less than ten books to finish (Mission: Earth took that many) then the tale could not possibly be fully told. RJ has developed over three dozen characters interacting on a global scale, their stories (Each could be treated as a book in itself) cannot be resolved thoroughly without this entire series continuing on for at least another five books."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was as good and better as the five preceding it.How anyone can say that this series is boring is beyond me.

As some of the otherreaders wrote, and correctly, they don't seem to get any wiser from past experiences. Let me write this again in caps: THEY DON'T GET ANY WISER FROM PAST EXPERIENCES. Also, the irritating 'chip-on-the-shoulder' the main character women have toward men folks. Always there's an upmanship-head game always playing out by Nynave, Elaine, Egwene, and that wanna-be queen. The men can also be infuriating by their submissivenes.

He has drawn all of us into his world. We are right there along with Matt, Perrin, (my personal favorite character), and Rand as they fight for thier lives, and the lives of those they love. Not to mention countless people they don't know.The way Mr. Jordan interweaves the many plots is pure writting genious! You can't help but be swallowed up by the whole story. Each seperate plot is bound (no pun intended) to the next. You find yourself swept along at such a pace that the book seems done and you've only just picked it up.I think that any sci-fi, adventure reader would love this series and recomend it highly. So if you've been wondering if you should pick it up, DO IT!! Besides, the hard cover edition looks great on the book shelf.I also noticed that a few readers who have left their comments befor me, mostly the ones who knocked the books and Mr. Jordan, were hoping that the next book would be the last. Well I heard that it is a nine book series, so I guess that you'll just have to live with it till the story ends. Mr. Jordan is not the type of writer who will just end a story, at least not untill the story is over.

No other writer holds a candle to the infinate possibilities in Robert Jordan's worlds. The story appeals to all as the Aes Sedai struggle to gain hold over Rand al'Thor as he struggles with himself and the voice of Lew Therin Telemon inside his head. The story is elaboratly dressed in mystique, fun, adventure, and love.

Lord of Chaos continues a trend in the series. Books 1-4 move along at a very nice pace. Books 5-6 are obsessed with odd character quirks and the plot moves at a considerably slacker pace. Books 7-9 are mind-numbingly slow and the repetitive descriptions of character tendencies are quite tiresome, though they have inspired some excellently entertaining commentary in these quarters.

Jordan is just beginning to show his abilities. Rand takes on more character, and the others gain more depth as well. Mat gets more Mat-like (for lack of a better term), and Perrin gets wimpier.

Instead of using interesting ideas mixed in tedium, the writing improves to a palatable level.The story is as fine as the rest, if you overlook the Aiel. The Aiel, much like the Seanchan, the Whitecloaks, and the Breaking of the Tower, are all unnecessary plot devices serving only to stretch the series beyond the original six books to a possible 11 (based on an online chat with the author). None of the forementioned plotlines advance the main story, namely Rand vs. the Dark One. I can accept some Aiel, they're mildly interesting, but if one combined everything together there would be at least 30 pages of Aiel Maidens flashing handtalk and laughing at Rand (The Shaido rebellion story has to go as well).That being said, 'Lord' still maintains focus on the good vs. evil story with multiple Forsaken plotlines.

Against all odds, Rand must struggle to unite the people for a cataclysmic battle against the forces of evil.There are many masters in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien would certainly be lauded highest when it comes to development of the world in which the events he illustrates transpire. Robert Jordan, for all the criticism leveled against him for what appears to be a marketing ploy - stringing the series out as long as humanly possible to generate greater book sales - would certainly have to rank near the top for character development. His series is filled with various interesting folk with varied viewpoints and motivations. While most (decent) authors go well into detail in describing the motivations and quirks of their heroes, Jordan doesn't stop there. Even his villains are thoroughly detailed. Moghidien, for example, one of the wickedest of the fallen, has a history and personality that influences how she reacts, as well as insecurities and frailties. Good, evil, benevolent or malign, all of Jordan's characters are fully fleshed out, and we get a fair view into their minds and motivations as the drama unfolds. Yes, the world is on the simple side, and yes, the plot, of late, has lost its pace; but it's a world and plot filled with only the most fascinating of folks. At a series currently juggling over 50 characters, all unveiled over the last 10 volumes, it's a commendable and laudable feat, indeed.Fans of Jordan's epic series of many volumes of many pages have been whinging since book six that the series seems to have no end in sight. Unfortunately, it's now a race against the clock for Jordan and his publisher, whose decision to prolong the series as long as they have may result in the work never being finished. Ironically, Rand, the hero destined to die on the slopes of the Dragonmount, may outlive his creator.

Mostly endless posturing, maneuvering, and intrigue on the part of the characters, epitomized by the Aes Sedai &quot;sniff&quot; (every other page an Aes Sedai is sniffing--it gets old after a while). The intrigue is supposed to be complex, but the characters come across as sophisticated as a bunch of third-graders: petulant and whiny.I think that Robert Jordan has run out of steam and is simply milking the series for all the money that he can wring out of it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan does it again in book six of his incredibly long and involved saga, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. In this latest masterpiece, things are really starting to move. With the unlikely help of Mat and his Band, Nynaeve and Elayne go in search of a ter'angreal which may bring rain to the thirsty land. The Tower remains split, but the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar choose an Amyrlin Seat, and the choice will shock you. Rand raises a vast army of Asha'man, men who can channel, with the help of former false Dragon, Mazrim Taim, while preparing for war against the powerful and possibly mad Forsaken, Sammael. However, in the midst of it all, discord begins to be sown within the group of rebel Aes Sedai by a mysterious but evil character named Aran'gar, disguised as the beautiful Hasima, secretary to Delana Sedai. As always, the story is gripping, but is continually bogged down with unnecessary character descriptions and explanations of this strange world which may be interesting to a few, but will annoy most readers, anxious to keep things moving. All complaints aside, it's a great book, and definitely one worth reading."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"By the accounts I have read, Robert Jordan's fantasy megaseries &quot;The Wheel of Time,&quot; the ninth volume of which is due for release in late 2000, was originally intended as a six-volume saga. Whatever the motivation--more money made on more volumes, characters or fantasyland more interesting (and thus worth more verbiage) than first estimated, what have you--the original plan is moot, and we the readers are faced with a series half again as long as first advertised, with no end in sight. This situation would be more palatable if the events that take place within &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; had not begun to follow the monotonous pattern that this episode first set up, to wit: Rand Al'Thor flits about various kingdoms under his nominal control to no apparent purpose, Aes Sedai women scheme and plot against him and each other, other female characters bicker and argue, all while the forces of darkness pull strings in the background and seemingly have the better knowledge of what is really happening--better, in fact, than the reader does.In sum, not much of any real import or consequence happens until the last 100 pages, which would mean more if the book weren't 1000 pages long; the acceleration in this last section is exhilarating, but part of this effect is achieved by the 900-page buildup, which any sensible reader (a category I apparently do not fall under) cannot be blamed for avoiding entirely. It is extremely difficult to avoid the obvious conclusion that in this volume, not to mention the previous and subsequent ones, Jordan could very easily have accomplished the same narrative without slaughtering quite so many trees.None of these comments have any meaning, of course, if you have become so infatuated with the characters or with Jordan's fantasyland that no amount of description of the minutiae of these people's lives could ever be enough. Those who have finished the first five volumes and are not so enthralled, however, should note that the investment in time and attention that will be required to see Jordan's tale completely through may be more than you are willing to give. If so, this is the place to quit. As far as technical considerations are concerned, the prose is still slick but occasionally poor, and given to recycling some of the same passages again and again.Overall, my impression is that after getting past the Tolkien pastiche of the first few volumes, Jordan was doing a fine job of exploiting a highly imaginative fantasyland. It seems a genuine shame that he would let his narrative bog down like it does here."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time in general isn't an easy read. On the contrary, the length of this saga and its complexity often intimidates and repels people. However, I have never read anything nearly as engrossing and absolute as the Wheel of Time books: it is the complete reading experience. In a world where it often seems that nothing of interest ever happens to us, one may find in these books friends for life, and actually feel as if he is sharing their experiences, their strife and their innermost thoughts. Lord of Chaos, the six in the series, very much epitomizes this element. Though it's almost a thousand pages long (on paperback, at least), not much actually happens in this book, but it builds a wider base to understand the characters, their world, their enemies and the dangers they face, including those they are oblivious of. Furthermore, this book sheds light on the foundations of future eventualities in later books. The reader finds himself even more attached to the characters and the world they inhabit. He is also subjected to great stress, as this book builds a lot of tension. And then, at the last three hundred pages or so, all hell breaks loose. All in all, this book is long and relatively noncommunicative, at least at the beginning, and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who hasn't read the previous five books of the series, but the bottom line is, it's a fabulous book, and I couldn't lay my hands off it once I started reading it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is easily the worst book I have read in the series so far. The characters are so incredibly stupid I am finding myself hoping the Dark One wins. Could there really be a character as stupid as Nyneave? She never does anything but get angry, complain, tug her braid (how many times must we read that!) and yet she acts as if she should be in control of everything!!An Aes Sedai gets stabbed and of course the rest of the Aes Sedai claim it is Rands doing. No need to dig any deeper, no need to consider - must have been him. Rand can channel, why would he need to get someone to stab an Aes Sedai? and why would he do it anyway? Stupid.Why would the white tower bother to kidnap Rand? They have to release him sooner or later. Aes Sedai are supposed to be careful and logical and yet they dump mankinds last great hope into a chest!!! That will certainly convince him to trust them!! Stupid, stupid.Gawyn's sister loves Rand yet without proof, Gawyn wants to kill him because he thinks he killed his mother. No proof that she is dead or that Rand did it. The only fact he has is that Rand is openly supporting his sister and that she loves him. Would any brother believe his sister could love the man who killed their mother? Yet Gawyn ignores these facts and wants to see Rand dead. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Jordan should take a leaf out of George RR Martin's books and start killing off some characters (Nyneave and Faile would be an excellent start). Which brings me to the point that if you really want to read fantasy the way it should be written, read the Song of Ice and Fire series or Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The author must hate women. All of his female characters are ambitious, arrogant, self absorbed, petulant, demanding, ungrateful, manipulative, and chauvinistic toward men.I would have long ago taken any one of his female characters across my knee and given a good spaking if I were any of the male characters because they act just like immature children. I certainly would not cow to them the way the men do, or stand for being bullied, criticized and belittled. I wouldn't fight back, I'd simply treat them as the obstacles they so often are and ignore them as if they weren't there and do whatever the hell I want to do anyway.These women do not add to or enhance or even support anyone in what must be accomplished. More often than not they are a hinderance, confusing and complicating issues that would have been long resolved had it not been for their meddling.As a woman, I am deeply offended by the portrayal of women in these books!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book has a great title and a lot of potential. This one was hard to review cause I hated reading the first 250 pages, it was just watch Rand do something then have both sides of Aes Sedai talk about it, then the nobles and towns people. When The book gets really interesting for me is after Nyaveve figures out her secrecy gift, it's a huge spoiler that I don't want to give away, but after that happens the book finds a direction and starts charging for it.So the first quarter of the book I loathed, but after that i loved it. We get to see the one power used my Rand and Taim as I always wanted to see it done.This book Brings back Perrin and Lolial who were absent in the last book. This book had the most story lines of minor characters who have been missing brought back and added to this story line with the same set of adventures, and Jordan still end this book with and great ending for this book but it still fore shadows what's coming up in future books.I'm going to continue my quest to finishing the series"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"These are not great books. The Wheel of Time is not art or literature. What it is is a great adventure. If you like magic, battles, loads of detail, etc. you will enjoy this series.I don't love The Wheel of Time or hate it, but I have invested a lot of time into it so far, and I am going to continue reading it until it is over.Please stop comparing Jordan to Tolkein. Its not even close. Tolkein had a story with a beginning and end in mind. Robert Jordan just keeps adding layer upon layer onto this series to keep the franchise going.Be honest. Has this series ever won a major Fiction award? Do critics ever include these books in best of lists?These books are the male equivalent of Romance novels. Trashy fun."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I JUST this minute finished reading this book. Took me most of a year to get through it.(and no, it wasn't me reading slow ;)Nothing, *NOTHING*, really interesting happens until pages 3-400.. I *REALLY* don't believe that this book should have been approx. 1000 pages, or that it took so long to get through it.I just got to page 150-250 and kept putting it down. THEN i said screw it, and it became a matter of prinicple, just to get further than i did before.I'm not exactly sure it was worth the weak ending. From page 500 on, i kept expecting the action to heighten, but the anticipation just leveled, and waned at the conclusion.But what am i complaining about? After i bought this many books from him, i'm in to the end of the story whether i like it or not ;)btw *yes* i'll get the rest, that's what i'm here for.. yo Robert, ez on the dialog bro, it's a bit much"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"LoC is clearly the best book thus far in Robert Jordan's epic, awesome series. The battle at Dumai's Well is one of the most vivid and wrenching battle scenes ever put down in a fantasy novel. The chapter ranks right up there with Tolkein's &quot;The Battle of Five Armies&quot; in the Hobbit and with Stephen R. Donaldson's &quot;Lord Mhoram's Victory&quot; located in the Thomas Covenant series. The latter books from Jordan have shown a dropoff in quality, I believe that the series peaked with LoC. But what a peak it was! This is not to say that the other books in the series aren't excellent, they are, but LoC is the best."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I liked the first couple of Wheel of Time books well enough to keep reading, though from the beginning I saw that all comparisons to Tolkien were wishful thinking. Book 5 was hard to finish, though, and I hoped Book 6 would be better. IT'S NOT. I love books--I read constantly--but I could hardly finish Lord of Chaos. If you like to read nearly 1000 pages about people having meetings with various other people, arguing and complaining about the exact same things in about the same words, and having more meetings to discuss it all, then believe me, this is the book for you! If you like a story, just give up on the Wheel of Time books and find something better. I kept reading Lord of Chaos just so the loose ends could be tied up: the terangreal would be found and the weather changed, Rand and Faile's misunderstanding would be fixed, it would finally come out that Morgase is alive...this is just the beginning of the plot pieces that needed tying up. But none of this happens, and the book is ended with a series of disjointed paragraphs that open new cans of worms instead. I couldn't even remember who some of the people mentioned in the ending paragraphs were. I felt I had been cheated or tricked.In other words, despite 980-plus pages, almost nothing happens! You would think that Mr. Jordan had been paid by the word instead of by the book! This is the end, as far as I'm concerned. I've wasted way too much of my life reading these books already, and i'm certainly not going to waste another second on them now."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan has not lost the ability to create wonderful battle scenes or even tension in this book. However his inability to keep his plot lines from getting confused, or having simple too many characters, leaves the reader feeling cheated. The earlier books kept the Rand and Co. together and simplified the story. Now however with the main characters and their supporting caste blown to the four corners of this potentially great land, Jordan is struggling to keep his web intact. Introducing increasingly larger numbers of sub-plots and other characters makes the wheel of time look like a bad hollywood soap opera. I also feel that his constant need to divert to other books and projects while he is busy with this series doesn't help. Its time to focus on making this series better. I don't think Tolkien is in danger of loosing his crown."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"***3.5 stars***Just when it looked as if the Wheel of Time series was going nowhere and no longer worth reading, Jordan comes back with the entertaining Lord of Chaos. Plenty of problems persist -- Jordan's not much of a writer, it's too long, and some of the characters are caricatures -- but enough things are improved over the previous two volumes to make the book recommendable. One of the best changes is that Jordan brings back the bad guys. A problem with recent books, IMO, was that Jordan didn't spend nearly enough time on the activities of the evil powers in the world that he created, and little of their plotting was revealed. SciFi/fantasy books need good villains to succeed, and considering how unlikeable or boring most of the good guys are most of the time, Jordan needs to keep the evil-doers present in order to generate interest, and he does it here. Furthermore, Rand has finally emerged here as an interesting character. He's nothing like the Rand of the first two books, and I guess that's the point. Anyway, Jordan has found a way to make Rand a sort of haunted, complex anti-hero type, and this measurably improves all of the chapters in which he appears. Also, unlike the previous two books, this one gets back to good plotting, good pacing and creating a sense of unity. In other words, after reading Lord of Chaos, you actually feel like you read a book instead of 1000 pages containing randomglimpses of something much bigger. Sure, ther was a 200-250 page section of bloat in the middle of the book where things started to bog down and began to lose my interest, but everything picked up again and moved toward a very exciting climax.I do wish that Jordan wouldn't be so obvious in his \\"twists\\" and be subtle about such things. I mean, the whole idea of Mazrim Taim and the Ashaman is a really good one, but the prologue gives away what is actually going on, and this is really too bad. Jordan does this all the time, and you wonder if he is either really underestimating his audience, or just doesn't know how allow such things to develop naturally and without undue clues. (In case you haven't figured out one of his techniques, 90% of the time that a character vehemently denies something, you know it will actually happen later on).Still, this is a pretty good book, and is good enough to be considered on the same level as books 2 and 3, IMO."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is nothing short of awesome. However, in order to enjoy or understand The Lord of Chaos, one must first read the previous five books. This book finally begins to reveal where Jordan is going with the series. He has been developing a plot for action for much of the last three books, and at the end of The Lord of Chaos the action is released. I am sure the following books will develop largely from what occurs in this novel, making it a cornerstone to the series.Much changes in this novel. Perrin is reintroduced to the plot and joins Rand in Caemlyn and follows to Cairhien. Perhaps the most interesting events concern Mat. Jordan reveals that the Daughter of the Nine Moons is Seanchan. Mat also leads Rand's army of Dragonsworn. Elayne and Nyn use Moghedien to discover new uses of the power and leave for Ebou Dar to find a weather ter'angreal. Egwene leaves the Wise Ones to go to Salidar. The men Rand gathers to channel become a force to be reckoned with. Min reaches Rand and enjoys teasing him. I would reveal more about Rand, but that would spoil the novel.For me, Mat and Lews Therin are the most interesting characters. The fact that The Lord of Chaos spends so much time dealing with them makes this book one of my favorites. I did not notice as much reptition in this novel as in previous. I think Jordan realizes that someone who is reading the Lord of Chaos has probably read the entire series. If you thought the Fires of Heaven was so-so and are deciding whether to read the next one, I recommend at least reading The Lord of Chaos before quitting the Series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With such a good series, picking out the best one should be hard. It is not. Lord of Chaos is a great book, the best one to date. Robert Jordan brings together and nicely combines the elements of the past books.We have great drama, backstabbing, rivarlies and war. There are major surprises, major, and good new developments. I especially like Taim joining Rand's side. It is nice touch. We see now that the coming war will have great powers on both sides. The eventual end to this series should be spectular.In Lord of Chaos, indeed, Robert Jordan gives us a sweet taste of the final climax, a great battle scene, the most detailed yet in this series. All sides, almost, are represented. At my last count, there must be at least eight different sides here.Every group, strong at first, has split at least once. Thus we have two different Aiel factions, or three; the Aes Sedai have split and, if you include the Waive Mistresses and the Aiel, there are four factions there; we have the re-conquering; and, of course, the Forsaken, who themselves are hardly cohesive.Indeed, with all the plots and counterplots, will this book ever end? It is easy to see, if Rand ever wins, how his winning coalition may break up and war with itself. Rand, the Dragon, of course will win in the end. But, if he didn't, the other side would also have trouble surviving their victory.It is hard to see how any writer will be able to maintain the intensity, and the great detail found in this series. They have been a pleasure to read and I look forward to reading the next parts in this series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is THE best book I have ever read! I disagree with the reviewers that say this book has flaws. There might be a few small ones but, but they make a big deal of them because they are too picky! Any time a great book like this comes along they can't find big things to complain about so they complain about the tiny things. They say that Robert Jordan goes into too much detail, sure he goes into detail! His main objective in the detail is to give you a clear picture in you mind so that you can understand what's happening better. If you like detailed books you will like this book. If you don't, sorry, but you are missing a good book!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The discs were in their sleeves.... along with some residue that looked like someone spilled a malt on the discs and didn't wipe them off.

A major plotline is revealed early on when Rand and Taim first meet. After that, the narrative does lull in the middle parts until Nynaeve's discovery and the summoning of Egwene. I especially enjoyed the Egwene/Gawyn interaction, that was a very nice touch by Jordan. I didn't like that Mat/Elayne/Nynaeve were left in limbo at the end of this book. However, the spectacular fight scene at Dumai's Wells made up for it. Not as good as Fires of Heaven, I'd rate this at 3.5, but still good entry for WoT."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I enjoyed this book even though not as good as the ones before. It is more of an \\"event book\\" than a story. Throughout the thousand pages, there are several important events occurring. Though they are not as intriguing as its predecessors, it has several key developments in it and several questions are answered. Overall a very good book.I have enjoyed this series a lot. Every book gets better and better. Until the last 100 pages, the book is bland and is very wordy, but it still is able to answer many questions (which in turn creates more questions).As I have read other reviews, I realized that some readers don't appreciate a good book when they see one. They look for something that they would write. But I on the other hand enjoy his writing. If they don't enjoy it, don't read it.In this book, Rand has just added another country to his rule. As revealed in the last book, the forsaken Lanfear is no longer, because of Moraine's quick thinking by shoving Lanfear into the Terangreall. (Though I do not believe she is gone for good.) I like how Rand performs in politics. Politics are not fun, but Rand handles them well for an unlearned boy from the country. He intends Elayne for the throne, but the nobles intend it for themselves.The aiel and the wise ones are interesting and they are pretty good characters. As reading about them, I wondered who would win, an aiel, or an elf? I enjoy these characters.At the starting of the, book I lost interest quickly, But when certain events occurred, like when rand found Salidar, it renewed my vigor. I also loved the return of Perrin, since has not appeared I two books.Two characters that I continue to love are Mat and Perrin. Mat has always been a favorite of mine; one reason is because of his ever changing luck. All he wants is a woman to love and an inn to gamble in, yet he gets neither very often. Perrin I feel sorry for. Feile is a demanding woman and it is very interesting to see the marriage progress. I felt really sorry for him when Feile heard rumors of him and Berelain and started to ignore him. It reminds me of a proverb, \\"it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with an angry and contentious woman.\\" I feel sorry for Perrin.Finally, Rand is becoming less innocent and soft. He trusts little of Aes Sedai. In the final 100 pages, the best part of the book, his trust is shattered by unfortunate events. His character has changed from his innocent and carefree life in the Two RiversThis book has many twists and turns. I can't wait for the next book. Though it is wordy in some parts, the story progresses with more plot twists and turns. I feel sad that Robert Jordan is dead, but I hope his son finishes the book soon. I love this series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Book 6 has none of the fluff of book 5. The pace of the book slows to a sinister crawl towards the middle and then speeds up towards a cracking finale. I think it is one of the best in the series, up there with vols 2, 3, 4 The Great Hunt, The Dragon Reborn and The Shadow Rising. The political intrigue reaches a climax and Rand's paranoia is increasingly justified. This book is largely about Rand, Egwene, Perrin.I always find it strange that people wax lyrical about book 1, which I thought has the most stupid last 200 pages of any of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Dark Lord guy stirs the pot a bit.Rand also gets fed up with the sexist sorceresses and says, hey, you blokes can do magic too if you can, and establishes his own band of magic wielders with Mazrim Taim to lead them.The females get upset at this threat to their power, and come after Rand.Yet another power base, that of the army of religious fanatics also comes more into play."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"oh light!!! could i love rand any more than i do? robert jordan comes back at us with his sixth installment, and there are some major happenings & shocking revelations in this book. and amazingly we are still given even more information and history regarding the wheel of time world. it's so amazing! do not be mislead, the wheel of time series is NOT light reading; however, despite its weight & depth, it is the most consuming & riveting read you will find. this book has more action than book five & therefore, i give it five stars."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is the standard of the series. (So far.)In the first book we are given a slow-paced introduction to a very complex and interesting story, but it's about at the half-way point that the book becomes truly captivating. The second book was better still, and we don't have to deal with as many initial concepts as in the first book(an inevitable advantage for any second book in any series)and the events start to focus on the chief-hero, who just barely rose above the rest of the heroes at the end of the first book. The third book was even better, and the fourth and fifth were in another league or order of magnitude. Then in Lord of Chaos, we have the action-packed pinnacle. Aes Sedai on the one side, Aes Sedai on the other, renegade Aiel, and the Ashaman have become a reality. The Forsaken are given an enigmatic command about the Lord of Chaos (thus the title, obviously) and a very intriguing interplay commences. And we are introduced to the character of Shadar Haran, a most unMyrrdrahl like Myrrdrahl. But the best of this book was the progression of the last chapters to the Conclusion in Dumai's Wells. Books seven and eight were of a lesser quality, though not bad by any means, and in them the sub-plots begin to tie up. Book Nine was better than Seven And Eight, but not quite at the same level as Number Six."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes.but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation.the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have truly enjoyed the Wheel of Time series thus far. I have only read through this book. The series started a little slow but quickly gained momentum and kept it, until this book. The story is wonderful and I'm still excited about reading the rest of ther series, but Jordan really stretches the plot thin to get a fat book here. The last 100 to 150 pages cover much more story and moves much faster than the rest of the book.

I enjoyed it as much as any of the others, maybe even more than the fifth book. The book maintained such a high level of tension that I never found it boring. I always looked forward to reading a few more pages whenever I had spare time. Sure, the characters weren't running for their lives like in the first three, but a lot things were still happening. It must be understood that no word in these books is a waste of ink. Every one is there for a reason, even if you can't see it right away.

I like WoT series, I'm on book 8 right now, and overall enjoying the story. I would give this book 3.5/5.Now to the review: RJ went over the roof with pointless details over details over details. Sure there is some plots and subplots going on, which is good, there's some character development, wich is great, there are interesting insights into how for example Two Rivers changed etc, but after reading through 900+ pages I got the fealing that nothing happened in this book, and pretty much nothing did, excpet ehh 2 major moments - Egwen's and the final climax. Otherwise you can sum up this book on one A4 format page, and will pretty much mention everything important.And as some people mentioned this is a trend that is going on in the next books as well. If you want to enjoy it, be prepared to skim through some pages to get over some pointless \\"what kind of low cut dress that was\\" detail and back into the story.I'm currently on book 8, but there's one big moment that's already tipping me off. 95% of female characters are just annoying, in fact they are portrated so annoying that you want a) strangle Nynaeve with her own braide, considering that it's apparently tougher then metal cable..... b) give Aviendha a \\"how to\\" guide on male/female relationship for 14 y.o. c) Pretty much kill Elayda and half of the Aies Sedai bunch cause 90% of them are the same annoying characer with different kind of bossoms and hips d) Give Perrin some courage to shake some sence in his monster of a wife ( unless this guy likes skinny girls with big noses, who verbaly abuse him all the time...he does like that it seems) e) Send Elayne to the mining camps for maybe 2-3 years, or take all her \\"unlimited powaaaa\\" from her, and stuff her with minimum amount of $$ in some village, seriously over the past 7 books this girl learned jack on how to normally communicate with people, without pulling her chin up to the sky, lecturing how stupid everyone is, or screaming that \\"she is the next queen of andor\\". And don't even get me started an all that BS \\"it's my throne, and he can't give it back to me, cause it's no his, how dare he suggest such as thing\\". Suure Ealyne, go and take Andor all by yourself from Forsaken, I'm suuuure you can do that withouth Rand's help.There's like 3 or 4 characters that are female and likable, others seem to use auto-label-maker that prints out \\"males are dumb\\" stickers for any reason.That's not saying that some of the male characters seem to have a hard case of dimm witness illness ( it's that other kind of Dark's One touch effect, I'm sure). But overall at least they are more sensible, they don't go around with thoughts on their mind as to how to show of the \\"superior male intelligence\\" - something that most female characters seems to be oppsessed with, making them insecure if anything.Well at any rate. Fan of the series - read this book, and learn how to skip through boring details for the next books. Other people won't bother to read this anyway, they'll go from the start, and by this time they'll know if they like the series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"One of the best fantasy series ever written. The characters are engaging and fun, and evolve throughout the series into compelling heroes and heroines. Even the villains and sub-characters' are fully developed, and their stories matter to the overall scheme.More than just fantasy, these books are fun - humor, sarcasm, comedy, battles of will, romance, tragedy, tear jerkers, and constant ironies with the characters' preconceptions, genders, ages, and culture.Beyond excellent characters, compelling plot twists, and an intriguing system of magic, this is one of the few epic fantasies written with the scope to compare to Tolkien's Middle Earth.

It is considered by many fans of the series as the best of the lot. In my mind it falls just behind The Shadow Rising, but I think it's the second book in the series. Lord of Chaos also marks the finest of the four acts that The Wheel of Time comprises (admittedly speaking with the final act incomplete).Nynaeve, Egwene, and Perrin, in limited action, all have Crowning Moments of Awesome. Rand's slipping sanity continues to become a major theme. Rand's journey is as dark, and as good, as it gets in The Wheel of Time. The city of Ebou Dar, one of the richer cultures in the series, is introduced and featured heavily.But not all is well with the world (of Wheel of Time characters). Elayne, on the other hand, shortly after it is made clear she knows less about leadership than a village wisdom despite being raised a princess (probably unsurprising given the historical success of hereditary nobility as providers of the aristocracy), sets forth on her now 7-book-long mission to demonstrate her firm grasp of the negative use of power while contributing absolutely nothing to the saving of the world most of the other \\"good\\" characters are busy with. Perrin and Faile make it into this book, but only barely. Considering where their character go in the next 7 books, perhaps we should be grateful. But what screen time Perrin does have in this book, he really makes count. But all of that is only hinted at here, whatever drag it will be on the later books.Lord of Chaos has one of the finest climaxes in the series. Not only is a great action sequence, but it brings a tremendous emotional weight and its ramifications reverberate through the rest of the series. It changes the world of the series.Book 6 is, I think, a good place to put the series down if you're no longer feeling it. The Wheel of Time remains the same kind of massive, sprawling story with dozens of different players maneuvering against each other for the next four or five books without significantly moving the story forward. Not that it's not still good, because I very much think it is, but if you're going to get that much of something you better like it and that sort of thing is better done in book 6 than anywhere else in the series.Lord of Chaos has the worst of all the hardback cover art, looking like something better suited for a bad romance novel.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

No inconsistencies, endless details. Still can't put it down. This book is as good as the first."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan has a tendency to exaggerate this weird struggle/dynamic between men and women. At some moments it can be so over the top, I suspect it's supposed to be campy. Is Jordan trying to appeal to young people or make fun of them? However, everything else in this book is solid stuff. It's just great fantasy."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While reading Lord of Chaos, I was at a loss about how to describe and grade this installment of the Wheel of Time. Upon finishing I came to the realization that Lord of Chaos marks the beginning of Act II of Robert Jordan's epic creation. In Lord of Chaos many plot threads are begun throughout but only the primary plot of Rand dealing with the Aes Sedai, with the beginning of the Asha'men involved as well, comes to a conclusion.Throughout Lord of Chaos there are many point-of-view characters to bring forth the various plot threads the book deals with. Many POVs are from the primary characters that have told the story throughout the series along with several new characters that added to the narrative, though some just a paragraph long. Because of all these POVs and plot threads, the climax of Lord of Chaos is very quick to take place. In the last 200 pages, days are literal compressed as events lead to the dramatic battle that highlights the book along with the resolution to the Rand-Aes Sedai storyline in the immediate aftermath. The one fault throughout the book wasn't the compression of the climax, it was the unnecessary retelling of events in the first five books by the primary characters. While a few were important in terms of character development, the vast majority weren't and it took up page space that could have been used for something else.Lord of Chaos is an important part of The Wheel of Time series, when you read it I recommend you view it as the beginning of Act II of Robert Jordan's epic tale. Viewing Lord of Chaos as a singular book will hurt your appreciation of it, but viewing the book as part of a greater whole will only add to your appreciation."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After five books, I'm totally sucked into the story.

It had many pros and a little con. the pros were: the creating of the black tower. the healing nyneave can do. and the last chapter is very good. there is also much much more. the bad sides are there are still long talks between nyneave and elayne. The boring tugging of braids, smoothing of skirts, and icy stares.The last chapter,Dumai's Wells, is my favorite because of the battle there. Over all it was the best so far to my opinion."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lord of Chaos is an excellent book, and one of the best in the series. Robert Jordan keeps up the strong scheming, action, politics, and emotions. His detailed descriptions and histories intice the reader, and paint a vivid picture of his world. The Wheel of Time series is a little slow, but only in the sense that such a large and intricate series takes a while to get to the end and give closure. In no way is this series boring.Rand is caught in an ever-downward spiral towards madness, and it is fascinating to read of Lews Therin's personal knowledge of the Forsaken and the One Power. It was also enjoyable to read about Mat, Egwene, and the Aiel. The Aes Sedai take on darker and more dangerous roles concerning Rand in this book. Depending on which characters you prefer, this book may have been more or less exciting compared to the others. To me, it was one of the best."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love the series Wheel of Time. Let's just say my grades are falling apart, and I don't care cuz I'm hooked.I think book six is a good example of Jordan's style of writing: he tends to get long-winded and add too much detail where it isn't needed. Also, he builds the reader's interest towards a particular end - then abruptly takes a left turn at the end of the book - i.e. Rand is planning to attack Illian (finally), but instead ends up in an Aes Sedai chest with daily beatings and on his way to the Amyrlin. This isn't that unusual, and I guess I'm getting used to it.However, overall this book is excellent! We're thrown deeper into the 'Rand is going crazy' plot, the Aes Sedai close a noose about Rand's neck, Mat spends his time just being annoying as usual (and I love it), and Perrin's relationship with Rand becomes even more muddled. The conclusion seems appropriate to the characters involved, and very exciting.Still left with some questions? I think Jordan's subplots might actually lead somewhere, but we have yet to find out just where he is going. Until we do, I'm as tied to his books as surely as Mat is tied to the Horn of Valere!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The series started off strong, and became even stronger. It soared to amazing heights in books 3 and 4, but quickly took the plunge afterwards. By the time book 6 comes along, the characters have nearly become unbearable, and the plot has dissolved into people winking around from place to place with none of the excitement of the journeys found in previous books. It seems to me that the plot has become so complex that Jordan is drowning in it, and no longer sees the overall flow of the story. I read book 7, and it was slightly better, but I'm still debating whether or not to continue the series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have at long last, managed to successfully quit reading a series. This is from somone who finished reading a Kevin J. Anderson series simply because I managed to make it through the first one (Sorry, Kevin, but you suck). The first 3 or so books were good reads, and I had made it through the fifth (I think) in about two weeks when I discovered something. This author is continuing to write books for money, and will drag this series along until he has wrung every last nickel out of it. There quite easily could be ten books to this series and frankly, I just can't make it. Reminds me of when Frank Herbert kept writing Dune novels simply because they kept throwing money at him. Terry Goodkind did a much better job with this type of story."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After 1000+ pages, can any reviewer honestly state this book is not a literary train-wreck. I tell you with a straight face that this book crippled my interest in fantasy, and for over a year after I threw it down in frustration (page 612), I was unable to pick up a fictional work - I was that frustrated.

Following the readers review I bought straight the 9 first books. What a mistake. the Game of Thrones or even Sword of truth series are far better than the Wheel of time serie. It is as if Robert Jordan is paid by the line like the french writers from the 19th century, Balzac, Flaubert etc...So far I have finished 1 to 7. From the 4th (till 7th) they just are impossible to finish. Like chewing branflakes forever and being unable to swallow it.I really regret I went further the third.Do not make my mistake unless slow rythm and low level action is what you seek.Robert Jordan has also the gift for beginning threads of stories with no intention of closing them, creating new characters without really caring to give them substance, depth or real influence on the plot.My recommendation: read the 3 first ones, and then taste the 4th, if you have the patience and like it carry on. If not don't hope it'll get better and you'll get some action or anything ...stop right there.Same with the 5th etc...Don't buy them all at once like me.This a real never ending story, not even close to that, and it just gets slower and slower with more and more characters...I hate it, but may be you won't.My bet ? you will."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First your alarm goes off and you want to shut it off.

I live in the Bronx and work in Manhattan, so most of my reading is on the subway to and from work. I'm one of those people who can't read in bed...I am so fed up with Jordan. After reading the books of Tolkien and David Eddings (whose books are really great!!), I got spoiled for stories that move along and characters you really care about. I can't say that for Jordan's epic wordfest!!!I'm half way thru book 6. I figure I've read around 5,000 pages of this stuff. I can't say that I really love the series, but since I've invested so much time in it, I need to see it through, but these characters are so pathetic. You can't even like them. The ones you do like disappear for hundreds or thousands of pages. What's up with that?!!! By the time they come back, you've forgotten who they were. I find myself now, not even caring about characters or not even knowing who they are or what they are doing. Why should I care?If only Jordan would cut out a couple hundred pages and make you feel that there is something to look forward to. I was excited today because I got to page 498. Thank God!!

I just can't seem to be able to put it down. In just three days of reading I'm on page 577.In this book there is a very large plot twist and lots of action. It also reveals many of the plans of all of the main characters and groups, such as: Rand, Sammael, Pedron Niall, the Shaido Aiel, Morgase, and the Little Tower. It developes many relationships between many of the main characters, and all in all, is so far a great book. If you enjoy fantasy then I suggest you pickup the series at it's beginning, but if this is the book that you're on in the WoT, then I suggest you pick it up. Even if you didn't finish The Fires of Heaven I would suggest that you pick up this book and read it, because what Jordan lost in his fifth book he finds in the sixth book."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is one of the best books from the Wheel of Time Series.

But i still believe it is the best wheel of time book"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Another massive tome from fantasy writer Robert Jordan leads to more questions than answers. Rand begins to pull together a group of men who can channel, while big changes are in store for Egwene, Nyaneve, and Elayne. Some new characters are introduced including a false dragon named Taim who looks like he'll be around for a while, and a welcome addition back to the fold is Perrin and his wife Faile. My only beef with the book is Jordan's need for an editor. After reading again and again about how low or high a bodice is cut, and the inner details of city after city it begins to get tedious by page seven hundred.I also didn't think this book really took off until about half way through with scads of exposition to wade through. Still, you have to marvel at a man who can write the volume he does with no apparent end in sight and still manage to keep his characters mostly compelling."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I don't really post many reviews on here so I'm not completely sure if I'm allowed to flame the other reviewers, so I'll just give it a try and say that most of you are idiots that shouldn't have been reading a series as great as this in the first place, stick to something simpler like Lord of the Rings, or one of it's many obvious rip-offs if you can't handle complexity in a fantasy series. Now, it's honestly been years since I last read this, and I only looked on here because with my brother beginning to read the series my interest was once again rejuvenated and I decided I wanted to see what people thought of what may possibly be my favorite entry in the series. The great mystery of who Demandred is was one definite enticement with this installment, from the first section of the prologue where he first speaks with the Dark One in the Pit of Doom to the very last cryptic paragraph where the Dark One is seemingly pleased with whatever it was Demandred accomplished during the course of these 1000 pages. A mystery I'm sure no one will know the true answer to until the 12th book is released. I also really enjoyed the political aspect of this though most people oddly cite this as a negative aspect (which is the same thing people did with the Star Wars prequels). To me the politics really adds a lot more depth and makes it all feel all the more real. If there's one thing that can't be taken away from Jordan it's that the world he has created is unbelievably comprehensive and it's almost hard to believe one person came up with all this, and can keep track of all of it. And while The Fires of Heaven and The Shadow Rising had plenty more action than this (these are my two other favorites in the series, but before any of you assume I'm on that whole \\"the series starts to suck down the road\\" bandwagon I'll have you know the only entry I found boring was book 10 but I still thought it was necessary in the end), what this book builds up to, the eventual real payoff, is one of the goriest, most amazing battles ever written and I defy anyone to name me it's equal. But maybe it isn't so thrilling for some, personally I was a big horror fan before I got into fantasy, mostly reading Stephen King, so I really appreciate the horror elements sometimes thrown into Wheel of Time and I definitly appreciate and adore a climax that ends with a literal hill-sized pile of human body parts laying in the middle of the battlefield. Which, the introduction of Mazrim Taim and everything to do with the Asha'man and the Black Tower was great, Taim is one of my favorite characters to read about and for a good while I really thought he was Demandred (Book 9 really squashed that theory). This book also impressed me because it was the first (correct me if I'm wrong) to include instances where things the reader thought impossible became possible, changing the rules of that particular fictional world. The two biggest I can recall off the top of my head being Nynaeve actually undoing Logain's gentling and Rand being able to break free while (I can't remember the number of Aes Sedai required to do this but I'll guess 6 or 9) Aes Sedai had him shielded. When these two instances occured I nearly shat my pants, while some people might scoff at this with their cynical \\"it's a fantasy novel anything can happen\\" claptrap, for me I have so much invested in this made-up world, I believe so much of it, that it can at times be as amazing to hear these marvels as it is to hear that a real human being defied gravity, or cancer has been cured. Which this book kind of opened the door and there has been some other instances in the series like this, like the breath-taking finale for book 9 where Rand with the help of others, chiefly Nynaeve actually cleanses the male half of the source, talk about awesome. Anyways I only wish I remembered more off the top of my head that happened in this one, I get the idea if I go on too long I'll mistake something from another book for something from this book, so I'll stop now and just hope that this review goes to the top (I'm not completely sure how this site works but I hope it's newest review first) so I can break up all the negativity on the first page of this site because frankly, a book this good deserves much better and to anyone reading these negative reviews and getting the wrong thoughts in their heads, just keep in mind there's always gotta be someone out there who hates something, the difference is you don't see me posting non thorough reviews about the things I don't like, personally I just ignore their existence and let the people who enjoy it enjoy it, that's not to say there should be no dissenting views on any kind of work posted, but they ought to be from actual fans with some in depth points on what was wrong with it instead of short, obviously biased, piles of drivel that just call the book boring, complex and political, with no insight whatsoever."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this is an excellent book I read awhile ago...just purchased for my son...this book was in excellent condition..."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really didn't like this one, that title character does seam very pointless and I hope he doesn't come back in later books.

Let me tell you though, If I read one more page devoted entirely to an outfit, or hear about how stubborn yet beautiful a woman is I'm heading straight for the wood chipper and I'm heaving my friends books in. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is for the fact that the series started out with some scope, a tenuous grasp on something larger than the world of man.

And, to be honest, it really doesn't. But why is that? Hmmmmm. It seems to me that any author, no matter how good he/she may be, might tend to take a while telling a story that is THIS BIG. The plot involves the entire freaking world, OK? Cut RJ a little slack. The events of this story do not just happen to a few random people in a tiny corner of the world. Everyone gets into this one. The Seanchan, the Sea Folk, the people of \\"Randland\\" (of which there are close to 15 different countries all warring against one another, and conflicts galore, be they religious, military, political, racial, or gender), the Aiel, and All the Bad Guys. Whew. I've got to give props to anyone that can maintain that kind of story.An entire world can be changed in one book. Watership Down brings us rabbits whose world is turned upside down, their lifestyles and habits had to be changed to suit this new world . . . and it is a single volume of work. And a damn good one, too. But those were rabbits. We're humans, with greater differences and more power . . . there's gonna be a lot of conflict for that kind of world to be turned upside down. And Jordan's telling us about it all.Almost all our plot points are advanced in some way . . . Even Moiraine. For some reason, the reader gets the feeling that she's not really gone. She's coming back. We don't know why we get this feeling (or do we?), but it's there, nagging at us. There are powers, things that can be done with the One Power, that were never imagined before. A more balanced situation between the sexes comes with the formation of the Black Tower, and the pledging of the . . . (oh, wait, no spoilers!!). Perrin comes back (*grunting* a la Tim Allen) and his weird wife. Oh, did I say that out loud?Anyway, all joking aside, this is an excellent addition to an excellent series, and I remain a loyal fan. And the Battle of Dumai's Wells still gives me the shivers."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Am I the only one who thinks Jordan hates women? Why are all his female characters so manipulative, competative, and controlling? His books tend to start by re-intoducing the characters (since you may not have seen them in 1000 pages), setting up things tediously for 500 pages, then concluding in an exciting finale that somehow makes you ready to trudge through the next one. For a lovely reduction of the plot (which is pretty cool) and better writing, see the myriad of Wheel of Time fan-webpages."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Two things keep popping up in every negative review of any of the books in this series. One, everyone seems to think the books are too long, and for seemingly no purpose. Of course, Tolstoy makes Jordan look like a captionist for the New York Times, so remember, it could be worse. Two, everyone hates Jordan's women, especially Nynaeve. I can sympathize. So why not skip the female-bonding chapters? I have for the last three or so books and have discovered it's a much better read, and on top of that, I've discovered that it seems that what the women do (which really only amounts to whining about or bullying the men, anyway) is ultimately unessential to the plot. You will feel guilty the first few times you do this, but believe me, you'll be better off for it. And all those wonderful reviews! Sheesh! I can't imagine what they'd consider to be rubbish."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've been reading The Wheel of Time books for about 4 months now (I only read on my lunch hour, hence, the length of time in which it has taken to get this far). When I completed The Lord of Chaos, I threw the book down. I was completely irritated and more than a little frustrated to find that it had ended the way it had. I had so many questions running through my mind and I felt totally ripped off. Moghedian was set free, why? Had Egwene ever reached Tar Valon to over-ride Elaidas rule there and make the Tower whole again? Did Mat ever find and marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons? Did Faile ever forgive Perrin for whatever it was she thought he did? Did Elayne and Nyneave find the bowl ter'angreal? Will Loial return to the stedding to marry Erith? Who did Rand actually end up with; Min, Elayne or Aviendha, and whichever it was, what happened to the other two? Of course, let's not forget the Dark One....did he ever destroy the world, or did Rand conquer all evil and set the world to rights? So many questions and so few answers. I actually advised my best friend NOT to read the entire book, but maybe just the last couple of chapters. Then I found out there actually IS a 7th book in the series, but I'm a little hesitant to go out and buy it. Will it read as the last 3 in the series have? Lacking in action and intrigue while going overboard with details that have already been mentioned 1000 times. Afterall, How many times do you have to told what and Aes Sadai is? I don't know that I'd recommend this series to anyone, simply because of the dissatisfaction of the last 3 books, and if you've already started the series, then stop at the 3rd."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"These books are now apparently being churned out for the purpose of making money for Mr. Jordan, or else we are getting Mr. jordan's 'stream of consciousness' as he writes these books. To state it simply in a few words- this book is filled with the same boring stuff over and over again, for 900 pages.The point is, Long does not equal Good, as some people idiotically assume. The dictionary is long, but does it make for good reading? Do I read for the sake of reading endless descriptions? I love reading, and I have been an avid reader since the age of 7. Unfortunately that doesn't mean I like to waste time reading about the following:Rand wanders the countryside making and breaking alliances. The Aes Sedai bicker, complain about men, and scheme. The Dark One laughs hideously in the background and plans evil machinations.That about summarizes the plot. The rest of the book is filler. I can read descriptions, but if that's all a book is, there's something wron with it. I don't want to know exactly what everyone eats for dinner every day, or what their hemline is. I don't like reading pages of &quot;Ninaeve tugged her hair&quot; &quot;Elayne smoothed her skirt&quot;(how many times has that sentence been used in the series?!) &quot;Rand didn't understand women&quot; etc.This book is turning into a boring teenage soap opera where various people try to enter into various relationships and bicker and quarrel and are petulant and jealous CONSTANTLY. If you want to read that, go ahead. If you want good fantasy look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After 900 MORE PAGES of text, I found that the characters I was at least vaguely interested in during the first and second installments of this rediculously long series are simply annoying. Rand: With a name that sounds suspiciously like Randall, he is the stereotypical uninteresting hero blessed with enormous power. The only reason I was ever interested in this character was that he was supposed to go insane, and what's more intriguing than a character skirting madness? Well, that was brought up in book two. This is book six, and although Lews Therin's nut-job voice is ringing in his head, Rand himself seems quite sane. He has no decent sense of humor, no personality, no beliefs, no nothing. He does have a half-realized love for min and about every other female character that comes his way, but that falls through the roof just like every other sub-plot that's been dropped in this story. Every female character is boring except for Nynaeve, whose strange love for Lan was also dropped as a sub-plot along the way. Plus, although she does have a personality, she is so completely unlikable that I visibly cringe every time dialogue is given to her. She's just going to complain or make some kind of sexist comment. The only intelligent or witty character, Thom Merrilin, is no longer intelligent or witty, and his delightful play at being a paltry magician that was so cool in the first book has evaporated. He's now under Nynaeve's domineering thumb. The Aes Sedai are about as entertaining as a root canal, and when they're not busy talking about how they hate all men, they're insulting their fellow &quot;sisters&quot;, incubating plots that will most likely never hatch, or &quot;bending&quot; the truth-but never outright lying-to achieve thier ends. Which brings me to the most annoying thing about not only this story, but about the whole series: The battle of the sexes. This whole gender war angle was slightly amusing at first, but I couldn't help but be constantly offended by the fact that the men always lost every argument or conflict to a herd of dim-witted female characters. But then again, what competition can there be with male characters as stupid and sometimes juvenile as they are in this book? So what saved this book from from getting one star? The battle at Dumai Wells. Action! Excitement! Something actually happened!This single action scene was a ray of sunshine in an otherwise confusing quagmire of forgotten sub-plots and one-sided characters. I stopped reading the series with this book, because I decided to go read books where plot lines reached conclusions. So if you just can't wait for the final battle between Rand and the dark one, too bad, because you WILL wait . . .

This was the book that started the decline. I loved the books in the beginning of the series. However, the books started taking weird turns that I found completely unnecessary including the three girls bonding to the Dragon Reborn. It was just a disturbing and unnecessary twist to the story line. The story grew so tiring."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've noticed some people complaining that this book, and even this series altogether, moves slowly due to the overuse of details. I'll admit that if I didn't want details, then whatever I did, I wouldn't read Robert Jordan or Frank Herbert or anyone else that set a higher standard for sci-fi / fantasy writing by providing dedicated READERS with what they wanted; DETAILS! Robert Jordan could have written 30 books in this series and I'd be all the happier because the characters have detail, the world has detail, and the plots have detail! For those of you that want more than just an expanded outline I highly recommend this book and all the other books that go along with it. Take your time and take it all in. You'll absolutely love it! For those of you that don't like details I recommend you watch a movie or read a magazine rather than a novel. In fact, maybe it'd be best if you didn't read at all. Think about it. If you insist on reading there's a good chance that you'll search for highly rated books and award winning authors only to be disappointed when you realize that the good stories are detailed. And to the person complaining that the women and men in this book(series) are not realistic, I recommend you read something non-fiction rather than fantasy. You might be less frustrated if you do so, and as it sounds from the point of view of any avid fantasy reader you may as well be complaining that the use of magic and the inclusion of fantastical creatures aren't realistic. It's called Fantasy for a reason!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Except for a bad CD in the set, Amazon customer service just outshines them self on the replacement.

When I got the call from my local bookstore that The Lord Of Chaos was in, I actually tremble with excitement. Some people are saying how long and drawn out the plots are and that the characters are not maturing. Open your eyes people! Jordan has done something to me that no author has done since Tolkien. I find myself constantly in the series rereading my favorite parts. The scope and depth of this series is unbelievable. Lord of Chaos was everything I had hoped for and more. I have been reading this series now for almost four and a half years, far longer than I waited for any other series to be completed. I would wait another five years; that's how much I love this vast tapestry that Jordan has spun. I have read A Crown of Swords, and I cannot wait to get my hot little hands on the next book. The best way I can describe this series to someone who has not yet read it, is that it is a journey. Every book in the series that I finish is the closing of a journey, and I wish to God that I had not read the first book yet, so I could experience all the wonder, sorrow, joy, and magic that this series has given me.

It shows his great ability to write a story with a numerous amount of characters that are almost all equally important. I also like his new addition of writing from the Forsakens' perspective. He may not be as popular as Tolkien but he can definitly write just as well if not better. This book answers so many questions about, The Wheel of Time series, but asks so many more. If you do read this, which I highly suggest, make sure you have nothing planned for the next few hours.

No doubt a fair percentage of them watch the daytime soaps that run for 20+ years...Quantity doesn't mean quality. Another review stated that an author writing a &quot;series&quot; keeps going until he &quot;runs out of ideas.&quot; NOT TRUE. A series should be as long as it needs to be without meandering. LOTR was three books (4 if you count The Hobbit) but every page meant something, served a purpose, moved the story forward. WOT treads water.Is Jordan getting paid by the page? Or by the word? Where ten words could suffice, Jordan uses two hundred and fifty.I have just enough interest in these characters to keep me reading the series, but I don't need page-long descriptions of everyone's hair, breeches, chin, face, skirt, expression, cleavage, skin color, sweat, shoes, etc. Or the furniture, paintings, murals, carpet, ceilings, gardens, horses, inns, dust and brambles around them.Why does every character we meet, however minor, need a first name, last name, physical description, brief history, etc.? If there's an innkeeper, just call her &quot;innkeeper,&quot; not &quot;Mistress so-and-so, a Taraboner, with a high-pitched voice and a round face, not beautiful but handsome, wearing a dress which would have put any Domani woman to shame, a low neckline displaying considerable cleavage, and black, curly hair falling to her shoulders, with a gleam in her eye, blah blah blah.&quot;NO ONE CARES.I have given up keeping track of people, especially the 200 different Aes Sedai and the 450 servants we've met along the way. I no longer care where the countries are in relation to one another, or who rules them, or who leads the armies, because it simply doesn't matter.Perhaps Jordan alone isn't to blame. We keep buying his books. And who the heck is the editor? I will be moving on to 7 and 8, eventually, but I feel no sense of urgency since apparently this story will never end."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I can't believe the number of good reviews I've seen on this book. This volume advances the plot by so little, it could have been done in 100 pages or less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's getting sick and tired of the endless bantering, ranting and raving of the women in the book (especially Nynaeve). It seems like Mr. Jordan is determined to just make all of the female characters in the book look like fools (he's doing a great job so far). I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books, but now I'm not so sure. It seems that Jordan is just going to drag this series out for as long as it takes. The writing is getting worse, the situations are getting less interesting, and it seems that he's writing to an audience of 12-year-old boys."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This review is for the casual fantasy novel reader, not teenage/young adult fanatics of the series.Okay, for all of you that have made it through the first five books and are wondering whether or not to continue, don't. The first four books are pretty solid work, well-developed and fun to read, if not a little long (where is his editor I wonder). But beginning in book 5 everything starts to slow way down. Book 6 is 900 pages and nothing happens. Even worse, the two stated goals at the beginning are not met by the end and it takes the author 100 pages in book seven to wrap things up. Finally, the characters are becoming less and less likeable in each novel, which makes you wonder what's the point?My advice is to read something by David Eddings or Terry Brooks, the true leaders in this field."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I do not like to harry the readers with a long for/against review.

I thought it was the best ending of any wheel of time book so far (which is saying something). It left me breathless with its power. I also liked the quick scene shifts of the epilogue. The beginning, a long awaited dialogue with the Dark One and a description of Shayol Ghul were quality parts as well. And, there were some interesting parts with the forsaken in them. So, flashes of brilliance. But in between there was just a little too much chaff : irrelevant scenes and political minutae. I did not mind this because I like that sort of thing in limited amounts. But this book was the limit. Now we need a return to the fast paced development of the first four books in the series. I liked the host of new characters, particularly the various Tower Aes Sedai, but I hope this has not opened up too many sub plots. The series has slowed and needs to pick up speed again. And it needs to do it NOW."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am an avid reader - I read close to 2-3 books a month. Ever since I laid my hands on the Eye of the World, though, I have been wrapped up in this amazing story. However, I feel that I need to say something about the reviews I have been reading of the Wheel of Time series, and I have to say that some of these reviewers are only in for the &quot;quick fix&quot;. I only have one thing to say to them - &quot;If you don't like reading, don't&quot;. This is by far one of the most fantastic and imaginative series I have ever read. Robert Jordan is a creative individual who has done an exquisite job of relating his story to the reader. He uses the descriptive voice like no other that I have read. &quot;When something can be described by 10 words, he uses 250&quot;. So what? Do you think he enjoys writing these long books? He's trying to paint a picture of this world of his, and it's fascinating. Keeping track of the characters in the book is really not that hard if you pay attention, especially when there's a &quot;glossary&quot; in the back of the book to remind you if you do forget. Savor each page, each word, because it is truly a beautiful story.I have just finished Book 6, and I have to say that this story just gets better and better. Questions are answered, while new ones spring up. Mysteries that are solved only lead to deeper mysteries that you had no idea were there. The compliment of characters gives this series every possible point of view you can get. I started this series only a few months ago, and I have been obsessed by it. The descriptions of Jordan's world are almost at enjoyable to read as the interaction between the characters. Reviewers complain that the series is too long - that's because they must not enjoy reading. Me, I hope this series goes on for a while. I have never truly gotten this much enjoyment from a series of books ever. If you read this series, please have the mind set that this is not something to rush through. Lose yourself in it, get whisked away to the Aiel Waste or to Andor and enjoy the great work of this extremely imaginative author."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There are tons of reviews out there that will tell you that this is a horrible book, slow, verbose, and dull, and just as many that will tell you this book is the best they've ever read, etc. The truth lies somewhere in between. If you like Robert Jordan's previous works (which, seeing as you're considering reading the sixth, you probably do) then you are going to love this book. The conclusion of this book (which the cover - horribly drawn as it is - alludes to) is arguably the best of all those in the Wheel of Time series. It's dramatic, frought with tension, and rather chilling. Personally, I feel that the 600+ pages that get you there aren't that bad either; they are also some of the best Jordan has written. If you don't like his style or his story, though, you won't like it and I don't recommend it. It's as simple as that. But for any Jordan fan - well, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This review is intended for people who have not read the series yetand not as a discussion piece.I was thrilled by Lord of Chaos. I have read a lot of disparagingremarks about this book from supposed Wheel of Time fans, but thisbook did not live up to their badmouthing. For one thing, the storytakes a noticeably different track than the previous books, focusingon the developments laid in The Fires of Heaven. In other words, thisbook does not follow the \\"pack up and leave\\" storylines of theprevious five books. With a few exceptions, the characters are notjourneying, but are dealing with developments as other characters cometo them. I found this quite refreshing.I expected Lord of Chaos to be a dud because I knew that there wereseveral events in the storyline that had to take place, and at the endof The Fires of Heaven, none of them seemed close to happening.Quite the contrary, Lord of Chaos shows new windows into previouslyneglected areas, including The Forsaken, men who channel, and severalother areas. The workings of Aes Sedai are further fleshed out by theevents in Salidar --- I really like reading about the ceremonies in away that is relevant to the characters. That is particularlysatisfying in a way that The Star Wars prequels just were not.Further disappointment in my expectations occurs in the last third ofthe book where no fewer than six major twists occur in the plot.These were things that I totally did not expect. In other words, thefirst six hundred pages are merely good and the last three hundred areincredible. I was blown away by things starting at around page 600.The story picked up phenomenally at that point. The conclusion iseven more earth-shattering. The story totally did not go the way Ithought and it was very entertaining.Keep reading. The only recommendation I have is to have a copy of ACrown of Swords on hand for when you finish. There is littleresolution after the thrilling final scene, except some setup for thenext book. A Crown of Swords even begins with a retelling of thefinal scene of Lord of Chaos, which I welcomed.I am still anxiously waiting to be disappointed by these books: so farI haven been thrilled."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While other fantasy-writers always seem eager to tell their story and get it over with, Jordan really puts the story in second place. This saga is one of feeling and emotions of good and evil and of lies and truth. While reading this series you will find yourself in an absurd world that so cunningly written that the thin barrier between reality and fantasy seems to vanish. This book in particular hasn't got much real progress for Rand on his way to the Last Battle; the Forsaken are still roaming the earth and the Dark One is still terrorising the people with an everlasting summer. Still this book doesn't get boring. Jordan invests a lot of energy in deepening out his characters which I think is very important. Most writers can't get to this point, because it uses up a lot of paper. Jordan doesn't seem interested in saving paper, he knows what a good story needs. I can't wait to see Rand win the Last Battle. On the other hand, I would have to find a new hobby, then."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The sixth book of The Wheel of Time takes us deep into the second act of this massive story, with the transition to a more political-oriented narrative continuing apace. Lord of Chaos is one of the more divisive books in the series, with fans praising its deeper exploration of ideas and intrigue, whilst critics bemoan the slow pace of the book compared to earlier volumes.The kingdoms of Cairhien, Mayene and Tear are now sworn to the Dragon Reborn, and a successful raid on Caemlyn, capital of Andor, has seen that city fall to his forces as well. Several of the Forsaken, the most powerful servants of the Dark One, have been slain and Rand's successes look like they will continue unabated. In the south, he is assembling a vast army to send against the Forsaken Sammael in his stronghold of Illian, whilst the Aes Sedai remain divided on how to proceed with him. However, Rand's announcement of an amnesty for men who can channel has shocked the world, for all male channellers of the One Power are doomed to go mad and die, wreaking havoc as they go, and some of his enemies are prepared to move against him before that can be allowed to happen.The theme of the sixth book in The Wheel of Time is consolidation. Rand's forces have absorbed vast amounts of territory, but before he can resume his campaign he must secure that which he holds already. With scheming against him in Andor and Cairhien underway and an outright rebellion going on in Tear, this proves a difficult task. Rand also has to find a way of dealing with both factions of the Aes Sedai, an undertaking fraught with peril. His companions also have their own problems to deal with: Perrin must prove his worthiness to his wife's parents, Mat has to deal with the issues of becoming a general, and Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve have complex currents to negotiate amongst the rebel Aes Sedai. Even Pedron Niall, commander of the Children of the Light, has significant problems he has to overcome in both his own ranks and his dealings with the displaced Queen of Andor, whilst the surviving Forsaken scheme incessantly against one another.The problem with this kind of stock-taking is that it is hard to work up a dramatic story about it. Instead, you end up with lots and lots of talk. Characters sitting around talking about the plot, about what has already happened and what they think might happen in the future. That's when they are not engaged in increasingly tedious and infantile discussions about male-female relations, which by this volume are starting to get a mite repetitive. The politicking and intrigue is fine as far as it goes (although fans of GRRM or Bakker may find it a bit on the shallow and simplistic side), but you do need a bit more to spice the book up. There's some fine, atmospheric interludes in the book, such as Rand taking a brief sojourn in the desolate, cursed city of Shadar Logoth, but overall the novel has serious pacing issues. Simply put, this is a 1,000-page book in which not a lot happens for the first three-quarters of it.Towards the end, however, the pace starts to lift quite noticeably as Rand's attempts to play the two Aes Sedai factions off against one another backfire spectacularly and some of the most surprising events in the entire series take place, culminating in a massive battle at the spring of Dumai's Wells in which Jordan's sometimes-variable skills at depicting action, drama and the ability to tie together disparate storylines are put to their best effect. This late burst of action sequences and confrontations is extremely effective, and Dumai's Wells often tops readers' polls as the most satisfying moment of the entire series to date, with some fine moments right at the end of the book which hint at much greater things to come.Lord of Chaos (****) is a sedentary novel where events unfold slowly, but do succeed in laying the groundwork for the spectacular and satisfying concluding section of the book. I suspect many readers will be put off by the slow pace, but I found the payoff to be more than worth it. The novel is available in the UK from Orbit and in the USA from Tor."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The narrative hits some snags again in this book (as I felt it did in book four), but still results in a strong read by one of the best fantasy writers of our time. Some of the subplots begin to drag on and you don't feel that page-burning speed that is in the other books. There are some great plot twists here that leave you wondering what else Jordan has up his sleeve for future volumes. While the pace of the overall story decreases in this book, Jordan still pleases in the end. Recommended strongly to fans of the series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"That line basically sums up the feeling of _Lord of Chaos_. This is Rand's book, regardless of what happens to other characters. Perrin and Faile reapper? That's nice. Nynaeve and Elayne have difficulty readjusting to life under Aes Sedai guidance? Oh well. Mat and the Band of the Red Hand plan for war and end up visiting the Aes Sedai? Not that exciting. In fact, only three really important things happen in this book that *don't* happen to Rand: one happens to Nynaeve, one to Egwene, and Mat makes a fateful journey to Ebou Dar. By doing so, we learn that he's really very serious about keeping his word, something that just never seemed like Mat before. So there is character development for the other characters. But Rand is the focus of the attention. Whether he's in Caemlyn or Cairhien, whether he's dealing with Davram Bashere, the most powerful man in Saldaea, or Mazrim Taim, the false Dragon, or various Aes Sedai delegations, Rand's hardening of himself is the focal point of _Lord of Chaos_. Min becomes much more important, since she is the only one that Rand fails to drive away, and so becomes the person he depends on the most, and the only one who can make him see reason. Rand and Lews Therin (in his head) have a few good conversations when Rand has nothing else to do, in what is possibly the biggest bungle the Aes Sedai have made in the series so far. _Lord of Chaos_ is filled with scenes that are emotional and touching, but also with battle (Dumai's Wells is the greatest bloodbath seen in _The Wheel of Time_ so far.. sort of a medieval battle with a few landmines added) and definitely shows the greatest character development for Rand as he goes from a suspicious but still occasionally likable guy into a machine of a man. Although this change is good in _Lord of Chaos_, it gets the better of Jordan in later books as it becomes almost impossible to sympathize with Rand, unlike in the earlier books."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Imagine a reporter following around a cranky old couple and recording all their bickering. For 10 years.Now take that bickering and add tedious descriptions of such amazing items as pots, pans, horse saddles, dresses, taverns, and furniture.Now add references to breasts after each of these unnessesary descriptions. Better yet - tie breasts into that description somehow.Next, throw in some interesting fantasy concepts based on Eastern philosophy. Before this takes off and the reader actually starts to get interested, though, add more of the bickering. And a few more breast references. Also, take 13 pages to inform the reader that the protagonist has left their room at the inn and is now in the horse stables.Do this for 900 pages.Viola! You now have Robert Jordan's Lord of Chaos, Fires of Heaven, and, judging by the reviews, every other book that follows in this series.Don't get me wrong - I was a big fan of this series. I loved the plot, the concepts Jordan introduced, the Aiel, Aes Sedai, Dragon Reborn, etc. He started with a great story.Unfortunately he doesn't end with one.Most people mention book 6 or 7 turning them off. I started to get suspicious after book 3. That was the first time I finished and said to myself, \\"Wait, it took him 600 pages for THAT?\\" Book 4 was even worse, but I was still into it. Book 5 was when I realized it was an ongoing theme. Book 6 was the last straw. I'm done.Specifically, here's what I have against the Wheel of Time:Detail - There's good detail and bad detail. Tolkein gave histories, insights into dwarven and elvish culture, etc. Things that enriched his fictional universe. This is good detail. A whole page describing what type of dress Nyneve is wearing is not good detail. Two pages describing what Rand saw as he walked to the stables is not good detail. If you take 900 pages to write a book that would have been twice as good if it were 450 pages, you're not giving good detail.Breasts - Why is Jordan so obsessed with these? The guy goes out of his way to mention breasts. \\"Egwene folded her arms beneath her breasts\\", \\"The necklace that held the two rings hanging between Nyneve's breasts\\", \\"Elayne caught sight of almost-too-low-cut dress that showed part of her breasts.\\" Robert - just write a detailed, thorough, graphic love scene for yourself and get it all out of your system. Honestly. His books read like a 14 year old boy's mental commentary while watching Desperate Housewives.The Women - Jordan's mental archetype of women appears to be a stubborn, cantankerous, petty, insecure, attractive woman with (you guessed it), prominent breasts. Was his mother this way? Sisters? Wife? I can't help but wonder, seeing as every woman in his books has the exact same personality. And unfortunately that personality is very annoying.Nynaeve tugged her braid - Just go ahead and call the next book in this series: The Wheel of Time: Nynaeve Tugged Her Braid.Those are just a few. I really liked this series to begin with. I wish Jordan had gone a different route than he did, but I can't take it anymore. There are too many other good books out there to waste time reading 900 pages about Nynaeve's dresses, Perrin not understanding women, Elayne thinking Rand is a wool-headed man, and, of course, Egwene folding her arms under her breasts.That is all."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I do not understand those who claim that &quot;nothing is happening&quot; in LOC. Did you actually read the book?-The Black Tower is established.-Egwene becomes Amyrlin and starts moving against Elaida, accepting what the rebels tried to deny so long (broken tower).-Nynaeve discovers how to heal stilling/gentling.-Alanna binds Rand as a warder.-Aes Sedai take Rand captive.-Rand makes Aes Sedai swear fealty.-Wise Ones partake in battle.-Forsaken coming back from the dead.And more. &quot;Nothing happening&quot;?Compare this to the first book.-They run from the trollocs.-They run from the Myrdraal.-They run from the trollocs.-They still run from the trollocs.Apart from the last few chapters, there is not more happening/being revealed than in book 6. I don't hear anybody complain about that though. Is it more exciting because people face the possibility of death, and we don't know yet that certain characters can't die before Tarmon Gaidon?So how much &quot;revealing&quot; and &quot;happening&quot; do you want? And how do you want it? As a bulleted list? Or as a summary in a history book, as brief and concise as possible? There's a difference between a reporter and a writer, and Jordan does an excellent job showing that he belongs to the latter category. I'd much rather read and enjoy these close to 1000 pages, than having a 10 page summary of &quot;what is happening&quot;, missing all the important details and undercurrents. Missing having enough information to envision this world and what is happening.Fund a fantasy newspaper if you can't handle skillfully written books."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The climactic end of The Fires of Heaven saw several Forsaken dead or captured. Lanfear was killed by Moiraine. Rahvin was balefired out of existence by Rand. Asmodean was killed by some nameless character (to be revealed much later). And Moghedian was captured by Nynaeve. And by now you should see a pattern. Forsaken are killed off in odd numbered books. Balthamael and Aginor in Book 1. Be'lal and Ishamael in Book 3. The above in Book 5.Now, at the start of Lord of Chaos, Rand is in charge of both Cairhien and Caemlyn. During his stretches of the book, at least in the first 3/4, we see lots of diplomatic maneuvering between Rand and Aes Sedai in both cities mentioned previously. One diplomatic mission is from Tar Valon. The other from Salidar. Both sets of Aes Sedai seek control over Rand, although one set appears to be \\"nicer\\" than the other. Either way, during the book if you already had some contempt for the Aes Sedai you're going to love hating them even more because they are some of the most petty, nasty and insufferable women of the entire series. How far they have fallen from the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.Meanwhile, during the Egwene sections of the book, and her POV is the second greatest, we see her being summoned to Salidar. This is quite sad. Why? Because her POV gave us insight into the Aiel, probably the most interesting people of the entire series. Now, without her there, we see her POV among the Aes Sedai of Salidar.After Rand and Egwene, the other sections of the book focus on way too many characters. Jordan fractures his book into so many points of view that one wonders if he was trying to make his book into a simulacrum of the Patterns of the Ages. For instance, while The Fires of Heaven had 20 points of view, Lord of Chaos had 47 different points of view. The man was clearly in love with his own writing and needed a better editor to tell him to focus on the main characters and stop introducing new characters. Still, the chapters on Nynaeve are probably some of my favorite of the series. Why? Because between this book and the next, Nynaeve comes to certain conclusions and we are invited to see those same conclusions. One of them is that the Aes Sedai are always convinced that they know more than they do. This features quite prominently in one particular scene where Nynaeve successfully does something that not even the Age of Legends Aes Sedai managed to do.Mat also appears in the book. I have to admit I used to hate Mat. But during this reread I actually grew to like Mat and understand him better. His points of view are always interesting in that he keeps being pushed to do something he doesn't want to do, and yet he does it really well. He also has one particular memory that is interesting for those who enjoy the history of the Randlands.Perrin appears too. And with him, Faile - the most juvenile and nasty character of the entire series. Seriously, certain Forsaken appear better than Faile does. Some of Faile's actions will leave you wondering how anyone could love this abusive person. Towards the beginning of the book Perrin feels the pull of Rand on him and journeys to him. At least this gets his plot line entwined back with Rand. Sadly, Mat is now with Aviendha and Egwene in Salidar/Ebou Dar. Ah well, can't have everything. And the Perrin-Rand plot line leads to Dumai's Wells. One of the favorite scenes for many. Not mine. But to each his own. Still, the outcome of Dumai's Wells is probably one of the bigger game changers of the entire series.I've been keeping track of the sniffs in the book because Jordan has his women sniff way too much.

This is so great! Now that Lanfear is out of the way, as well as a half a dozen other Forsaken, Rand can finally set about doing what he has to... but step carefully! With Egwene just raised to the rebel Amyrlin Seat, Nynaeve and Elayne trying to find a ter'angreal that will mend the hellish weather and possibly throwing a wrecking ball through Rand's plans by dragging Mat along, Morgase now a &quot;guest&quot; in the Fortress of the Light, Aes Sedai who are trying to capture Rand and drag him to the White Tower to hold him until Tarmon Gai'don and the reader's discovery of some more Black Ajah in the Tower itself, this will leave you on your seat's edge. A little graphic at the end, at Dumai's Wells, but... Oh, yes. Rand has his help. He recruited the false Dragon Mazrim Taim, who can also channel (and sounds suspiciously like the Forsaken Demandred!) to help him find men who can channel or be trained to, and created a &quot;Black Tower&quot; of Asha'man. At the same time, he's trying to deal with Lews Therin Telamon's insane spirit in his head. Excellent plot twist!In Salidar, Egwene is having her own problems. As the new Amyrlin, she has to deal with a stubborn Keeper and a stubborn Hall, while handling a captured Moghedien and a few other crises.As we have come to expect out of RJ, these books are each detailed, fast-paced, high-quality masterpieces, and I am looking forward to Books 7 and 8. I see complaints about &quot;it's too slow&quot;, &quot;it's too detailed&quot;... B.S.! This seems slow because it's gigantic... I've heard estimates of up to 15 books, all of them at least 700-pagers. Hey, the more, the better! You want to read the series? Live with it! And every detail could be important, especially when dealing with Aes Sedai. Details help you feel emotions, and I cried when Moiraine died. I understood completely how Rand felt about Rahvin.

Although of course, I think that the length of Jordan's series is appalling, it is still very well written. He has the potential to make a masterful series that doesn't drag for eighty years. One reader said he was going to set himself of fire if Jordan didn't finish. Honestly I don't know how the author walks the streets safely anymore after pulling off such a maddening series. Anyway, if you're reading Lord of Chaos now, slow down and wait until Jordan finishes the series. If you don't, you may end up like me,waiting and waiting and waiting for the next book and then losing interest and facts from the previous novels. Then of course there are no little synopses that can remind you of what you've forgotten.

In Lord of Chaos, Rand is fighting for his sanity while trying to control the Lords of Camelyn and Cairhein. He is also trying to keep the opposing Aes Sedai at bay. The story is really good when it focuses on Rand. A sub-plot about Perrin and his jealous wife Faile comes later in the book. I think Perrin jumped into that marriage too soon, and it certainly drags the story down a bit. Mat used to be my favorite character in the series, but he travels with Elayne and Nynaeve in this book. Any sub-plot with Nynaeve quickly grows tiresome--how any woman can be such a shrew and still have friends is beyond understanding. Her character never develops much past the man-hating bully of the first book.

Especially Nynaeve and Faile. I mentally groan anytime the story moves to Nynaeve and Elayne and their stupid, shallow sisters in Salidar. They are just getting more boring and less developed as the series continues.Jordan storytelling has devolved to having his female chauvinists lie to and manipulate their boorish male companions as they flounder around the countryside arguing endlessly as they do increasingly poorly explained things.It almost seems as if Jordan had become bored with his story by this time, but had a page limit he had to reach to achieve parity with his other novels and had to stave off his climax for 700 more pages than he wanted to.I have kept reading so far because the time effort put into the series so far is significant and I am still interested in *some* of the characters.

While we wait anxiously for Robert Jordan to deliver us another ticket to the fantastic world of Rand al'Thor, we can amuse ourselves with the great mass of research and commentary about tWoT here on the Internet. It fascinates me to see how much time and effort so many people have invested in these books. One reason for the interest, I suspect, is the fact that the series is a terrific reading experience. The standard story of good vs. evil is unfolded on a scale that is unmatched in fantasy literature. Many characters - some engaging, some repellent - people the work, along with scary monsters. The scenes are painted in amazing detail, the characters act like real people, and furious and deadly action punctuates the story to remind us that a war is underway. ACOS moved us a good distance toward the Last Battle. In this instalment, Mat in particular matures. In many, often hilariously funny, passages he shows himself to be a thoughtful, resourceful and extremely brave young man who is beginning to understand and wield his strange power. He is ready for his fated meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons. So too all the other major characters develop. Egwene, Elayne, Rand and Perrin, although sometimes still showing the awkwardness of youth, are beginning to exercise command as befits those destined to rule nations and societies. Nynaeve is going to be the bane of more of the female Forsaken. And fortunately, there is much more to come. The stage is set for an action-packed eighth novel. I fear for Mat, and Egwene too. War is going to wrack Altara and Ghealdan, and we will see much more of Seanchan. I can hardly wait."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Lord of Chaos, book six in the Wheel of Time, is like most books in the series. Think of them as the star wars trilogy; some installments in the series are real duds , but the company they are with makes up for it in the grand scheme. The Lord of Chaos falls between throw-out-the-window boring and awe inspiring. Robert Jordan seems to be perfectly content stretching detail and description out page after excruciating page, and then tacking on a battle at the end that, while exciting, seems to just be there to hold the plot together until the next installment. While the book does have a rich and believable world, the author often makes things more complicated than they have to be, like calling things by different names (I dont care what he calls it, if it is big, gray and has tusks, im calling it an elephant, not the absurd name he gave it in the fourth or fifth book).As well developed as the characters in the book are, I can't say that I actually care for any of them. Whats more, there are well over 100 names you would have to memorize to recall every character that appears in the series. And take note, in the real world, some people actually get along with the opposite sex! If the book were written at any more slower a pace, it would be in real-time. The series started at a good pace, but this book and the seventh book have had no major resolutions. The main protagonists in the book, called the foresaken (I believe there are twelve or thirteen) were dropping like flies since before this book, but now there are still about 7 left, and at the rate they are dispatched of now, it would be optimistic to say the series will end before twelve.That said, the author can write as good as gold when he wants to. His battles are epic, his world thoruoghly planned out, and his magic system is among the most interesting i've ever read. The overall story is grand in scope, though is it just me, or does it seem a tad biblical (the protagonist; the Dragon Reborn, sounds a lot like the messiah, complete with false Dragons, and no less than an adversary named shai' tan, which I believe is the hebrew equivalent for satan)?One last note to the author, if you actually have an editor for your books, fire he/she and get on that can shorten your stories."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In one word: Incredible.In another: Long.Robert Jordan has created an awesome and deadly world,beseiged by the powers of darkness and brought us heroes never the likes of which you will not likely see again.

Most teens say Lord of Chaos is borning and lacks action like in the earlier books. Who ever thought of that? Now, in the six book, Rand, the dragon reborn, continues to show signs of maddness, and, sends away his Aiel love, Aviendha, fearing she too will be affected by his wraith. Lews Therin now is stuck in Rands head, waiting for a chance to seize control of Rand's body. Egwene, now finishing her training with the Wise Ones, heads for Saildar to confront her destiny. Mat, with the aid of his ter'angreal, has become a great war general, and is sent to bring Elayne back to Camyln. And Perrin, Lord of the Two Rivers, is feeling the urge to join Rand, an urge of ta'evern against ta'evern.All in all, this book is fantastic. Mat's dry sence of humor is great, and the all out battle of Aes Sedai vs. Asha'man will have sitting on the edge of your reading chair. A great read."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Hello all of you out there in computer land. I've been reading &quot;The Lord of Chaos&quot; and man have I been stunned!

In the \\"Lord of Chaos\\" Rand al'Thor has learned knew spells and is finally approaching the \\"Last Battle\\" with the Dark One.If you have read any of Robert Jordan's other works then I'm sure you will agree with me that this is one book set apart from the rest.

These may seem irritating to you but acctally it keeps you reading to find out what happens. I have to say that my favorite part is when Rand is bonded by a Aes Sedai and rand goes crazy sheliding her and almost killed here after she left she started talking about how strong he is and that she was just a twig compared to him. To understand this you have to relize that Aes Sedai never act like that they are always calm and expressionless a Aes Sedai loseing here calm means that something really huge is going on."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I only gave this three stars because, honestly, there is a good 500-600 pages that could have been clipped. The same thing as in the first book. Not that it's that big an issue, it is wonderful for a writer to show a world in so much detail, however in this case, as well as The Eye of The World and The Fires of Heaven most of all, the action is scarce and what little happens happens at the very end.So, down to it, this book has I think the shortest of the epic battles at the end, taking one chapter. Perrin, who was completely missing from the previous book, makes a long awaited return, yet it is saved until the very end for his arrival. To make it more strange, the prologue is 6 times the length of most of the chapters, and most of the good parts of the plot happen there, not in the rest of the story. Still, this one was conclusive, and I felt after reading it, it would have made a fair ending, having tied so much, yet of course, there remains the issue of the rebel Aes Sedai.

This book has non stop action as opposed to book 5, where there is barely any action and mostly women bickering about clothing. There are major plot twists in this book that take you by supprise, and if you have read books 1-5 previous to reading this book, they will most likely make you jump for joy. At times it can be long winded and a bit boring, but they are few, short, and far between. So ignore what you hear from everyone about Robert Jordan being evil for writing his seiries so long... that's what makes it so great. I suggest you start from the first book if you are new to the series and no matter what do not give up on the 5th book.

The only major thing that happened was killing part of the shaido and making the Aes Sedai bow to him. That fulfilled part of the prophecies so it is some progress. However, chasing the Aiel and the Aes Sedai with Rand did get a little boring. Also, the only big thing that Elayne and Nynaeve did was get closer to the Bowl of Winds.

Let's face it though, good ol' Bob uses some phrases waaaay too much. How many times do we need to hear about Mat looking for &quot;a kiss and a cuddle?&quot; Or Nynaevae tugging on her braid, or all the women folding their arms under their breasts?Also, there MAY be some logical inconsistencies in WoT. For example, if Rand loses Tarmon Gai'don, then eternity, and all the revolutions of the Wheel of Time, will fall under the Shadow, but if he wins, everythings going to be all happy. Yet, Artur Hawkwing and Ba'alzamon both knew Rand in earlier lives. In these lives, we have to assume that Rand was the Dragon Reborn in each of them, all rebirths of the &quot;first&quot; Dragon. Yet, the Dark One states that in some of those lives, the Dragon bowed down to him, so we have to assume he lost those Tarmon Gai'dons. But if he did, then the world would be under the shadow permanently, which isn't the case. Please feel free to disagree with this, as long as you can explain why.Another thing to face. Rand is badly portrayed in one area. He keeps talking about how duty is heavier than a mountain, but his duty is to win Tarmon Gaidon, and also keep alive as much peopel as possible. The best way to do this would be obviously to wield Callandor to destroy the Forsaken, then the Dark One. Or even better, that thingamajig in Rhuidean that links him to that other thingamabob across the Aryth Ocean.

The climax is an unbelievable rush and I had withdrawals waiting for The Crown of Swords to come out.

There have been so many plot lines intorduced and so many loose ends exposed that I really think it is about time Jordan started tying a few of them up. It really is beginning to look as if the series will just go on forever now, and the monotony of reading them now is beginning to make the entire series seem like just a marketing ploy to keep people buying books indefinitely until they die. If you think the series will end with Jordan's death, think again. They did it with James Bond, they can find another writer, some protoge' of Jordan's, to pick up the series with very little effort at all.I may stop reading sometime in the middle of this book.

It continues in the footsteps of the previous books in the Wheel of Time, but at the same time adds many unexpected twists. All the great characters, all the action, and all of the political maneuverings of the earlier books, somehow made even better. Enthralling to the end, I couldn't put this book down for days. Even when I finished it, I had to read it again just to absorb the massive amount of information in it. The only sour note is some of the reviews that are posted here. That this book should get anything less than a three-star is beyond imagining. I read a review that actually said that the only character to develop was Egwene. I urge that person to take the blindfold off his or her eyes and actually read the book. When was the last time that Rand had a dead man in his brain addressing him? Verin and Alanna, almost unimportant in all but the Shadow Rising, suddenly play gigantic roles when they bond Rand. Mat, now a general, has to go toe-to-toe with the Amyrlin, and learns to further his distrust of Aes Sedai. New characters are introduced, old characters resurge, and everything is brilliant.

So many unexpected developments, both in plot and character, it was brilliant.Unlike FoH, LoC actually kept me turning the pages since I wanted to see what was going to happen next. And the ending was great too, for once it didn't end with Rand killing one of the Forsaken.The only thing I was dissapointed with was not with the actual book itself, but rather the magazine review from Locus Magazine, which gave away what was going to happen at the ending!

In the book, Rand al-Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles with political intrigues that try to undercut his authority. He also deals with the growing madness from the Dark One's taint on saidin, the male half of the True Source that gives a channeler his or her power. This madness manifests in primarily three areas: hearing his previous self's (Lewis Therin Telamon's) voice in his head, a near manic depression over any female harmed, and a dangerous (as Rand learns in the book) cockiness that could prove deadly.Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon deals with the manipulations of his childhood friends among the Aes Sedai, and Perrin Aybarra contends with the knowledge that he must quickly reach Rand, or his friend could be lost forever.This book was simultaneously the strongest and the weakest of the books in the series so far. The character development and more personal angles that I had wanted I got in spades. I think that maybe it was a case of getting what I want and regretting it. The ta'veren's allies also had strong storylines, with Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene having their own discoveries/breakthroughs, and journeys. Even some of the secondary characters, like my one of my favorites, Loial, had proper focus for the first time in books.Also introduced was Rand's new school for male channelers, called the \\"Black Tower\\" to differentiate it from the White Tower of Aes Sedai. These male channelers, called Asha'man by Rand, are introduced, and will play a *vital* role in future events.Yet for all of this improvement, the story felt like so much filler. A huge \\"door stopper\\" sized book for a couple of (admittedly quite important) plot points that could have been condensed to a shorter book, or put in with a future volume. It just was both interesting, and tedious. Never a good combination.The one major caution that I must give is that this book was extremely, graphically violent in a way that previous books have not been. That alone has made the book drop in how I rate it. It is a suitable read, but the intense violence is just too much, and really brushes up near the intolerable.All in all, the book was a fun read, but sadly little more, and a sad volume in the series of so much promise so far. Recommended to get through the series, or if you are bored. Otherwise, don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Rand is, without question, the Dragon Reborn, commanding Aiel as well as wetlanders in his battle against the Shadow. That being said, doubters exist, and Rand must learn to use his power in a wise fashion as he extends his empire in preparation for the Last Battle. As the Dragon Reborn enters the political sphere again, he is forced to reconcile the appearance of new characters, dramatic shifts in others, and the animosity of clear political changes at the White Tower among the Aes Sedai. Also, Rand must bring his power to bear without Asmodean and largely without guidance on the whole.Eventually, faced with a battle for his life, Rand brings to bear new weapons in the struggle against the Shadow. These weapons, however, may give Rand, in the long run, more than he reckoned for, heightening the appeal of the series. This book, as of this point in Jordan's works, possesses the best battle scene of all the books, occurring at Dumai Wells. You won't regretting continuing the journey with Rand.This book makes significant plot progress. True, politically, Rand continues to move at a pace of approximately one kingdom or entity a book, however, the actions in Lord of Chaos fundamentally transform the emotional state of those involved. Rand takes a permanent dark turn as a result of Dumai Wells, and Egwene, in particular, fits nicely, if surprisingly, into her new role.Grades:Content: ADevelopment: A"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I first started reading Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time back in 2001. The film adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings prompted me to delve deeper into the fantasy genre. So I bought The Eye of the World from the bookstore, and it had me hooked after the first hundred pages. From then on, I read every single installment, up until Crossroads of Twilight. I stopped at Book Ten because I went on to read other books. I think it was back in 2004 when I put The Wheel of Time on hiatus. I continued to enjoy myself reading other books, until the end of 2007, when I decided to reread Jordan's epic series. It's now April of 2011, and I finally had the time to sit back and read the sixth volume, Lord of Chaos. I admired the series very much back when I was still a teenager. The admiration has now dimmed, as the novels that I have read in the past few years have mostly affected not only my attitude toward The Wheel of Time, but also the entire fantasy genre.After Crossroads of Twilight, I moved on to early Russian Literature: Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, and early Tolstoy. I also explored the contemporary crime genre by reading books written by Michael Connelly, Nelson DeMille, Vince Flynn, and Steve Hamilton. Like The Wheel of Time, I also moved away from The Lord of the Rings (especially the film adaptations), and went on to admire films such as Full Metal Jacket, The Insider, One Hour Photo, Casino, and many others. The TV shows Deadwood (2004-2006) and Millennium (1996-1999) also played an important role. With all these contemporary books and films and TV shows, my appreciation for the fantasy genre has simply grown smaller. Although I still like fantasy in general, I find myself noticing most of the flaws and clich&eacute;s now more than when I had back in the early 2000's. My opinions have changed, and now I do believe that The Wheel of Time has several flaws that are just inescapable from the human eye. In my previous reviews on Amazon, I have given high grades for books one through five. Now, I give them at least a 7 out of 10 due to the fact that I have found the flaws more distracting. I wasn't bothered by them back then, but now, I can almost see why some people can't stand this epic series.Regarding Lord of Chaos, this one I find only fair. The plot continues to drag in some sections, a few characters continue to become annoyances (especially Nynaeve, whom I'll admit, I never liked ever since The Great Hunt), and certain guidelines continue to drive these characters instead of their own emotions. And when I mean guidelines, I mean that these characters are forced into certain plot points in order to keep the story the way it was originally intended. Their personalities or motives never play a part. It's always \\"you must do this because of this one rule\\" and \\"you cannot be this because you are destined to become that.\\" It's like the standard fantasy formula: person is said to be the future savior, so he must do certain things while not thinking for himself. This formula really ruins the suspense in the story, and it ultimately becomes almost predictable throughout. In addition, some of the minor characters seemed to have been created just to add a higher amount the word count. They are irrelevant to the actual plot, and they seem to disappear without a single trace. Nynaeve is the one main character that I truly can't stand. She hasn't really progressed since the first book, and like Ingtar, her personality is always forced. And that's another thing that I don't like in the Wheel of Time: the useless (and illogical) romantic subplots. All of them add no purpose to the series. Most of them seemed to have been created just to add a little more spice to the story, and most really don't go anywhere. The one that is most confusing is the relationship between Lan and Nynaeve. This one I am sick of the most. There was absolutely no foreshadowing of any of this in Eye of the World, and the relationship itself is awkward at times. What does Lan see in Nynaeve and vice versa? Their romance is just useless, and should have been erased a long time ago.But Lord of Chaos does have some good things in it. For one, I'm glad to see the main characters again in this book. Mat, Lan, and Siuan are the most interesting to me. Also, Jordan's extraordinary writing style remains unchanged, and I admire the sharp prose from beginning to end. The battle of Dumai's Wells is pretty terrifying, while Rand's psychic interaction with Lews Therin is really fascinating.Even though I haven't given up on fantasy just yet, I'm still irritated with the flaws that I have newly discovered in The Wheel of Time. The guidelines, the unnecessary Lan/Nynaeve romance, the meaningless minor characters, and the overall plodding pace of the story keeps me from enjoying these sorts of books anymore. I know that the contemporary thriller genre is not perfect, but at least they're connected with the real world. So for now, I will continue reading detective thrillers and political thrillers. I may find that spark once again and continue on with A Crown of Swords, since I still like The Wheel of Time for the characters and Jordan's writing style. But that's still a probability and not a guarantee.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Official grades, as of 4/15/2011 (out of 10):The Eye of the World, 7.2/10The Great Hunt, 7.8/10The Dragon Reborn, 7.1/10The Shadow Rising, 7.7/10The Fires of Heaven, 6.8/10Lord of Chaos, 6.1/10------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTE: The quote for the title of the review is from Lord of Chaos, page 73."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm riding the Wheel of Time a little later than most people, and I finished Lord of Chaos for the first time yesterday, so I'm going to give you my honest opinion as someone who lacks the perspective of having finished the whole series: I'm still hooked. I've heard from many accounts that the pace slows in the series about halfway through, although there's debate among fans how early/late the series begins to stagnate. So far, I'm still quite satisfied with what I've read. For those who claim that nothing happens in Lord of Chaos, I call rubbish: quite a lot of interesting developments arise; it's just not nearly as frantic. With each passing novel, there has been a gradual shift from intense action towards political intrigue and character development. These two latter elements are heavily focused upon in Lord of Chaos, although there are still some excellent action scenes to be found.*Minor Spoilers*Some of the more interesting plot threads are Rand attempting to control the voices in his head, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene struggling (separately) with their newfound rises to power, Nyneave's relentless desire to become the first to heal Stilling, the Forsaken plotting against each other, anticipation of the impending war between the White Tower and the rebel Aes Sedai, the struggle between multiple factions all vying to control Rand, and the mysterious nature of Mazrim Taim.*End Spoilers*Obviously, if you're thinking of buying Book 6, you'd have to have read the first five in the series, so you should already have an idea of whether you want to continue reading or not. If the changing focus towards politics and character development scares you, or you don't anticipate the less frequent pacing of intense action scenes, you may not get the most enjoyment out of Lord of Chaos. As for me, I devoured all 900+ pages, until the novel reached an epic conclusion that left me hungering for more.

Many reviews claim that Lord of Chaos is too slow and lacking in action, but I claim that the climax was well worth the development of something like twenty \\"round\\" characters over 900 pages. As I've said before, if it takes 12 books to wrap up the tangled web Jordan has created then so be it! I will enjoy every page. I reccomend the series to any fantasy lover. Ignore the critics who say that it is too perilous a journey, too steep a mountain, and too momentous a task. They're only trying to be more \\"accomplished\\" readers than you. Don't let them tell you what you can and can't read!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There comes a point, in a thousand page book, where one is just overwhelmed with information. I mentioned this back in The Great Hunt, but the book is so dense that you look at the dwindling number of pages towards the back of the book and think, This can't possibly be enough to hold all the stuff I remember happening. And yet it does. The storytelling here is solid, and while there may be a lot of fat to trim, the climactic scenes are usually very well paced and keep you hanging on the whole way through.So, what happens in this book?As we begin, the rebel Aes Sedai in the tiny village of Salidar are waiting to know what to do. This isn't something that one would normally say of Aes Sedai, but they are uncertain. The White Tower is the Aes Sedai family, and to think of it splitting down the middle is just as bad as seeing your own family crack in two - you would do anything to save it. While the Salidar Aes Sedai certainly want to stand up against Elaida and her barely legal takeover of the Tower, they also want their family to be whole again. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that reconciliation is not to be, and so they prepare to take the radical step of naming an Amyrlin Seat of their own. Once that is done, the Tower will truly be split, but perhaps they can bring Elaida to justice in the end.Rand al'Thor is trying to hold together the lands he's conquered - Tear, Cairhein and Andor - and prevent them from collapsing into chaos. There are bands of violent looters who call themselves \\"Dragonsworn,\\" following their mad prophet and razing all that stands in their path. The Shaido, a clan of Aiel who refuse to accept Rand as their Chief of Chiefs, continues to dog Rand and his allies, and are an ever-present threat. He has Aes Sedai from both the White Tower and Salidar calling on him, each trying to convince him that they are the only ones who are worth allying with. And in Illian, the Forsaken Sammael waits, his greatest ambition being to crush Rand al'Thor and stand at the right hand of the Dark One when his time comes 'round at last.All over the continent, the weather has gone into perpetual summer - lands are drying up, farms are dying, as the hand of the Dark One touches the world. Elayne and Nynaeve believe they know where they can find an object that will bring the weather back to normal, but they must first get out of Salidar. Once they do that, they have the violent streets of Ebou Dar to contend with. Egwene is with the Aiel Dreamwalkers, learning how to manage the World of Dreams, not prepared for the magnitude of what awaits her with the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar. Mat, now the leader of his own army, finds himself guarding Elayne and Nynaeve, much to his own dismay.All around them, the world falls into chaos, and everything that Rand has done is poised to be undone.As I said, it's a dense book, and the changes that occur from the first page to the thousandth are pretty serious. But even though all that, my interest was held and I was entertained, not the least because the characters entertained me from beginning to end.One of the fun tricks that Jordan uses to great effect, in this book and elsewhere, is conflicting viewpoints. In the last review, I talked about how, for some readers, the profusion of point-of-view characters made the book harder to get into (and at my count, this book has 44 POV characters in it). One advantage to that kind of writing, however, is that we get to examine events and situations through the eyes of different characters, which is often informative and always entertaining.Take Rand, for example. He's an interesting character in that while has has to juggle so many different large-scale problems at once (and he's generally pretty good at it), he's hopeless on the individual level. In once scene, for example, Egwene comes to visit Rand. She's determined to talk to him about the Wise Ones' manipulation of him, but gets sidetracked into the topic of the Salidar Aes Sedai. Realizing that Rand's nature as a ta'veren (a person whose mere presence can influence chance and fate) is about to cause her to tell him everything, she opens herself to saidar, the female half of the True Source, as a means of self-control.Rand can sense this, and believes that she is afraid of him, calling on saidar as preparation for some kind of attack. He's disappointed in her, of course, but this just further cements his distrust of Aes Sedai and deepens his disappointment that he can no longer trust someone with whom he had grown up. He believes that Egwene approached him in order to involve him in the Wise Ones' plans and to stand against his own plan to give the thrones of Cairhein and Andor to Elayne.\\"At least you didn't let her see you were tired,\\" he tells himself after she leaves.Egwene's first thought upon seeing him? \\"He looked so tired.\\"Two people see the same situation from radically different points of view, and it is their inability to reconcile these points of view that cause conflict. Storytelling 101, but done to great effect in these books. There's another, far funnier scene later on, when Mat finally gets to Salidar and has a humorous misunderstanding as to exactly what Egwene is doing there. Like so many other characters, he's absolutely sure he knows what's going on, only to discover that the reality of the situation is nothing like what he expected. The characters' willingness to make assumptions, unwillingness to say what they're really thinking, and inability to accurately know what will happen next are a constant throughout these books, and makes them all the more human.It is these differences of perspective - often leavened with characters who are wonderfully un-self-aware (Rand, Mat, and Nynaeve are my favorite examples) - that makes the Cast of Thousands worthwhile. For all the benefits of a single-POV book or series, there's always more story that could be told by shifting into the head of another character. What kind of story would Harry Potter have been if we could have watched events unfold through Ron and Hermione's eyes as well? Longer, that's for sure, but perhaps it would have been even better.Would I want The Wheel of Time pared down to just Rand al'Thor's point of view? Not on your life. Not just because Rand is one of the less well-developed characters in the series, but I would miss the others. I would miss being in the funhouse-mirror mind of Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan, or the scary thoughts of the Forsaken. I would miss knowing how Mat feels about finding himself a general, or Perrin becoming the lord of his homeland. I would miss Perrin's conversations with the wolves (\\"We come\\" just gave me shivers. It's in chapter 54, check it out.) I would regret losing even the minor POV characters - Sulin trying to figure out how to keep Rand safe, whether he wanted it or not. Faile working to make sure her husband becomes all that he should become. Pedron Niall and his visions of a world saved by his Whitecloaks.While the vast crowd of characters can be overwhelming, it creates a rich world in which I can easily lose myself. Which is exactly what a good book is supposed to accomplish.----------------------------------------------------The lions sing and the hills take flight.The moon by day, and the sun by night.Blind woman, deaf man, jackdaw fool.Let the Lord of Chaos rule.- Children's chant of the Fourth Age----------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Excellent book series, don't get involved if you dont want to read a long story. like 14 books long. if you enjoy reading fantasy novels this is one of the best. it is a legendary story equal to the writings of Tolkien, better than any other modern fantasy novelist currently in writting."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When I first read Robert Jordan's Lord of Chaos back in 1997, I remember it being a grueling read that sapped my enthusiasm for the series. In many ways, it sets the formula for its successors -- hundreds of pages of inertia punctuated by an event at the end. Now that I'm older and am better at deconstructing an author's intent, successful or not, I do appreciate what Robert Jordan was trying to do with the book. The payoff is neatly executed based on themes set-up throughout the book, it's just that it necessitates making the women of the book -- particularly Nynaeve and Elayne -- extremely unlikable.Lord of Chaos is fundamentally about Rand's relationship with the Aes Sedai, which in turn is a proxy for the relationships between men and women in general. In Fires of Heaven, Moiraine told him never to trust another Aes Sedai -- Rand understands the argument, but naively underestimates the two delegations that come to him. He chooses to trust the wrong delegation, and that in turn forces a series of events that culminates in the Battle of Dumai's Wells, perhaps one of the most visceral and exhilarating action sequences in the series. The final moments of the story proper also bring about the natural resolution for Robert Jordan's major themes -- his view of the politics between men and women, and in particular, the manipulation and humiliation of men at the hands of women and ultimately the need for women to submit to men.I'm not sure if I would describe Robert Jordan as a sexist, necessarily, and he's definitely not a misogynist, but he takes the \\"Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars\\" approach to an embarrassing level. The women of the book do not treat its men very well -- indeed, Rand is literally tortured for being a man that can channel (though one wonders if he's tortured for simply being a man who stands up to powerful women). This has been a problem for me throughout the series, but I find it especially troubling in Lord of Chaos. Gender is treated as a see saw, tilting the balance of power between one side or the other. There is no equality, only a struggle for dominance.I want to continue my re-read of the series to get to Brandon Sanderson's contributions, but I wonder how much more of this I can take. It's especially a shame because the earlier books were so entertaining. Alas, I must grit my teeth and soldier on to the end, although each volume grows more tedious than the last."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I could almost copy and paste my review for Fires of Heaven right here and it would be mostly suitable because Lord of Chaos is more of the same. This is another metropolitan-city-phonebook-sized novel with a potentially interesting story that is bogged down by its excruciatingly slow pace, regular insertions of backstory, constant descriptions of the garb of every major and minor character (garb which keeps getting smoothed, straightened, or otherwise adjusted), and too many mentions of expanses of bosoms, spankings, sitting on knees, sniffing, snorting, and braid yanking. (I swear, if I have to read \\"good stout Two-Rivers woolens\\" one more time...)In Lord of Chaos some of the most interesting WOT characters are absent (e.g., Egeanin and Lan), some of the formerly interesting characters have become almost intolerable (e.g., Siuan and Aviendha), and some who should have grown up by now just won't (Nynaeve and Faile). At least we get to visit a new city -- Ebou Dar .... in which everyone looks and acts the same and all the women are looking for fights (with knives).The only really entertaining parts of Lord of Chaos were Lews Therin's mumblings in Rand's head -- I thought this was clever and amusing:\\"Where are all the dead?\\" Lews Therin whispered. \\"Why will they not be silent?\\"Rand chuckled grimly. Surely that had to be a joke.There is a climax at the end of the book that truly changes the course of the story (and I hope will serve to pick up the pace in the next novel), but it took entirely too long to get there and involved a sudden change in some of the characters' normal behavior. Rand's got a hoard of Aiel maidens and wise ones around him everywhere he goes and then they suddenly decide to take a coffee break when a group of Aes Sedai come to visit? Huh? Well, I was puzzled, but at least there was finally some action, even if the events around it seemed contrived.Robert Jordan is a smooth writer who's got an interesting story to tell (thus, three stars), but he dilutes its power by drawing it out. This book's plot should have been combined with the previous two books' plots and then 75% of the words should have been removed. (There was so much repetition that we probably wouldn't have missed anything!). Then, instead of three slow and repetitive novels, we'd have one great novel."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I had some troubles reading this book, since practically every single female character is so mean and BITCHY.It makes you feel sorry for the male characters because they have to put up with these frustratingly stubborn and unreasonable women. I absolutely hate Faile. Nynaeve comes a very close second after Faile; Egwene and Elayne are tied for third place. Although the story is good, I would have been happier if there was more action. Unfortunatly, it is not the book that I can't put down."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Readers of any book in this series will appreciate the color and detail that Jordan imparts into the peoples, countries, cities, and politic. But, while I have deeply enjoyed all of the Wheel of Time series, I find this book moves more slowly than most of the others. I felt that he spent too much time on minor sub-plots without developing others which had previously been implied as crucial to the overall tale, making the story drag."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In a nutshell I dont know whether I envy Robert Jordan or pity him. A great mind let loose in it's own playground has created for me a world so intense that rather than put petrol in my car this week I bought book 7. And in that way he is always doomed to dissappoint somewhere. He will cause someone somewhere to drop the books and pick up something else.Is this a fault?..NO.It's just natural progression....his superb in depth style will cause lull's in action and plot twists where he must stand back and recap certain things, answer questions that the reader's have posed to themselves and have come up with half truths. Hollywood has become increasingly tainted with the all-action demand, plotlines and characters swamped by more and more stunt sequences. Thankfully Jordan hasn't sold out yet.But unfortunately this 1000 page monster is primarily the exact opposite, Little happenening so he can wind up the next books with brilliant plotlines. Mat marches for a bit, saves some kid (Olver), then marches a bit more. Egwene finally gets her hands on Gawyn then (a little typically) has to sod off again. Nynaeve and Elayne are basically narrators for the twistings of the two towers (with a few added bits of miraculous healings). The forsaken do very little but hint at more and more. Perrin says he's off to help rand then dissappears 700 pages doing it. Rand bounces back and forth meeting aes sedai and meeting a few old friends.Dont get me wrong this isn't a whole snooze, the back 200 of the book gets moving again with good plotlines and a greater sense of developement (though once again, in my opinion, much like in Fires of heaven, he kinda fails to describe the battle scenes with as much intensity as he does everything else, but it is no mean feat to do it well), but I finished it wondering why it took me 3 days to read book 4 and 15 days to read this.Poor, poor Jordan may not have wanted to write this part, but he had to!Basically in all books there are some parts you dont really want to read but you have to. Most of this book is the same. This is the part of the WOT series you dont want to slog through, but you do, coz u know there are greater rewards at the end of it.Some wontSome will just give upTheir loss!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is definitely one of my favourite books, especially after the sub-standard The Fires of Heaven. The Lord of Chaos is a very interesting book with a fantastic ending. What makes it interesting is that the reader gets a look at things from the perspective of the Forsaken. Combined this with the Aes Sedai's interactions with Rand, and add the fact that the whole annoying Egwene vs Nynaeve drama has petered out, and this book definitely seems superior to its predecessor.There are some good tel'aran'rhiod scenes in Lord of Chaos, and the character development is good. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this book is that there is no confrontation between Rand and the Forsaken. Despite this flaw, Lord of Chaos is an excellent addition to the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A great book.

At that point I asked him:&quot;how many books there were going to be in the series?&quot; 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.&quot;about the plot - do you have it worked out?&quot; Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have been reading the Wheel of Time series since the first book came out and this is my favorite series ever. However, it's not for everyone. Jordan is probably the most descriptive writer I have ever read and he will describe everything he possibly can in one situation in order to set the mood properly. This makes his books, and the chapters, very long. Some people don't like long and descriptive, elaborate writing like this, I do, and I believe that Robert Jordan is the best author I have ever read. Read the series in order, starting from the first book, and it will make a lot more sense and be much more enjoyable reading. I've gone back and read all of them over again at least twice."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The rampant mary-suism, the perfect (and morally superior) aiel, the spanking the lectures from Rand and the wise ones, and the sister-wives have at last done me in. I liked this series at first because the characters were small town kids setting off on adventures. Suddenly they are all uber-powerful super-teens who boss around people twice their age. They are all beautiful, wise, and eternally youthful of face. Everyone who is anyone is about 20 years old. The 20 year olds can wield weapons like veterans twice their age. The female characters are almost universally 'the most powerful the tower/wise ones' have ever seen. Rand laments the deaths of female chararacters and yet persists in having a female honor guard and three girlfriends. Totally inconsistant with his upbringing. The sister wife thing... Yeek...Total guy fantasy. No self-respecting woman let alone a queen would agree to 'share' her man with two other women... Women don't share very easily I don't care how close they are. There is jealousy and hurt, and lack of equality.Towards the end of this one I began to loathe Rand's character. He is supercillious and annoying.1 star."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Overall, Lord of Chaos is an incredible book.

To be perfectly honest I stopped reading the book about halfway through it, and whether or not I'll ever have the ambition to finish the rest of it is doubtful. Every single one of his books feels the same when you read it. The first 100-250 or so pages are the dullest, most pointless things in the world. The amount of detail he puts in to his stories is even harder to get through than Tolkien, but unlike that master story teller Jordan fails to hold his audience's interest for very long because he spends so much time talking about stupid, pointless things. His story is very reminiscent of another series (or at least the early books are) by Terry Goodkind called &quot;The Sword of Truth,&quot; but the difference between the pair is that Goodkind's books are the type that you never want to put down and unlike Jordan's characters Goodkind's act their age, but of course that brings up another flaw in the books--the timeline. You look at the appendix or whatever it is in the back of the book and it seems amazing how much he focuses in on the timeline, but if you actually keep track of how much time passes between the first and the sixth then a slight problem arises: how is it that his characters went from being young teens to suddenly being in their twenties when only a few years, if that, have actually gone by? And is there even one somewhat kind woman in this entire series? I think that Jordan must have a problem with the ladies since every single one is a devious scumbag that doesn't care about anything but what they want, or else an idiotic little fool. Basically, the point is that the book just doesn't make sense, that he's juggling with too many characters, and the plot is so terribly predictable that it's sickening. Do yourself a favor and don't read any of these books; they're a waste of time and are so full of detail that by the time you finish one part you won't even remember what was happening to the other characters when you get back to them."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for 1 star rating).

All in all, I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are in general a fantasy fan or not. So far I've found one person who didn't like this series, and I didn't like him anyway.

I admit that getting started was a chore, because Fires of Heaven was slow, but after page 300 i could not stop. It has the best ending off all the Wheel of Time Books except maybe Path of Daggers.

I've faithfully kept up with the series, and I think that the seven books I've read would have made an excellent trilogy. A little editing would have made a good series absolutely fantastic. If you have patience, Robert Jordan has some truly original ideas that will keep you busy for months, even if you are a fast reader.

I wish this series would cover twenty books because I can't get enough. I wanted to scream when I finished the fourth book and didn't have the fifth book to read.

In fact, Robert Jordan has more creativity in his little finger than most other authors combined.

The petty torments the characters shove at each other is unbelievable. Matt being tormented by the Aes Sedai about his magic immunity is but one of many many examples. Everyone has their own agenda and won't veer away from it to help one of their \\"friends\\" or \\"allies\\" even if it means the end of the world. So Rand is the Dragon Reborn and yet the Aes Sedai insist on controlling him rather than working with him. Their arrogance is frustrating and hardly credible, even those who are from Emond's Field and supposedly his friends. Just why does Rand \\"love\\" Elayne and Avienda anyway? I can understand Min, but not the other two. At what point do the characters in these books, most especially the Aes Sedai, finally HELP rather than hinder the war against the Dark One. I've had no problem putting the book down to read other things; even knowing I may loose the story line. I loose the plot anyway after 6,000 or so pages, with no synopsis or good glossary."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The previous five books of this series are intense, eventful, and beautifully written works of fantasy. Lord of Chaos represents a bit of a turn in RJ's writing style. I remember reading it for the first time and thinking it was a little slow. There was a lot of talk and intricate plotting but little action. Then came Dumai's Wells.Nothing I have read in any novel, before or since, can compare to Dumai's Wells. The raw emotion spilled out on the pages of the last two chapters of this book is nearly overwhelming. Rand's burning anger at his mistreatment by the Red Ajah. Min's fear for Rand. Perrin's guilt for summoning the wolves. Above it all, the burning rage of the wolves. By the end, I wanted blood so badly I could taste it. And the Asha'man delivered better than I thought possible. I get chills just thinking about it all these years later. I find myself comparing every battle scene in every movie and novel to it, and my conclusion is always the same - \\"This is no Dumai's Wells.\\"The later books of the series are weak, and not just in comparison to Dumai's Wells. The plot appears to just drift away from Jordan and he compensates with intensely dull descriptive prose. But for those readers who are considering the series and are turned off by the negative reviews of the later books, please reconsider. The first five books are outstanding, and the end of Lord of Chaos was a climax that will almost certainly overshadow whatever Jordan manages for the Last Battle (if he lives that long). Read the first six and walk away, knowing that you've seen the series at its very best."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Mmmm...how can I possibly review this book and be able to convey the exact JOY I felt at reading it? Let me put it this way. I was vacationing in Florida when I read this book, and we spent an entire day at Disneyland. That night, we got back at about 10:00. I plopped down in bed, but instead of falling asleep (like most people would have after a day like that), I stayed up until 2 A.M. reading Lord of Chaos. It's THAT good.There were so many plot twists, TONS of surprises. The ending scene was, I believe, one of the best you can ever read in literature. It seriously gave me the shivers. I loved it.There was just SO MANY good things happening in this book...I really can't describe it. If you're a WoT fan, don't stop now. You'll really love this book. If you haven't read any of the previous books yet, go back and read them IN ORDER.For anyone who likes to read (and even if you don't) the Wheel of Time series is the best literature has to offer. I mean, it has humor, romance, adventure, suspense, and some pretty creepy parts. What MORE can anyone ask for?"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you thought this latest book would be more of the same as the other books in the series, think again. I was a little wary picking this one up as I was getting tired of 450 pages of Rand, Perrin, and Mat wandering the land getting dumped on by women, and 450 pages of Elayne, Nynaeve, Aviendha, and Egwene being total bitches to each other and everyone they meet. Then, with a 100 pages to go, Rand goes off and finds some random Forsaken to kill.Robert Jordon must have had some critiques in this regard because this book is totally different. At the beginning of the book, Rand finds out that Rahvin did not, in fact, kill Queen Morgase. Rand feels guilty about killing Rahvin even if he was one of the Forsaken. Rahvin was just minding his own business trying to run Caemlyn because the Queen just up and left on him when Rand shows up to kill him. Because of his mistake, Rand must now run Caemlyn himself or find someone else to do it. The only logical choice is Elayne. So, Rand fast-travels to Salidar to find her.When he gets there, Elayne has already left. He finds Egwene, though, and learns that she is holding Moghedien captive through a bracelet that was once used on Egwene a few books ago. After a few chapters of Egwene insulting Rand about how wool-brained and stubborn he is, Rand learns that all the achievements Egwene, Elayne, & Nynaeve were being praised for by the other Aes Sedai were actually tortured out of Moghedien and passed off as their own.Egwene explains that it is the best solution because if the Aes Sedai found out, they would kill her. Rand comes up with a better way of dealing with Moghedien by asking her in secret if she would like to be bonded to him as her warder. Doing so, she would be allowed to live and he would grant her amnesty but she would be bonded in only doing as he commanded. She agrees and Rand does it. They are making plans for escape when Egwene calls her to meet in private. Through the newly created bond, Rand can feel Egwene torturing Moghedien for information about her suspected plan. Rand finds her by following the pain and rescues Moghedien by creating a gateway back to Caemlyn. Once safe, he removes the bracelet, by which Moghedien is eternally grateful.Rand and Moghedien spend some time together and learn through talking and through their bond that they are very much the same. Rand comes to the conclusion that the real evil in the world are the Aes Sedai. Once this was revealed, it made sense why Robert Jordan spent five books making the most unlikable, evil characters ever written. If you think about it, it makes sense. What \\"evil\\" are all the Forsaken doing throughout the books? Quietly minding their own business running cities? That's about all I can think of. On the flip-side, what are Aes Sedai doing? Bullying and bending the truth would be at the top of the list. Mat gets tortured, picked-on, and feces thrown at him by Aes Sedai. Rand and Lan are raped (Jordan's words) by Aes Sedai.When the pieces are finally put together, Rand is enraged at the treachery and deceit. He then links with Moghedien and performs that stunt he used in the third book where he senses the same likeness in his enemies and channels them to explode. At first, he can only do Caemlyn but then, he makes gateways to the other cities and spends the rest of the book hunting them down.The thrilling climax comes when he learns that the four most powerful Aes Sedai, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha, & Nynaeve, have learned to resist his attacks. He finds out they possess attributes that make them almost as powerful as the Dark One himself. Since they never had the Oath Rod to limit their powers, they used lying, cheating, hypocrisy, stubbornness, insulting, & mega-bitchiness to become more powerful than any Aes Sedai in history. Robert Jordon spent time in every book, when he wasn't spending ten pages to describe a room or street or the clothes a girl was wearing, writing about how those girls were the most powerful Aes Sedai in a thousand years. I just never put two and two together about what made them so powerful.Rand knows that he'll need help in defeating them so he asks Moghedien to contact the other Forsaken and enlist their help. They meet up with the rest of the Forsaken and Rand discovers that the Forsaken were, in fact, seals in the Dark One's prison. Not sealed in with the Dark One, but seals to keep the Dark One from escaping. They had known all along that it was the Aes Sedai that were the Dark One's followers. Jordan has said many times in the books that it is the Aes Sedai that run the nations and that kings and queens bow to them. What more could the Dark One want? The only thing that could get in the way of that would be men standing up to them. So, they bully all the men into submission and hunt down all the men able to channel and kill or still them.Even though learning all of this just confirmed his suspicions, Rand is even more enraged than ever. With the Forsaken at his side, he confronts the Dread Aes Sedai, Egwene, Elayne, Nynaeve, & Aviendha. Both sides link with each other but Rand's powers are pushed to limit. Even though he is linked with the most powerful names in history, he cannot overcome the Dread Aes Sedai, for they have powers no man can stand up to. The Glare. The Stare. The Chin Lift. The Sniff. The Braid Tug. The Plunging Neckline. The Skirt Smooth. The Lip Thin. The Eye Tighten.Will Rand be able to save the world from the Dark One and his followers?

Is there a support group? Although I really love the series, I wonder where some of these characters get their sense of responsibility. Elayne is SUPPOSED to be the Daughter-heir, thinks her mother is dead, her inheiritance is up for grabs, and she goes searching for a BOWL?? I realize this bowl has powers that can save the world from the weather, but GROW UP!!! Sounds more like an excuse to go out with the girls. Send Nynaeve and Co. to get the thing and get to back to your day job!! Of course, this fairly obvious solution would take away from some of the plot devices (everyone thinks Rand killed Morgase, Gawn wants to kill Rand, Elayne doesn't know if she should still love Rand, Morgase thinks Rand wants her kingdom &amp; is signing up with Niall Pedron to get it back, etc.) I also think both Rand and Mat should listen a little more to the voices in their heads. They may sound crazy, but the DO have experience. Lews Therin is obviuosly trying to tell Rand that Mazrim Taim is really Dermandred. Mat needs to realize that those past memories are NOT going to go away and learn from them. I'm also is bit bored with some petty items: repetitive clothng descriptions (ie, 'good stout Two Rivers woolens'), one-upmanship games between all the males and females (am I old fashioned enough to believe that honesty in communication is a good thing?), and Nynaeve's braid tugging (when did this start - I don't remember it in the first two or three books?) I came to this series late - started collecting most of the books at garage sales and used book stores.

I like Mr. Jordan's writing style; the slow build up to an exciting ending of each book, with the many intricate story lines intertwining and having their own relation to the main story, but at the same time having a beginning, climax and even ending of their own, that keeps the reader on the edge of his seat.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like all of the female characters, they all seem to be independent, self reliant, can think and act on their own volition, and don't wait around for men to help them. Most of the conflict between the men and women is minor everyday irritation, which is truer than if everybody just got along perfectly; plus it does make the characters lives more believable. Here is a group of people who along with their super-powers and extraordinary responsibilities, have to deal with the pettiness, shortsightedness, jealousy, misunderstanding, ambition, and other very human flaws that they and those around them are burdened with.Another element of the story that I like, is the existence of traitors working inside the ranks of the good people, plus other characters who are not conscious members of the evil forces, but whose own personal goals, interfere and impede the organization and union of the forces of good.I am looking forward to reading the next book in this very entertaining series."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The book was in very good shape and is a good book I enjoyed it .

However, I have a few issues with this book. The first being that the best part of this book is the last few chapters, and not because I was waiting for it to end. It's the only fast paced part of the book. Where I actually feel a little suspense and it was written superbly. It was quite refreshing after reading the previous 900 pages, which drag on endlessly almost. I thought to myself, now this is the Robert Jordan I know and love, where has he been this whole time?The characters in this book dawdle to such an extent I often wondered why he was even bothered writing about them. Perhaps it was just filler, perhaps he just couldn't stop once he began. Whatever the reason, it is quite a shame. This book could have been so much more than it is. I found myself skipping paragraphs, skimming over pages, I even skipped a few pages without looking at them to see if I missed anything when I started reading again. Turns out I really didn't.I'm getting bored of all the thumb twiddling, glaring, sweating, serene faces, and braid tugging. Will someone cut off that woman's braid already! A character in Salidar actually threatened to and I was thinking, \\"Yes, yes, please! I can't stand it anymore! Do it now!\\" But, of course, it never happened. Big surprise.At least, the magic system is more developed than in other fantasy series. For which, I am very grateful to Mr. Jordan. I don't think I could stand every character getting out of every pickle with not even a scratch.Now, some reviewers, say that nothing at all happens in this book. Which is definitely not true. Many things happen, it just takes a loooong while for characters to actually do them. If Robert Jordan would have cut out all the useless material, this book would have been a lot more enjoyable. I just hope that he doesn't keep this up throughout the rest of the novels. And if he has, let us hope that Brandon Sanderson can save it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was rather frustrated thinking of what to rate this book. It's not quite as good as \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" or the previous books, but it's still a bit better than most four-star books, including the first two in the series. I've settled on four stars, since giving this book five stars is just too much of a stretch and might imply too strongly that there aren't any flaws.The high points: Excellent characterization, great and detailed worldbuilding, awesomely funny scene where Rand researches his heritage, good writing and dialogue, intense conclusion, extremely awesome Asha'man, Mat Cauthon in general, and RAND AL'THOR TOTALLY KICKS AES SEDAI ASS!!!The low points: Plot moves along a bit slower than it should, quite a bit more detail and filler material than there strictly needs to be, the final few chapters feel a bit rushed, romance pops out of nowhere and is ill-explained, Min is not nearly good enough for Rand, most of the women are still bitches, and the sections with Morgase and the Whitecloaks were still boring as heck.Lord of Chaos is very good, but not quite up to the level of the previous three books. For those curious, Rand and Egwene get the majority of the chapters to themselves, and there are a total of 45 PoV characters in this book(no, I'm not kidding), the majority of whom get only a brief spot to themselves.If you liked the previous five books, you'll probably like Lord of Chaos, though you should keep in mind that this is not the kind of series to read if all you're interested in is immediate action and gratification. The Wheel of Time requires definite patience to get through and appreciate, though it is well worth it in the end.By the way, did I mention that Rand and the Asha'man totally own?"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"'Lord of Chaos' is book six of a projected twelve (!) in the 'Wheel of Time' series. The series is now firmly less an adventure story and more like a political thriller (fantasy style). There are plots and schemes and machinations and conspiracies galore. In fact I would say there are too many subplots and way too many characters- especially give Jordan's penchant for naming everyone and everything (including horses!). Having said that although I think the series could use a lot of trimming, I'm still caught up in the storyline and can't wait to find out what comes next. My understanding is that next few books are a lot like this one.

He and his friends travel all over the world trying to get everyone on his side, getting ready for the big battle which will decide whether the end of the world will go to the evil one or the good people. But not everyone will believe in him. There is magic, and unseen forces, monsters, strange peoples from far away, all kinds of different unexplainable things happening that can only happen when magic is used. It's a fun read, there are many small plots and twists to follow along the way. I love the story line, and the writer is wonderful. It's very colorful, and it is easy to visualize in your head, based on his descriptions, what is going on. The characters are very real and their personalities are very distinct and some are quite unusual.

There are good points, sure. The Dark Lord is heard from at last, we see more interaction between the Forsaken, which outlines their characters better than descriptions, the terrible battle at Dumai's Wells is well painted. But now Jordan is clearly stretching out each episode to the point where it becomes painful. TOR Books seems to have been too overawed by Jordan for whoever was edited the book obviously did little or nothing. The phrases get repetitive enough to madden the reader. Every woman for instance \\"folds her arms beneath her breasts\\". Sorilea thinks every woman whom she likes has \\"hips mean for babies\\". What happened to the famous imagination? Wake up editor and smell the coffee. Jordan also introduces fresh complications in an already complex saga by reincarnating two Forsaken, evidently Aginor and Balthamel, for what purpose, nobody knows. But the biggest disappointment is Jordan's treatment of female characters. I thought that here at last is a true adventure of equals with both men and women playing starring roles. But the women spend most of their time arguing like cats and then get stuck with inconsequential parts. The weather may be a problem; Jordan never quite explains why; and it seems the quest for the Bowl of the Winds (so conveniently and unconvincingly seen in a dream! please!) seems more a device to get them out of the way. Jordan also appears to believe in a real war of the sexes. All the women are arrogant, consider men a bunch of idiots, (\\"need their ears boxed daily on general principle\\") and behave in the most juvenile manner imaginable. Rather than have such caricatures of female characters, I would rather have a male-only book. And Jordan's contempt for his readers as seen in his glossary is profound. The glossary if anything, is smaller than his earlier books! Why have those wretched incomplete pages at all? As for a decent map of the world, forget it. Down to 3 stars this time I am afraid."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is huge; (which is not saying much in regards to the WOT, but this book seemed the biggest so far) so huge I can barely remember anything that happens, except the ending which was decent. Besides that, I do remember the beginning of the book where various peoples were gathered in the court of Tear to witness Rand announce something or punish someone or some such thing (again, my memory fails me). Anyway, a good chunk in the beginning of the book detailed how everybody in that court was staring at or studying someone else. Really; it went something like this (and I'm not quoting verbatim): \\"the Tairen lords were studying Rand, blah, blah, blah. The Cairhens were watching the Tairen lords, yadda, yadda, yadda. In truth, everyone was watching somebody else.\\" Wow. Exciting. Everyone was watching someone else. Please excuse the sarcasm but it does this for at least 15 pages or so (and that could very well be a conservative estimate). Maybe I'm entirely missing the point but was this really necessary? Was it really important to have all these people stand around watching someone else? And even if it was, was it necessary to go on and on about it? This to me as a good example as any of Jordan's problem of \\"diahrrea of the pen\\" (or word processor). Lots and lots of words to announce that Rand was leaving Tear or something or that Elayne and Egwene decide to go and find a bowl. You have to do a lot of reading (or perusing) to find the choice bits, of which there are few, in ANY WOT book. Of course, this is still better than book 7 (and perhaps 8, as suggested from some of the customer reviews for that book), where the entire books looks to be filler, but that's really no excuse. I'm afraid I'll give this book 2 stars, despite the exciting ending because I just can't recall the other 500+ pages of the book, except the ending; and that scene where the people stand around looking at each other."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Maybe I've missed something all along. Maybe Jordan's latest Wheel of Time installment, the 1,000-page Lord of Chaos, is in fact a masterpiece: an existential epic that's about nothing because, well, that's all we can look forward to in life--NOTHING; a fantasy book that teases us away from the monotony of our own dull daily lives, promising escapism, only to hit us over the head with more monotony (Oh, what a cruel, CRUEL joke!) Instead of comparing Jordan to his fellow fantasy hackers, maybe we should compare him to Camus, Sartre, or Beckett. Picture Rand as the brooding, Hamlet-esque lead, forever caught between thought and action; picture the entire now-nine-volume series as Fantasy meets Waiting for Godot. Brilliant, I'm telling you.

Then, breathe a deep sigh of relief when you finish the novel and realize, thank God, that such a horrific creature never even appeared.*Flash*Favorite Sexist Moment: As Egwene is named Amrlyin in Salidar, every female present must strip to the waist, bare her breasts, and announce proudly, &quot;I am a woman!&quot;This novel gets one star only because the ending is a brief return to form. The last one hundred pages are kind of interesting. The rest is complete filler."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well what can I say ... I liked the first book to an extent, but this is too much. The Aes Sedai do seem to smell of Bene Geserit, the Aiel of Fremen, Rand'al'Thor of Paul Atreides and the rest is just filling the gaps with slightly personal / emotional scenes that are remarkably all alike. And on top of that, the action is WAY too slow. In fact, nothing happens.To elaborate on the above, all themes seem well known already, or just caricatures of the original ones, or, even, not well enough thought about. Its all very convenient reading about unreadable Aes Sedai faces, while they really are intensely angry inside, and -somehow- they manage to hide it. Why not, Bene Geserit could do it on the spot - it's just that I cant seem to remember any particular White Tower training scene. It just happens, somewhere, somehow. Or, how nice indeed, having a thing like Ta'veren to exploit whenever the situation turns a little crampy . Oh look, a lightning fell from the sky and the hero is saved miraculously because he is ta'veren. And why bother immersing the reader on a Daes Daemar intrigue? Just mention the thing, surely, it happens on the background being shadowy and stuff, no need for the reader to know how it's done really. Very convenient indeed. And intriguingly unimaginable.First perspective scenes follow two major patterns, depending on whether the character is a man or a woman. On the first case, in almost all scenes, he will be whining about his situation whether favorable or not, about his 'duty' that is 'so hard to do' , constantly in denial about his 'special ability' whether it's channeling or being ta'veren or anything else. On the second case, she will be muttering about how capable she is, how wool-headed men are (wool-head seems to be one of the writer's favourite words), about the difference of men and women. Couple scenes are always about their love, and strangely enough on how they do not understand one another under any circumstances.There is not much to say about the action. It is just extremely slow. One or two major events, that you are already expecting, and the rest is Nynaeve tugging her braid. Will Rand defeat evil _insert name of Forsaken here_ ? Please.Finally, concerning RJ's writting style, there are just a lot of repeating phrases and situations (tugging of braid,strange cats in a room, couple not understanding each other etc), that seem to make the plot even more boring and impersonal. Not only the scenes are similar , RJ's wording is highly repetitive, utterly eradicating the book's last hope of originality. On top of that, he keeps on going about unnecessary details, while the plot could fit in a paragraph, though not a very good one.My suggestion : read Ursulla LeGuin. Read Tolkien. Read Frank Herbert. Read Terry Pratchett. Don't waste your time through these books the way I did. RJ should try to actually write a real book instead of this endless recipe-sprung random-book-generator babbling."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I must shake my head in amazement when i read all of the five star reviews that this book gets. It's like these people haven't even read the first five books in the series, for if they did they would have to realize the dropoff in quality starting with Lord of Chaos. By no means a terrible book, this is where the majority of WoT readers can all agree that the series begins to stagnate. This is one of those rare novels where one can openly give the entire story away and not have to put spoiler tags because ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. Readers should just get used to this and stick it out, as this becomes a theme for the next three books or so.One thing that this book does do, however, is contintue to develop the entire female cast of characters into the most hateable ensemble of raving lunatic bitches to ever grace the pages of American literature. Just about every single chapter with Elayne or Faile is complete torture. Oddly enough, I don't really mind Nynaeve, but that's probably because she spends most of the series next to the completely intolerable Elayne. Seriously Elayne. Go away and die.Having said all of that, the book is interesting enough to get to the end, which is actually one of the most climactic endings in the entire series. All i have to say is this: Dumais Wells. That is all."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The reread before the release of book 12.1 continues. That the Gathering Storm being the first of an ending trilogy of books did not bother at the time they announced this fact. But now as I continue to read and see how Jordan has had to throw in so many elements to stretch things to these books, it has made me unappreciative of so many books.There was a good pace in the early books and the format we come to expect, hero that is reluctant to take on such an onerous task, gains the skills to handle it, then takes in on, seemed to be followed quite well. Time frame wise we now run into issues.Jordan wants to move his people all over his map that originally took half a year to transverse. There were his ideas to circumvent this, first the Ways, then portal stones, and now he can just open up holes and take entire people thousands of miles in a blink. But those long distances served another good balance, it caused the timeline to slow. All these subplots could develop because weeks and months were passing.That allowed the climax that is approaching to have more depth, to have more elements. Now we have in Lord of Chaos, again a book that the previous few could have led us to a conclusion of the story, so many elements that the story needs to be revaluated and since it was not planned from the beginning, we have problems.The illuminator Alludra and her not recognizing Thom whom they had met when her life was about to be snuffed out, is now explained in an elegant way. Someone, probably thousands of someones let Jordan know he had muffed it. Somewhere along the line, Jordan began to get full time assistants to help with the story. My understanding is there were 2 at one time, and his wife, and the editors at TOR.Jordan began to make things so complex with so many characters (something like 1800 now) that keeping track of it must have been difficult, but it seems clear now that we have gotten to another book where he could have brought us to an end, and instead holds us off, with so much that it is clear book 7 won't finish it either. Jordan has fallen into a pit. He is going to be writing and then have an inspiration, well if I were this character in book three, and all these things I have been writing about were happening in the world, then this thing that I had never thought of before must also be happening.Here is what is wrong with that. We see good keep maneuvering, and doing things to get their houses in order for the big battle. But evil isn't really concerned. Oh a few lieutenants of the head number one bad guy (The Dark One) are carefully fighting each other, and fighting our heroes every so often. But why is there not a Saruman making Uruk Hai armies to spring on the millions of human troops that are being united.Why are not the Trolloc and Myrdrall warriors skirmishing more and more to be ready for the fight, instead of just a few little attacks, that never succeed here and there. Why not use the opportunities that come the way of the lieutenants to snuff out Rand's friends, as Rand has killed several of the Forsaken when he could. Rand must be at the last battle, but the others need not, if you were evil, you would feel that.So Jordan has opened up the door too wide. There are too many things that he wants to tell in a short time as if every day is a crescendo to the climax. It of course is still great when read all in context. But you have to think that if he had sat down to dissect the plot of his entire arc, he would have known that the world he set up, would not be turning out the way he was writing it."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lord of Chaos might very well be the summit of Jordan's wonderful WoT series. The next couple of books after this sort of trail off, don't hold the reader as well as the books up to this do. That being said, you can't help but read his books. Not for nothing is Jordan the reigning king (along w/Martin) of fantasy epics.I'm aware that there are many who critisize the series for its sometimes heavy-handed messages and dozen or so cast of major characters (my fav is Mat). My response to these nay-sayers; try to find someone who has written as much as well as he has, in the time that he has done it. It will be a very short list.Jordan's great, the series (while very long) is great, and Lord of Chaos is also great. (wait 'till the end, it is spectacular)"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you've read the past books, and enjoyed them, the Lord of Chaos leaves you wanting more. In my opinion, this is the best book to date - my favorite. The last few chapters are heart-wrenching, and evoke such emotions as you read over the chapters. Surprises as you wouldn't imagine abound throughout the book, and such wrath and vengence at the hands of the Aiel and other powerful characters are beyond description! Totally amazing how the book ends too - you won't believe it!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of this series and read at least two more books before I realized this is a rather lengthy work with no resolution in sight. My suspicions were confirmed when I met the author at a book signing in Virginia and he told me they were considering ten to twelve books in the series. And they are not small tomes by any means!Any good story writer knows that a plot needs an end. While Robert Jordan is an excellent story teller, I wonder if he knows how to resolve all the conflicts in a tale. If so, this must simply be a money-making thing for him, not a legitimate literary pursuit."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Disregard the cover of this book, it is not, as it appears, a drug store romance novel. Inside the pathetic cover lies the greatest fantasy story I have ever read, and that is saying something. I have read Goodkind, Tolkien, and more, but the ending of this book surpasses everything else. It accomplishes with grace and power the emotions and suspense every author tries to create. The entire series is nothing short of awesome, but Lord of Chaos is the most impressive of all of the nine books. Without a doubt."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is fantastic. I happened to pick up the first book of this series on the recommendation of bookstore management. Impossible to put down. If I would have know that it takes so long for each new book, I wouldn't have started to read them. I would have just saved them so I could plow through them without waiting. All I can say is write faster!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"What can I say some people just don't get it. Robert Jordan (as he likes to be called) is a man who has spun a world filled with vivid charectors and history out of nothing. Thats not an easy thing to do in fact to my ming I can compare him only to Tolkien himself. Jordan created entire cultures and languages out of his own mind. Amazing!! Charector development is something that should not accur immediatly but is slowly learned over time as Jordan shows us with his stubborn charectors Nynvene and Rand al' Thor. Sometimes a story is so well done and so engrossing that one can not encompass its entirety into three or four books as many of his critics would like him too and I look forward to as many more as possible. My only qualm is that sometimes he takes a wee bit long to write another book and though each one shows a growing development, not only in him but in his charectors as well, his last book came out almost two years ago. Waiting for the next one is like sitting on the edge of my seat in a mystery, or horror movie wondering what will happen or who done it. Either way length or not Robert Jordan deserves a pedestal next to the best of his kind and should me noted among them as one of the best of them!!"},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The sixth book in the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series hits a high note that shatters walls. Jordan, a master of character and plot, offers up a wonderful fantasy epic that culminates in a tension-filled finale, guaranteed to have you brushing fingernail remains from the page.This story starts strong and careens headlong toward a violent climax that both satisfies and teases. I am continuously amazed at how much plot Jordan fits into this novel. Lord of Chaos is at once a novel of political intrigue, high fantasy, and war.But while the plotting is excellent, it is Jordan's characters that make this novel better than the average &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; epic. Character development is the central feature to Jordan's novels, a rarity in plot-driven high fantasy. He maintains this focus on character, though, without sacrificing story, showing us the people through their actions. This approach, of striking a perfect balance between character and plot, has made this novel a major event in writing, regardless of genre.Lord of Chaos is definitely the best of the seven in the series (so far, anyway - Jordan is planning to pen at least three more.) Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan has sapped all suspense in his series by over-using prophecies. We all know Rand is going to fight the dark one and &quot;lose his blood at Shayol Ghul.&quot; And, to put it bluntly, if Rand and crew do not win the last battle, the entire series would be a big waste of time. Thats not to say that I don't enjoy reading The Wheel of Time. Quite the contrary; in fact, its hard to not get excited when you pick up a brand new WoT book. I'm just pointing out that Mr. Jordan has used prophecies as a huge crutch in the plot. Why does Rand go out of his way to take Callandor? Propechy. Why does anybody even support him and not just gentle him on sight? Prophecy. Prophecy this, prophecy that.In my honest opinion, the only reason to continue reading this series is to find out how exactly things will happen, not whether or with whom."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have to agree with some of the other people that have reviewed this book, it is not up to the same standard as the first 3 in the series. Having started negativly I have to admit that it is a hell of a book. The way that he develops the characters and does not just give you the regular &quot;I am the hero and everything is just going to fall into place for me&quot; is intriguing. I also find some of the ideas that people have expressed about the book in these reviews fascinating and have given me some new ideas about what I think will be happening in the remaining books of the series. I do recomed that people reading this attempt of a review should buy or borrow this book to read it but, please, not before you have started at the beginning from number 1 onwards."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It may be only once in a millenium that a writer like Robert Jordan is born. He has managed to combine the wit of Stephen King, the mysticism and charm of Tolkien, the humour of Jack L. Chalker and the romanticism of Stephen Donaldson. He has managed to create a world which captures our fantasy to a violent extent and leaves us gasping for more. In the sixth part of the series, which many would term as the greatest work of fiction ever, he has not disappointed us by turning the plot into a repetition and a monotony. Though the lead characters appear to be heading toward the ultimate triumph, there is a whole lot of doubt thrown in with the little twists and turns that only Mr. Jordan can produce. The characters continue to develop and become more complex and more open to us. The plot moves with a vastness and swiftness that is sadly lacking in most of the so-called fantasy books of today. Mr. Jordan has once again left us with an absolute sizzler: one which a person resents putting down even for a second. This is one series where the readers have hardly become less interested, what's more they are anxiously, at least I can say this for myself, waiting for all future parts to follow, no matter how long it may take. I only wish that Mr. Jordan manages to repeat this performance over and over and not be hurried at all in efforts to complete this series. This is one series for which one could wait years . Tolkien may have started it but Robert Jordan has taken it to the skies."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT.

Mazrim really did die of his injuries and demandred took his place close to al'thor as to be able to manipulate him. The asha' man are meant to sicken al'thor...the whole book has set Mazrim up to challenging Rand's ideas and faith. Lews Therin knew before me who Taim really was and he was my main clue, he always whines about the forsaken when Taim is around. Rand doesn't see this because Lews Therin is , of course, stark raving mad. Or is he. He saw the truth before anyone else. I loved this book almost parreleling Steven King's WasteLand for subtle hints that could lead you anywhere or nowhere. The only thing i didn't like was the lack of urgency so present in the first 3. I loved when Rand had to run from Ishamnael ( or should i say Ba'alzamon). And dodge the evil in Aridohl and Four Kings. Now it seems as if he can click heels and go anywhere ( which he can) and deal with any threat, not counting half the white tower attacking him. I miss the adventures and the evil so apparent in the first 3. Now the evil seems familiar and thus not as evil.

How can you, an author, expect to retain readers when you do not continue a story's plot? The only thing this book did was relocate the characters. The personalities stayed the same, and all of the problems that were there at the beginning of the book are still there at the end.Needless to say, I will never buy another book in this series again, since this one was frustrating and a waste of time..."},{"Title":"Lord Of Chaos (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Book Six of Robert Jordan's &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series, Lord Of Chaos is a two cassette, 2.75 hour, digitally mastered, abridged audiobook that continues the story of Rand al'Thor and his struggle to unite the nations for the Last Battle when the Dark One will break free into the world to spring the snares laid by the immortal forsaken to the detriment of an unwary humankind.

The three that follow this are almost 1/2 to 1/3 the size content wize - they have increased the font size to keep the physical dimensions of the books similar.

First, I'd like to thank those that left such superb reviews because they were instrumental in my decision to plunk down the somewhat high cost of this duo...but I'm so glad I did! Everything the other reviewers said was true - these are absolutely essential and have totally transformed my ideas on gardening.Living in Florida one would think we could grow anything - while that may be true in some parts of the state, other areas of Florida are just plain difficult. Poor soil quality (think beach sand), unrelenting heat, excessively high humidity (think ROT, mold, mildew) and then...to top it all off...one or two days here or there with numbing cold (okay, numbing for Florida...it does drop to the 20's!). We've tried to garden time and time again only to encounter dismal, pathetic \\"crops\\". So much work, energy and effort for so very little.It seemed we were constantly battling everything. The only items that did well were a couple of fruit trees (but one can only eat so many Kumquats). Still, it gave us hope because the kumquat tree regularly produces HUGE crops 2x's per year - massive amounts. If we could only get a few other things to do 1/10 that of the kumquat tree we'd be on to something.Finally, one of us got the bright idea that there had to be a way to work with nature rather than against it...we were clearly NOT winning...we had no idea what that would be called but after hunting and pecking around came up with the term \\"permaculture\\". Ahhhhh....we already knew trees seemed to give a better \\"bang for the buck\\" but now we have totally transformed EVERYTHING we ever thought we knew about gardening.Seriously - did I mention what a waste of time the Master Gardening class was? How about the several months of hydroponic training (now that was a costly and very tasteless mistake), the greenhouse (at least we will get a little enjoyment and can put it to good use). What I really like about this book is that it provides the information you need for YOUR specific situation...it's not a one size fits all approach but rather really informs and teaches you what to do, why to do it and then provides the basics for you to understand how.It has radically altered everything we have ever learned about gardening.

Quite a monumental accomplishment for the authors, and very useful to anyone wishing to delve into edible perennial gardening from a systematic approach. The charts make the 2nd volume particularly useful, I'd say if you only have the budget for one of the books, make it the 2nd one. Note that these authors live in New England and thus much of the information is is bioregionally tailored to that climate and ecology. Nonetheless I live in a different region and I have found the books very useful and much of the information is applicable anywhere.Would be a 5 star review if they put out a more affordable paperback version. People I know who could best use this information-- homesteaders and community garden organizers-- are probably unable or unwilling to spend nearly $100 for a couple of books."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"I was looking for a solid intro to permaculture. I wanted something recent, thorough and although there are several good ones that fit with those criterias, it's the only ones that fitted with my northern location and I'm so pleased with them. Some say they repeats too much but I wouldn't say that, especially that the sum of information is huge and some repetitions are simply an occasion to make links between all the data. Even though the authors' perception of the world environment situation is clearly on the worrying side, they try to be objective and let the knowledge do the talk.It covers many aspects of the temperate forest; vegetation layers, their function, mimicry for a small edible garden multiple functions of plants, soil, designing with your goals as a starting point, with ecological complementarity in mind including fauna. In brief, every step from scratch to harvesting.It really changed my perception of ecosystems and I can't wait to start my own experiemnts with the very handy list of hardy edible plants suggested with all the info needed to create a self-sustaining garden."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"It's no surprise to learn that Dave and Eric worked for seven years to write the Edible Forest Gardens books; the depth and breadth of permaculture knowledge that they present is incredible. Although I've heard some say that these books are not an easy read, I've found them to be fascinating, enjoyable and indispensable. I started my journey into permaculture with Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway, then decided to plant an edible forest in the back yard, so I purchased Volume 2 of Edible Forest Gardens, since it covers the practical consideration of forest gardening. I was so impressed with the book that I then purchased volume 1, which focuses on the ecological vision and theory for temperate climate permaculture.

It draws on a very large number of ecological and forestry publications, with full references. The chapter end-notes are easy to use and refer to an appended bibliography. Numerous colour photographs, and diagrams illustrate the concepts. Both as text and as a reference it will retain its value.There are many tough patches of ecological complexity, and of subtle theory. Numerous times I could read a few pages only until I had come to understand some difficult to grasp concept, then I would need to put the book down as the authors started a fresh mental adventure. Review after each chapter could be helpful during reading, but I continued to finish, and now plan to solidify understanding by going over pencil-marked passages. Throughout, even difficult topics are made clear.A highlight to me was the authors' masterful handling of the various theories of ecological succession, brief comments on their historical development, and preliminary discussion of how they can be used in design and management. Their enthusiasm and humor, allowed only occasional brief exposure up to this point, break through here as they repeatedly state the need for freedom, experimentation, and fun.I found the introductory portions inspirational, also the final text portions and the catalogue of 100 most useful plants--I skipped ahead and read this listing to get a break from the theory and to see what plants could be used in my northern boreal forest location.If this instructional and authoritative volume had been available in the 1970s, we might now have more commonly available permaculture forests and gardens for practical examination and evaluation, and a generation of working designers.Volume Two on design and practice sits on my shelf.

Now, I've only read the first one (about to start on volume number 2), but the quality of information in the first volume in outstanding. Volume 1 is concerned with the theory behind forest gardening, but with a keen eye towards using that information in the second volume (which includes detailed information on actually creating a forest garden). David Jacke does a great job of covering everything from invasive plants to forest succession to what a guild is and how to build one to underground microbes and why we should care about them. Full of informative figures, graphs and sidebars, this book does an excellent job of filling a niche that has been otherwise missed by many permaculture and sustainable ag books - what to do in the more temperate, rainy parts of the world. I'd recommend this book over Patrick Whitfield's great book if you live in the U.S. because it suggests a variety of plants native to the U.S. and has a larger number of useful species for people who live in the U.S. and are dealing with colder temperatures than those seen in Britain. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in creating an edible landscape on a piece of property."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"I bought the books to understand the practical aspects of building a forest garden on my 2 acre land. I started reading the vol 2 because that seemed to contain the practical advice. However, soon after, I became convinced that vol 1 can not be ignored. Now I have read vol 1 and am truly in awe of the authors' clarity of thinking and organizing the vast amounts of material and data. The theory is clear and up-to-date with vast recent scientific knowledge- a rare combination indeed.My only advice to a beginning reader would be to read the last part (conclusion) of vol 1 before and in between the various chapters in order to maintain motivation and interest in the overly theoretical- but necessarily so- parts of vol 1. That chapter really ties the theory together with your reasons of going into such details as are presented.I found in that chapter my \\"aha\\" moment.Thanks to the authors for these wonderful and helpful books. Are worth their weight in gold- or rich moist forest humus!"},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"If you are a home gardener who has ever stopped to wonder whether permaculture was useful to you, you need to read these books. If you are an intermediate to advanced permaculturist, you will revel in these books. If you want to understand how a single individual with a garden can make the world a better place, you need to read these books.Jacke and Toensmeier lay out an incredible vision in Volume I for the potential that permaculture holds for gardeners in the northern US. And they lead the reader through an eye-opening education in the scientific theory which supports that vision. In Volume II, they walk the reader through the process of creating their own unique vision for the reader's own permaculture design. Then they lay out, step by step, how to progress from vision to reality.Along the way, they range from the theoretical to the highly practical, from how many miles of fungal strands are in a teaspoon of soil from the forest floor, to exactly how to plant a tree so that it not only survives but thrives. And they do it in a voice which is both learned and whimsical, enthusiastic and serious -- and downright fun.I'm buying a second set of these books. I need to keep one set with me as I build my garden; I learn new things every time I turn the page, knowledge I need on a \\"how to\\" level. But I need a second set, so that I can lend it to my friends who would get tremendous insight from reading these books...my order for my second set is going in today!Full disclosure: I am a very pleased client of Dave Jacke's design practice."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"I'll start by saying that even though this is a great 2-volume set, it scared me away from actually creating a forest garden for years. The first volume gives an extremely detailed and comprehensive overview of the theory behind forest gardening. If you start reading this book and think that you actually need to understand all this stuff in order go and plant a forest garden, you'll probably throw in the towel and never do it. There are a million details covered, and understanding it all to me seems like a daunting task.I also found it for the most part very boring and even redundant. Based on some of the other reviews, other people seem to disagree with this. But to me in terms of excitement this book is just a shade above a technical manual (except the first section on \\"Vision,\\" which I found very interesting)And the thing is, you don't need to know everything in this book to start a forest garden. If you actually want to know what you need to know about making a forest garden, I highly recommend Martin Crawford'sCreating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops. When I read that book, I realized that I already basically knew what I needed to know in order to actually get started and put plants in the ground. Before I read Crawford's book I felt almost hopelessly lost. I had only been reading Edible Forest Gardens, which makes creating a forest garden seem like a superhuman task. Martin Crawford's book puts it on a more human level. In the end, there really aren't that many really key points to consider in making a forest garden. And the rest is mostly practical common sense. (I'm oversimplifying here. . . there's a thousand different nuances to the theory, but in the end most of these nuances don't directly affect what you're going to put in the ground. They are intellectual candy).OK. I've blasted the book enough. On to the praise.I'm very glad to have this 2-volume set. The appendices of volume 1 and 2 are extremely valuable to anyone wanting to create a forest garden, and I personally think that it's worth the purchase price of these books just to get the appendices. The appendices to volume 2 contain all sorts of data about plant species you may want to put in your forest garden (though I've learned that if you really want to make certain about any particular stat, verify it with other sources if you can. . . it's not uncommon to get different data if you look at another source). That being said, it is by far the best compilation of data of its kind. It's an absolutely wonderful resource, and I'm sure it took a tremendous amount of tedious labor to create (I believe Eric Toensmeier is the one to thank there). I have yet to find a species I've been interested in planting in my forest garden that has not been in the appendices.Also I absolutely love the appendix to volume 1, which is what the authors call the \\"Top 100\\" species for forest gardening. If you are new to forest gardening, you will love this. It goes into detail about all of these cool species you can plant, and it's useful later on as well since you can look to this list to find species which for the most part \\"play well\\" in the forest garden.I do also enjoy browsing through the body of Volume 2 (the \\"practice\\" volume, as opposed the the \\"theory\\" of volume 1) to find material on specific topics of interest, but I would not recommend to anyone that they read it straight through. There's lots of interesting things to consider. It's more of a browsing book than a sit-down-and-read book (at least for me. . . I'm sure there are some out there who would disagree). It's almost like a reference manual, but not exactly.There's a quote of Peter Bane that's on the back of the book which I find particularly apt in describing it. \\"This book will define the intellectual territory of it subject for at least a generation.\\" If I knew how to italicize the word \\"intellectual\\" I would. I agree with this quote. It's a very important book on this subject, but it's very heady and is not really practical as a \\"how-to\\" kind of book, at least not for mere mortals like me. It's a great reference, and belongs on the shelf of any really serious forest gardener, but if you are looking for something that will tell you the basics of forest gardening and get you up and running and putting plants in the ground, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"These books are college grade and leave nothing to guess. A complete education and reference set in one package. If you want to get into permaculture this 2 book set is your education shopping list.The first volume assumes you are a traditional gardener/farmer, or completely new to seeing plants for what they are, and gives every bit of information to bring you up to speed. Another book I had bought only gave some projects to do and I no longer think that author knew enough to write a book. The knowledge from volume 1 is critical to making the right choices and understanding why.The second volume is twice as thick as the first and is dedicated to applying your new knowledge to actual projects. It gives so much well organized information that your brain will be in extacy.Together, these books store a small library of information. Several sections and indexes hold entire books worth of data on their own. Just one of the plant matrices holds important facts on over 600 species so you can find the specific member of a plant family that suits your needs.I am just awestruck at the amount of information I have received in this 2 volume set. I need no other books relating to horticulture.Must have!"},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"This book adds depth to the existing research in agro-ecology. It provides new information and examples specific to temperate, especially warmer-temperate climates. It also highlights applications of this information in the first section: \\"Vision.\\" The authors have put together a massive work that will certainly serve my reference for years to come. This work is primarily an information-packed textbook that includes much in the way of strategies and principles which apply to all biological development of landscapes. In this regard the book can serve as a text in any regenerative landscape studies.For me, the most valuable aspects of this book are:-the articulation of integrated design principles (so many good one's under one cover)-the masterful graphics (who did them all?)-the development and refining of new language for thinking about agro-ecosystems. E.g. they've taken out the word \\"invasive\\" and use the word \\"opportunist\\" instead; advancing our approach in this perennial challenge and contextualizing it in a more proper problem-solving/use-based approach, as opposed to the useless conservationist/alarmist approach that can't find the leverage.-the case studies, although I wish there were more.-The \\"top 100\\" plant list for temperate climates = awesome resource.-the depth of research (which is fairly mind-blowing) including aspects such as cross sectional mapping of root systems, nutrient flows in agro-ecosystems, and much much more.It is obvious why this book has taken many years to produce.I am left with several confusions/questions. One is the name: \\"Forest\\" gardening. The authors show the differences between forest and woodland systems (as in % canopy cover) and are clearly explaining strategies for WOODLAND gardening with some light coming in through a partially open canopy. \\"Edible Woodland Gardening\\" would make more sense and the term Forest is a bit misleading. (This is not a book about mushroom cultivation, or understory crops alone). Maybe it's simply that woodland is a fairly unused term in the States.Another frustration is in the case studies/examples. The case studies are few and examples of strategy applications are brief. They are also only from fairly warm-temperate sites: southern England, North Carolina, etc. I did not see any from New England, for instance, where both authors reside. Of course there are not an abundance of sites to use as examples, but there are many more than are shown. I wonder why the Bullock Bros. woodland garden in a temperate region of the US was not highlighted or referenced, for instance. I am hoping that Volume II has more of these case studies.Overall an incredible work of research with an applied focus and a super useful source of ecological design principles that are crucial for any student in any field connected with biological landscape development.Ben FalkWhole Systems Design, LLCMoretown, Vermont, USA"},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"Amazon is offering a pretty great package deal with these books, and I would gladly get another to share with friends.

Anyone dissing these books because they didn't notice or understand that information is being absurd at best.Good warning, though, for anyone else from climates very explicitly NOT covered by these books: if you do not live in a temperate climate, these volumes will not provide you with some types of \\"real hands on information\\" for where you live - though I'd have thought that the detailed information in these books on subjects such as how natural systems work, how to be your own property surveyor, how to think through your gardening needs and expectations before you plant, how to prepare and manage every type of soil imaginable, and many other practicalities, would apply everywhere.Anyway, for those of us who do live in temperate climates, these volumes are a godsend - because almost all previous works on permaculture were written for people living in climates like Australia's. The principles were elegant, but the details did not translate - to a really miserable degree. Everything from plant species to building construction to animal housing was relentlessly geared to the tropics and subtropics.The writing style in these books is dense, but exquisitely clear and well-crafted. The authors write with a rare combination of passion and intelligence. If that isn't your thing, fine, be bored with it for \\"a year or so.\\" Many people would move on after a week, but no further comment, other than this: anyone living on any continent who can't find \\"some information\\" (principles, stories, examples, techniques, helpful diagrams) in these two gloriously detailed volumes isn't likely to find it anywhere."},{"Title":"Edible Forest Gardens, 2 Volumes","review":"I bought the two books, despite the price because everyone talked about them.

I haven't been in primary school for quite a number of years. Don't talk down to me. Perhaps I stand alone on this matter.The chapters meander through topics only to backtrack and cover those topics again before backtracking and covering those topics again so that the authors can backtrack and cover those topics again in order to backtrack and cover those topics again. Then, after all, the authors attempt to cover those topics again from a different point of view which is actually nothing more than the same point of view restated.Their 'theories' are the work of dilettantes. The only usable information was cited from other sources. After reading this book I know little or nothing more about forest gardening than I did before reading it.

This is the place to do a quick perusal to determine whether you want to know more.

For years, I've worn Channel No.5 and come close to adoring the scent on me and others. What's not to like- it consists of essential oils from sandalwood, vanilla, rose, ylang-ylang, neroli and bergamot and other fine oils. Of course, having worn this perfume for so long, as did my mother, I also know the perfumers use a very special rose (and plenty of it) and that the way the perfume is mixed affects the scent. I also know that the version sold in many department stores in the States is an inferior grade. You have to buy the blend that has not been overly diluted with alcohol.One of the aspects of this book I truly appreciate is the overview of all the different uses of essential oils. Essential oils can be used medicinally for sure or as health and beauty aids. You can also use them as household cleaning products. For example, you don't have to use moth balls to protect your woolens, you can use a blend of essential oils (including cedar oil) and they will smell better in the spring.

His painfully meticulous inquiry into Byron's life, as well as the lives of his associates, is second only to his vibrant way of weaving all of this information together to bring forth the portrait of Byron. This is not only a portrait of Byron, but one of the general Romantic Hero; anyone who is interested in the culture and history of this period of time, as well as Romanticism in general, would benefit intellectually from reading this book. If you wish to know more about Byron's role in the struggles for Greek independence, about the various rumors intertwined with Byron's love associations, about his interactions with the Shelley family, or about his personal quirks, then you will enjoy this book immensely. Luckily, Marchand is able to balance out his portrait without slipping into &quot;gossip column writer mode.&quot;In an age when academic types write books to show off theoretical knowledge or a large vocabulary, it is refreshing to see a book that relies more on actual knowledge rather than theory; indeed, the writing style is neither pedantic nor alienating. Readers who are not formal students of literature will feel more than comfortable with this book, while those who are engaged in formal scholarship will find this an enlightening example of pure and true scholarship."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book really did change the way I look at things. Also,don't miss &quot;Immortality&quot;, Kundera's other masterpiece. Hewill liberate you from &quot;dragging your painful self through the world&quot; into a different realm."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"On a list of my top five favorite books of all time, this book would probably be first. More so than any other Milan Kundera book I've read (and I've read quite a few), this book is the quintessential blend of Kundera's trademark humor, tangential insights, and passionate characters. More a series of loosely-related short stories than a full novel, TBoLaF is a whimsical jaunt that masquerades as a light read while imparting significant observations and lessons about the human animal. This was the first MK book I ever read, and I think it is an excellent introduction to his body of work. While many site The Unbearable Lightness of Being as MK's magnum opus, and it very well might be, but I feel this book is at least as representative of his masterful style, and probably more accessible. While TULoB is a masterpiece, TBoLaF is less polished (in a good way), and is considerably lighter (excuse the pun). It's a book I would read again and again, just for the reassurance that beautiful, playful, and insightful writing is alive and well in the late twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I love Kundera's books. I make no apolgies on that point. While they are not the type of books that I would categorize as &quot;leisure reading&quot;, his works are absolutely captivating. K shows off his erudition as he takes us on a stroll thru 20th century postmodernism. It is difficult to categorize this book....and perhaps that's the point. His remarks on music, love and poetry are trenchant and evocative. I would highly recommend that every educated and cultured person should read MK. Just bring a sense of wonder and your imagination......let Mr. Kundera do the rest!"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I read this for a book group. We all arrived for the meeting talking about how frustrating the read had been. We were then most pleasantly surprised that this book generated one of our best discussions in months. It's a meaty read."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Rules on reading The Book of Laughter and Forgetting1) There's no one plot. There's not supposed to be. Deal with it. There are seven separate parts, on the surface entirely unrelated (yes, even the two Tamina chapters are not related, on the surface). Think of the seven parts as composing the background of the tragedy of Tamina - the details that compose the necessary context of Tamina, but ultimately are exactly that - context. Think of the novel as a painting - you can't have the central figure without the wall behind her, the desk she's sitting at, the work she's doing.2) It's not a novel, whatever the cover may say. It's a collection of seven parts into one \\"cyclical\\" book.3) It's not about either laughter or forgetting, though those are present. It's about life.4) Most likely, you'll come across something and think, \\"That's interesting.\\" And then twenty minutes later, on an entirely different topic, you'll think, \\"That's a good point.\\" In the next part you'll think, \\"Well, that's probably true. Hmmmm.\\" Each time you'll come across an interesting point. The interesting points may not be connected - that doesn't matter. Ultimately, this book is a collection of thoughts - thoughts grouped into Thoughts, grouped with other Thoughts into one of seven parts, grouped with six other parts into one book.5) Some may say that this book is life-changing. They're either fooling themselves or they've made a mistake - it's not *supposed* to be life-changing. It's not *supposed* to build up to one major point, climbing and climbing up to one shattering climax, one life-changing idea. To acknowledge the metaphor (and not to sound crude), this book should *not* be an intellectual orgasm. It should be a parade of intellectual questions. (There lies the most important part - it *asks* questions, not answers them.)6) Kundera says that this is a book of \\"variations\\" - separate parts varying slightly from one theme to go deeper and deeper into that theme. He's wrong.7) Finally, don't believe what anyone says about this book, especially me."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I had no expectations about this book and after reading it felt the author was misogynistic and self-indulgent.Would not recommend."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book is wonderful if you know how to read it. I don't believe it's meant to be read as a novel, but rather as a series of vignettes about individuals, moments, feelings, and emotions of &quot;ordinary people&quot; during the tumultuous post-WWII Czech Republic. That part of the novel is delightful and a breath of fresh air; it's real history painted with delicate attention to detail instead of the broad, sweeping strokes of historians who have a habit of focusing on well-known dissidents and politicians. I've never read other books by Kundera, so perhaps my interpretation is skewed. However, I have visited Prague and this book satiated the thirst I've had to scratch beneath the surface of the touristic atomosphere that has taken over there. Read this book, and imagine that the people you encounter on the streets in Prague likely remember the oppression and misery Kundera speaks of in these pages."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Laughter amid litost; no guilt at denouncing laughter amidst profound dispair.

This was an international bestseller which I did get something out of &amp; I would recommend it. Depending on 'YOU' this book can be as DEEP as you want it to be. Each story gave me something different--here's the premise &amp;/or what I got out of each: Story 1: Personal letters reveal secrets. Story 2: Exploratory love works for those willing to explore. A childhood memory returns and a true to life fantasy is created. A mothers arrival is pleasantly expected for a given time frame. A mothers visit adds a bit of controversy. A mothers departure reeks of soft spoken love. Story 3: There are many good reasons to smile, laugh, and dance in a circle. Living is happiness. Laughing is living profoundly. Story 4: A yearning and hope to read one's long lost written words are revisited. The realization that every one without exception bears a protential writer within him. Story 5: A story of love &amp; hopelessness between a 'pretty boy Prague student' and a married woman. A parable for the aspirirng poet &amp;/or writer. Story 6: Is forgetting a voyage to dying? Real music epics (symphonies) are a thing of the past. Sex is not love but merely a territory love takes over. Is the closeness of death all but a carefree childlike dream?

It amazes me that the english language can be written this way through a translator of originally czech text. The book is an incredible work. I highly recommend it, although you could probably pick up a used one at a local bookstore instead of buying it at amazon."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This is one of Kundera's best works and a good place to start for an introduction to his fiction. I don't use the term \\"novel\\" because Kundera hesitates to use it. As he says in the text, this book is made up of little vignettes (with no common characters) which are different \\"variations\\" on the themes of laughter and forgetting. Like much of Kundera's work, it deals with the subjugation of the Czech people. When the Russians took over their country, they instituted a program of official \\"forgetting\\" - erasing the country's culture and history. The book is a good example of Kundera's philosophical style - with an emphasis on telling, not showing."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"The only other book I've read of his is The Unbearable Lightness of Being, which is one of my favorite books, and I've read other Czech authors as well, which I've always enjoyed. The Book of Laughter and Forgetting seems more like a collection of short stories than a novel, though with connecting themes familiar to Kundera's work: Prague in 1968, exile, sex, love, death, art and politics. This book uses much more symbolism than Unbearable Lightness, even venturing in magical realism at times. It is also much more 'intellectual' in the French sense than Unbearable Lightness. A good book, and worth the read, but I prefer more actual storytelling than this book provides."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This novel (a novel of fragments and variations on a theme) concerns those concerned with recovering history, in the literal sense of covering over. Made up of seven parts, with only Kundera and a character named Tamina the revisited positions, the novel plays with the notion of musical variation and gives it literary expression. Kundera takes the familiar cords, the exile, the rebel, the man and the woman with A Past, the photograph, and the supposed &quot;innocence&quot; of children, and he plays them in a variety of combinations and tempos to highlight the subtlety in each note and the infinite variety and depth of each life. This is a novel in which Kundera stares fully at his own culpability in Czech politics and he does so at the novelistic moment of watching his father die. One of the most poignant moments in the book, and one which underlines Kundera's notions here about Utopias, ideals, and aspirations, is that &quot;while we seek the infinity of the stars, we lose the infinity of our fathers.&quot; The book circles around this notion of creating the ideal world and aspiring to the ultimate human organization, and sends in pointed and damaging attacks on the dehumanization of such processes and aspirations. It is, to my mind, the finest of Kundera's novels (though _Slowness_ comes a close second). It is seemingly non-linear, asks more questions than it provides answers, and will demand the acute attention of the reader, but, in the end, it is worth every strain of concentration"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This novel is easily worthy of more than 5 stars. It is the most unique and intellectually stimulating book I have encountered in all my history of reading. The way Kundera weaves so many seperate stories, anecdotes and historical facts along with some pretty heavy philosophical theory into the novel to make his views come alive is amazing. The section Litost (about the poets) was mesmerizing. This book has changed my view on life, love, laughter and history."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"In The Angels, the third part of The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, Milan Kundera criss-crosses the tale of two American girls attempting to impress their teacher by putting a spin on a class presentation with an account of his brief career as an astrologist during his last days in his homeland of Czechoslovakia, two anecdotes that have no relevance to one another, or do they? The goal of this lucid, experimental novel (described as \\"a meditation on existence as seen through the medium of imaginary characters\\") seems to be identifying the hidden coincidences and thematic unities of life itself. To accomplish this task, Mr. Kundera has disregarded the traditional definition of the novel and has composed a narrative that is unified in spirit and themes, rather than in time and place. A new cast of characters is drawn-up for each of the seven parts (with only one who populates two sections) but the same subject matter (laughter, understanding, remembrance, forgetting, spiritual and emotional transcendence) unifies the opus. Meanwhile small dashes of historical anecdotes, personal accounts and philosophical musings are added to further explore the themes. The resulting work is absolutely unique, wholly engaging and remarkably insightful."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Some writers you have to have read to take yourself seriously as a person. With that in mind I had 'Unbearable Lightness' on my list. But after having been recommended 'Laughter/Forgetting', opted for that instead.I know this is a really clever novel full of symbolism, political/historical commentary and philosophical musings. I know that others rave about it. I know it hints to Nietzsche, Sartre and Kafka, but, I am sorry Mr Kundera, this lowly teacher in the North East of England just could not get on with it.Selected sections from the book were valuable, for example, the one about mama and her priorities, her innate perspective which allowed her to understand that everyday activity, such as picking pears, is much more important than the politics of a nutty dictator. However, the outlook in general, the sense of alienation created, the rough treatment he gives Tamina, the poor presentation of women in general, it was all a bit much. I had to force myself to complete reading the book and felt it was quite a futile exercise(which explains why it took me ages), asking myself repeatedly 'Why am I reading this?'Kundera, in this book, is coarse in his symbolism and his dire outlook is outright depressing. There must be more beautiful ways of expressing oneself about life than this. I know life can suck, be unfair and sad, but why write about it like this, not giving the reader a shred of hope?"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"In his at first sight 'light-hearted' style, Milan Kundera tackles profound questions. In this book: why want people to forget the past? Why do people forget the past? Why want and try people that other people forget the(ir) past? His answer: to control the future. And why do people want to control the future: to rewrite the past.For the struggle of mankind against the powerful is the struggle of the mind against forgetting.The political/social and/or religious powerful are obsessed by the political or moral past. Christianity is obsessed by the sexual past (paradisiac sexuality) of mankind. In the countries of Eastern Europe, politicians are obsessed by their collaborationist past. If they can't rewrite the past, they have no future.This book is brilliantly composed along those themes. As Milan Kundera himself states: as 'Variations on a Theme' by Beethoven: every part with different characters, situations, surroundings ...A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I would have to agree with another reviewer that I would have perferred more storytelling in this book. The first chapter in which Tamina appears is magnificent--a simple and direct yet remarkably poignant story. Later in the book, however, Kundera lost my interest when his stories disintegrate into purely allegorical fantasy, and he rambles on about himself, Milan Kundera, a bit too much.Kundera's mix of heavily symbolic story with philosophical musing was highly effective in \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\\" As for this book, I found much beauty in the first half, but had to force myself through the second half.

I had great difficulty getting into the first chapter but forced myself to keep going. Many books start slow , then get better. By the end of the chapter I was doubtful but liked it a little better. I decided to read on. The second chapter had nothing to do with the first. It was like an entirely different story. It was equally difficult to read. The book took a turn at this point and started to become very dirty indeed. I threw the book away wih no regrets."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I see Kundera as a chintesence of the senses, here and ther weighing more or less on a particular one.

Kundera leaves one's head spinning with his virtuosity. Plot takes a backseat to theme in The Book of L &amp; F. Kundera is expanding the range of the common notion of the novel: he combines fragments, scenes, ideas, dreams, fantasies, facts, history, autobiography, and stories. It works. His analogies are wonderful and clear and personally relevant. I'll return time and again to reread passages about &quot;litost.&quot; This acclamation is not to mislead one from the fact that Kundera can be a test, but the rewards are worth its taking."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I loved this book! His philosphy on laughter is absolutely novel! What a nice surprise. Very few books make me laugh out loud, but this was one of them."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I had a modernist/post-modernist class in college and we read this and I enjoyed it very much. It was a bit of a break from some of the difficult novels we were reading. Kept the book for years and recently re-read and got through half of it. For me it is a book best experienced when you are young. All the impressions, ideas, romantic/sexual stuff seems to have the depth of someone around college age. No longer young I was bored, but four stars for my remembrance of college pursuits."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This is a very novel novel. If the novel, as an art form, is in essence a piece of work with something wrong with it, then this quirky book takes up all the possibilities inherent in that and weaves a magical piece of fiction out of several, recurring themes, like a musical variation.Like the Unbearable Lightness of Being, the book tells the story of characters who occupy a curious, almost etheral existence as they grapple with the absurdities and terrors of Communist censorship in Czechoslovakia. Kundera's characters, certainly his male ones, are always highly intelligent and highly philosophical sexual beings. They love, they fret, and they die. There is much to be delighted about in this novel as characters struggle to find a voice in the face of censorship and are weighed down by the burdens of ageing and nostalgia.Kundera is always souffle light in his style, but the very best literature of this vein (the Continental reflexive style) combines lightness with weight. And I found that many of the stories slipped out of my memory after sparkling and shimmering for the short time they remained in there. This is evidently a book I wil have to reread.Also, try and pick up the edition with the author interview with Philip Roth at the back. Two great intellectual heavyweights ponder the architecture and themes of the novel, and life. Well worth reading if you can."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"The self proclaimed 'book' of laughter and forgetting is a wonderful tour-de-force that packs a punch concerning the concepts and ever recurring themes of life on earth. Kundera explores and questions the ideas behind laughter and the difference between laughing when things lose their meaning and laughing because of meaning. When reading this book you are sure to drown amidst the laughter of angels."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I read this book while working in a small shop in the French Quarter last summer. Everytime someone walked in and found me crying, they would try to comfort me and would then be annoyed that I was crying because of this book. Kundera, without a doubt, manages to capture the bittersweet reality of love and loss. In his typical postmodern narrative fashion, _The Book of Laughter and Forgetting_ reads like a symphony: there is happiness and sorrow, pain and joy. I found this book to be as close to the truth about love and loss as a writer can come. In the end, you feel as if you have managed to somehow deal with the bitter reality and survived."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"\\"The Book Of Laughter and Forgetting\\" was Kundera's phenomenal literary debut, earning considerable praise from Western literary critics when it was first published. It is a fascinating look at memory, sexuality and personal relationships as told through a series of seven distinct vignettes, each with a separate cast of characters (though two are directly interwoven.). His splendid, terse, yet lyrical, prose seemingly weaves these different sections into a coherent work of fiction. Part memoir, part political tract, and as well as fiction, Kundera looks at the human condition as seen through predominantly Czech eyes during the bleak aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, yet his themes remain universal and of interest to all."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I recommend this book. This author is so extremely and unnaturally talented that the sentences are only clothing for the story itself, which is about life in a way that is so subjective and objective. I explored myself when reading this book! I had many pregnant pauses to digest and internalize tiny pearls of wisdom strewn all over the beautifully written prose.I recommend \\"the unbearable lightness of being\\" by the same author as well.Milan Kundera has done a splendid and inspiring job."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book is great in the way that Laurence Sterne's _A Sentimental Journey_ is great: it is slender, full of delicacy and yet extremely erotic, immediate, and just about perfect. Indeed, I think it's stronger than the more famous _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Really a fantastic read, full of originality and some sense of realism. It's essentially a novel comprised of what could be called seven short stories, but interspersed within each story are the author's musings on life, politics, relationships and even autobiographical sketches. The perspectives Kundera provided about living and functioning within the former Czechoslovakia while under communist and Soviet control was, I thought, fascinating. Such perspectives were presented not just through autobiographical presentations, but through each character in each of the stories.Kundera's examination of relationships, be it the individual's internal relationship with him/herself, or the relations between the individual and other persons, the individual and \\"the state\\", or the individual and the whole of humanity were engaging. Kundera's writing and presentation were clear and concise, yet his concepts had great depth. His thoughts/opinions/perspectives gave me many opportunities to ponder life's various aspects. I appreciated that because it too often seems I get too bogged down with life's minutiae to remember to stop and reflect on important things...like how we (humanity) relate to each other.There are, however, a few sections, seemingly more towards the end, that just flat out border on the bizarre. That being said, it wasn't a major detractor from the overall quality of Kundera's writing.The only regret I have in reading this book is that I wasn't able to do it simultaneously with a friend who would also value the perspectives, philosophical musings and discussion of human relations that are contained in it. To do so would have led to great conversations while sitting with the friend in the corner of a quiet cafe on a cold, rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Another classic by Milan Kundera.

I will go on to read his other novels, but I will be more cautious with my expectations."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Milan Kundera is one of the more innovative writers of the 20th century. He treats the writing of a novel as artfully as sculptor or a painter. He dances his way across a wide array of concepts to bring in focus upon the main title themes of laughter and forgetting.The narratives in this book are separate and unrelated, except by theme.An expert at creating a scene aimed to raise a specific emotion in the reader, Kundera assembles characters to interact in ways which best illustrate the central themes. He is a master of tension. Although this is not a continuous, linear sequence of events, it is a linear sequence of ideas. The novel acts as a sort of medium of exploration through these topics - from treason to dancing, pure joy to discontent, and he even proposes a study on an emotion that he has found to be unnamed in any language besides Czech. It is clear he places great value on emotions and the inner-conflict, as well as the reconciliation of such, usually through unexpected means.It is beautifully written (even in translation). I can't imagine someone reading this novel and coming away with bad feelings about it, even though it is surely not what most readers expect it to be.If you like it, be sure to follow this book with The Unbearable Lightness of Being."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"reading any milan kundera book is certain to change your view on life forever.

In many ways this is an experimental novel, the seven different parts of the book are compared by the author to Beethoven's variations upon a musical theme. These different variations either describe, converge upon, or dance around the story of Tamina, a Czech exile who ran away from the communists with her husband only to see him die of disease soon afterward. As time passes she becomes obsessed with the mortal fear that she will forget him. She cannot go back to her homeland but she can try to get her husband's love letters back, to bring some of his laughter back into her life, to remind her that she is not alone.Tamina's homeland meanwhile, still languishes and suffers under the boot of the Soviet Union. The intellectuals who were so excited about communism in the late 1940s can't believe how wrong it goes over the next twenty years and try to correct their mistake. But the Soviets will have none of their \\"stalking a lost deed\\" as Kundera calls it--just as the Czechs are succeeding in relaxing the strictures of totalitarianism, in storm the Soviet tanks in 1968, ending the \\"Prague Spring\\" and delaying freedom in Eastern Europe for another twenty-one years.Published in 1978, three years after Kundera escaped the Iron Curtain and set down new roots in France, this book is also an important historical document. (I actually read it for the first time as an assignment for a 20th Century European history class in college in 1991--I'm still grateful to the professor.) It is important because it warns us of the insidious dangers of \\"forgetting.\\" One of the first things the communists did after crushing the Prague Spring was to fire some one hundred forty-five Czech historians from the universities in an attempt to erase the memory of the people. It is frightening how well they might have succeeded if the Soviet economy had stayed strong for another generation or two.THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING is touching and erotic, a moving and inspired intellectual feat. It is not humorous, but if you are open to the experience, it will inspire \\"serious laughter, laughter beyond joking.\\" Kundera has a gentle, straightforward style that evokes rich and vivid images (at least as translated by Michael Henry Heim--I look forward to reading Aaron Asher's in the future). For anyone who has loved, for anyone who has a memory, for anyone who appreciates the freedom we have in this society, THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING is a must."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Like Rushdie's Satanic Verses, this book is largely about angels and devils, or good and evil. The setting is (mostly) Prague around 1970, and the basic political themes -- Czech and Russian Communists and their adversaries -- are used as a foundation for the more ethereal, philosophical themes, such as the nature of humor, the nature of history, and the differences between the genders.Kundera's frequent personal anecdotes told in the midst of the novel can be quite disconcerting -- and there's a parody of this book floating around the web that makes light of Kundera's self-indulgent practice of using his books as personal therapy sessions. But the anecdotes are still interesting, and since Prague around 1970 is such a big part of Kundera's own mental and cultural ethos, well, why not?Anyone who is familiar with the dark, fatalistic jokes whispered in Communist Eastern Europe in the Olden Days will enjoy the steady stream of such humor in this novel. Kundera is a masterful joketeller. There is also a lot of bawdy sexual humor, fairly standard, but that is not nearly as interesting as the joke about the man vomiting in Prague's central square (I don't want to spoil the joke here, so you'll just have to read it in the book).Kundera's attitudes toward women are for the most part repugnant -- but that's Kundera for ya. The contemporary American reader will wince when Kundera describes the beauty of rape, etc. This is just fair warning that some of the attitudes in this book may make you angry, as they made me angry; but we can't change Kundera. At least, unlike the other Kundera I've read, this novel is only partly -- not entirely -- about sex and seduction.Overall, this is a combination of a brilliant reflection on history and philosophy, a warm-hearted story about dissidents in Prague, and some amusing autobiographical notes on Kundera. I found it more satisfying than Unbearable Lightness of Being, and can compare it (but only distantly) to the novels of Gunter Grass, which also discuss major political-historical events and the burden of a historical conscience, but focusing on the characters' personal lives, not hitting the reader over the head with grand historico-political lessons."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Kundera could not write Laughter and Forgetting without discussing, at some length, their opposites. This overall sad \\"novel\\" has elements that are unforgettable. The novel was set in the backdrop of Prague Spring in 1968, when disaffected teachers, writers, and historians, believing that freedom from communism's bone-crushing anti-intellectualism was within reach, were seduced into tipping their hands, only to be crushed by the Russian invasion that followed in August. Tens of thousands emigrated, while hundreds of thousands were banished from their positions of power and influence. Many went to jail.Similarities between Kundera's characters and my friends during the heady \\"flower power\\" days of the late 60's here in the USA made the novel ring sadly true and \\"universal\\" on a personal level. We were disaffected with the establishment, we felt empowered by our energy, ideals, and our sense of intellectual, political, and sexual freedom. But . . . things didn't turn out for us the way we had planned them. While the napalm was flowing in Vietnam, the tanks were rolling in Prague, and the National Guard was firing on the students at Kent state, the mistakes that affected us most severely were those that happened in our relationships with friends and lovers. It is quite true that the state will squash -\\"like a flea between its fingers\\"- the individual that steps out of its circle of preferred actors and thinkers. But it's not the state that we have to worry about. The bankruptcy in our lives is usually of our own making, a point which, despite it's railings against the establishment, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting eloquently makes.While Kundera repeats the sins of the state several times, even opening two chapters with identical accounts of a man erased by the state, his characters fumble with sins of their own. The men, compelled to act out sexual and ego games, lead hollow lives. Ultimately, they must deal with an overwhelming sense of their own failure. The women characters do not fare much better. They get the little joy in life available to them only by forgetting the men they love.Throughout the book, Kundera maintains that it is only by remembering that we can live and make progress. Kundera says we don't do this very well -- as nations or individuals. We try to re-write history - condemning ourselves to repetitive failure. Sound about right?The book is as disturbing as it is wise. Laughter and Forgetting is a good introduction to the rich and complex work of Milos Kundera."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"One of the things that is interesting about Kundera's works is how he often ties different stories and different narrators in together, and combines stories that flow in and out in different directions (like Unbearable Lightness, perhaps his most famous, which combines two couples). This book has many stories which flow together with varied narration, and in a few of them, the narrator rises out of the page to tell his own stories. Kundera is undoubtedly a post-modernist, but there is something fascinatingly easy to read about all of his stories. It's clear from reading this how he loves and obsesses about his characters. This book is a fantastic read that really makes you think a lot about the relations between men and women, and also about life in a (former) Soviet controlled country. I think in America we feel very removed from what went on in Eastern Europe, but much of Kundera's writing based on the horrors he experienced bring you in touch with that world."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book totally blew my mind when I first read it, maybe more than any other book since. Kundera has a way of looking at the world that is totally unique and pretty enlightening, and although I didn't understand everything he said at the time, I feel like his sharing that view with readers is an incredible gift. None of his other books grasp it quite as completely (although several other people I've talked to also say that the first one of his they read was the best, whatever it was). Read it, read it young, and let its ideas float around in your mind forever- you'll be a more complex thinker, I guarantee it. (I'm not sure how much my guarantee means to you, but it means a lot to me)"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I would quickly give this book five stars, but having read two other Kundera novels, this is my least favorite. It was intellectual, of course, but it wasn't as idea-oriented as the Unbearable Lightness of Being or Immortality. It had some great passages about laughter, communism, and music, but Kundera's generalizations and aphorisms weren't as convincing they are in his later works. Also, I wasn't moved by the ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Kundera's raw, honest, eclectic style and satiric humor captures life in its nudity. His writing is most complex at its simplest and tragic at its funniest. It mocks and embraces the angst ridden characters in their repudiation and profession of intellectualism as it exposes the similarity in seemingly contradictory things. The novel escapes all known formats to frolic with criticism, music, art, sex and politics, randomly throwing scraps of insights, memories and lies. He takes the gloom out of existentialism carrying Camus and Sartre to new heights. Refreshing and offensive! - V. Roy"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"In this somewhat somber farce of a novel, Kundera seems to capture the essence of the plight of modern life. In seven integrated parts, Kundera takes us through a whirlwind of emotions as the lives of the characters are often mirrored in some Kundera contorted fashion to one's own life. Kundera writes sometimes in a shocking and unabashfed way, which can make one gasp, shudder, and laugh all at the same time. And throughout the novel there is the recurring theme as to how does a person live today within complexities of relationships, careers, politics, ect., without being crushed by their weight or letting themselves be fluttered away into meaninglessnes. And although Kundera writes in an ambiguous way, he carries us to that borderline at which one can live within the extremes, and he carries one there on the coattails of not only laughter and forgetting but also at the same time with solemnity and remembering."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This work by Franco-Czech writer (not a combination one sees everyday) is best if read quickly before or after his other great work, The Unbearable Lightness of Being. All of Kundera's works take a post-modern approach to the novel's themes and style, liberally sprinkling philosophical and metaphysical questions throughout the text; this one is no exception. It's constant and enduring image is that of the Circle Dance, as shown on the cover, and its power to allow the human spirit to rise into the clouds. The classical opinion of what a novel should be must be abandoned, or at least silenced, in order to thoroughly enjoy this work, but it makes any trouble well worth it. HIghest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This is the best book I ever read. I first read it in 1986 and have re-read it six times since. Although the joy and wonder is not quite the same on successive reads, I have never puzzled why this book so enchanted me. As another reviewer wrote, the book simply changed my life. Never have I read a book which radiated such intellectual force. Kundera's technique of retelling the same story from different character's perspective is illuminating and enthralling (though it becomes a bit stale in some of his later works.) This marvelous book is not for everyone and serves as a Rohrshack test. After I first read it I immediately sent copies to my four best friends. Two wondered what exactly I saw in the book and the other two agreed it was the most brilliant work of fiction they had ever read. The book took on a life of its own. Twice I gave it to my then girlfriends. In both instances, the girlfriend never read the book but their mothers did! (hoping to gain some insight into the new boyfriend) Mother #1 concluded I was a cynical, morose pervert. Mother #2 loved the book and later became my mother in law. The only sad note is that Kundera never again achieved this level of brilliance, certainly not in the &quot;Unbearable Lightness of Being.&quot; My second favorite Kundera novel is &quot;Life is Elsewhere.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING is a sophisticated work of art. An amalgam of experimental fiction, straightforward storytelling, magical realism and metafiction, it successfully grapples with bigger than big themes, portraying the crucible that was Czechoslovakia after the Russian invasion in 1968 and before the dissolution of the Soviet empire. Kundera makes this tall order work in prose that rings sharp and clear. It is difficult to believe that this was not originally written in English, and the credit for the translation goes to Michael Henry Heim, at least for the used edition I purchased (part of Penguin's \\"Voices From the Other Europe\\" series edited by Philip Roth, circa 1980). The book was first published in Europe in the late 1970's.At one point in the novel, Kundera, a trained musician, describes why Beethoven was drawn to the variations form, in which an original 16-measure theme gradually changes in each variation. This is a key to how Kundera the writer has constructed this book in a series of stories to explicate the significance of memory in art and life, the devastation by the political and the metaphorical effects of laughter in its many forms. If this sounds like too much abstraction, please know that Kundera has created very real characters in visual language, and the action moves swiftly. He periodically deploys sexual scenes with late 20th century European sensibility that provides yet another lens on his central themes.After the 1968 invasion, Kundera lost his professorship at the Prague Institute and saw his books removed from public shelves. Eventually, he and his wife went into exile. When he published this book, his citizenship was revoked and it was banned in his native country. We know that things are different now, but this cry from the heart of political, artistic and personal oppression is a message that should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I normally have a very short attention span, especially when it comes to reading. But philosophy books are my forte, and this was undoubtedly the most enjoyable work I have ever read, inviting me to turn the page, and challenging my views, and changing my mind. The book is nothing short of brilliant, and is filled with luminous quotes on nearly every page. The images were fresh, vivacious, and enthralling, and the words were wonderfully placed."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I can't seem to keep this wonderful novel. I lend it it out- and it doesn't return. I have bought 6 copies so far. You can never read this piece too many times. With every reading, you can derive a different meaning. He is so subtle, sensual, compassiionate, and harsh. The only other author that I can think of that leaves his characters so naked is Dosteosky. Kundera, however, is far more compassionate about human nature. His revealing portrayals let us learn more about human sexuality and interaction. His humor is honest and without trappings. Some of his other work falls short of this. Life is Elsewhere is also quite good, but not as good as The Book of Laughter and Forgetting."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book is the first by Milan Kundera I have read. It was loaned to me by a friend after I expressed my interest in reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being, to which I was drawn simply by its title. She handed Laughter and Forgetting to me, saying off-handedly that it wasn't that great. Slightly disappointed, I kept it on a shelf. One morning, I woke up later than usual and as the sun shone through my window. It was one of those nothing-to-do sunny days, but too cold to leave home. I perused the titles on my shelves and because nothing else grabbed my attention, I opened Laughter and Forgetting and let my eyes half-wittingly latch onto the trails of words as Kundera unleashes his multi-faceted \\"novel\\". Admittedly, despite my resistance (because of the loaner's negative remark), I inhaled the first part. The feeling I acquired was one of enchantment, and marvel. My eyes wandered to the window, to where to late morning sun warmed the snowy landscape. I took a deep breath and returned to the book. By the end of the second part, I was not merely hopelessly hooked on the book, but as well, an ardent devotee of Kundera.The novel's artful and philosophical prose meanders through a flurry of 1970's contemporary ideas including democracy, fear, sexual roles, and are intertwined by Kundera's poetical portrayal of memory in the varying degrees of propoganda through personal interpretation of past experiences. Additionally, as the title suggests, laughter plays a part, suggested by the author first as the devilish opposition of order, and as the natural feminine influence.Kundera recognizes his themes contained in the vignettes that makeup the novel, and exploits them by assimilating them into a single body of work. I've heard some people say about the book that they felt they didn't pay close enough attention, and that they couldn't tightly tie the fragments of this novel, but I disagree. Yes, Kundera attempts to distort the linear art of prose into the multi-dimension of the mind. The novel sometimes creates a feeling of deja-vu, sometimes a more obvious trick than others. This is skill of Kundera's that he might have mastered in his later work, Immortality. But here it is experimental and ambitious, albeit a confident delivery... it's a pleasant and stimulating discourse. So my advice is, get this book and relax ...let this grand storyteller carry you."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"This book launched a re-awakening of my non-fiction laden mind.The Book of Laughter and Forgetting is the literary catalyst for an endless series of powerful intellectual and spiritual orgasms.Read it."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"I read this book in my required history course at college (Brandeis University). It was the only part of the course I liked. What a find. It's a rare circumstance that I enjoyed a required reading so much. Since then, I've read Kundera's other books, but this one is still my favorite. His explanations of little-explained emotions such as angst and kitsch were hysterical and insightful, not to mention weird and wacky.I'd describe this book as a sort of cross between Sartre and Stanislaw Lem, except much more grounded in reality than either."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"As with most others of Milan Kundera's books, while leafing through \\"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting\\" one is invariably nudged to reconsider the question - What is really a novel? Does it have to be one story? Or could it be a collection of loosely connected beads that somehow beautifully string together after all are read in a non-obvious way to make one point?Somewhere in the fifth (out of seven) chapter Kundera introduces a poet named Lermontov and makes the following observation: \\"... Lermontov once read Pascal's pens&eacute;e about subtle minds and geometric minds and ever since had divided the human race into two categories: Those who are subtle and all others\\". I can imagine that this book would be greater appreciated by the former in Pascal's classification.The book deals with a few recurring motifs: Oblivion and its associated torment, the idea of \\"litost\\", absurdity and meaning and the supposed \\"boundary\\" between them which when crossed converts one into another. Each theme is elaborated in a separate chapter. Each chapter in turn is subdivided into parts that are sometimes unrelated to each other but illuminate different sub-motifs of each motif and thus finer angles of the iridescent whole. It is thus a \\"book in variations\\". The \\"variations\\" are not just around the main theme but also in \\"scale\\" with delicious analogies to emphasize how the same idea applies not just to individuals but also to societies: For example the book starts with the story of the communist Klement Gottwald and a famous photo of his with Clementis during the Czech coup of 1948, who puts a hat on Gottwald to protect him from the cold. After Clementis falls out of favour with the government and is executed, he is removed from all official versions of the picture and all that remains of him in the photo is his hat on Gottwald - a reminder of what once was. This is an instance of forced social amnesia (another sub-motif in the book), which is distinct from \\"natural social amnesia\\" that that is induced by a barrage of historical events that force supposedly important events (at the time they happened) into oblivion from public memory. In a chapter \\"Lost Letters\\", the protagonist Mirek, aims to rewrite his past just like the communists did with the picture for hopes of a more peaceful future (but like the hat in the altered picture that serves as a constant reminder of what happened, he too keeps catching glimpses of his past because of random events). The amnesia induced by events that supersede each other is contrasted with the character of Tamina (which in many ways, as noted by Kundera, emobides both the story of and the audience for the book) who is numbed by the remorse associated with the memories of her husbands death. However, a chance encounter with a man smitten by her erases some of the memories she holds dearly to. This erasure induces the feeling of guilt that she could not no longer recollect how her dead husband looked like, which in turn also fades into oblivion by an encounter with a group of children; the mutability of memories. He also contrasts Tamina's lingering sadness that appears to have form but no content with the memory of his own father who while knowing everything could not communicate anything, having lost the ability to speak as he died - appearing to reduce everything to an bungled undifferentiated whole. Another major recurring motif is of meaning and the \\"border\\" that once crossed renders something that one could give their life for on a platter completely meaningless and absurd and factors that might cause \\"crossing\\" of the border.What runs through in common in each bead is Kundera's beautiful and easy writing style (he also has a habit of repeating sentences and sometimes complete paragraphs), his sharp sense of humour and eroticism running through his stories. I can understand that this might make some people uncomfortable with his writings. There were infact a few stories in the book that I found strange but I married them with the fact that Kundera wants to emphasize absurdity in those sections. He makes many observations related to these themes that most of us might have thought about at some point in time when we experienced some similar pain, but which are incredibly hard to communicate. Reading them made me think how similar all of us really are."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"Words flows with laughter that we should never forget in this book. History repeating itself, with humanity at its mercy with Kundera ageless prose, one cannot escape to think of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu with political upheavals and emerging nationalism across the globe..may be Milan will return to Prague one day!"},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"While most readers will know Kundera only through his made for the screen book, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, his other books are actually more accessible and wonderful reading, including The book of Laughter and Forgetting. Kundera calls this a novel in the form of variations, and its seven parts are divided among narratives of characters and political commentary as well as autobiographical comments from Kundera himself. This is not in any way a traditional novel either in its form or its plot (there really is no plot if by plot we mean something with a beginning, middle and end).But, Kundera manages to pull these pieces together masterfully creating a truly funny commentary about life and love and history and what it means to be human and navigate this crazy world. And, while the book was written over thirty years ago and specifically references the era of Czech turmoil in the 1970's, it is timeless in its themes of love, relationships, politics, sexuality, existentialism. What role does laughter play? Kundera says he could always tell a communist because of the style of their laughter and in this book he labels two types: the laughter of the devil who recognize the meaninglessness of life; and the laughter of angels celebrating the joy of life but also the belief in order. Both of these types of laughter are necessary and each is destructive if taken to extremes.His second major theme is forgetting. And, in the novel, forgetting fills two roles: there is the forced forgetting engaged in purposefully by the state to re-create history; and the inevitable forgetting by the individual of their past. Kundera suggests that the self is the sum of everything we remember, and in the book memory and its power is heavily emphasized (but again, too much memory is not good either). Sometimes, we do well to forget.One of the major themes that Kundera addresses is the problem of the middle ground and the problem of the extreme, neither is good. Staying to the middle ground leads to the demand for \\"equality\\" in all and ultimately to repression and destruction in an effort to maintain that ideal (which becomes the extreme). Kundera does not preach an alternative vision except for one where things aren't taken too seriously.The novel includes many sex scenes and/or scenes of nudity. These aren't in any way pornographic but rather are further commentary (often funny) but also serious about the role that sex, love, the erotic can and does play in life. For this novel, sex/love is central but it can also be controlling and boring and taken too seriously.The book often made me laugh out loud, and while some readers might be put off by the mixed format of the chapters, if the book is approached without expectations of a traditional novel, it is very enjoyable and thought provoking and beautiful. I often found myself pausing over something Kundera would say (the people who dance and become angels and float above the ground, for example) that was both beautiful and confusing. But, after some thought I could usually figure out how the image fit with the novel as a whole (and usually upon further reading the connections would become even more clear).I've read the novel now three times and have never failed to enjoy and savor it fully."},{"Title":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (King Penguin S.)","review":"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting = / +by Milan Kunderatranslated from french by Aaron AsherIf someone asked me what this book was about: I could not answer them. There were so many different characters, but the themes were the same. Stories about death and stories about forgetting (hence the title). The content was sex, and relationships. The character's offered their interpretations of something and after that the author would tell you his. This is only the second book that I have read by Milan Kundera (the other being The Unbearable Lightness of Being). Both books had short chapters ,a great deal of asides, and time taken to create moments. It was not enough for the author and for his audience to understand the action of the story. Kundera desires to make you understand what everybody was thinking when the important conflict took place.About a third of the way through the book the short chapters became tedious and it was a struggle to read the last sixty pages. Much like The Unbearable Lightness of Being. It's an interesting trick, because both books were easy to get into. I often feel that the first chapter of the book is so important to get to, when deciding if I will read it entirely or not. Milan's books have an advantage because of the shortness of the chapters."},{"Title":"Kierkegaard","review":"Okay, some things get lost in the translation to the Kindle. The full title of the book is: The Concluding Unscientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments. One of the reasons the book is so larded and repetitious is that Kierkegaard wrote it as a sight gag. The Philosophical FragmentsPhilosophical Fragments/Johannes Climacus : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 7is a tiny book (so small, in fact, that Princeton University Press spoils the joke by coupling it to another book in order to make a medium sized volume). The joke is supposed to be a 700 page postscript to a 100 page book. You lose that on the Kindle, but, as I just mentioned, Princeton messed up the joke in an actual book, and, with the Kindle, you also lose the thrill of lugging around a 700 page tome for however long it takes you to read it, so there's that. It is the measure of my devotion that I have successfully fought gravity several times (this is the third different translation I've read) without giving up and going back to Sickness Unto DeathThe Sickness Unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition For Upbuilding And Awakening (Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 19) (v. 19).In any case, the virtue of this translation is that I have always imagined the book as taking place at table, where, after dinner, a nineteenth century fop, between drags on his cigar and the occasional sip of cognac, tells me very efficiently, if somewhat tipsily, what's what. The translator, from what I have read, gets the character, Johannes Climacus (our first person narrator), spot on. I really get the feeling I am with the character and that is quite an accomplishment.I suspect that such verisimilitude is rare because most translators are academicians and Kierkegaard is an amateur, as interested in literary effect as in philosophical cogency. Scholars tend to forget that this is not a philosophical treatise, but a novel with a protagonist who delivers an ordered monologue about religion, history, theology and faith. Hannay seems very aware of this and of conveying the book's novelistic quality. Good for him."},{"Title":"Kierkegaard","review":"I have had the Hong translation (1992) for years but had difficulties reading it. Comparing it to an older translation in the selections included in Deconstruction In Context, I was glad that Hong used the idea of a spurious infinity. In mathematics, an idea which produces a march down the road to a spurious infinity is considered absurd and easily dismissed. The 2009 translation of Concluding Scientific Postscript by Alastair Hannay goes back to the idea of a bad infinity and explains it with a note on Hegel: In Hegel a bad infinity is one that cannot be accommodated to the dialectic of opposition in which oppositions are cancelled in the true infinity.The thinking in this book is like philosophers considering themselves more advanced than geometers because the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, which makes it impossible for geometry to consider a triangle with two right angles but the philosophers are setting up a dialectic in which two sides are infinitely long or the line between the two right angles is becoming infinitely small. The idea of a tangeant in calculus is the kind of pure idea that makes Kierkegaard choose Lessing as a thinker in the section on Possible and actual theses of Lessing, as opposed to: \\"Maybe this infinity of reflection is the bad infinity -- in that case we are soon finished, for the bad infinity is meant to be some despicable something or other that has to be given up the sooner the better.\\" (p. 95).Bubbles in economics work like a spurious infinity when everybody can see that nobody will be able to keep track of where to send the interest on all the borrowed money when the electricity goes out and the lights are shut off. Shooting for $14 trillion of money that has already been spent is a method that is not all that scrupulous about not understanding a joke."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"I found this book to be confusing and disorganized as a reference guide.

I like my technical books to be brief and to the point. I started reading the PL/SQL guide with a few simple questions: how can I write a stored procedure, what is a calling convention, where are they stored inside the DB. Skimming the book to find answers to these did not work, and the book was way too verbose (pages of common-sense stuff tangential to PL/SQL, such as &quot;you should write as little code as possible&quot;, &quot;Make comments easy to enter and maintain&quot;).If you are looking to get going quickly, Urman's book is much better."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"As a beginner to PLSQL, I have to read through a lot of material to find the things that I want to know. This book seems to be for intermediate programmers. But then it would be nice if some material could be dropped to get to the point. Too much time consumed reading unnecessary material."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"This book is so incredibly long and verbose that it is impossible to use to actually learn PL/SQL in a self-directed manner. Each of its numerous long chapters is so focused on a small, isolated sub-topic of PL/SQL that it spends over 500 pages just to cover the basics of PL/SQL. At that point, 500 pages into the book it says, \\"by now you have mastered the basics of PL/SQL\\" and begins a series of long chapters on small, isolated advanced sub-topics.Incredibly, the book does not cover or even mention the essential, crucially important \\"Windows Functions\\" added to the ISO SQL standard in 2003. A professional must, repeat must, know those \\"Windows Functions.\\"Computer science students who are reading this book under the auspices of a college professor will undoubtedly learn a great deal from this book during many, many hours of reading it in the context of a two semester course where their professor discusses with them the essential points. That however is little comfort to a working professional who needs to get answers to real world Oracle SQL problems in a hurry. For a working professional who needs to get real work done and does not have time to spend weeks reading, this book is practically useless."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"Steve has a deep understanding of the development process, and get into the minds of most programmers.

While this book is not adequate for those with no knowledge of relational database methodology of SQL experience, it is a great reference and tutorial for those who have prior knowledge of basic SQL. The book provides many examples of coding, along with guides illustrating debugging techniques. For those interested in SQL or an introduction into relational databases, I suggest both the Modern Database Management book (ISBN: 0-8053-6054-9) and the LAN Times Guide to SQL book (ISBN: 0-07-882026-X)."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"I didn't give this one 5 stars because of the author's repetitive pontification on matters of style, which is basically preaching to the choir, and was a waste of dead trees.

I use it heavily for reference now that I have learned enough PL/SQL to be really dangerous. The book is not quite as strong for that purpose, but it's better than the Oracle documentation on the subject."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"The book really deserves a 4 star for all the material it presents. I want to highlight my disappointment that a large part of it are just things in Oracle manuals, basics of structured methodology and a little bit of Object technology. I bought it because experienced PL/SQL developers rated it high and I expected it to be an advanced book. So I am suprised that the author assumes the readers are not familiar with these basics.

Mister Feuerstein is apparently not so sure about the meaning of a constant. The code examples can be confusing.

From a beginner's standpoint, the book is terrific. Assuming familiarity with programming logic, the book works very well in exposing the power and strengths of PL/SQL. The examples are clear and helpful, and the narrative is helpful in unraveling the complexities of PL/SQL programming constructs. I'm learning everything I need to do my job just by reading this book and applying it to my own programs. The only thing I'd like to see improved is better layout of the text on the pages, more graphics, and better quality paper.

Well, my rating above might be biased. I made a career change from physics to become a professional C/C++ programmer by reading K&amp;R's C Programming Language to begin with.

Not only do these books cover a huge amount of material, but any topic that is covered is covered in excruciating detail. It looks to me like the authors took great notes while they suffered through yet another partially implemented Oracle feature, and then turned these notes into books that make it possible for the rest of us to minimize the pain assocatiated with PL/SQL development. These books are written by developers for developers, so you'll see how to figure out why something that should work isn't working. I recommend all three books and I recommend the author's approach to programming. By the way, the indexes are better than most. This is a big help when you have a specific question. Finally, these books are appropriate for all PL/SQL programmers (new and experienced) because the books work well as both a tuturial and as a reference manual. In order to achieve both of these goals, there is a huge amount of material to wade through. But I know the answer is in there someplace, so the volume is worth it to me."},{"Title":"Oracle Pl/Sql Programming","review":"I recommend this book wholeheartedly for beginners as well as veterans of PL/SQL.

It also tells you where and when the differences arise between the various revisions and their numbers. A great benefit along with the book is a diskette with code and a few utilities. Most of the code is generic and can be simply cut and pasted into the application with little or not trouble.

Many computer books are written in such a dry, choppy style that this is impossible. This book is a pleasure. I enjoy the humor, the real-life anecdotes and, of course, there's lots of technical stuff. What I like most about the book are the coding standards and &quot;best practices&quot; that appear throughout the book (well, at least the first four chapters). Most of the technical content of this book is contained in the Oracle on-line books--but without this extra insight and commentary the technical details just don't mean much.

After reading this book half way, I definetly rate this book highly if I have experience in PL/SQL. This book would be a good one for beginners if the author rearranges the order to the chapters. Right from the start, the author uses function, package and procedure to illustrate some of his points. Unfortunately, he does not introduce these 3 topics until later in the book. Poor me!!

This is very untrue, and the thing to do is to be selective. These two pitfalls must be avoided if one really wants to enjoy the classic Hardy Boys at their best.I have researched and then read several installments in the venerable series which enjoy the highest reputations among true and informed HB aficionados. Next I applied my own personal evaluation to each book.O.K. then, and what of this installment -- The Shore Road Mystery?

Not among the best, in my opinion, but certainly not the worst; 3.5 stars. The books in this series are adventure romps. Not too serious, but a lot of fun. A good gateway series for young readers (and old nostalgia junkies).The Kindle Edition:This is my third Hardy Boys book on Kindle.The Kindle Edition gets my approval for including the line-drawings from the hardcovers. However, the cover illustration is not included. The 'cover' of the Kindle Edition is the title page of the hardcover. Perhaps the colors in the cover make it too difficult to render on Kindle.I give demerits for the number and type of typos in the books. This Kindle Edition, as well as \\"The Missing Chums\\", has far too many typos that were introduced during the conversion to electronic format. A common example is that the text \\"Joe!\\" from the hardcover is rendered as \\"Joel\\" in the Kindle. It seems obvious to me that the publisher ran the book through a scanner, did an Optical Character Recognition, then maybe some quick cleanup editing and called it 'good'. I estimate I saw 40 - 50 typos of this nature in the text.This Kindle Edition could have been 5-star if the publisher had included the cover illustration somehow, and if the proofreading had been done right. The publisher needs to invest more effort into the Kindle Edition if they insist on charging the same price as the hardcover."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"After I finished The Shore Road Mystery, I did'nt think it was actually that great, even after I spent about the whole year wishing so hard i would be able to read this book.

I figured that by the time I got this far into the series the characters would be dull, the plot line monotonous, and one book would read like the other. This is not the case! This was a fast-paced book, new characters interspersed with the usual cast; though only Frank, Joe, and Chet are the central characters in this tale.Cars are being stolen in Bayport and adjacent cities and the crooks use the Shore Road to make their getaway. The Hardy's friend Jack Dodd and his dad are framed for the robberies, and subsequently jump bail (or do they). With their dad, Fenton, away in New York the Hardy Boys work on the case themselves from the land, sea, and air.

Jack Dodd, a schoolmate of the Hardy's, asks Frank and Joe to solve a family mystery involving a treasure hidden during Pilgrim times. However, after Jack and his father are accused of stealing cars along the Shore Road, they disappear. Did the Dodds go onto hiding so that they could search for the treasure? Did they run away because they are guilty? Or were they kidnapped to make it look as if they ran away? Frank, Joe and Chet work to find the answer and solve the mysteries. This book was quite good; it has a realistic plot, plenty of action and was generally enjoyable. Nonetheless, I prefer the original edition to the revised. The original edition was better written as to the flow of the book and the language used. The Pilgrim mystery, which was not a part of the original, felt tacked on and was not woven into the story very well in my opinion. Both editions are worth reading and since they are only similar in their basic plot and only slightly similar in their endings, I think that most fans could read one and then not feel bored reading the second one later. However, if you're only going to read one, I'd say to go with the original."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"A string of car robberies have piqued the Hardy Boy's interest. It appears as though the car thieves regularly elude the police even when the police are hot on their trail. When the Hardy Boys put their minds to the mystery what they discover is that the car crooks are even cleverer than they could ever have suspected.We follow the Hardy Boys as they try to prove that the Dodds, who car thieves framed and then disappeared, had nothing to do with the thefts. Eventually the Hardy Boys discover that the car thieves have plans far more nefarious than simply stealing cars.While searching for the car thieves the boys also learn that there is a Dodd family mystery involving missing treasure. The boys also wonder what the mysterious spider-man has to do with the mystery. And why does a certain farmer always seem to be plowing his fields without lights in the middle of the night? As the story nears its conclusion the boys will use a car as a Trojan horse to attempt to trap the thieves. What will happen when the thieves discover the boys? There are many mysteries for the boys to solve. The boys learn that their father has an important mystery of his own, but in the end it turns out that their father's mystery and theirs may be related.This mystery is one of the most intriguing Hardy Boys mysteries. The author managed to change a simple car theft story into a puzzle for the Hardy Boys. The author also mixed in additional story elements to be sure that it would be relatively difficult for the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery.As a side note, this mystery has a cave as a key element. It appears that the author was in a cave mood, because caves appeared in each of the previous four stories, and continue to appear in the next stories. Just goes to show how versatile caves can be.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"The Shore Road Mystery re-write wasn't nearly as good as the original, wherein Frank and Joe bought a used fancy car, fixed it up, and hid in the trunk. Their Trojan Horse technique carried them right into the lair of the auto thieves; after numerous exciting brushes with danger, they were able to escape and bring back the police.The re-write wasn't nearly as tense. It's possible that was purposeful. At the end of the original, Fenton Hardy muted his pride for his sons' accomplishment with the admonition that their tactic had simply been too dangerous, and they could have been seriously injured or worse.But that's what made the book good. Kids enjoy stories of that nature because nothing like that ever happens to teens in real life. Really, how many teams of teen-brother detectives do you think are operating in the USA just now, solving crimes and mysteries every other week (while owning cars, motorcycles, ice boats, airplanes, you name it)?

Then the Dodds are accused of stealing the cars. They get out from bail. Then they disappear. The Hardy Boys suspect they've been kidnapped.

This book was substantially \\"updated\\" in 1964 from the depression-era original, and much is lost in in the process.In the original, a ring of car thieves is stealing cars (I guess they are pretty much doing what you'd expect a ring of car thieves to do, all right). They ply their illict trade along Shore Road which, in 1931, is a barely-improved, dark, lonely, winding cliff road rising and switchbacking above the crashing turbulence of Bayport Bay.Why anyone in their right mind would park there is anybody's guess.But, park there they do. So the boys devise an outstanding ruse (devising ruses is a great way to sharpen your pronunciation of s sounds, too). They by an old junk car which is very ornate but which has a really crummy engine. They then \\"pimp the ride\\" by hammering out dents, painting it, polishing it, and getting really spiffy spoked wheels and wide whitewall tires.Then they hide in the boot in the back, park it along Shore Road, and wait to get stolen. And they do.Well, that was in 1930. In 1964 they pick up a touch-tone phone, call the police and report a stolen '64 Ford Falcon.

Winston Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his historical writing, but it difficult to see any contemporary historian contending for such an honour. The historian's craft is so much seen now as a technical one, 'mastering the sources' is considered to be the summit of achievement in historical writing. Also, the historican has also to master some sociology, political science, and statistics, besides mere writing. Possibly, there is a lot of good in the modern attitude, but we have probably lost in many places, the art of good writing. Motley, like all his contemporaries except perhaps Parkman or Prescott, is not now considered a historian of the first rank. But, by God, the man could write! If you want the best modern account of the birth of the Netherlands as a modern nation state, read Geoffrey Parker's 'The Dutch Revolt'. However, if you enjoy a tale spun around a real-life hero, William the Silent, and how he led an embattled people to freedom, written in the finest prose, then this book is for you. Incidentally, some modern historians do still value the insights of their predecessors, like Macauley in Britain, but are probably their superior in research methodologies and interpretation. For me, in the art of writing, the likes of Motley, Prescott, Parkman, and Macauley are infinitely better!"},{"Title":"The rise of the Dutch republic: A history","review":"Although first written in 1856 the author applies a spell-binding style to tell the gruesome history of the birth of the Dutch nation from the unrelenting suppression of the religious and political aspirations of a sophisticated and rich people. In Volume I Motley covers the period from Emporer Charles V to the appointment of Count Alva as military overlord of the Netherlands. In Volume II he continues to describe in great detail the circumstances, personages, and intrigues that so painfully come together and nearly destroy the industrial and economic powerhouse in the low countries. He excellently explains the motives and actions of William of Orange, the follies of his noble friends and their destruction, the cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition, and, eventually, the rising of the people against the hated Alva and his mercenary murderers. It is the start of the 80 Year War of which this book covers the first seven bloody years.Since I found this series in my father's book case and started reading I have not been able to put it down. The series take the reader to live the period and understand the human drama and the hope and perseverance that lift a population to found the most powerful nation in the world."},{"Title":"The rise of the Dutch republic: A history","review":"John Lathrop Motley's history of the 40-year Dutch War of Independence (1568-1609)is a major work. The three-volume set called the &quot;Rise of the Dutch Republic&quot; is only part of the story, carrying the reader only up to the date of 1584 when the Constitution of the United Netherlands was implimented.Motley later in 1874 added another four-volume set called &quot;History of the United Netherlands&quot; which brings the reader up to the date of 1609 when most of the fighting in the Netherlands between Spain and the Protestant nobles of the Nehterlands ended. Needless to it is a major commitment for the reader to get the whole story that Motley wants to tell. Indeed Motley could have told more. The official recognition of Dutch Independence did not come until Spain signed the Peace of the Hague in 1648 at the conclusion of the Thirty Years War (1619-1648).Motley's outlook on the events covered in the seven volumes leaves no doubt that his sympathies lie with the Dutch. His bias is heavy handed and approaches propaganda. Still for the reader with the time and desire to learn about the history of the Dutch people the entire set is enlightening."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Professional Advanced Configuration and Implementation: A Comprehensive Guide to the New Mainstream Desktop Operating System for Professional Users","review":"I have been thinking all day about how I can adequately praise this book and still keep my review believable. The book is amazing... Well, the best way that I could put it is that I have spent hundreds of dollars on technical books in the last couple of years (about Win NT, TCP/IP, Cisco, etc.) and this book is easily in the top 5, maybe top 2.Okay, why is it so great? Most books about Windows NT and 2000 are aimed at the person who has never used the software before and spend 3/4 of the pages describing mundane things like how to add programs to the start menu, how to set up printers, etc. - the stuff you can easily figure out on your own. Then there are the high level books that talk about the strategy of setting up your multi-domain network or rolling out Active Directory across your global corporation. It is usually YEARS after a product ships before books come out that just deal with the nuts and bolts of the operating system for the IT Professional who already understands the GUI - how to REALLY troubleshoot problems, what warts there are in the OS, etc. It has only been during the past year that decent books have started coming out about Windows NT Server 4.This book has all of that info and more. For example: It has a list (in Chapter 27) of all of the common Blue Screen of Death error messages and likely sources of these problems. How cool is that? That section alone is worth the price of the book.If you are sick of books that you have skip the first 10 chapters or that don't really tell you how to actually configure things, get this book. Not coincidentally, you should also get this book if you are preparing for the MS Win 2K Pro test (070-210). You can skip the expensive (boring) training that you would pay hundreds of dollars for and just read the book.BTW I did pass the test (I got 840) and the only real studying I did was reading this book - although I have been using Win 2K Pro since it came out. That reminds me of something else: If you do buy the book, study chapters 23-25 about Automated Installation well. The test I took had almost 10 questions (out of 50) on this subject alone.Hope this helps..."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Professional Advanced Configuration and Implementation: A Comprehensive Guide to the New Mainstream Desktop Operating System for Professional Users","review":"Having read the authors other book on Windows 2000 Active Directory, I immediately bought this tome.

It was as if Valery Leith wrote down her first-draft, first-impressions of the plot and didn't think it over. It's like her muse, pure creativity with no order, took over and left her without any control over what happened.Now, the first two books got some negative reviews, I assume from readers looking for mindless sword-and-sorcery. Her books are mature and poetic, and sometimes too wordy, sometimes slow-moving, but she writes so beautifully with such distinctive imagery, it's worth it.OK. &quot;The Way of the Rose&quot; made such little sense that I can no longer recommend the series to friends without beign embarassed.The only reason I give this book 3 stars, instead of 1, is because there is no other fantasy world like this one, and Leith's writing and command of language is moving and beautiful.Command of plot, she has not. What happened to the story that so captivated me in the first book? The backstory of Queen Ysse's quest for magic artifacts, and Quintar's company. . .where did it go? What about Istar, the warrior woman feeling lonely and confused? Now she's in love with a. . .I don't know, a bird man/monster. . .and it's the plot that's confused.A character I liked, Xiriel the scholar, disappeared completely.And my favorite character, Tarquin, formerly Quintar the Queen's champion, now a warrior in self-imposed exile, tormented by his past failures. . .what happens to him? Well, a horse eats him...You see, my review is as incoherent as this book. Sadly, Leith had such a good thing going with the previous two volumes. I think it was the &quot;time-serpent&quot; that undid it.I do recommend this book to anyone who wants to write fantasy or study every aspect of the fantasy genre. Don't write a plot like this! But do think of things as interesting as these, and write with such poetic beauty. Just keep control over your muse."},{"Title":"The Way of the Rose (Everien, Book 3)","review":"I very like Valery Leith writing style. I coudn't find book one, so i started with book two then three which was a different experience for me. It was a wonder journey anyway."},{"Title":"The Way of the Rose (Everien, Book 3)","review":"i rarely ever buy books - i like to buy them after i read them, only if i deem them good enough. i have purchased all 3 of the Everien series. As the other reviewees have noted, Leith has created this amazingly complex, intricate world that is confusing at times. But her language and imagery is so vivid and her phrases beautiful that it's worth the read. i have not come across any thing like this trilogy where the plot and the fantasy world is this complex. i found it very enjoyable and i hope you do too!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Rose (Everien, Book 3)","review":"Having read all 3 books I can safely say Valery Leith has created a very complex web of events and characters. This is a trilogy to be read slowly and savour, because it does not fall prey to all the simplistic cliches that most fantasy books do -X falls in love with Y, this person becomes braver and more noble due to this, someone overcomes childhood fears, all the characters split up to do different tasks, meet up in the end and have the usual 'aftermath orgy of explanations', etc. Thank goodness. Each character is a whole world unto themselves and does not necessarily come to understand all that has happened, but each has a role that, as time goes on, becomes complex, sad, bitter, sometimes funny and important in ways that cannot be foreseen. The evolving revelations about the Timeserpent, Everians, Ice, Jaya's role and the fate of the clans is not wrapped up in one perspective or one grain of truth.Don't worry -this doesn't mean you'll need a dictionary, or will fall asleep due to lack of action, suspense or surprises. Enjoy the fresh narrative, the chapter endings that leave you hanging, and root for your favourite character, good or not-so-good."},{"Title":"The Way of the Rose (Everien, Book 3)","review":"This is the conclusion of Valery Leith's Everien series, and is one of the most imaginative books I've ever read (this includes the Dune series(Frank Herbert), Lord Of The Rings(J.R.R. Tolkien), and The Gunslinger(Stephen King). Her mastery of language and description is downright poetic at times, and her characters are as good as any in the books I mentioned above.That said, this isn't a very easy read. It does have a plot, but the plot is extreemly complex, and some of the places the book takes place in are even more so. They are very good, but I found myself having to read a few chapters twice to understand what was happening. It is still so good, though, that I had to give it five stars (althogh it probably deserves 4.5).The bottom line: this is an amazing book, but only if you can handle it. If you aren't a strong reader, you will probably get extreemly confused and not be able to enjoy it as much."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Just when I was beginning to think that there was nothing new and fresh on the bookshelf, I ran across this splendid novel. It's hard to explain what's so different about it, but it's like nothing I've ever read before. I was shocked to actually be able to pick up a book that's labeled as romance and had Black characters without reading explicit sexual or vulgar language. It's a Christian novel, but it's not too churchy (is that a word?) nor is it overbearingly religious. This is romance in its purest and truest form yet you never lose sight of the fact that these love birds have God in their lives. The characters are believable and unbelievable all at the same time. The romantic nature of the leading man is what every woman wants, but few are blessed to experience. Although the characters and locations in this novel are fictitious, the descriptions given are so vivid, that you can imagine what each person and place looks like. It's like a movie in book form. It covered comedy, romance, drama and even a little suspense. Talk about an escape from the real world into a wonderful world of fantasy! I was so refreshed and when I was finished I wanted more. This is truly the best book I've read all year--and I read a lot of books. I hope to see more work very soon from this new talented author."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"A girlfriend of mine bought this book recently and told me how much she enjoyed it. She passed it along to me and I agree with her wholeheartedly. This is one of those novels that you curl up in bed and read and when you wake up in the morning it's either underneath your pillow or on the floor by your bed because you couldn't put it down and you fell asleep still trying to read it. I know this because that's what happened to me two nights in a row. I read it in the morning before work, during my lunch break, and before going to bed. It demands that kind of attention. It's not just a story of true love, but also a story of true friendship that survives a huge problem that creeps between two men who are as close as brothers. I love Grace and Greg, the leading love birds in this novel, but my favorite characters are actually Lena and Mattie, the mothers of the leading characters who have a love/hate relationship that keeps you in stitches. This is a great read from beginning to end. There is even a brief surprise guest appearance by some prominent celebrities that blend in so well with the story-line that their appearances are highly believable. This book would make a great stage play or a made-for-TV movie. A+ for this one."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Dr. Gregory Dixon not only stole Grace's heart in For Love & Grace, but he stole my heart and the hearts of every woman in my book club.

Until then, I'd never even heard of Kendra Norman Bellamy. I picked up a copy of For Love And Grace while I was there and on the ride back to D.C., I couldn't put it down! This book surrounding the lives of Gregory (Greg) Dixon, Jessica (Grace) Charles, Derrick (Rick/Ricky) Madison and Sherry Madison was so good that my boyfriend got angry with me for not listening to him talk during the drive back home. I was so absorbed! It had me laughing (you have to read about the parents in this book to see what I mean), crying (the love story part) and angry(with Derrick, mostly). And the ending was stellar. This is one of the best books I've read all year and by the time the sun went down, I was finished. Wednesday morning, I went to a store that was closer to my home and asked if they had any other titles by this author and they pulled one called A Love So Strong.

Doctor Gregory Dixon and his best friend Derrick Madison found out the hard way when Derrick's mother gets killed in a horrible car crash. Although the families are rooted and grounded in the word of God, Derrick cannot seem to shake his hatred of the one person who was responsible for his mother's death.Gregory has never found love - at least, a love he could cherish for the rest of his life. His latest patient, who is in a coma, seems to be the one thing he has been waiting for. His problem: she is the other driver. Faced with the issue of sacrificing his life-long friendship for the woman of his dreams, Gregory turns to the one true source of guidance and comfort: the Lord.This story was warm, heart-felt, biblically-based and spiritually grounded, appealing to all types of readers. Kendra Norman-Bellamy shows the literary world that faith, values and trust in God's word will always prevail. It starts a little slow, but eventually gathers speed, ending as a quick read. Although the ending was very unrealistic, FOR LOVE AND GRACE is guaranteed to uplift your spirits, giving you hope that some love stories do come true. (RAWSISTAZ Rating: 3.5)Reviewed by T.

That is the first thought that enters my mind whenever I think about the inspirational works scripted by Kendra Norman Bellamy in For Love and Grace.This story touches on the everyday struggle of good versus evil. The good are the works of Dr. regory Dixon in saving the life of an accident victim who steals his heart in the end. Gregory is identified from the very beginning of the story as an excellent physician and as a man of strong faith whose calling has him doing the work of his savior. A true subscriber to \\"let His will be done\\".Romans 12:19 \\"Vengeance is mine\\"; I will repay, saith the Lord.Attorney Derrick Madison, is a man grieving the loss of his mother, who cultivates evil as he strives to have the person that he holds responsible punished for his mothers death. Derrick is so obsessed with vengeance that he blocks out all the people that care about him, including his wife Sherry, their infant child, and his best friend Gregory. Derrick is determined to make sure that the person he holds responsible for his mother's death is penalized to the fullest for her heinous crime.Grace is the unfortunate young woman who was involved in the accident that took the life of Derrick's mother and Gregory's god mother. This becomes a situation, as Gregory is put in the position of being both her treating physician and only chance for survival. Meanwhile, Derrick is unaware that the patient that Gregory is trying so hard to save is the one that he considers the murderer of his mother.While reading this book, I felt a deep sense of reflection. I wondered how many times I have been set on doing what I thought was right or taking vengeance when I believed that I have been wronged. How many of us today can say that if we lost someone that we truly loved, that we would not pursue their killer with a vengeance? In a sense this novel, has made me as the reviewer step back and take a good look at the path that I follow. Some may wonder if that is a good thing. I say yes because as an author, the goal is to provide a good read, and as a Christian, the goal is to minister to the masses. This novel by Ms. Norman-Bellamy has more than lived up to both purposes. Let the readers say AMEN.Reviewed By: Eleanor S.

There were so many genre's touched in this book that to call it romance is really cheating it out of something more. I never like to give details of books away, but the men in this book were so powerful. I think the cover designer should have put Dr. Gregory Dixon on the front cover instead of putting Grace there. At least he should have been on there with her because this book would not have been what it was without Dr. Dixon's presence.

Dr. Gregory Dixon, one of the brightest stars in brain medicine, finds his professional duties at odds with his best friend, Derrick Madison, esquire, when the patient Gregory has committed to save kills Derrick's mother. To make matters worse, Gregory falls for his patient, Grace, despite Derrick's quest to make her pay for his mother's death. How can you fall in love with your best friend's enemy? How can you save a friendship severed by hate? Bellamy believes that love will make a way.If you are a hopeless romantic, this book is for you. If you want to read a book about black men who aren't keeping secrets and having baby Mama Drama, then this book is for you. If you are a Christian woman and you want to find a good read that nurtures your soul, this book is for you.So why did I give it a four rating? Although the story is sweet and the characters well thought out, there are some pacing problems in the book that slows the reader down. Bellamy has some basic style challenges: point of view shifts, time change, character generalizations and plot points that the normal reader wouldn't see. But would feel when he/she says, \\"let me read that again\\" or \\"Did I read that right?\\" More than likely these minor glitches would be cleared by the time the book is re-released through BET Books this summer.Nonetheless, Bellamy is an author to watch in the future with two more books following this one, and she promises to keep the good men coming.Dee Y.

Kendra, the author, captivates you from page one to the very end! I couldn't put it down. When I HAD to work I was day dreaming about Grace and Greg and even crazy Derrick wondering what was going to happen next. My favorite part was when Greg took Grace to church and she gave her testimony! My eyes were filled with tears and the hairs on my arms were raised! It spoke volumes to me about how God is still a miracle worker today! So awesome Kendra! May God bless you in all your new endeavors!

Now, I know we should never judge a book by its cover, but I needed some new reads for my library and this cover is actually what caught my eye. Then I read the back and thought to myself that it sounded like a interesting story. As usual, my money was funny and my change was strange, but the store was having a special where you could buy two books and get a third at 50% off, so that sealed my decision to buy it. The other two books I got were by my favorite authors, Bernice McFadden and Donna Hill. I figured I'd just browse through a little of FOR LOVE AND GRACE and then put it down and start on Donna's. Wrong!! When I cracked open the pages of FOR LOVE AND GRACE and started reading, I couldn't even put it down! My, my my! It was so good! I loved this writer's style. It drew me into the book and seemed to almost make these people my neighbors, friends and coworkers. I don't know where this author has been, but I will definitely be buying more of her work. Simply put, FOR LOVE AND GRACE is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It easily makes my top ten list. Thank God for the 50% off sale, because I might have never read it otherwise."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Kendra Norman-Bellamy created a touching tale about love, trust and devotions to family and friends in her debut novel For Love and Grace. Dr. Gregory Dixon and Derrick Madison were more then friends they consider each other brothers. Through good times and bad they've been there for each other. However, when a tragic car accident kills Derrick's mother, there bond is tested beyond endurance. Derrick pins the blame on the other victim, Grace, who suffers life treating injuries from the accident. When Derrick finds out that Gregory is Grace's doctor, he abruptly ends there lifelong friendship. Meanwhile Gregory is rapidly falling in love with his patient Grace while carrying the knowledge that his love for her could ruin any chances he may have with his former friend back. For Love and Grace is an romantic novel about four Christians whose love for each other get tested through maybe the roughest time in their lives. This novel was very inspirational. The characters were very well developed and and I truly enjoyed the plot."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Not since Jacquelin Thomas hit the scene have I read a Christian fiction as good as this one. I won this book at a fund raiser a few months ago and put it away and kind of forgot about it. Last week, I had to have surgery and was placed in the hospital. I asked my daughter to bring me a book when she came for her next visit and FOR LOVE AND GRACE is one of three that she brought. Once I cracked open the front cover, I couldn't put it down. The first night, I fell asleep with it in the bed with me and the next morning, my nurse said, &quot;That sure must be a good one that you're reading.&quot; She doesn't know the half of it. I was captured from beginning to end and I think the story really hit home with me because I was in the hospital just like Grace was during much of the story. I was looking to see if I could find and nab doctor like Greg, but I failed (DARN IT!). My attending physician was wonderful, but he was no Dr. Gregory Dixon! I had never heard of this wonderful author before, but I see on Amazon that she has something else coming out soon. I will definitely be purchasing it. FOR LOVE AND GRACE makes my highly recommended list."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"For Love and Grace captivated me as a charming romance novel. Reading this novel brought back a personal nostalgia for the ideals of love. The characters were realistically created and I could relate to the real life situations. For Love and Grace has it all. If you're looking for comic relief with a strong moral backbone, then look to Mattie and Lena. If you're looking for a special, personal intimate relationship, look to Greg and Grace. If you can relate to the pain of loosing a parent and coping with grief look at Derrick. If you want to be a strong supportive wife, mother and friend then concentrate on Sherry. Friendships are tested, look to Greg and Derrick to see how they went through a storm and emerged on the other side. Most of all look toward self for there are some good practices to be gained by reading this novel.A car crash ended the life of attorney Derrick Madison's mother. The same car crash placed Grace Charles in the hospital barely clinging to life with severe head trauma. She is transferred for more specialized care and surgery to the hospital where Dr. Gregory Dixon works. He becomes her primary physician. It is not every day that a patient is blessed with a Christian physician who prays for Gods strength and direction. Derrick is bitter with the driver of the car that caused his mother to wreck. He calls the driver a murderer and is determined to make the driver face justice. He is incensed when he finds out that Grace is the other driver and that his best friend from the cradle, has saved her life. Sherry- Derricks wife, the pastor of their church, and Greg's mother Mattie seek to comfort Derrick, but because of his guilt, he is clearly not thinking rationally about the charge that Greg has as a doctor. Enraged with his wife, his best friend, and his mother's best friend because they don't feel the same way he does, he becomes a maverick and stops going to church, being friends with Greg and estranges himself from his wife.Meanwhile, Greg has fallen in love for the first time. If ever there was love at first sight, seeing Grace for the first time in her battered and bruised state, Greg knew she was the one. Her mother Lena and Mattie become friends during Grace's surgery and recovery period and Sherry becomes a close confidante. Grief continues to consume Derrick and Grace gets better. Love blossoms, as friendship fades. But God is not through with this situation yet. Watching the power of God move through all of these characters is truly a testament to His greatness.A Christian fiction novel, For Love and Grace keeps it real without being preachy. The operative word is Fiction in the description of the novel. I think the events can be real and open the possibility of actual occurrence. God exercises the power to heal the sick, the broken hearted and disenchanted. The possibility of falling in love with the spirit of a person just from coming into contact with them one time is real but admittedly rare. A true love story without benefit of formula, Kendra Norman-Bellamy has a hit on her hands and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

I read a review that said that this book was &quot;too ficticious for black folks&quot; as if black men or black women can't have the personalities of these people who just happen to be educated and honorable. We're so used to reading about trifling black folks who are tangled up in a bunch of stupid drama that we can't appreciate it when a writer chooses to write about the positive side of our people.

Through \\"For Love and Grace\\" she has shown us how God can, just as He says in Romans 8:28, \\"work all things out for good.\\"Derrick Madison lost his mother, Ms. Julia, in a terrible car accident, which because of his pain, anger, and bitterness caused him to alienate those closest to him, his wife, child, godmother, and best friend. Through prayer and faith in God, Dr. Gregory Dixon, Derrick's best friend, was able to perform the brain surgery that saved the life of the driver, thought by Derrick to have caused the accident that killed his mother, who was also Dr. Dixon's Godmother.During the time of treating his patient and her recovery, Dr. Dixon fell in love with Jessica Grace Charles and knew that he had found his soul mate in her. The power of God working in this situation allowed Ms. Lena, Dr. Dixon's mother, who was also the best friend of Ms. Julia to find a new best friend, Ms. Mattie, Grace's mother. Sherry, Derrick's wife, was also able to find a best friend in Grace. Greg and Grace were able to find each other, and the once in a lifetime love that we all dream of experiencing someday.With the prayers of many and counseling of his Pastor, Derrick was finally able to find peace about the accident and ask forgiveness from those he'd hurt and alienated, resulting in the relationship of his family, friends, and new family to be restored to one of extreme love and closeness.\\"For Love and Grace\\" is an excellent example of how God works in ways that we sometimes don't understand, but find out in the end were working \\"for good\\". The power of faith and forgiveness are also exemplified through the lives of these characters.Kendra Norman-Bellamy is a very talented writer who has now become one of my \\"favorite\\" Authors.

Everything was fresh and surprising. When the truth came out about the accident and the real reasons behind Derrick's anger - I was floored. It was so unexpected. The star appearances near the end of the novel were even more of a pleasant surprise. This was a wonderfully written novel and I would recommend it to any one who loves fiction.

The strain in their relationship is compounded when Greg falls in love with the suspect, a beautiful, young coed by the name of Jessica Grace.This is the center of Kendra Norman-Bellamy's debut novel, \\"For Love and Grace,\\" a book that is solidly written and full of interesting characters who look to God to help them through the troubling times that lie ahead.\\"For Love and Grace\\" was a quick read for me. I read it in a few hours. I was really drawn into the story from the first page and Norman-Bellamy draws her characters very distinctly, giving them each something unique to draw upon.Despite my enjoyment of the novel, there were a few things that hindered me from giving this novel a five. We know that Greg is a catch, but I began to gloss over sections where women were fawning all over Greg. A few select moments would have gone a long way. Some of the medical jargon or scenes felt as if I had seen them before in movies or read them in books, and I wanted something a bit fresher and authentic to the profession and this particular story. Grace's and Greg's mothers--Miss Lena and Miss Mattie--did a lot of comical bantering in the story and at times, it seemed to detract from the story instead of add to it.Aside from these things, my overall read of this novel was great and fast, and I would recommend this novel to all that wish to read a heartfelt novel about love, death, forgiveness, and placing total trust in Christ.Shon Bacon"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Kendra Norman-Bellamy offers Christian readers a good Christian fiction story to avid Christian readers.

It has been several years since I've picked up a romance novel and this was well worth it."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"If ever a book can grab you in the first few chapters and hold your attention long enough to know that it's character-driven and not a generic read, then you know that you have a good book. I read For Love And Grace and came away convinced that this author is destined for a graceful future. Kendra Norman-Bellamy has penned a love story extolling virtues of likable men seldom seen in lieu of the penchant to show them in sordid situations. Seldom too, will you find novels written where romance is not based on sex, sex, and more sex! Real life situations work best when storylines are woven to give poignancy to the process of eliciting genuine page turners.When Derrick Madison lost his mother in a tragic car accident he immediately looks for reasons to justify angst gone awry by blaming others, and not allowing the better part of valor be instrumental in the healing process. The gist of this story involves Grace a college student who was involved in the aforementioned mishap. Enter Dr. Gregory Dixon, Derrick's best friend who falls in love with Grace and opens a can or worms that prove to be troublesome and somehow manages to bring to the fore the real meaning of friendship. I was able to read into the author's reason for writing such a book that would raise the sensibilities of strong male charisma amid the need to make viable decisions. Moreover, I saw how one can really bring back together friendship gone bad, how to deal with misguided guilt, learning how to let remorse guide forgiveness, and most importantly, in allowing a higher spiritual awareness define the real reason to fall in love. All of this is inherent in this book!This is billed as Christian Romance, but the author articulates with clarity and the aplomb of a seasoned writer. It manages to render a heartfelt storyline allowing the characters to define substance, thus taking it way beyond the usual confines of a stereotypical debut novel. Kudos to you Kendra, we welcome this and look forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"As a black man, I love books that glorify black men.

I asked for good fiction where men weren't made to look like snakes and her first words were \\"Have you read anything by Kendra Norman-Bellamy.\\" With the option to bring the books back for a refund if I didn't like them, I walked out of the store with every one of her titles. That was Saturday. Today is Wednesday. I read all four of her books in five days and I loved every one of them. I can't say that I've experienced love like the folks in A Love So Strong, For Love & Grace, and Because of Grace, but it was kwel to read about black love and survival despite the odds and the forces that fight against them. I'm more of a Jhordan kind of guy in Crossing Jhordan's River. I got issues, but I'll bust a ni**** in the mouth if he messes with my family. All of these books were great and it was good to read about brothers who fought for their women and the survival of their marriage. I think I'm a fan."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"This is the first time I've read a romance book where all the lead characters were professional and progressive black people and that in itself was a wonderful relief! Usually somebody in the leading role is a brother with a rap sheet so long that it reaches from one county to the other or a sister who has served more men than McDonalds.For Love And Grace is a wonderfully written novel that just left me feeling warm and satisfied. I generally don't read a lot of Christian based novels because they lack the ability to capture my attention and hold it until the end. This one did that and did it very well. The author didn't spend her time trying to convert or save the reader's soul, but instead gave us a great story about Christian folks who had to survive an everyday situation that threatened their faith and friendship. The relationship that flourished in the middle of all of this between the doctor and the college student was beautiful.My favorite character was Sherry who in my opinion did a heck of a job balancing her friendship with Greg and her love for Derrick. I could also relate to her because I too, am a school teacher who grew up with my best friend being a male classmate.This book is definitely worth the read. I was disappointed to read one reviewer's comment that said she didn't want to see a sequel to this one. Everyone has their own opinion, but I, like the other reviewers, couldn't disagree more.

When I met her, I thought she was barely more than a teenager, but in the biographical information printed, I see where she is married with children. So many of our children are suffering for the lack of proper parenting and constructive surroundings. I hope her children know how fortunate they are to have a mother who is creating positive stories about a community that is in tremendous need of this type reflection.

Why can't our black men be portrayed as loving men who worship the ground we walk on? I LOVED this character. He was my absolute favorite.Two - Grace Charles: An example for all women! Wholesome, Soft-Spoken, Professional, Talented, Determined. She was a gentle woman, but not a \\"yes man\\" type woman. She allowed the relationship that sparked between she and Greg to evolve naturally and when he let her know that he was interested, she opened up. No need to play hard to get when you know it's rightThree - Sherry Madison: The epitome of a friend! Loyal, Dependable, Selfless, Strong. Sherry was able to balance friendship and love without being disloyal or having to choose sides. She stood for right, but stood by her man at the same time even when she didn't agree with him. I think she was really the glue that held everyone together.Four - Derrick Madison: Stubborn, Imperfect, Real, Sentimental. Even with the hard shell that he displayed on the outside, he was actually a fragile and bruised man. His emotions were real and as a reader I could feel them. Guilt will do some crazy things to the mental state of a man.Five & Six - Lena and Mattie: Protective, Nurturing, Funny, Funny, FUNNY! These women were irritating at times, but they were hilarious and definitely characters that most people can relate to on some level!From beginning to end, this was a really good read. My only complaint is that although the cover is nice, I couldn't see the character's faces on the faces of the cover models. I think the author should have chosen a different cover design. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say. I fell in love with these characters and would like to read more about them (in a book with a different cover). Personally, I'm not a big Christian book reader, but I must admit that I have gotten tired of the same old stuff....sex....profanity....criminal activity.....more sex. It was nice to read something different and I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I think this is one of the best Christian based novels that I've ever read. Christian fiction is my favorite to read because I know that I'll be reading something that's not filled with profane words or graphic details about bedroom scenes, but I admit that a lot of times Christian books aren't as interesting as some of the books with all the messy stuff in them. For Love And Grace was really good though. I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars just because certain things about Lena and Mattie reminded me of my meddlesome ex-mother-in-law who I could not stand and I still blame for the break up of my marriage. But since 4 1/2 wasn't a choice, I gave it five stars which it probably deserves anyway. Nosey, babbling old women just get on my nerves, but I'm a witness that they sure do exist so I couldnt' hold it against the story. I think the story was well written and gave brownie points to the Christian fiction industry. If God could read this book, I think he would be proud."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Beautiful Book, I just loved it and will continue to buy books under author Kendra Norman-Bellamy. Such an inspiring story."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"For Love and Grace is a great start to a wonderful love story! I could not have imagined a more precious and beautiful relationship. The main character, Greg gives new definition to love at first sight. Once he sets eyes on Grace he never dreamed of someone so magnificent. Although Grace is unable to return the feeling, Greg's love for her continues to grow.Their love affair is introduced under stressful and trying times for everyone involved. Grace was in a horrible car accident which took the life of Greg's best friend mother. As you can imagine Grace is not very popular amongst Greg's friend Derrick. Greg is placed in a most difficult situation of having to save the life of the woman who was part of an accident that killed a dear friend of his and whom he is falling madly in love with. He must make a decision that may ruin his closest relationship.The development of their love is magical. Greg's love for Grace is strong even before they officially meet. Her class, elogance, and self driven desire to live evokes a love in him so powerful. Every woman dreams of having a man who loves them as much as Greg loves his Grace."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I have read several of Kendra Norman Bellamy's books and I could tell this was an early work. While the story line was cute the character were sometime a little boring and predictable but putting that aside it was refreshing and light. There should have been more research done as the limitation of a medical resident. There is no hospital in American who employs a physician to do brain surgery, diagnosis and treat abdominal illness in the ER and cast broken bones. Medicine is much to specialized. If I have read this book first I may have liked it more but after reading 3:57 A.M, The Morning After and Fifteen Years I do she has developed and matured as a writer and this was her starting point."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"For some reason, I found the whole notion of him falling in love with her so fast to be unbelievably unrealistic.

I ended up skimming them on the train. Not terrible books, but definitely not repeats like her others for me."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I loved this book it had elements of drama, humour (the two mothers were funny but I felt there as a bit of overkill with those two it started to get annoying to read) and romance. Yes there is a fairy tale aspect to the story - the hero and heroine seem too perfect to be true- they have the perfect courtship with no drama whatsoever maybe cos Grace spent most of the time in a coma- lol. Anyway this is a good start to a lovely series. However an element of realism is there in regards to Derrick's response to his mother's death. It does makee one think this is where one's faith really is tested and how most of us probably would truly behave if we were in his shoes."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel by Kendra Norman-Bellamy.

Greg was definitely a man of God. He handled the situation with Derrick well. Even in the mist of all his trials and tribulation he still believed God. Mattie and Lena tripped me out. They were so funny. That's what a real friendship is all about. This book can definitely teach we as Christians a lesson. Kendra keep doing what you are doing. This was my first book that I had read that was wrote by Kendra Norman-Bellamy, but let me tell you this won't be my last."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Simply put, I loved this book. While Dr. Gregory Dixon was falling in love with Grace, I was falling in love with HIM!

Great read!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I guess I never really knew what Christian romance was. I always saw it as a \\"Little House On The Prairie\\" kind of thing that wouldn't hold my attention. This book opened my eyes! The characters were real and the story was excellent. It wasn't boring like the romances that your mama used to read, but it wasn't tacky like the stuff your teenaged daughter might be interested in reading. I loved the fact that it wasn't about sex...but about genuine love and friendship which is something that a lot of relationship books don't have. I won't give away any of the story, but it was just a wonderful novel that I loved from start to finish. Hope to see a sequel!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"This wonderful story about broken and mended friendships and newfound love was one that I could not put down and I mean that literally. I started reading this book when I sat at the table to enjoy lunch and I put it down when I finished it three hours later. There were a couple of moments when one of the characters seemed too good to be true, but because I've known people like that, it was still very realistic to me.I immediately fell in love with Lena and Mattie (the feuding mothers) and I would move ten zip codes to find a man like Greg. My favorite character was Derrick because he took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that had me on the brink of killing him at times. I hated him and loved him all at the same time.All in all, this was one of the best books I've read this year and it's definitely worth picking up. Upon visiting the author's website, I've already marked my calendar for July when her next book will become available.Thank you Kendra Norman-Bellamy for a totally satisfactory read that not only massaged my imagination, but blessed my heart all at the same time. I encourage you to Write On!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I thought that this book was great from start to finish. As a first novel I think this book was written professionally. The storyline was wonderful and I couldn't stop laughing at the constantly bickering friends, Ms Lena, and Ms. Mattie.

I can't wait to find out what'll happen next."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Using her written words, Kendra Norman-Bellamy has proven that no matter how strong we stand in our faith, certain trials and tribulations will occur that will test our faith and rock our belief that we have confessed to the Lord. Using God's written words, in the way that he intended for them to be used to overcome those trial and tribulations, is what results in a testimony, which is exactly what I consider this novel to be. For Love and Grace is a testimony of these friends' steadfast faith and loyalty, which guided them through the most trying and difficult time their friendship has ever endured.Dr. Gregory Dixon and Attorney Derrick Madison share a God-fearing and brotherly friendship. One day, however, their loyal friendship and steadfast faith is put to the test when Dr. Gregory Dixon is called upon to perform a lifesaving surgery on an accident victim-the same victim who was driving the other vehicle that claimed the life of Julia Madison, Derrick's mother. While Derrick looks at Greg's decision to perform the operation as a slap in the face, Greg looks at it as an act of fulfilling his duty and obligations as a doctor and child of God. Needless to say, the life-long friendship they once shared is no more.Valuing their friendship, how can Greg convince the hatred-filled Derrick that he did the right thing by saving his patient's life? More importantly, how will the fact that Greg has fallen in love with his patient (and the person that Derrick despises so much) further detriment their relationship? Most importantly, will their friendship be salvageable?For Love and Grace is not your typical run of the mill, \\"holier than thou\\" Christian novel. Superbly written, this novel is a perfect example of a test of faith and a test of friendship. Kendra Norman-Bellamy does an excellent job at keeping the focus of Christianity at the core of this novel without being preachy and bogging the reader down with lectures. The witty dialogue shared between Ms. Lena (Greg's mother) and Ms. Mattie (the mother of Greg's newfound love) lightens the tone and is sure to spark moments of laughter from the reader.For Love and Grace will stir moments of tears, chills, laughter and romance. This is a definite must-read for all, regardless of religious background and upbringing, and one novel that will have you screaming, \\"Is there a doctor in the house?\\" I highly anticipate the release of the sequel, Because of Grace,to this stellar novel and all future releases from this blessed and talented author."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"For Love And Grace by Kendra Norman-Bellamy is a deftly written novel of a biblical David and Jonathan-like friendship, but set in the present day. Two men who are closer than brothers (one a doctor and one a lawyer) are driven apart when the lawyer's mother tragically dies in an accident and the doctor must perform a life-saving surgery on a young woman.

This is a wonderful love story that puts the \\"man\\" back in roMANce. It was so refreshing to read about a man who fell in love with a woman and married her without 'testing the waters' first. This romance wasn't based on sex, but on genuine love. Greg and Grace made for a very lovable couple. Aside from them, I laughed out loud several times when reading the toe to toe combats between their mothers, Lena and Mattie. I also felt the grief that Derrick felt over the lost of his mother and the frustrations of Sherry as she tried to balance her love for her husband (Derrick) and her loyal friendship to Greg during the time that the men's brotherly bond was broken. This was a wonderful story and I hope to see a sequel.

Dr. Gregory Dixon and Attorney Derrick Madison are best friends who are torn apart when Jessica \\"Grace\\" Charles accidentally interrupts their lives. Dr. Dixon is anxious to operate on Grace and save her life because he has other plans for her; Attorney Madison wishes that Grace would die just like the lady she hit-his mom. With two opposing forces at work only by the Grace of God will these characters discover and understand the truth behind the tragic death of a loved one.Norman-Bellamy has written a Christian Fiction romance novel that can be enjoyed by someone as young as a teenager and as seasoned as a senior citizen. The storyline is one of love, laughter, tears and romance but void of profanity and obscene sexual scenes. The male characters are presented in a positive light and they exhibit the behavior and characteristics that any woman would want in a relationship. But the characters which really captured my attention and added life to the story were the parents of Greg and Grace-Ms. Lena and Ms. Mattie. These two characters were colorful, humorous and cantankerous and made for many laugh out loud moments.For Love and Grace by Kendra Norman-Bellamy is an uplifting and motivating novel that touches on true love, true friendship, true faith and true happiness. It is a pleasurable and easy read that can be read in one sitting. Fans of Christian Fiction and Romance/Love stories will especially enjoy this well-written book from new-comer Norman-Bellamy.Reviewed by YasminAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"For Love and Grace is filled with romance, humor, and drama.

I take public transportation to and from work and I read this in three days. I had to force myself not to read it at other times because I wanted to have it to read in route to and from my job everyday. I absolutely LOVED it! Everybody and everything in this novel was described and developed so well, that I felt like I was right there with every page I turned. I love romance novels, but I'm not really into Christian reading. Although this one is a Christian book, it's not preachy nor is the purpose to condemn the reader if they don't share the same faith as the characters in the book do. It's a marvelously written work that had me begging for more. Although there are no vivid sex situations here as there are in most romance books that I read, it is DEFINITELY a love story. The leading man (a doctor) in this book can give me a check-up anytime!! I'd love to see a follow-up novel to this one. Without giving the storyline away, I'll just say that Greg is the kind of man that most of us want, but have a heck of a time finding. He made me want to get up and go to church! Maybe that's why I haven't met Mr. Right. I've been looking in all the wrong places. Although this story is fiction, it's very believable. I imagine that an eligible handsome doctor could easily take special interest in a beautiful patient and find himself in love with her. Don't even let me get started on that wedding! Oh, my! I wonder if Greg has any single brothers. Oh, yeah...it's just a novel. Aside from Greg and Grace, my other favorites are Lena and Mattie, their mothers. They are hilarious and so very entertaining! I laughed and cried all the way through this book and now I'm reading it a second time. No wonder everybody's giving this one five stars!!!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Grace Charles, the leading lady in this story is my perfect girl. She's beautiful (looks like Chante Moore), she's smart (graduated from college in the top of her class), she's talented (sings & plays the piano) and she's a Christian. What more does a man need? And the leading man, Greg Dixon is athletic (played basketball), smart (graduated with honors from Georgetown University) and pulls in the dough (he's a brain surgeon). Man! He makes most of the rest of us look like chopped liver. To be honest, I never really intended to read this book. Hey, I'm a guy and I admit that I only bought this book from the author because I thought she was a fly looking honey when I saw her sitting in the bookstore signing her novel. I took the book back home and left it on my mama's coffee table. She called me a few days later and said she enjoyed it very much. I really didn't think I'd like it, but once I started reading it, I found out that not only did this author have looks, but she had talent too. Although I read a new book about every two weeks, I'm not at all into romance. I usually read horror and sci-fi, but this is a very well written novel that captured my attention and my imagination from chapter one. I didn't even know this book was listed on Amazon. I just thought I'd search for it and what do you know? Here it is. Since I can't tell her how great this book is in person, I'm glad to have a chance to pass along my thoughts to the general public. It's great and she should be proud of herself. Buy this one and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a tear-jerker and it tugs at the heart strings too....hey, I'm a man, but I'm also human.

When I was handed this book, my words were, \\"If I don't like it, I'm sure gonna put it on Amazon.\\" Well, I really dug this book and since I was so ready to post a bad response to it, I thought it was only fair for me to pull my foot out of my mouth and post a good one.

The Bible is full of sex and profanity, among other things. Where do you think we get our stories from? The Bible is the basis for everything that is written or that has been written or that will be written. Science fiction, love stories, murder mysteries, westerns, gangsters, doctors stories, law and police stories, witchcraft stories, mummy stories, ghosts stories, stories of desertion, physical and verbal abuse, stories of lust, sex, desire, temptations, deception, confusion, homosexuality, sports competition and events, etc.--all originated from the HOLY BIBLE. There is NOTHING new under the sun. In keeping with reality, therefore, Christians DO curse and commit SIN. Christian fiction is a BROAD term just like fiction itself. The only thing that distinguishes \\"Christian\\" fiction from \\"Mainstream\\" fiction is that it contains spirituality in some fashion. We need to get off of this kick that Christians are pefect and don't commit fornication, use profanity, listen to secular music, dance and sing the lyrics to hip-hop or R&B, or do other sinful things. I am a Christian, but I'm not perfect and I read this book and it was alright. If so-called Christians would write with reality in their novels (like Kimberla Lawson Roby - \\"Too Much of a Good Thing\\"), then maybe their stories wouldn't be \\"so boring.\\" To me, For Love and Grace was just another BET-type romance novel excluding sex scenes."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"One of my best friends got me this book, along with another good book for Christmas.

And Jesus Christ in heaven knows, if I could find myself a Dr. Gregory Dixon, this man I'm with would be HISTORY - and I MEAN that! (good thing he don't read Amazon reviews) But seriously, this book was so good 'til it wasn't even funny and it defined love not based on shallow stuff. I didn't want it to end. It was like reading a black cinderella story, but it was way more real and emotionally charged than cinderella. I read a book every two weeks or so and I started the year off right with this one. All the characters were good (even the ones I hated) and I liked that it wasn't so many of them that I couldn't keep up with them all. Some books are like that. This book was really good and I'm sure during the year when I can't find a new good book to read (finding them is getting harder and harder), I'll be pulling this one out again."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Another book that my soro sister from Atlanta sent me. Here is yet another Christian romance novel on the story of forgiveness. Some of the dialogues were flat and lifeless with no feeling. I found it distasteful and insensitive that the two mothers, especially Jessi's mom, were arguing while Jessi was lying on her deathbed. The front cover is appealing, but the characters are somewhat underdeveloped. The story moves slow, but it can be read relatively quickly. It was an okay read as far as Christian love stories go, and very predictable. It kind of reminded me of a Cinderalla story...and they lived happily ever after. This is pure fiction romance and not a true to life novel. I'm glad the author brought closure to the characters because a sequel would be overkill.

The wedding was a catchy &quot;Steel Magnolia&quot; wedding. This book reminds me of the Christian love story novel, Awakening Mercy, except it didn't beat around the bush as much.I give this book a 3.5 stars. It was easy to follow, dialoge driven, but predictable and too fictitious for black folks. Although I love reading &quot;Calgon take me away&quot; romance novels, but since this was more Christian driven, it should &quot;keep it real.&quot; I like the two dueling mothers.

It seems that the market is inundated with books, movies and even plays that bash us repeatedly. I am tired of the stereotypical, \\"Mama Done Burnt Up the Chicken-Part II,\\" which depicts the Black male character as an abusive, unemployed, uneducated protagonist victimizing the Black woman. I don't care to see my brothers in that light. It has gotten old.Then along comes \\"For Love and Grace\\" to restore my faith in urban literature. The lead characters in the story include strong Black men! They are positive role models and professionals. We see them in functional relationships adoring their queens. They are fathers taking care of and loving their children. They are even sons supporting and respecting their mothers. We also see them as true friends to one another-Godly men. By the same token, they are human and aren't perfect. This sets the tone for an easy read that I couldn't put down.Norman-Bellamy takes us through a wide range of emotions. There are so many twists and turns with the story that I forgot that the novel is categorized as a romance. I laughed out loud. The suspense had me hanging on every word. I can't emphasize enough how captivating the characters are. I've ordered copies of this book for my mother, cousin, and friends. Anytime I need to get someone a gift, the choice is and will be \\"For Love and Grace\\" (at least until Norman-Bellamy \\"graces\\" us with her next book). The story is not your average urban novel. It makes me proud to me a Black man."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"After reading my boss' copy of this book, I went to the author's website and ordered my own. Romance novels aren't generally my thing, but this one is a winner. Speaking from a man's point of view, it was more than refreshing to read a novel where we (Black men) are portrayed as something more than wife-beating, child neglecting, womanizing losers. This book is what romance is all about. Man meets woman. Man falls in love with woman. Man protects, loves and romances woman. Man gets down on one knee and makes woman his bride. If I didn't know better, I'd think \\"For Love And Grace\\" was written by a man who was trying to give his own kind some redemption. But to read this heartwarming story and see that it's written by a woman who sees us as the kings that we are and allows us, in her writing, to treat our women as the queens that they are is wonderful. This is truly the rebirth of what romance once was. There's not a dull moment here. The writing style is fresh and the characters are captivating. Even the \\"sexual scenes\\" between the supporting characters who are a loving married couple, are very tactful and leave much to the imagination. I loved every page and every chapter of this book and I look forward to the next one, whether it be a sequel or a whole new venture. This is well worth the money.

The story is excellent and very well written. The characters are well developed and three dimensional.

Not since Victoria Murray have I read a more refreshing story of love seasoned with wholesome values that left me with an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction. It's a wonderful emotional experience to actually feel that a story has met every single need and expectation that you would have desired it to. For Love And Grace is one of those stories. It's more than just a good story. It's so well-written that I felt like I knew the characters and I could feel what they were feeling throughout the novel. I honestly hated for this one to end and I've started reading it for a second time. It's not often that you pick up a novel that portrays positive Black male role models who make you just want to get on your knees and ask God &quot;Where's mine?&quot;, but Greg, in this book did that for me.

Having some handsome man swept us off our feet, not just handsome a Christian Professional. What more could you ask for? This book is not just a Christian Romance Novel to me it's much more than that. It shows that if God is put first in our lives everything else will fall into place our marriages and our relationships with others. I'm not much of a reader but this book was able to get and keep my attention until I completed it. I was told once you pick it up you can't put it down, well I'm a witness it's very hard because you always want to see what's going to happen next.

I bought this book about a month ago. When I finished reading it, my 13 and 16 year old daughters read it and now my mom is reading it. That's how versitile it is. It's full of emotion and love, but the purity of it is what makes it so refreshing. Very good read. Well worth the purchase. I hope this is just one of many to come."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"This love story is about friends and lovers. The brothers are portrayed in a positive light even in the darkest hour. The women are loving and supportive of one another and of their men.For Love and Grace is a well-written novel that motivates and captivates. The story is very thorough in capturing and maintaining the reader's attention. I didn't want it to end, and it didn't because the love lives on forever!The first-time author did an excellent job!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I bought this book at a small bookstore called \\"Life Is A Box of Crayons\\" in Atlanta, Georgia. The cover and the write-up on the back caught my attention. It looked and sounded like a good read. Boy, was it ever!! This is such a beautiful story of faith, love and friendship. It covers the love that two strong Black brothers have for the women and children in their lives as well as the love between the two male friends who have their life-time friendship tried because of the death of a dear mother. When I started reading this book on my ride back home, I couldn't put it down. I was captivated from page one. It's such a refreshing change from what you normally get in a romance novel. The fact that all of the major players in this book were born-again Christians is felt throughout the novel with the deep love and committments of their relationships. There are moments of tears, laughter, drama and romance. It would make for a great movie. Five stars to this new author in her freshman project. I can't wait to see what's next."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Reality seasoned with a bit of fantasy and valuable lessons makes for a flavorful read.Kendra Norman-Bellamy has written a novel that epitomizes the original intent of the term - romance. In a world where romance novels are synonymous with amoral behavior, For Love And Grace rests among the best of the best.Dr. Gregory Dixon and attorney Derrick Madison have history literally from the cradle. Friendship ties are stretched to the limit when professional responsibilities are viewed as backstabbing and unforgivable. Portrayal of the meaning of enduring faith and unconditional love speaks to the reader as they become acquainted with the characters. Though not perfect and at some times annoying, the mothers are someone the reader has known or has had exposure to. Derrick's wife's strength is encouraging in that she willingly sets her needs aside for the sake of her husband's healing. Gregory's love and courtship of Grace places the spotlight on what is pure versus what society dictates as steps towards intimacy.From beginning to end interest in character and plot is held with just the right amount of hints, intrigue and a need to know.Ms. Norman-Bellamy is to be commended for her courage. Courage for daring to step away from expectancy. Courage for portraying strong values in the face of adversity. Daring to stand in the face of criticism for presenting a tale about people of color without taking the readers on a trip through drama land for the sake of \`keeping it real'.A book worth reading and sharing.Dr. Linda F. Beed, D.R.E.On Assignment Reviews"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I absolutely luuuuuuved this book! In other reviews there has been much talk about wanting a sequel. I don't necessarily want one, but I would definitely take it if the author decides to write one. The story is wonderful just like she ended it, but like one of the other reviewers said I'd like to know what happened after October 6th too. I just loved the way the author tied everything together so nicely. The book wasn't predictable at all. I expected the October 6th thing to happen, but all the other mysteries that were solved were just genius the way she put it together. I never would have guessed.

I find it offensive when I hear people comparing this book to Victoria christopher Murphey's book &quot;Temptation.&quot; Love and Grace is far, far, better than Temptation. I don't know what all the hoopla is about Temptation because it bored me stiff. Heck, I don't know what y'all talkin' about (I got an attitude now). [smile] Vicki Murphey needs to take some pointers from this author.I would've given Love and Grace a five star but when I got to the end, I was livid! The author turned this raw, sweet, story into a fairytale. The surprise guests at the wedding scene was like the movie &quot;Coming to America,&quot; when the prince lifted the veil of his bride, chosen by the King, only to find it was the women he really wanted to marry. Please! Give me a break! I wanted it to end on a more solid note or on a more personal wedding. I must admit that it was kinda cute when she walked in and saw all of the police there and thought it was because of a stalker female who was after her husband-to-be, only to find out that they were there because of the high profile musical guests. None of them to my liking. But then again, I didn't write the story -- I just read it, enjoyed it, and reviewed it."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"I think what I liked most about this book was the romance between Greg and Grace. It was so very romantic, although it was almost secondary to the theme of the friendship between Greg and Derrick. The strong male presence and the bond between the men and their mothers was a refreshing tone. The characters of Greg and Grace made for a different kind of dramatic love story fit for a BET movie or modern-day black stage play fit for a Tony Award."},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Kendra Norman-Bellamy's For Love and Grace was beautifully written, a story of true friendship, true love and God's grace and mercy. Throughout the story you could see the working of God's hand in every situation even those times when it appeared hopeless to the point of no return. Certainly the agape love of God in the heart of Dr. Greg Dixon was at work when it came to his friendship with his best friend Derrick. How many of us would have been able to forgive our best friend if they would have done half of what Derrick did? Oh, but the love of God... and His peace! This story also allows us to see that if we wait on God for our mate, no matter how crazy it may seem how you come together, it is yet God working it out for you.Wonderful, wonderful story!"},{"Title":"For Love and Grace (For Love and Grace Series #1)","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, my church book club read this book too.

She did real good with this one. For Love and Grace was the perfect book for me to snuggled close to my fireplace with. It warmed my heart. To say it was a wholesome book somehow gives the indication that it was boring and dramaless. That's not true though.

This is an in- depth report, based on years of study and experience in the field, on the clinical route that ends in suicide and why your intervention may not have made a difference.Dr. Hillman shows us the path the soul took to the brink and explains why they could not turn back...unless they stood at the edge and chose to turn away.I have read many books that sought to confort the bereaved. This book allows us, as the tormented survivors, a smidgeon of insight. The kind of insight that makes some sense of the senseless act. I don't know Dr. Hillman, although I certainly read some of his other work after reading this book; but I owe him a dept. This book is a gift. I hope you find it as remarkable as I did."},{"Title":"Suicide and the soul","review":"This is the most influential book I have read regarding clinical practice. After reading it, I was in awe of how anyone can think let alone write so profoundly. It is not just about suicide, but speaks of how experience and developmental transitions shape our existence. Although breathtakingly compassionate and sophisticated regarding the joys and pains of living, I didn't find the content at all sentimental. This book is highly absorbing, frequently moving and extremely original in its perspective on various concepts. Ideas are introduced well, with examples that make it accessible to anyone regardless of their professional or personal reasons for reading \\"Suicide and the Soul\\". It can be a challenge in terms of the concepts, beliefs and emotions related to the material as would be expected. I am astounded at the age of this book; given how contemporary its viewpoints are on the matter. There is just as much value in this book to learn more about living and life, as death and suicide. Obviously, I would recommend reading the book.....at least once."},{"Title":"Suicide and the soul","review":"Hillman delivers - and like many Jungian writers, he wanders all of soul's territory and Jung's theories.

All major topics in metallurgy are covered at an undergraduate survey level. Cottrell's writing style is excellent, and he concentrates on giving the reader insight into the many technical aspects involved in metallurgy. He doesn't just throw a bunch of equations at you without giving you insight into each one. This book concentrates more on concepts and understanding than on industrial details and metallurgical recipes. Readers will need a basic understanding of calculus, physics and chemistry (at a first year college/university level)."},{"Title":"B0786 Introduction to metallurgy (matsci)","review":"The original version of this book, \\"Theoretical Structural Metallurgy\\" (first published in 1948), was the prototype for what a modern metallurgy text (and course) should cover. This book is an expanded version of that one. Prior to Professor Cottrell's texts, metallurgy was generally taught as an applied discipline, mostly focusing on metal (mostly iron and steel) production, properties and uses. His books changed that by creating a firm foundation in the sciences of metallurgical thermodynamics, phase transformations and modern explanations of electronic and deformation behavior.This book is a bit long in the tooth, but most of the basic metallurgical material that it covers is just as timely as when it was written, about 40 years ago. It starts with atomic structure, chemical bonding and chapters on aspects of thermodynamics. Then there are chapters devoted to; steels, phase diagrams, crystal structures, mechanical properties, deformation, oxidation, corrosion, electronic properties and uses of metals. The material covered is basic and most suitable for an introductory metallurgy course. Additional, more advanced, texts are therefore required for more in-depth treatments of the topics that are covered. Professor Cottrell wrote with clarity, making this is a great text for a first course in metallurgy. There are many more recent texts on this subject, which for the most part have been modeled on the original version of this book - even after 40 years this book hold its own with them. The book is also a good choice for a mechanical, civil or electrical engineer who wishes to learn more about the basics of metallurgy."},{"Title":"General chemistry","review":"Some years ago, as a first year student of physics, I had a course in chemistry that I thought I would never pass - it had been years since I graduated from high school, so I could not remember much of the chemistry classes, and chemistry had never been my favorite subject anyway. This course was based on the worst example of a European textbook (filled with information, but extremely hard to grasp), it was impossible to understand chemistry from this source only. So I looked for alternatives.By sheer luck, I stumbled upon Atkins' book on a bookstore shelf. As soon as I started reading it, I was captivated. Everything that did not make much sense in the other book now was perfectly clear. The illustrations are beautiful, e.g. giving you a feel of what each element looks like in vivid color. This was one of the best textbooks I had ever encountered. It only took me a month or two to learn it all from cover to cover, and I guess what? - I passed the exam with an A, and with the compliments of the professor, congratulating me for my thorough knowledge - something I wouldn't dream of just a few months before. This was the first example for me of what a difference a good textbook can make.If you want to learn and understand chemistry, even if you're starting from scratch, this is the book to use!Later on, I read several other Atkins' books. His writing is truly remarkable, passing on not merely knowledge, but insight. I would recommend also &quot;The 2nd Law&quot;."},{"Title":"General chemistry","review":"I have not seriously looked at a chemistry textbook in years. I still recall with some unease my classes in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, geochemistry, and physical chemistry. Despite our long hours together, chemistry and I were never close friends.A while back I found myself browsing \\"General Chemistry\\", a widely used text authored by P. W. Atkins and J. A. Beran. Surprisingly, I transitioned from a cursory review mode to a dedicated reading of the entire text. I emerged six months later with an excitment for chemistry that I had never developed while attending university.Like most first year college science textbooks, the latest edition of Atkins' text is thick (about 1,000 glossy pages), heavy, and incredibly expensive. I used an older second edition (1990) that is available for a substantially reduced price on Amazon.I suspect that Atkins' text is more detailed than many first year chemistry books. I found the section on Redox Equations and Half Reactions to be troublesome. I had difficulty with chapters 14 and 15 on Acids and Bases (pgs. 531-620) and even set the book aside for several weeks. I am unsure whether the problem was with the text or with me, probably a little of both. The last 300 pages seemed easier going. The organic chemistry sections were well written.I appreciated the way that the authors clearly explained the solution strategy for ALL example problems before detailing the solution itself. The problem is defined, a strategy for solving the problem is discussed, and the solution is clearly shown. This feature makes Atkins' textbook particularly sutiable for self-study and review.I especially enjoyed the discussions on special topics like Processing Ores, Scanning Tunneling Microscope, Redox Reactions in Photography, Photoelectrochemistry, Swimming Pool Chemistry, Stalactite Growth, and Smog Formation.I am puzzled why reader reviews for Atkins' various textbooks seem so inconsistent. Some readers rave about his textbooks; others hate them. I have read this book from cover to cover and I join those readers that recommend Atkins' textbooks.Recently I came across a more current edition of Atkins' General Chemistry (now co-authoed with Loretta Jones) that has been substantially restructured. The new 3D drawings of molecules were especially impressive. If you can afford it, buy a newer edition, but avoid the high cost of the latest edition unless it is a class requirement."},{"Title":"General chemistry","review":"Ever since I can remember I despised everything that had to do with physics, chemistry and natural science, even though I was good at math.When enrolling in high school we began learning chemistry at a higher level, and I immidiately felt captivated.

I read in it on a daily basis and find it fascinating to read the two authors' descriptions of the wonders of molecyles, atoms, pH, ions and physical chemistry, it has opened a doorway to a whole new world. I really owe my recently acquired interest in chemistry to books like this one.Buy it!"},{"Title":"General chemistry","review":"Beautiful book! Reads easily, great diagrams, and pretty pictures.

I prefer the almanac because it is paper.The CD-ROM has a nice browsing system, but given the fact that it does not have class/method descriptions, I think I will typically use the free HTML help that comes with JDK over this CD-ROM.

Trent, sometimes a name used for Lance Kilkenny is one of the most interesting heroes created by L'amour, perhaps the ultimate warrior-like person who could ever be created by one of the greatest authors ever lived and contributed. There is one thing that Bantam Book and L'amour's offsprings didn't do yet. They should line up the whole works of L'amour and mark the 1, 2, 3 numbers for the readers to follow. Like Sackett saga, they should tell the reader to start reading from &quot;To The Far Blue Mountain&quot;, then, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot;, then which one should be read first about Tell Sackett, Orrion, or Tyrel Sackett. Readers picking up and finising a book and found out that should come later after the other ones is so annoying and frustrated. If there is a character who would appear again and again as a certain series, the publisher and the heir of L'amour should mark them clearly. Like I've read Tell finally lost his wife, Angee, and then the next one I've picked up was Angee was still alive, because this is the one I should have read first, but without knowing it is such an annoying mixup."},{"Title":"The Rider of the Ruby Hills","review":"L'amour is always dependable for a good read with realistic people.

This one was an audiobook I listened to this time. The reader was good, better than average for a Louie L'Amour reader and he had a flavor of the old west in his speech, I liked that. And the story started promising but faded toward the end with little more to like about the main characters than first described.Story goes like this, lone rider rides into town from off the plains, see's the woman he's goin' ta marry, determines the land he's goin' ta own, runs into the city-slicker and the other men he's gonna hav' ta kill and goes about takin' care of business. A formula I like really, but in other Louie L'amour books it's been done so much better.Of recent stories I've read or heard I'd suggest Crazy Man, The Lonely Men, or Mojave Crossing for a better read. Also Larry McMurtry's Commanche Moon is a good western read.

In responding to the various, hugely UN-specific statements that help determine your personality type and your child's, I found I had a different answer for different circumstances, moods, or times of day. For instance, in the section that determines if you are a fast- or slow-placed person, you circle 1 if you make up your mind quickly, or circle 2 if you take your time in decision-making. Well, am I deciding which preschool to send my child to, or choosing shampoo at the store? Different circumstances, different answers.In addition to disliking the basis for the book, I found the parenting advice to be very basic. \\"Do not become impatient with the child. Don't rush or push him. . .Be open at times if your child suggests a different way of doing something. . .Realize that some conflict and change is healthy. . .,\\" etc. Be aware, too, that this book is written from a fundamentalist Christian viewpoint--the author is a southern Baptist minister and liberally sprinkles the pages with Bible verses and other evangelical language.The one part of the book that I enjoyed was a couple of pages of positive \\"one-liners\\" you can use to build your child's self-confidence: for example, instead of saying \\"What's taking you so long?\\" you can say, \\"You do things precisely and accurately.\\" That is very much in line with the whole \\"observe, don't judge\\" philosophy of child psychologist Haim Ginott which I try to follow.There are many more helpful parenting books out there--keep searching."},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"This book will help you understand that different personalities aren't right or wrong, they are just different.Using the DISC personality profile descriptions this easy to understand book can help you re-open closed communication lines with your child who is different than you in action, thought, and deed.It's as simple as starting by asking yourself is he/she &quot;slow-paced&quot; or &quot;fast-paced&quot;, &quot;task-oriented&quot; or &quot;people-oriented&quot;?

It is very easy to read and understand and has helped me to see others differently, and recognize how personalities truly affect relationships. Knowledge is the key, and once I understand why someone behaves the way they do, I can recognize that they really aren't just trying to annoy me, and learn to adjust. I also see my own weaknesses and can work on those. No one is DEFINED by their personality type. We all have choices to make in life, but understanding your normal tendencies can help you to become a more balance person. And having a daughter that is so different from me, I really enjoyed the section in this book on how each personality type relates to the others- strengths, struggles, and strategies. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"Charles Boyd does a wonderful job of writing this book to help parents understand the need to parent children to their unique personalities.I like how he uses the DISC Model that helps parents understand that their personality and their child's personality can work together even if at opposite ends of the spectrum. I have taught these principles in parenting classes using this book and found parents have a AHAA! moment when it dawns on them why their child follows them around all evening. The parents realized that their children just needed to be nurtured based on their personality styles.I like how the book is written as a study book for parenting groups. It gives another way for parents to gather together, share ideas, and learn new strategies about children.This is a must read for parents.Jen Hegerty, School Counselor"},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"I can honestly say that this book has changed my outlook on my parenting.This book starts out by clarifying what the Bible means when it commands us to \\"train up a child in the way he should go\\" (Proverbs 22:6) by explaining that the Hebrew meaning behind \\"the way he should go\\" more accurately could be described to say \\"according to his bent\\". In other words, God has created each of us with a unique bent to our personality. We will do best to understand our child's bent and parent them with that in mind. Failing to do this results in children that are raised feeling that if they could change who they are (be more assertive, more calm, more creative, more like their brother, etc) we would love/accept them more. God has created each of us with our own set of strengths, gifts, weaknesses and tendencies. This book used the popular DISC personality assessment model to help me to not only understand the personality of my children, but to see how it is God given. It also helped my husband and I identify our personality types and understand the natural strengths and weaknesses with those personalities. Practically, this book also went into great detail providing ideas on how to tailor our parenting style to train our children according to their \\"bent\\" (even breaking down each specific parent/child personality combination). It also touched on how the differing personality types of you and your spouse can affect your marriage.After reading this book I was able to better understand our oldest son's personality and appreciate his temperament rather than try to fight or change it.As a few examples:-Part of our son's personality is to have a strong desire to lead. This can be a strength; the world needs leaders, especially good ones. Our challenge as parents is to help him recognize this God given gift and see how he can use it to help others. In addition, he needs to keep in mind that sometimes he may be tempted to lead others in a way that is inconsiderate of their desires. Knowing this about him, we can affirm his strength and help him learn how this strength can also be a weaknesses, if he is not careful. We are working to be more intentional about verbally affirming his strengths as we see them displayed. When he asks the waitress at a restaurant if he can please have more to drink we can say \\"You were not worried to ask for something that you needed, that is called being assertive, good job!\\"-Another aspect of our son's personality is his desire to do things in a systematic way. Knowing how important routine is to him and how well he responds to doing things \\"in order\\" we have found ways to incorporate list making in our home. We have a list for \\"what do do when you get home from school\\", \\"what to do before you watch TV\\" and \\"what to do to get ready for bed\\". These list have worked AMAZINGLY well and it feels great finding things like this that help us to train him according to his \\"bent\\".Since reading this book, I have mentioned this book to countless friends. Two of my friends have borrowed my copy. I asked them if they had any feedback to share on it. Here is what they said:\\"Any book that helps me understand my children better is a good read. Once you figure out the personality type your child leans towards, it is fun to follow how their minds generally process things. It can be very eye opening.It definitely helped me understand some of the frustrations in our household. Now that I understand where they are coming from (and even where I am coming from!), it makes it easier to step back and evaluate the situation correctly.\\" Serena H.\\"As a parent, I want my kids to thrive and this enlightening book has helped me learn to encourage them according to their own God-given design. I love the added benefit that these insights have also helped strengthen my marriage at the same time.\\" Meredith M."},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"This book was easy to read and very informative. I enjoyed reading it and recommended it to friends, who are now reading it, too.I plan to read it again through the years to help me be the best parent for my kids."},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"This book has been a great, practical resource for our family, and the title is a perfect description of just what the book does: it has helped us to understand the different, unique needs of each of our children, and also how to meet those needs effectively.After some general introductory chapters, it gives a simple explanation of each of the four major personality types using the DISC system, and helps you identify both your own predominant personality type, as well as each of your children's. Of course most people are a combination of two or more types, and so these are generalizations, but they really give insight into \\"Why my child acts that way, and why I react this way.\\"For me, one of the best features of the whole book is the section that takes each of the four major personality types (or in this case \\"parenting styles\\"), and matches those parenting styles with each of the four major personality types of your children, one per page. So for example, if you are predominantly a \\"D\\" parent, it matches you up with each possible personality type of your child: D, I, S, or C, and lists \\"Strengths,\\" \\"Struggles,\\" and \\"Strategies\\" for each combination. This made the book specific enough to be really helpful.There are some other great features in the book, but that one was my favorite. I've loaned out my copy multiple times, and even bought one for a friend. It's a wonderful resource and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Different Children, Different Needs: Understanding the Unique Personality of Your Child","review":"This is an exceptional book for parents, giving us the descriptions of different temperaments... both for our children and for ourselves.

The book goes on and on about the features of Small Business Server and how easy it is for the administrator to set up and maintain (the book does this for at least a hundred pages). I believe knowing about all of the features are important, but the book lacks in not showing the reader how to troubleshoot and inplement most of them. Some of the features that I was trying to implement were advanced but not out of the ordinary. This book didn't halp me at all.I have read many text books in my days.

It was the first 747 bombing and the worst act of air terrorism until 9/11. This 1987 book was turned down by American publishers because there weren't any American victims, but this is a book that Americans need to read to know about what is really going on in Canada if Americans think that they were too soft on terrorism.The Pan Am 103 Lockerbie bombing, blamed on Libya and arab terrorists, would not happen until the next year, was also a bomb hidden in a radio by a passenger who did not board the airplane. That would have been prevented had the lessons of Air India 182, the first flight to use such tactics been learned. America would not be truly awakened to the threat of terrorism based on religious nationalism until 2001.When written, the suspects hadn't even been identified or arrested yet, but this book shows that Khalistan nationalists like Gurpartap Singh Birk who celebrated the killing of Indian Prime Minister Indira Ghandi were planning many acts of terrorism. It tells the story of Inderjit Singh Reyat, the electrican who was eventually convicted of buying the parts for and rigging just the Tokyo bomb which was suspected as being nearly identical to the AI 182 bomb, yet merely fined and released to work for Jaguar in the UK until his rearrest for. He met Talvinder (Talwinder) Singh Parmar, head of BK but describing himself as an unemployed janitor with a house built in 1982 worth $350,000 to demonstrate a test explosion.About half of the book is dedicated to stories of the families, women children, men, widows and widowers who were lost or had lost loved ones in the disaster.This excellent book really needs an update on why only Reyat, the bomber caught red-handed with receipts for the very Sanyo tuner found blown to bits in Japan in an apparent attempt to blow up a SECOND airliner at the same was the only person convicted, despite wiretaps and multiple arrests of people like Talwinder Singh Parmar, already wanted by India as a terrorist (but Canada felt they didn't have good enough evidence to ship him to India) and head of the Babbar Khalsa (later banned as a terrorist organization) and his sidekick Ajaib Singh Bagri who had called for killing of thousands Hindus in revenge.Parmar would be released for lack of evidence and slip out to Pakistan in 1988 to continue the Khalistan insurgency in Punjab, but die in a shootout (some say staged killing) after being caught by Indian authorities in 1992.Reyat was given a deal to plead guilty if he would testify against Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, but he would not implicate them at trial. Despite wiretaps and testimony from witnesses (publisher Tara Singh Hayer could not testify because he had been murdered) that Malik and Bagri had confessed privately about their involvement and asked for their participation, the two were found \\"not guilty\\" in 2007 after the longest and most expensive investigation and trial in Canadian history, estimated at well over $100 millionNot exactly a happy ending, but that should get into interested in one of the biggest and earliest unknown backstories of 9/11 as Arab and eventually Al Queda would adopt the tactics from Punjab that make the occupied territories seem like a relatively quiet and peaceful place and inspire people like Ramsi Yousef to evision operations like Bojinka which planned to bomb dozens of planes at once with more sophisticated liquid explosives and timers and what would become 9/11 masterminded by uncle ksm."},{"Title":"Sorrow and the Terror: The Haunting Legacy of the Air India Tragedy","review":"WHAT REALLY HAPPEND 331 PEOPLE DIED BUT NOW THEY ARE BEAING BROUGHT TO TRIAL THAT STARTED FEB 4 2002 ALL SHOULD BE KILLED"},{"Title":"Inside Atl (Programming Languages/C)","review":"I feel sorry for any author who has to explain ATL. It must be a miserable job.C++ Templates, COM, Registry entries, in-process and out-of-process servers-- these subjects each have to be discussed before you can really get into ATL, and learn what it does and how it can help you. Quite a bit of prep work there.Like other ATL books out there, this one has it's confusing parts. After about the first 100 pages or so, the authors start explaining the internal workings of ATL objects, and man, does it make for a tough read. Various ATL classes are briefly mentioned here and there, this one is used as a template parameter for that one, and pity the poor reader who's new to the ATL game!Still, I can't blame the authors here, but rather the subject matter. If you keep cool, and don't worry whenever the authors expand those ATL macros and try to explain their inner workings, you can progress along fairly quickly.Most parts of the book are very well explained, and if you're someone who *must* know about ATL's internal workings in depth, then this book is a good one to start with. If you're new to ATL, you can definitely profit by reading this, but look for a beginner's companion to keep close by."},{"Title":"Inside Atl (Programming Languages/C)","review":"Excellent book for readers yearning a stronger understanding of ATL and COM. The auther does a concise job of explaining some of the more difficult or less well understood aspects of COM - APARTMENTS and THREADS.Apartments and threads, in most other COM books are often inadequete and rushed - not this book. The level of detail to apartments and threads can easily make this book worth buying all together, not to say, that the rest of the book isn't worth reading because it is.Although, they did a wonderful job of explaining threads and apartments this book isn't without its challenges. For example, to understand many of the code samples you must have some Windows 32 programming experience or be familiar with some of the Win32 API calls and libraries. Make sure you have a Windows 32 programming book as reference (e.g. Advanced Windows by Jeffrey Richter).Furthermore, I can understand how some readers may be intimidated by this book because they might not be as comfortable working with C++, templates, macros and the Win32 API...typical in most hardcore COM books I have read. However, don't let that stop you from reading this book. Just make sure that you purchase the necessary reference books to bring yourself up to speed.So, if you want to understand the internals of &quot;ATL&quot; and &quot;COM&quot;, do yourself a favor and buy this book. It should have an excellent shelf life, unlike some of the other COM books I've purchased, such as &quot;Beginning ATL COM&quot; from Wrox (save your money on this book).Over the years I've come to rely upon a few trusted books on COM and Win32 programming and have provided them below:COM:- Essential COM by Don Box (COM primer)- Inside COM by Dale Rogerson (COM primer)WIN 32 PROGRAMMING:- Advanced Windows by Jeffrey Richter (good advanced topics...threading, kernal, locking)- Programming Windows by Charles Petzold (good all-around ref.)- Learn Windows Programming in 21 days (excellent primer!)"},{"Title":"Inside Atl (Programming Languages/C)","review":"I found that the best way to grasp ATL is to understand COM in the first place.

This book does a good job to guide you through the main ATL features. My only complain is that, like almost every other book on COM that I have read, it assumes that you know nothing about C++ and COM and takes the first 2 chapters to introduce you these topics and that represents almost 100 pages of prerequisite material that should have been found only in a introduction book IMO."},{"Title":"Inside Atl (Programming Languages/C)","review":"First of all, this book wouldn't teach you anything from ground-up.

The reader probably knows plenty about the basics and is looking for real meat. Instead, he/she gets fluff.A case in point is the coverage of ActiveX control creation. The book joyfully enumerates the interfaces that ATL provides canned implementations for when you pick different options and macros, but zero information about how the canned implemetations work, how you extend them, what the implementation philosophy is...

For those that insist on preparing in some way (as I did before I entered), it is far more appropriate to learn HOW to do well in law school than to try and &quot;pre-learn&quot; torts, civil procedure, or contracts.

The latter consists in the different privileges that some men enjoy to the prejudice of others, such as to be richer, more honored, more powerful than they, or even to make themselves obeyed by them.\\"In 1750, the Academy of Dijon held an essay contest. The question, \`Has the restoration of the sciences &amp; arts tended to purify morals?' The First Discourse (Discourse on the Sciences and Arts) was the winning essay. Rousseau's powerful critique of the enlightenment in modern Europe spit in the faces of the very people that were judging his work. However, Rousseau's arguments and assessment of the enlightenment were so profound that even the elite scholars of the Academy could not deny Rousseau his just recognition for superior writing and understanding of the nature of the sciences and arts and their effects on modern life.Rousseau's Second Discourse (Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequity) was a follow up to the first. In it, Rousseau delves deeper into the issue of human origins (i.e. the state of nature) and the cause and effects of human inequality.No other philosopher has be praised and condemned, celebrated and written-off as much as Rousseau. His countless effects on modern life go relatively unknown. Anyone who has read Marx, must ask themselves, what history book was Marx reading. Upon reading Rousseau's Discourses, it become obvious, Marx read Rousseau. However, \\"Rousseau can still overpower where Marx falls flat.\\" (Allan Bloom, \`The Closing of The American Mind,' 217.)Rousseau is a must read for anyone who is a student of, or interested in, philosophy, political philosophy, Marxism, or simply has a longing to return to the state of nature and thinks that life would be best if we would all just \\"go and work in our garden.\\" (Voltaire, \`Candide,' 144.)"},{"Title":"The First and Second Discourses","review":"Wxactly what was said was given.

Between him and Hughes a mysterious bond remained. Hughes had stepped away from the glamorous, Hepburn and Gardner and RKO life by the time Hyland became CEO oh Hughes Aircraft, and so this wonderful book will be a kind of sequel to the Scorsese effort, which insyead concentrates on the less dismal, exciting and earlier Hollywood years and features a cameo by Gwen Stefani of No Doubt as Jean Harlow, the tragic platinum blonde whom Hughes directed in HELLS ANGELS and sought to dominate elsewhere."},{"Title":"Call Me Pat: The Autobiography of the Man Howard Hughes Chose to Lead Hughes Aircraft","review":"This is a great book.

I am an engineer but actually enjoyed the insight into the business aspects of running a very large company. My favorite part is when Pat initially takes over Hughes Aircraft and can't get the CFO to give him financial numbers...read it for yourself to see how Pat Hyland handled this situation."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Samurai and the Tea was not only historically accurate but kept my interest from beginning to end. Cathy Brueggemann Beil has an extraordinary talent for writing! After reading the book myself I am now reading it to my children. What an incredible way to learn about the beautiful legacy of the Japanese Christians! I look forward to her next book!"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"The Samuari and The Tea is one of the first books in a long time that has kept me glued to it's pages. The writer has the ability to transport not only Michael through time but also the reader. I learned much,cried alot, and when the story ended I felt the desire to become stronger in my faith. A true masterpiece in words!"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"My children and I really enjoyed this book. This is an excellent resource to complement any studies on Japan, the Eastern Hemisphere, or Christian martyrs. My criticisms are minor: First, the book contains some editing errors-- confusing \\"lose\\" and \\"loose,\\" etc. Secondly, the premise of time travel has been done before; this book approached an already over-used literary method in the same stale way. Thirdly, as a mother of two adopted children, including a child adopted from China (who does not look like me), I did not like the pejorative tone used in the first chapter regarding adoption.Despite these flaws, however, overall the information conveyed in the book is very good, and my children aged 6 through 13 really enjoyed the story. I would recommend it to all families, particularly Catholic families, who want to learn more about the history of Christianity in Japan."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"It disgusts me how many on Amazon try to sell Catholic books for 2 to 4 times more than they are worth. This is an excellent book on the history (true) of how Catholicism survived in Japan for hundreds of years. But this book may be had new for eight dollars at Angelus Press online. Just use your search engine for Angelus Press to get the website. It is put out by Pius X society. They have more excellent books and btw this book is on audio for $14.95 at the same website. Amazon you need to crack down on people who overprice their books to gouge customers. This should be an unfair labor practice. It is stealing and dishonest."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Not often have I learned so much while being held by a good story. Japan is was like so many other civilizations that encountered Christianity: that which is most noble and beautiful in the culture blends easily with Christianity. The japanese tea ceremony is such a custom and is the hub for Cathy Beil's story. What a fun way to learn about the Japanese martyrs and how Christianity survived in hiding for centuries in Japan."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"While never being an avid reader in high school I am deliberately trying to broaden my literary horizons. I reviewed the consumer critiques of Cathy Brueggemann Beil's book, The Samurai and the Tea, and chose to read it. I was not disappointed. The book had adventure, mystery, and inspiration. I also loved the fact that it wasn't super lengthy. It held my interest and I strongly recommend the book. Looking forward to more of Beil's publishings."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Being nonCatholic and non Japanese I can truly state that I was enthralled with the story of Micheal. I strongly recommend to every reader to purchase Cathy B. Beil's book, The Samuarai and The Tea!! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"This little book is not easy to come by but it is well worth the effort; how often does a reader encounter one small volume which encompasses time travel, mysticism, spiritualism, Japanese history, Christian teachings, the WWII Japanese American internment camps, fallen heroes, combat and personal sacrifice, and a multi-layered story of a young boy coming of age in a courageous, inspiring manner? Although this book almost defies description, the story manages to transcend age divisions, as it is fascinating and accessible to young readers but also keeps the attention of mature readers as well.The timeless spiritual values, and the eternal virtues of truth and honor, are brought into a captivating story, and the dramas played out in this tale hold the reader's interest to the very last page.The edition that I own was an early one, and there are a few typos which were NOT the fault of the author but which happened as the person who did the editing, transcribed and reformatted the original texts. But this is a small thing, easily overlooked, and hopefully it will be corrected if there is another edition on the horizon.I also hope that this author will write more in the future; her style is warm and deeply engaging. As she reveals more and more layers of the characters, we come to feel that we know them and care about them, just as we do with new friends in our own lives.All in all, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"My brother and sister-in-law sent me the book, The Samurai and the Tea, by Cathy Brueggemann Beil as a gift. It captured my interest so much that I could not put the book down until I knew the ending regarding Michael's final decision. I read the book late into the night after working a busy evening shift in the emergency department. It was awesome!!!!! Beil is a thoughtful, insightful writer. Her underlying research is evident. Trust that Beil is nearing the release of another book. Love her writing style and look forward to reading more of her works. (And thanks to my brother and his wife for an inspirational gift that can be read and reread and shared with others.)"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Amazing!! The Samurai and The Tea is a book that keeps the mind and heart in suspense. This book was able to relate true historical facts to a boy from the twenty-first century.

This fabulous book teaches history, traditions, and morals and tells a heart-warming story.A great book for all Americans who have questioned their heritage andhistory!"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Cathy Brueggemann Beil truly did a phenomenal amount of research related to Japanese Christian history, prior to writing and publishing the book.

Great reading for young and old, thanks to the author for sharing this wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"The Samurai and The Tea is a fascinating and instructive book.

Michael's adventures through time cleverly combine adventure and education. The atrocities suffered by Japanese Christians, not only in their native country but also in America are vividly described in this book. The Samurai and The Tea is enthralling, from beginning to end and I would highly recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","review":"Cathy combines a riveting time-travel adventure story that appeals to &quot;kids&quot; age 10-110 with a fascinating history of the growth of Christianity in Japan, woven among the intricacies of the Japanese Tea Ceremony. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy, in an easy-to-read manner that appeals to the young, yet detailed enough to hold the attention of the most discerning adult reader. Cathy's style draws the reader in so that you will feel you are right there with Michael; and when the story ends, you'll be reluctant to bid him farewell."},{"Title":"The Early Writings of Alan Watts","review":"This books probably isn't the best place to start for someone just becoming interested in either Alan Watts or in Eastern thought in general. However, for osmeone who is interested in Alan Watts, it is invaluable.

It goes far beyond the typical travel guide, covering such topics as the history, natural history, language, economy, and religion of Hawaii. Bisignani does not allow this to distract in any way from the purpose of the book, however. Quite the opposite; I used this book (almost exclusively) in planning an incredible--and incredibly diverse--trip to Hawaii. Everything from $20/night cabins in Volcanos National Park to $400+/night super-luxury resorts are covered in its many pages.A word of caution, though. If you are interested in a guide book to aid in finding a resort to escape to for your vacation, &quot;Hawaii Handbook&quot; may have too much information for you. Reading this book will allow and encourage travelers to get the most out of Hawaii's fantastically diverse offerings. You beach bums may discover that you are missing out on a great deal, and end up spending a lot less time sunning by the surf!"},{"Title":"Hawaii Handbook: The All-Island Guide (4th ed)","review":"I bought the Hawaii Handbook before my first trip to Hawaii in 1996. I found the accomodation, restaurant and general information invaluable. The feature I appreciated the most, however, was the the historical background given for Hawaii in general and for each island in particular. We stayed mostly on the island of Hawaii and had a memorable time. Knowing something about the history and geography of the island deepened our experience considerably."},{"Title":"The cult of Loving Kindness","review":"It is a pity that this work, like the previous two installments of the Starbridge Chronicles (Soldiers of Paradise and Sugar Rain), is now out of print, because it is certainly one of the most interesting fantasy experiments to be published in the past several years. Set in the distant future, in a time where environmental degradation has caused seasons to last for years, a phenomenon which has caused the fabric of society to disintigrate, the story synchronizes elements of mysticism, magic and prophecy. At the same time, the trilogy offers startling psychological insight into such areas as mass hysteria, human sexuality, addiction, and religious longings. Park in the Starbridge Chronicles has created a vivid, horrific world that, for all of its Boschian strangeness, convincingly portrays the landscape of the unbridled unconscious. I highly recommend these works to anyone, but in particular to readers of Gene Wolfe, Jack Vance, Frank Herbert, and Fritz Leiber."},{"Title":"The cult of Loving Kindness","review":"The first two books in the series are distinctly excellent and compelling science fiction. Not sure what happened here - this book is frustratingly aimless. Mr. Park's writing remains very good, but not good enough to make this nearly plotless book readable."},{"Title":"The cult of Loving Kindness","review":"Lest readers be confused by some of the reviews, this series is *not* set on Earth, nor are the characters human.It is set on a world that in many ways is Earthlike, but in others is not, and that difference has much to do with the nature of the societies that have evolved there. The characters are of a race that is in many ways remarkably human, both physically and mentally, but not *quite* so (for instance, they have prehensile tails, and--apparently--certain mental powers much akin to magic).The chief setting difference is that all the worlds in this solar system have extremely eccentric orbits, such that an \\"Earth\\" year is roughly 80,000 days long (about 219 Earth years). Moreover, there is, besides the nine orbital planets, another that is captured as a temporary moon by each of them in turn over time. That planet has become the keystone in their religion as \\"Paradise\\", considered the true home of humans, all the others, including \\"Earth\\", being seen as Hells of one degree or another. In consequence, their society is based on the acceptance of suffering and of sharply divided castes ruled over by a divinely ordained and omnipotent aristocracy.The series is well written and interesting, with a complex and interesting world setting, though it seems rather episodic and somewhat meandering. But it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Option Pricing: Mathematical Models and Computation","review":"This book is excelent. Style is very practical, very readable. Not only formulas are derived, but also mathematical ideas behind are explained. The book is very result-oriented, i.e. after reading it you will know some math methods.

Piecing together the William Joyce story from Public Record office archives an absorbing melange is created of a man drawn to violence, spirited to treason, and gifted with a perverse talent behind the radio microphone.Fascinatingly, Martland spends a time describing the problems the British faced in bringing Joyce to the gallows for treason after the war. Did a born American-born man owe allegiance to the Crown in the first place? The tortured legal arguments on whether an alien could owe the King a loyal duty and the weight the security services placed on these worries is brought to the fore in Martland's writings. Without giving the game away, the shear effort a bankrupt British state made in gathering the necessary evidence in order to swat this ultimately pathetic figure strikes the reader.And of Joyce's early life, the roots of Joyce's fascism beam through. Intellectually formidable, attracted by Mosley's shameless rhetoric, Joyce saw in Nazism an apt refuge for his anti-Semitic beliefs, and the institutionalization of the pub violence that permeated his life. Shunted from New York, to Ireland, to England, this is the tale of a wanderer whose Road to Damascus became a short stroll to a Berlin radio studio.There are glimpses into the anxiety of the British government during the first couple of years of Joyce's broadcasts. To be sure, many saw him, with that odd, clipped, parvenu accent, as more of a comic than a Josef Goebbels, but nonetheless this was a radioman heard widely over the whole of England ; akin to today, any media coverage was good media coverage.As the Nazi state crumbled, the sad last months of Joyce's employment in Germany are recorded in detail by Martland. Ever the Hitler believer, a rambling, drunken fool, gabbing into the microphone was what the end of the Reich did to Joyce. I like this part of the narrative, Joyce and precocious wife running from radio studio to radio studio always the transmitting sheep for the fast decaying Germany.This new series from the National Archives, as the dusty Public Record Office has been rechristened, is formidable in that each title has half a book full of documents from the actual files kept. In Joyce's case the lame points of appeal in his trial for treason are printed ; so too is a spurious note bysome soldiers in liberated Europe on how Joyce accidentally happened to be shot when fleeing after the war.Odious characters always excite. More so when they are dangerously formidable speakers, even if their crackpot ideas are laughable. More so when as intellectuals they leave democratic nations to find a hoped for comfort in the Berlin of 1939. I left this book with a fecund pity for William Joyce, Lord Haw-Haw. The Irish immigrant attempting to be a patrician ; the self-taught masterly student attracted by the Mosley din ; the sneering womanizer charming in person, plain nasty in the airwaves.Lord Haw-Haw is fantastic reading for those with an interest in betrayers, in espionage, and for those who want a distilled, non-pretentious, crystallized narrative of this complex figure. Refreshing in its clear style, accommodating to the plain curious, as I was, Martland in this project has done a fine job."},{"Title":"Review of Ophthalmology: Expert Consult - Online and Print, 1e","review":"I used this book for my ABO recertification test.

Also, the chapters on JavaScript were informative.On the down side, why would anyone write an XHTML book w/ out concentration on cross-browser functionality? Many of the examples were solutions for just IE or for just Netscape. The whole point of validated XHTML is to reach the widest possible audience which means coding to a defined standard; browser specific code is mostly pointless. Also, as someone mentioned, the use of deprecated tags in examples caused me to be wary of the code throughout the whole book. Finally, why wait till page 503 to cover CSS? That should have been demonstrated early on to discourage the use of inline formatting within pages. And the CSS coverage, a chapter crucial to web development (ie, separation of data and presentation), was weak.I guess for someone starting out it's ok to use this as a guide. But I urge anyone reading this book to avoid the use of deprecated tags or your web pages will render different ways in difft browsers."},{"Title":"XHTML Black Book: A Complete Guide to Mastering XHTML","review":"I bought this book as a beginner, wanting to learn the basics of Dynamic HTML and mission accomplished!

Unfortunately, the endless padding just makes information retrieval extremely slow. Not content to show us bits of code to illustrate particular points, Holzner gives us complete pages of irrelevent mark-up almost every time. Rather than using a tabular approach to show what elements can be used with each tag, the author dribbles through the entire descriptive list in every chapter. The cardinal sin, though, is Holzners repeated use of depricated elements and tags in his illustrations. Surely a book on XHTML should show the XHTML way of doing things rather than harking back to earlier standards. Yes, I know the tags still work in most cases, but they won't for much longer and there is ALWAYS an alternative approved XHTML way of doing things. The book is also very poorly designed: symbols for the various browsers and W3C standards would have made things much clearer.

Mark Joseph loves rock music and has some great insights and biographical gems on the bands (some famous, some less well-known). As a result of reading this book I think I added about 10 albums to my wish list.Joseph's central thesis is also well-argued: Christian musicians are better off remaining in the mainstream of teh musical culture, rather than allowing themslves to be exiled to the ghetto of \\"Christian music.\\" Once they are labeled CCM, they lose most of their potential aduience, they lose the freedoms to be creative, and they are now subject to the whims of a sub-culture that is even more banal and artless than that of secular pop music. Joseph makes a good case for this.Baker has packaged the book decently enough too, though it suffers from a lack of an index.Where this book disappointed me:1. The writing. While at times Joseph shows the ability to soar, most of the time its pretty cliched and workmanlike. His style on its own did not keep you reading.2. At times Joseph is just as one-dimensional as the fundamentalists he (rightly) critiques. For example, his loyalty to rock is such that he is unable to serious grapple with critiques like those of folsk like Charles Colson or Nancy Pearcey, who wonder whether the music's style inherantly appeals to the emotions over reason and thus has some limitations. Joseph seems incapable of both loving the music and at the same time acknowledging its potential weaknesses.Another example of this -- Joseph is eager to defend certain musicians' right (against ham-handed fundy's condemnations) to be less than orthodox and ask questions in their music. But can he not do that while also critiquing their theology. So Joseph will celebrate such-and-such musicians' proclamation that the God they celebrate in their songs is not the Christian God or a Muslim god or any other god, but the 'god I see when I look in my child's eyes, the god of nature...' It seems to me that Joseph is not taking these bands seriously enough in sometimes being uncritically affirming of all they say and do.Anyway, this was an enjoyable, thought-provoking read, even though I found it a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Faith, God and Rock & Roll: How People of Faith Are Transforming American Popular Music","review":"Mark Joseph wrote a book with one point in mind: Christians, particularly in the music world, should be salt and light to the world, rather than insulating themselves in the church/Christian realm. He has included brief biographies of many well known musicians - U2, Alice Cooper, Lenny Kravitz, Lifehouse, Jars of Clay, Gary Cherone (of Extreme and Van Halen fame), Lauryn Hill, and more, to show us that it is possible, even desirable, for Christian musicians to infuse the popular culture with subtle messages of hope and love. I enjoyed reading all these profiles, which included many musicians' views on faith. However, I have a few objections to the book.1) The thesis, while in part true, ignores one major consideration. Just as in the church, there needs to be preaching (witnessing/introduction of the gospel) and teaching (education for those who already believe), so too is there a need for Christian musicians in the secular realm, and others to remain in the \\"CCM\\" world. Joseph seems to be criticizing musicians for not venturing out into the world, and being satisfied with the bubble they are living in. I, however, applaud musicians who recognize the need to minister to those who already believe, and remain in the CCM (Contemporary Christian Music) scene.2) As far as writing itself goes, Mark Joseph is average, at best. I did not want to keep on reading because of the writing style, but rather because of the musicians he featured towards the end (Dashboard Confessional and U2, to name a few). I tolerated the chapters that focused on musicians I didn't know, simply because I wanted to be more informed. I was sorely tempted to just skip them over, though.Anyways, this book is not anyone's attempt at Pulitzer Prize-winning literature. Joseph is writing this because of his love of rock music, and as a gift to others who love it like he does. Definitely an enjoyable read, though it does not necessary merit a second perusing."},{"Title":"Faith, God and Rock & Roll: How People of Faith Are Transforming American Popular Music","review":"As far as I can tell, this is the same book as Faith, God, and Rock and Roll, just a later edition by a different publisher with a different cover. Baker Books added the subtitle and dropped the tatoo cover in favor of this more nondescript one for its 2004 printing. But it leads to mix-ups, and in some Amazon ads, they seem to be two different books, even being sold together for a special price. (So get one or the other version, but not both).This book is a follow-up to Mark Joseph's The Rock and Roll Rebellion (which also had a long subtitle), which profiled a number of artists to make the point that they'd be better off staying in the musical mainstream rather than getting shuttled off with the misleading label of &quot;Christian Rock&quot; artists, a nearly universally derided term, or even worse, &quot;Contemporary Christian Musicians&quot; or CCM for short, named, again misleadingly, for a magazine called CCM.That thesis also underscores Mark Allen Powell's Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Christian Music, which is similarly critical of the CCM subculture. The point is more obvious in Powell's original title, Parallel Worlds, A Critical View of Popular Christian Music (which was changed by the publisher to the present title which implies uncritical acceptance of this &quot;parallel world.&quot;Both books share their thesis with another book that wasn't primarily about music at all, Bob Briner's Roaring Lambs. In one way, these three books hook together. Joseph was both inspired and encouraged by Briner, and rather than bemoaning the sad cul de sac in which many artists find themselves, Powell in his book is bringing these artists' achievements out for assessment in the common light of day. Both Joseph and Powell are effectively treading new ground: not only acquainting us with &quot;new&quot; artists and music we may have missed, but at the same time giving us great rock writing."},{"Title":"Faith, God and Rock & Roll: How People of Faith Are Transforming American Popular Music","review":"It was pretty good. I would also include more even testimony of failure, for this reason. If you paint a picture that everything is perfect, and leave out what is not, you could be seen as being willing to omit details to make your point. This is a flaw that is recognizable in different cults. But, if you lay out everything exactly as it is, it is much more difficult to deny that there is something of value in the testimony of the ones who were successful in living for Christ. Like, the Bible includes Saul, Judas and Demas, alongside Peter, Paul and David. But, insdead of Saul and Judas and Demas discrediting God, they prove the value of what Peter, Paul and David really had in God."},{"Title":"Faith, God and Rock & Roll: How People of Faith Are Transforming American Popular Music","review":"Mark Joseph excels as a writer!

Dr. Sharon Flitterman King has a doctorate from the University of California, the Berkeley campus, and so does her identical twin sister, Dr. Sandy Fliterrman Lewis, who is also an author. Sharon's debut novel is readable, delightful, and worth the purchase. It has everything but the author's signature. Anyway, it is about 100 pages about a family and it's root to the Holocaust. I am proud that somebody can be published without the politics of the whole publishing industry. Sharon adds in drawings of her own all over the text.

She wasn't into it. But a few nights later, my husband read it to her, and came downstairs proclaiming the book a \\"miracle.\\" He said she became sleepier and sleepier as the book went on, with its rythmic soothing words, describing how everything from birds to sailboats to children go to sleep. Our daughter fell asleep in his lap. I then read it to her as her last book the next night, and she was perfectly happy to go \\"sleepy sleep\\" (as we call it) right afterwards. We use this as the \\"last book\\" of the night, interchangeably with Goodnight Moon, Prayer for a Child, and a few others that have a \\"goodnight\\" theme.

While she loved all the Margaret Wise Brown books, as they came out, this always remained the favorite. It must be in the genes, because the two oldest grandchildren, now out of college, loved it the best, too. And now, the third grandchild, a 5-year-old, is reading it to herself at night! Oddly, while one can find \\"Good Night Moon\\" in any book store, \\"A Child's Goodnight Book\\" is never there. Until Amazon, I always had to order it from the publisher.

If you are Christian then this might be fine, perhaps ideal, but we do not practice religion in our home so I was a bit put off.

I even sent the company this testimonial to use as they wish because I feel that strongly about how well designed the course is and how well the method has worked for me.What I like:1. The pace. Not too fast. Not too slow.2. The material. Very useful everyday stuff. The basics.3. The native speaker's voice. Ana's voice is super clear and she talks slowly so I can get the accent right.4. The American instructor. Sometimes humerous, sometimes serious, always informative and never humble (but he seems like a nice guy).5. The method. This is the best part. Nobody I have tried (including private instruction at Berlitz) beats this technique for getting you to speak basic Italian from the get-go.6. The price.. Worth much more because it works.What I don't like:1. No wriitten material.. I realize that this is a car course but I would have liked a tapescript or something. No biggie but ......All in all, a great course and an even better method than you'll find anywhere (at least that has been my experience)."},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"If you want to learn a lot of practical Italian fast and enjoy the process, I recommend you buy 'Behind the Wheel Italian'.I consider myself a bit of a language 'aficionado'. My hobby is to go around to bookstores and to surf the internet finding great deals on foreign language courses.I travel frequently for business and pleasure and have a great deal of contact with speakers of languages other than English.I have tried many methods including but not limited to Pimsleur, Living Language, Rosetta Stone, Berlitz and Learn in Your Car and I have NOTHING negative to say about any of them. All have their place. All are good courses in their own right.That said, I now go on to say that I have tried one particular method and courses in Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese that I DO consider to be the BEST. It is Language Dynamics. My reasons for this excellent opinion are as follows:1. This is clearly a niche or non-traditional approach. It didn't go through a traditional testwith a publishing company which probably would have wiped out most of its charm and effectiveness.2. The creators of these products clearly had one thing in mind when they created them.Simplicity. They saw things through the eyes of the 'language learner' and not the 'language teacher'. In other words, it is obvious that the producers emphathize with their students, know their fears, understand their needs.3. Since the students confusion and fear was foremost in their minds, they intentionally developed products that compensated for those fears, encouraged, gave tips, provided review and English. All sorts of help coming at you from all sides.Since you feel supported from all sides, since the instruction is clear and in English then in the foreign language with a native speaker, you learn quickly.The part I most like about this approach which is present in every course I have tried is the simple sentence building. I mean, even in Chinese I learned how to speak meaningful and original sentences right away. As anyone can tell you, this is not an easy feat to accomplish and Language Dynamics did it. That's why they are the best."},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"Behind the Wheel Italian is heads and tails above Michel Thomas and Berlitz. These types of courses are everywhere and I have returned them to Barnes and Noble many times.In my opinion, most people like me never even learn to speak Italian because most of the methods out there assume you know something already. This course took me from zip, squat, nada to being able to carry on a conversation in Italian. For $59.00 bucks and some change, that is a heck on an accomplishment.I am not arrogant when in comes to learning foreign languages and I know that a lot of folks like me worry about even being able to someday speak a foreign language.I loved the fact that the designers of this course actually cared enough about how people like me feel to make this course such a dream to use.

It's a bit strange that there are NO instructions as to how to actually do the lessons (i.e. are we supposed to repeat once and then say it with the Italian person?). I would have appreciated one piece of paper with basic instructions. Also it's hard to learn the language without seeing it in writing (what will I do when I see it written in Italy?) but overall, the Italian speaker is very clear and speaks at a slow pace, and the English speaker sounds like he's a computer talking, but I think it's a good course. I'm going to complement it with the \\"Italian for Dummies\\" book to help me along. It's difficult to drive in LA while learning a language (or maybe the other way around). I like it though.

That's when a friend recommended 'Behind the Wheel Italian' to me. I bought the course and I'm glad I did.The approach is truly original and very effective at teaching you to speak and understand Italian. Nobody else even comes close to this.

They start out with basic words and phrases such as 'Where' or 'How' and then evolve to How much is this? How many are there... .Where is the bathroom.? 'Waiter, the check please.' etc ... The course is excellent at building off of previous material. I have managed to learn to speak a great deal of Italian while tied up in traffic and even at the gym or while jogging. Now I can say 'The menu please' and 'Where is the train station'. and understand the answers when they're given to me. Even more important, I can express my personal likes and dislikes and carry on basic conversations in Italian.

It is obvious that it is professionally produced because much of it was recorded in 1993 when digital computer recording was not available for the most part. I bought my first Language Dynamics Italian course in 1993, it was cassetteof course and the label gave the name of the studio in which it was recorded.Once again, the package (which is innocent because it is excellent) is attacked and the content (which is outstanding) is ignored.Now, on to the content.

One of the &quot;good&quot; discs had 54 seconds of dead air space at the beginning of the disc. A good portion of the discs (too much actually) concentrates on counting. Many references are out of date and irrelevant (how you convert from Francs to Lira? who cares, - there are no more Francs or lira....) Mr. Frobose discusses a few examples of words that have similar roots and sounds in Italian and English as a way to accelerate the learning of many words.

Far from being a simple 'listen and repeat' language course, Behind the Wheel courses use a dynamic 'sentence building' technique.2. The basis of this technique is not simply random words but rather 'high frequency vocabulary' which are words which are used most frequently in any language. In this case, Italian.3. To these frequent words and 'modal' or mood verbs such as 'I want' 'I like'and so forth, the course proceeds to build the listeners' ability to form original yet simple sentences which later form a foundation for future communication in the language.All of the material I reviewed in a number of Behind the Wheel courses can be immediately applied to effectively communicate in the target language.This happens not by accident but by the intentional and intelligent design of the course by its developers.Faith Pierce/Ph.D. Candidate/Applied Linguistics"},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"I learned Chinese (Mandarin) this way back in college (1960s) and can still speak it pretty well. For me the repetitive pattern build-up and vocabulary drill method really works.

Suggerisco questo CD per chiunque che desidera imparare la lingua italiana."},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"This 6 CD set will undoubtedly funnel the italian language into your head. Even when you've got your eyes on the road and you are only half-listening to the discs, you can't help but pick up some of the language. Best results are achieved through repetition. It really helps to repeat out loud with the native Italian speaker on the discs. I feel very confident about my ability to speak very basic Italian.The reason I gave this product 4-stars as opposed to five is that you don't have the ability to skip from track to track. An entire CD is one track - all 60 minutes of it. So, if you want to skip to a particular section of the disc, you've got to fast forward. It's very inconvenient. In addition, many of the CD's have redundancies. For example, the narrator will teach you to count on disc one. Then, he'll do it again midway through disc two. If I want to re-learn numbers, I'll just re-listen to disc one! Again, a minor annoyance.Overall, this is a great product for learning the italian language.

The course starts with a handful of basic verbs that can be combined to form a wide array of sentences (e.g. &quot;I want to sleep&quot; and &quot;She can't talk on the phone&quot;) and then expands to include useful phrases, numbers, days of the week, etc. By the end of the course you'll own more complex phrases such as &quot;I brought three big suitcases full of clothes just for this vacation.&quot;The narrator and Italian speaker are very clear and the lessons progress at the perfect pace, including moderate introduction of new material as well as periodic repitition of words and phrases previously learned. The method requires very little effort -- simply repeat along with the CD and before you know it you're rattling off Italian sentences naturally.Unfortunately the CDs are not broken into separate tracks, which makes it more difficult to return to where you left off. Also, you'll want to obtain a book on Italian to develop at least a basic foundation for reading and writing the words you learn. That said, Behind The Wheel Italian is a great way to go -- time and money well spent."},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"I listened to all 6 CDs over a month period and I was taught very little. The vocabulary is limited and repetitive. The lessons contain useless dialogue regarding exchanging lira to francs (hello euro) and cashing a check at a bank presumably while you are in Italy. It contains about 30 minutes of anything interesting or insightful. There is no explanation for the use and/or conjugation of several verbs. Way too much time spent on numbers. The CDs are produced in a very low-budget way...the Italian speaker is recorded and inserted as necessary, even to build sentences! It sounds robotic. In fact, when Frobose says \\"one hundred one\\" the Italian (Anna) says \\"cento due\\". Frobose also asks Anna \\"how do you say_____in Italian?\\" too much. I never expected a response in Chinese on a learn Italian CD. And the sixth CD is a total waste of time. You get two minutes of new material and five minutes of Frobose getting philosphical(in English). Quanto costa? Troppo! Price is nowhere near reasonable for this. Dio mio! Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Behind the Wheel Italian (6 CD Course) (Italian Edition)","review":"Two weeks ago, at the behest of my friend Robert who travels frequently to Italy, I reluctantly purchased Behind the Wheel Italian.What a surprise. A small name in the foreign language business comes up with the best method and course. From beginning to end, this course, in an interested way, takes you from zip to conversational in Italian without having to guess. Everything is included on the CDs which makes this perfect for the car or gym. The English speaker gives you the English once, and Anna (the native Italian speaker) gives you the Italian twice. Most important of all, this unique approach to language learning gets you speaking your own original sentences so that you can really speak the language, not just parrot a bunch of incomprehensible jibberish.Congratulations to Language Dynamics, the small company, for having the creativity and innovation to make the best basic Italian language course on the market."},{"Title":"Horror, Science Fiction, and Fantasy Movie Posters (Horror, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Movie Posters)","review":"I was hoping for larger photos, maybe even larger pages, but there is a fine representation of movie posters in this book."},{"Title":"Horror, Science Fiction, and Fantasy Movie Posters (Horror, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Movie Posters)","review":"Being a fan of the B grade movies that get shown in the annual Incredibly Strange Film Festival, this book was an obvious purchase and I wasn't disappointed. There is a feast of all that's good and bad about these movie genres. The reproduction is superb and the selection thoughtful. My only criticism is that there is no logic and probably only the author's personal preference as to how big or small each poster gets presented - on some pages there is only one poster, on others there are 5 - I would have preferred one per page, but I guess that would have more than doubled the price. I only hope that there will be a second volume soon!"},{"Title":"Horror, Science Fiction, and Fantasy Movie Posters (Horror, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Movie Posters)","review":"Bruce Hershenson has managed over several books to enlighten many of us who are involvred in collecting movie posters. From his Crime Movie Posters, Horror Movie Posters,Academy award winners and a whole rope let alone string in his ever increasing catalogue we are able to gain great reference for the discerning collector. Also for those who perhaps cannot afford to invest into some great titles Hershenson has enabled those with a tight budget to appreciate the poster art from the twentieth century at a very reasonable cost.The content is laid out in a similar fashion to his previous books starting with early titles from the silent era, Homer's Odyssey 1909 right up to 1999's Sleepy Hollow, covering a multitude of titles, actors and actresses and subjects all coming under the heading of Horror, Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Such recognisable titles as Dracula, Batman and Raiders of the Lost Ark to lesser known titles such as Phantom From Space and The Green Pastures with an image to cover each year.The quality is very high with great colour on all the pages and at such a reasonable price this is truly a bargain, for a collector, a fan, a movie buff or just someone who likes to sit and watch a late night movie this is an excellent buy.Perhaps the only critcism for any of these books is the lack of text on the artists that produced the great artwork. A history on the film is all well and good and has probably been produced elsewhere, even if it is in Halliwell's but for the poster the artist is the all important person. It would be nice to know to whom the credit should go for such evocative art work. An impossible task perhaps, although if there were only a dozen images explained then this and all of Bruce Hershenson's book's would receive 5 stars and two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Color Printer Idea Book : 40 Really Cool and Useful Projects to Make with Any Color Printer!","review":"A beginning crafter with little computer experience will probably really enjoy this book.

It is well written and superbly organized making it easy to follow and fun to read. Kay covers the topic of color printers from start to finish describing different types of printers and gives tips on buying printers, along with printer accessories like ink cartridges. Next she covers materials needed for creating projects, different crafting techniques, software to be used in conjunction with a color printer and finally the piece de resistance--the projects themselves. Projects range from printing paper items such as cards, bookmarks, calendars, to printing on fabric and fabric transfers to make aprons, t-shirts, pillows, faux embroidery etc. She even has instructions for printing your own paperback book! All of the projects in Kay's books are &quot;do-able&quot; by even the most inexperienced computer novices since she utilizes templates already in existence from various computer crafting software programs like Print Artist, MS Publisher, Hane t-shirt maker etc. This is unlike other desk top publishing books where you have to create your own templates making it problematic for novices and experience users alike. At the end of the book she gives advice on how to sell what you make and lists all the materials needed for the projects in her book, suppliers, references and websites that may be helpful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a practical and possibly lucrative use from their computer and color printer other than printing ordinary, everyday documents.

Once again Belva Plain brings forth, with beautiful detail, the complexities of life.This book tells not only the story of three generations of doctors, but it is mainly the story of human souls. Whether you are a doctor or a painter, a decorator, or simply a housewife, you suffer and you rejoice with everything that life brings to you.Belva Plain makes us understand, through her characters, that nothing in life is simple and straight. Or, black and white. But rather a web of events that moves us back and forth.Great book and good read."},{"Title":"Random Winds","review":"Random Winds tells the story of one man's life, a doctor whose passionate love for another man's wife threatens the very foundations of his existance. This is one of those impossibly romantic novels one curls up with on a rainy day.

He becomes interested in brain surgery but to be able to afford to train as such, agrees to marry Jessie, the crippled sister of Fern, the woman he has always loved. The girls' wealthy father realizes that this is the only way that Jessie will be married and safe after his death and convinces Martin that this is the only path to his dream of becoming a top brain surgeon. They have a daughter, Claire, a pretty and clever girl who is set to follow in her father's footsteps. Martin and Jessie divorce after bitter fighting and Martin marries Hazel, a homely but good woman who gives him three more children. Martin's professional career grows and develops but he can't forget his love for Fern and this love, though never mentioned, eventually sours his marriage. Claire does become a doctor but prefers a practice more like that of her grandfather with closer contact with her patients. There are many dramas interwoven through this story of three generations of doctors with their personal loves and tragedies, and I found this to be one of those big, cosy reads which are just right when one is in the mood for it."},{"Title":"Random Winds","review":"All the things Dr. Martin Farrell endured in the last century still make headlines today: malpractice lawsuits, a bitter divorce, aging parents, an unhappy marriage, adultery. Not to mention the medical politics that cost Dr. Farrell the leadership of his own institute.Fresh out of medical school, Martin's plan to go abroad for further study is shelved when his father becomes ill. The elder Dr. Farrell expects Martin to take over his country practice, not realizing his son wants to become a neurologist. When Martin's father dies, leaving him as his mother's sole support, Martin fears he will never realize his dream.Jessie Meigs, daughter of a wealthy manufacturer, has spent most of her life as an object of pity due to scolliosis. Disregarding Martin's love for her sister, Jessie conspires with her father to pay for Martin's advanced medical training, in exchange for marriage.Their daughter, Claire, brings them great joy. But Martin's affair with his married sister-in-law costs him his wife and daughter. Lonely and unhappy, Martin is a sitting duck for nurse Hazel's warmth and domesticity. They marry and start a family.As World War II looms on the horizon, Martin's two families meet. Claire is quickly accepted by her stepmother and half-siblings. But once more, Martin is unable to resist a fling with his sister-in-law. The Farrell family is nearly destroyed by a double tragedy."},{"Title":"Random Winds","review":"Once again, a fabulous read! Ms. Plain's choice of words, timing, descriptions, characters, plot create a book like no other. Truthfully, I feel that way about all of her books and every time I reluctantly finish reading, what I consider an all too short story, I'm repeating her praise.The Doctors Farrell, father and daughter and grandfather are complex people. Pathetic Hazel and once pathetic, Jesse, the intriguing Mary Fern and all of the other characters are well thought out and hold your attention throughtout the story. You end up feeling like you've been an integral part of each and every character's life with it's successes, failures, heartache, disappointments, etc. Shouldn't a great novel involve the reader in more ways than one?

I would recommend this book to anyone especially women."},{"Title":"Random Winds","review":"My comments apply only to the quality of this Kindle edition of Belva Plain's Random Winds. This author's remarkable talent for writing has been violated by an obvious lack of proofreading by whoever put out this edition. I am 30% of the way through the novel, which I own in hardcover and read years ago, and I have found page after page of examples of missing punctuation, misspelled words (leaving a reader to guess what that word might be) and lack of capital letters where needed--just silly, annoying little mistakes that interrupt the flow of the actual work of the author.Really, it's just a shame. Perhaps it won't bother other readers, but as someone who knows this author and appreciates her work, it is annoying and the responsible parties should be embarrassed.

From the very beginning the reader submits to her way of seeing and laughs about the flatness of all other characters around her. My favorite example: When Goldie is making up her eyes Eva's comment brought tears to my eyes so hard I had to laugh. Two thumbs up for the first STRONG literary heroine!!! Men around her become awfully ridiculous and short-sighted and women robots of female socialisation. Anna Lee was already an astounding character but Eva is really on top!The (female) world has been desperately waiting for Eva Wylie...Thank you so much, Liza Cody!!!"},{"Title":"Bucket Nut","review":"Eva Wylie is a wrestler with ambitions of becoming a World Champion. She lives in a trailer as a security guard in a spare parts yard with two vicious guard dogs. She has very definite ideas about all aspects of life and if you don't agree with them, well, you can just sod off.This was an extremely interesting book for a couple of reasons. The first is that the protagonist is not your usual likable character who wins us over despite a couple of flaws. She actually challenges us, time and again over decisions she's made and thoughts she's had. She's abrasive, rude and continually \\"narked\\", and for all of that you still feel yourself cheering for her. The second is her job, or jobs actually, a wrestler, a part-time security guard, a part-time courier for a shady character and a part-time bouncer. There's never a dull moment when Eva's around.Bucket Nut is the first of only three books in the Eva Wylie series, a bittersweet fact. Only 3 books in the series will have me wishing there were more, but I'm pleased to have the other 2 books ahead of me. This is definitely one of those books that leave you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Bucket Nut","review":"This is a fabulous, wonderful book. A completely different protagonist and a first-person story which is hilarious and tragic in turns - the more moving because Eva Wylie doesn't ask for sympathy and isn't even aware she might inspire it. It's not often I bother to read crime novels twice, but there's so much in this I know I'll be reading it a third, and a fourth ..."},{"Title":"Bucket Nut","review":"Liza Cody has created an unforgettable character in Eva Wylie. She's as tough as the junk-yard dogs she lives with in her trailer. She's funny too, and vunlnerable and her life is a glimpse into a world most of us would not care to inhabit. But, another visit to her world would be looked foreward to with anticipation. Come back, Bucket Nut! We love you!"},{"Title":"Bucket Nut","review":"Although this book didn't feel at all like a mystery, I was pleasantly surprised to see a mystery writer create a unique character with so much depth. I often times felt very sorry for Eva's lot in life, but then I would recall that Eva certainly didn't feel sorry for herself, and she would probably tell me off for being so sappy. I thoroughly enjoyed Eva's perspective of life and her way with words. It's been a while since I met such a colorful character.As I stated, I have a problem with the &quot;mystery&quot; categorization. I was reminded more of &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; and &quot;Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man&quot; than any mystery I've ever read. I was more caught up in Eva's affording to fix her teeth and winning her wrestling match than her fairly passive quest for her sister and her attempt to get herself out of her latest fix. I look forward to reading the next installment. I applaud Eva Cody's rich character."},{"Title":"Bucket Nut","review":"I got hooked as soon as I picked up the book and was pleasantly surprised. It was very good and kept me reading, not wanting to put it down.

For the most part, the book was successful in teaching me the concepts and relevant objects. One of the good points was the ease of use and reference of the book - it's nice to have each chapter solely devoted to each ADO object. There is also a very interesting performance study that is probably alone worth the price of the book - very useful.Now, complaints. As others have said, although the cover and intro text may indicate you can use this book as is with many languages, this is not the case. The authors show very brief examples in one of the leading chapters on C++, J++, and other more advanced languages, and then proceed to VB/VBScript for the rest of the book. If you aren't using these two languages, I'd suggest you look for a book IN ADDITION to this one.Overall, an excellent book, especially for the price. I was able to get ADO working with a simple Access database in no time after reading it. Also, for those who bother to look at the examples on the Wrox site, they work well and provide all the source."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"This book is useless as a C++ reference. The front cover says that it &quot;Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP&quot;What a load of bunk. There is very very little C++ and I could not look at myself in the mirror if I would have made that claim."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"All the references to ADO is at your finger tips. A very handy book to have on your shelve."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"I cannot recommend this book enough. It is actually a joy to read - a reference book - imagine that! It contains everything I needed/wanted to know plus a whole lot more. It is the book that Microsoft should have shipped as their own."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"As the title suggests, it is a reference to the features in ADO, but the authors have done a good job of presenting a primer of ADO's more useful features. I was disoriented at first by how reference material was weaved together with extended textual explanations of concepts, but the format works. I ended up reading most of the book cover to cover rather than just looking up topics that interested me. And an extensive index goes a long way in making the material accessible for reference. Most of the code snippets are in VB or VBScript, but the authors used pseudocode a lot, so developers using any language will find the material helpful.The Introduction and first chapter take about 25 pages to give an overview of ADO. If you're new to database programming and ADO, I wouldn't start here; there just isn't enough to get you up to speed. But if you have a couple of database apps under your belt, this section serves as a good refresher and introduction to what's new in version 2.0.The next five chapters cover the ADO object model, each of the main objects, and the various collections, all in a fair bit of detail. The lists, tables, and technical detail got to be a bit tedious, but programmer's reference guides aren't meant to be riveting reading. These chapters serve as a good reference guide to the ADO architecture.The last three chapters are worth their weight in gold. Chapter 7 gives a good overview of remote data access and ADO. I was disappointed that ADO MD (multidimensional) received nary a mention, but otherwise the material is surprisingly up to date, such as by mentioning XML several times. Chapter 8, Data Shaping and Recordsets, is a gem. I suspect that relatively few developers have worked with data shapes yet, even with the data environment features of VB 6.0. And chapter 9 provides plenty of information about tuning your application's ADO performance.While I consider this book to be a mandatory addition to any Windows database programmer's library, it has a few annoying flaws. For one, it could have stood one more careful edit to catch typos and grammatical slips. The authors take on a patronizing tone at times, patting readers on the head. And there are ads for other Wrox Press titles scattered throughout the text, disguised as helpful notes about where to go for more information.Nevertheless, I'm glad to have this book at my elbow as I tackle data access with ADO. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"Good in depth reference on the ADO object model, but nothing new provided on MSDN CDs except for one topic - the performance analysis.

I have been developing asp database applications using ado for over a year, and this book is the reference I turn to the most.

This chapter does not only cover RDO but also XML and was for me a very good first look on these technologies.The books also takes up Stored procedures, Datashaping(Herarchial recordsets) and how/when to use them in your applications.As a finishing touch of this excellent book from Wrox Press there is a chapter on performance when opening and closing recordsets, using sql text questions or stored procedures, when to use different types of cursors, cursorlocations locking shemes and much more..This is definitly the book to buy about ADO.Sincerely /Hans Sixh&ouml;j Microsoft Certified Solution Developer"},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"I used this book as an mean for learning ADO about one year a go.

I have read this book completely. I very much like the way the concepts are explained and discussed. I strongly recommend it to other readers.However, I did find some debatable assertions on following pages:Page#11 JDBC was designed by Microsoft.Page#14: DNA is a old, simple, open architecture strategy made up of ideas and suggestions.Page#15: MTS, IIS, ASP, COM,DCOM, COM+, Visual Basic, VC++, VJ++ are all open and very simple to use technologies.Author directly and/or indirectly tries to elevate readers confidence through these statements. As Alex has done a good job all over, I am not yet ready to flame him for these minor things."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"This is a must have book for anyone who needs to brake the bonds of bound controls, i.e. serious programmers. It is well organized and well written. It is not intended as an introduction to database oriented application programming, but a novice would have little problem understanding the ADO model. The authors are obviously experienced, professional programmers. The only problem with the book is that it is a little short on sample code. In fact, it is very short. But the Wrox WEB site has the sample code that most other publishers put on CD."},{"Title":"Ado 2.0 Programmer's Reference","review":"An alternative title could have been &quot;ADO 2.0 in a nutshell&quot;.It reads as though it was written by a serious ADO user for another ADO user.

Every book Wrox puts out seems to be in an area that Microsoft has left out documentation for.

I find the book has basically no fat. It gets straight to the nitty-gritty and is set up so that you can use it as a desk reference, flipping through to find key information when you need it. I have no 'real' database experience but ADO is the up and coming choice for database programming so I got this book. I wasn't disappointed. There is a rather good intro which I found useful -I don't have the background, and even though some of the later chapters are a bit advanced for my current level, the way they are set up it will be easy for me to look up any material as I need it. Those looking to learn about ADO will find this a great book. There is a sample chapter and all the examples from the book are available on the Wrox Web-Developer site.

It's an exciting, fast-paced story of a young boy (15) whose life abruptly changes and he's on his own. How he copes and keeps his past a secret while living with a farm family is a challenge for him, as he longs for things to be back as they were.I have re-read this book several times, most recently at age 64, and still found it as heart-warming and heart-wrenching as I did the first time. I, too, wish it would be re-released.The author, Eloise Jarvis McGraw, has written other fine books, including Mocassin Trail, which is another story of a young boy ripped from the life he knew and thrust into an alien situation."},{"Title":"Sawdust in His Shoes","review":"Wow! I could have written all of these reviews myself!! I also read this as a library book when a teen-ager. Over and over and over. I LOVED IT!! After I got married, and even after having children, I would go back and check it out again occasionally and enjoy the magic once more. I also considered 'losing' it and paying the replacement fine. Then came the very tragic day that I went back to the library to find that 'Sawdust in His Shoes' had become a collectible and was no longer available for checkout, but had been archived?! I was horrified! I shared my sorrow with my four younger sisters, and they very kindly went together and bought me my very own copy on ebay, which they presented to me at Christmas that year. I am quite endebted to my dear sisters for allowing me the privilege and joy of sharing this wonderfully magic story with my own children!A truly captivating tale of love, loss, family, enemies, friendship, kindness, unkindness, courage, trust, hope, people, animals, decisions, betrayal, forgiveness, and even a touch of romance. This is a story that boys, girls, men, and women will enjoy equally. You will laugh and cry - sometimes at the same time. One of the few books I have read that reaches deep into my heart and gives me a hug. This story should, indeed, be reprinted, as it is virtually impossible to find clean stories for teen-agers anymore."},{"Title":"Sawdust in His Shoes","review":"I still remember that hushed argument in the library, in which my mother assured me this was one of the best books ever. I was highly doubtful, because this book was not \\"my\\" genre. I had already discovered the great fantasy books of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Madeline L'Engle and was complaining about a summer with no GOOD books to read. Mother recommended this story of a lost young circus performer on the run from an orphanage and hiding with a generous farm family. My first thought was BORING! But I relented just to shut mom up. Now, 20 years later, I still check this book out of the same public library at least once or twice a year. I have been hoping to find my own copy and am hoping the renaissance of young readers that has seemed to spring up will get this book into reprint. It would be a shame to lose such wonderful story. I cheered, I cried, I didn't care that it was not fantasy."},{"Title":"Sawdust in His Shoes","review":"I can still remember going to the library as a child and checking out Sawdust in His Shoes. I have no idea how many times I read it, but I remember wishing I could keep it out long enough to type the book so I could keep it. Now I find it's available as a used, out-of-print edition that will be too costly for me for some time. When I can afford it, I will buy it. The story is about Joe, a rebellious teen, part of a family of equestrians at a circus, who is brought to a farm. I can no longer remember the storyline, except the farmwoman who wants to understand him, and make him feel part of the family, and her children he, in the beginning, has trouble relating to. In the end, it's a brown horse Joe trains to become a rosinback that provides him a way to return to the circus life. For me, it was a feel-good book to read, and I, like so many others, would wish it were printed again. This book would certainly be purchased by a great many bibliophiles who had read it and would love to read it again, or those who would like to experience it for the first time."},{"Title":"Sawdust in His Shoes","review":"Like the other reviewers, I read this as a child and adored it.

Written for younger readers, it does not patronize or preach, but respects young hearts and intelligence.

It is a WONDERFUL tale with many twists and turns, although it does start with a tragic death so it might not be good for younger kids. The behind the scenes description of circus life has always remained with me and I thought of this book whenever I took my kids to see one. I always wished that I could float up to the top of a horse like the main character! Joe 's foster mother 's idea for a costume to match his horse is my favorite part.

The Owyhee River slices through here and on the more-detailed maps you'll see a few places identified as towns such as Silver City, Idaho and Jordan Valley, Oregon. Calling them \\"towns\\" proves to be an exaggeration if you are one of the infrequent travelers passing this way.You won't find much reference to the Owyhee region in conventional books of Western history -- but a lot happened there. The two authors have compiled a regional history that is full of tales and forgotten history of a neglected region. For example, I had never realized that the Bannock and Paiute Indians fought a series of wars with the White settlers. These were the despised \\"Digger\\" Indians and yet they proved to be pretty formidable in battle.Moreover, the tales of the early miners, cattlemen, and sheepherders of the region are fascinating. Cattle to stock the region were driven all the way from Texas; Basques came from Spain to herd sheep; and Silver City briefly was one of the richest mines ever discovered. Even the story of how the region acquired its odd name is worthy of attention. Somehow, though, the Owyhee country didn't attract the mythmakers of the Old West.The authors have remedied the lack of attention to the Owyhee with a well-researched and fair-minded history that is illustrated with many photographs and enhanced by the the personal experiences of Owyhee native, Mike Hanley, the co-author. The prose, I thought, was a little rough at times, but the quality of the material and the research overcomes this defect. This is a good regional history.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Owyhee Trails The West's Forgotten Corner","review":"Being a fan of books about the area I live in and especilly the part of the state that I love to roam around in This book was a real read.

Keep it up Jodi!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Although it was definitely a book of fiction, there were parts that came very close to having me believe I was reading a research document.As with many other Picoult books I have read, she never lost my attention. So many different elements but she brought them together beautifully."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was excellent. I've enjoyed all of her books, but his one kept my interest on the edge, and I didn't want to put it down. Putting children first in a divorce situation is definitely something all parents need to consider. You will stop and think while reading this riveting storyline."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love the characters... the realism of the story! One minute you shed tears,the next you are angry, and then terrified because you can identify with the emotion and feeling of the story! EXCELlENT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"\\"Keeping Faith\\" was written in 1999 and one of the few books of hersthat I haven't read. It is about faith in a higher power and alsoabout Faith, a child, who knows nothing of God or religion but seemsto have an inside track. A very provocative book. I wouldrecommend it. Surely, it's food for thought along with being a good story."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The main characters had a challenging journey and it was interesting to see how the each one dealt with their faith and beliefs in themselves as well as others."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I DID NOT LIKE THE STORY LINE - IT SEEMED WAY OUT THERE AND DID NOT KEEP MY INTEREST. IT IS THE ONLY JODI PICCOULT BOOK I HAVE NOT ENJOYED"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I can always count on the author,Judith Picoult,to challenge me with a thought provoking topic,incorporated into a work of fiction, relevant for our times. This book was not my favorite of Judith Picoult's many books, but it was an enjoyable read and made me think more deeply about faith vs.reason, the possibility of miracles, and how life experiences influence our relationship with a higher power(God)."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Very sweet love story. Held my attention and wasn't quite sure how it would end. I hate being able to figure out the ending half way through the book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I didn't read this book. I downloaded it accidentally and erased it immediately.Consequently I have no idea of its content or plot and no opinion on its literary merit.I do, however, have an opinion on Amazon billing and charging me for an item i did not retain."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"First, I would like to say that I enjoyed the novel. While I was reading it, I wasn't sure that I was. I realize that is a strange thing to say, but I felt the book cast a sort of melancholy spell over me, which seemed to pull some of the enjoyment of reading it away.Having said that though, I finished the book in 2 days, so it obviously kept me coming back.What I found interesting is that there was very little \\"place\\" description. What the surroundings and the people looked like were a mystery to me. I do not mind forming my own opinion of a characters outward appearances, however I do dislike it when I am told halfway through the book defining characteristics that disrupt what I had created in my minds eye. That is the reason I gave the book 4 stars. If you are going to tell me that someone looks a certain way, tell me upfront so I am not surprised by the information halfway through the book.The story asks some important questions, and does so in a lyrical and beautiful way. The story is one of light, set against the darkness of depression and infidelity an divorce.If you are interested in spirituality, angels, god, all the big unanswered questions, I think you will appreciate this book. Do not look for answers however, because none are forthcoming, which is exactly how it should be."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"An enthralling story which combines an age old story with a very modern twist. The relationship between the hero and heroine is somewhat predictable and, therefore, lacks credibility but an enjoyable read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Well written with a natural flow. I enjoyed the ideas put forth in her story. I enjoy Jodi's well thought out arguments this story took."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read several Jodi Picoult books, and this one was good, but not the best. The characters were likeable, but the story line about the little girl being a stigmatic, and healing people, was pretty far fetched.

Jodi is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult always keeps you spellbound. A s usual you are intriqued to continue reading. Is the story a sham or the truth.

She's usually one of my favorite authors but this one pretty much lacking its okay but not one of her best"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Faith is everywhere even when you don't know you have it. Love of your mother is endless and strong and protective. Very Awesome story a must read to test your Faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult always gives us novels which reflect current events. I read her bosoks with long breaks between each because they are usually such sad stories."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. I am a Christian and it really had me questioning many things along the way. Agonizing over the little girls suffering so many times,but what a beautiful ending. I have talked about this book to my friends and have recomended that they read it'"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Like many of Picoult's books, the plot was engaging and the writting outstanding. Picoult brings many of the characters to life, all the while keeping the reader guessing who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. Loved it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was a interesting and fascinating book. Getting the view on all of the different religions on spiritual matters. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I forgot who wrote this book when I was reading it on my kindle and I was shocked at some of the things that were happening within the story ... as I was telling my husband and friend about the book they asked who the author was so I went to look, saw it was Jodi Picoult and was like OF COURSE it is!! Great story. I thought there were a few holes in the story line - I like to know why things happen and I didn't feel like the why was told."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"J. Picoult is a good read. She keeps you interested and gives you many points of view to consider. I find her books informative and thoughtful as well as a good story line."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Enjoyed the story--tear jerker, as usually. Author rarely disappoints!! Would recommend it to Jodi fans--hard to put down. Amon one of her best!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was one of Jodi Picoult's finest books.

I would recommend this book to all of my friends!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Loved the story line and the charectars, but I was a little disappointed at the ending. I wanted to reach out and hug this kid through the whole book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The story was compelling, but I didn't like the picture of G*d that was presented. I do think it truly portrayed the way some religious frenzies wreak havoc, and also how the medai disturbs lives, too."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was aboslutely a favorite read for meg, serious, close to reality for many people, and soberly written. Not one step over the line of soppy.

Very interesting story line and very thought provoking. Well written and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Great read! I absolutely love Jodi Picoult books, very enticing!

I have always liked this author and had not read her for awhile. Glad I found this one!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Great book. Very thought provoking. Made one think that our lives are fully impacted by things that are from another realm. This is a book all non believers must read"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Of course, I purchased this because I have read so many other books by this author. It did not disappoint me. The story line was rather bizarre, leaving me more on the side of disbelief than belief. It did offer a glimpse of a religious experience with the little girl and her &#34;wounds&#34; and quite convincingly pointed out differences between the &#34;believers&#34; and &#34;non-believers.&#34; I liked the way Ms. Picoult wove into the story the role of the church in attempting to prove or disprove the validity of the little girl's medical events. THe book has its share of suspense and intrigue."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved everything about this book. The subject really made you stop and think. The characters came alive for me. Well written ."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Loved this book, it is a wonderful story, for those who believe and those who question! Jodi Picoult writes so the reader can feel what the characters are feeling."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was an enthralling story with lots of twists. The book kept me wondering what was going to happen next all the way through. this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"What would happen if your child started having visions, quoted from the bible, developed stigmata? If you were besieged by the media and the public seeking miracle cures how would this affect your life? And if this tore your marriage apart and your husband wanted custody of your child, how would you cope? Picoult has taken these possibilities and created an absorbing story capturing the feeling of bewilderment and helplessness of Faith's mother, Mariah. To add interest and complication she adds the growing attachment to the TV religious sceptic, Ian who initially wants to expose the phenomenon as a hoax.But how do you end a story like this? It would almost seem that the miracles must be explained . . . . . but Picoult brings the story to a close which may not satisfy some - but for me it was the only way it could be left.I will keep reading Picoult's books (this is about the 5th I have read)."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have read most of her books but this one was a little to weird and hard to believe. Too much like scifi"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is surely one of her best books. Got me so absorbed in the characters & their story that Istayed up way past my bedtime wide awake because I was intrigued & wanted to know what happened next.This book was worth losing sleep over. A definite must-read!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love most of Jodi Picoult's books but this had some unrealistic characters and was quite predictble, The end (if you could call it that) left me disappointed.....She didn't let us know what happened to Faith just left you hanging wondering what became of the whole story line. I would have recommended it until the end but I was disappointed she didn't really end it. I thought I was missing pages. Very disappointed!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A story that makes something most people would perceive as fake, realistic. Then doubt is introduced skilfully and the ending is not predictable, which I liked.Sit in a quiet corner in comfortable chair as this is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book keeps you interested from cover t o cover.

I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has an uncanny way of showing there absolutely are two sides to every debate. Her characters are strong and pique your interest with their points of view."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is wonderful and, yet, emotionally draining, but in a good way. The characters were so real.I was simply overwhelmed with her writing. It was just a nearly perfect book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Another Jodi Picoult book that was excellent, I recommend this book and any of Jodi books. She keeps you spell bound."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"When I first started the book I really enjoyed. To much repeating, and it took to long to get point across."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As always, this is another thought provoking book with Jodi's twist and turns, keeping you interested until the very end!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked the different stories and views within the main story. Although the book has a religious tone to it, no religion is deemed right or wrong. There were a few parts were I had a difficult time staying interested- predictable or repetitive. Overall, good book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is the best book by JP that I have read so far. I found it next to impossible to put down. Spellbinding is not a strong enough word."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have never read any of Jodi Picoult's books. If the others are like this one, I will read them all!Not only did she keep my interest in the story line, she made me think and reflect upon my own faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult writes very well. She's a good story-teller and her novels always have a serious edge. They go deeply into some social concern and look at its effects on ordinary people."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Another fabulous book by Picoult. I could not put it down. One you will be thinking about for a long time after you finish."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thought id read all Jodi s books but i happened on this one on amazon.Loved this book,but then again Jodi Picoult never disappoints! Im looking forward to a new release from her soon!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The content of the book was unusual and not one that is normally dealth with in fiction, as God and religion don't make light reading, but this kept me interested and questioning until the end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I haven't read &#34;Keeping Faith&#34; as yet but very accessable and easy to carry with you. Easily read with adjustible font size."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love, love, love Jodi Picoult so I was really looking forward to reading this book. All of her books that I've read have a twist, so I kept waiting for the twist and trying to figure it out. As it turns out, this one doesn't have a twist. I felt the ending was anti-climatic and disappointing. I enjoyed most of the book though."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Enjoyed exploring the questions so many share about faith with an objective vantage point. Religion aside faith and doubt are universal."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Made me wonder about today miracles and how God works in out day in age. How deep a mothers love is and how it can mirror the love of our God.I really enjoyed this book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this book however it got a little long in the court room,I just wanted to find out Faiths outcome. Once the courtroom part started I could not put it down. It makes one really think if we all can hear from our God."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is a real page turner whether you're a believer or not! Jodi Picoult is a master storyteller. Seeing her name on a book is enough for me to know it will be a good read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Very good,but little too long.kept you interested. Book was easy reading but had a lot of characters to keep track of"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have read five or six books by Jodi Piccoult, and have enjoyed them all. However, in each one I find that it seems they are longer than necessary. This is true of this latest read, \\"Keeping Faith\\". I felt it bogged down in the courtroom chapters due to too much information that wasn't necessary. Also, I have some unanswered questions. Why was it that Faith could heal her grandmother and others in the hospital, but was only able to give a brief respite from Autistic behavior for Michael? Also, the ending just left me hanging. I like the twist endings Jodi Piccoult usually writes, but this one was not one of my favorites. That said, I really did enjoy the book and plan to read more of Jodi Piccoult. I would recommend the book to friends with reservations."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is my third Picoult novel and I have the fourth ready to start. I was riveted by this book and stayed up until 6:00 a.m. 2 nights in a row to get it finished. I LOVED it until the final paragraph. Then she lost me. I still give it 4 stars because she's an awesome writer, but I just didn't \\"get\\" the final scene. Maybe I'm dense, but I have mulled it over all day and still can't figure out what it all means in the end. Oh, well...I recomend Picoult anyway. After reading The Pact and Handle With Care, I ordered Keeping Faith and Nineteen Minutes and will probably read her entire collection. She is a wonderful writer and I'm happy to live in New Hampshire because I recognize a lot of the places she writes about!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was very happy that I bought this book. Once I started, I literally could not put it down, and I finished it in less than 24 hours despite having to work and to tend to my nine month-old son.What I liked about this book most is the development of Mariah's character. At the beginning, I just wanted to shake some sense into her, but it was nice to see her turn around, become stronger and fight for her daughter...Millie was also another of my favorite character. She herself never stopped believing that her daugher had it in her to not only become stronger, but be there for her granddaughter.However, I had some disappointment at the very end of the book. I felt a definite loose end, a sense of unfinish. It's like I sensed something else developping, and bam... the whole thing is cut off. This is why I did not rate it a full five star, which otherwise it would have deserved.All in all, this is a book that I definitely would recommend"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As always, Picoult chooses to write about controversial topics that may get your feathers up- however Keeping Faith is beautifully written. The story unfolds about a young mother and her seven year old daughter who experiences signs of Stigmata. While the family is Jewish- non practicing at that- the child experiences more and more symptoms which the doctors can't explain. Theories are set in motion where the public, and the father of the child believe the mother to be harming the child in order to get attention.As in all of Picoult's novels, there are court hearings and a lot of doctor/ lawyer dialogue, but in this story it does not detract from the situations.I found myself questioning whether I WOULD believe the child or not, whether I would be one of those persons standing outside her door, if I would ignore the newsbroadcasts on television. I am still conflicted in my answer.This book raises many questions in the mind- do you believe? Do you think someone would play a hoax like that? Do you believe the child really sees \\"the guard\\"- the image of God. Is God a woman, a man, a unick? (sorry, the spelling might be wrong on that one).Keeping Faith is a wonderful story- if not for the ever questioning of God and Faith, but even just for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi delivers another great novel with Keeping Faith. Faith's family is torn apart when her father is discovered with another woman. Soon after, she begins seeing visions of \\"God\\" and experiencing stigmata. To top it off, she also becomes a powerful healer. But there are skeptics who would try to uncover a hoax, namely Ian Fletcher, the celebrated if controversial tele-athiest. And caught in the midst of all of this is Faith's mother, Maraih, who tries to cope with the media scrutiny while being challenged for custody by her ex-husband. The religious details are great and the courtroom finale really delivers. Any fan of Jodi Picoult will enjoy this well-written book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"My very first Jodi Picoult story, and will not be my last -- amazing and beautiful, it definitely will carry you through any business trip... I travel frequently for business and airport time is never any fun. Thanks to this novel, I enjoyed my week of travel -- guaranteed to keep your interest while on the beach as well."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Since Faith has been having difficulties accepting her parents' divorce, everyone thought that her new imaginary friend, \\"her guard\\", was merely a coping mechanism. \\"Her guard\\" teaches Faith things about religion that she had no way of knowing otherwise. When her grandmother dies, Faith brings her back to life. That's when things become difficult. A religious following gathers outside of Faith's house. This crowd includes Ian Fletcher, a man who makes a living by investigating religious phenomenon and usually proving them to be hoaxes. The situation intensifies, leading Faith's father to begin fighting for custody. Faith's mother, Mariah, fights to keep her daughter, Faith, as well as to keep faith in her daughter and herself. Therefore the title is actually a very clever double-entendre.The characters are very well-developed, making this unlikely story seem to be very plausible. The vivid settings also add realism to the story. This absolutely enthralling story of Faith is almost impossible to put down. Congratulations to Jodi Picoult on her masterpiece, my favorite of all her books that I have read so far!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have read several of Jodi Picoults books, each one is different and reflects on what a great writer she is. One of the things I like the most about reading her books they do not go into a long detail but gets right to the point. It will be a sad day for for me when I have read them all."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Although I had to suspend belief at a couple of places, the book was riveting. I agree with another reviwer who said that her writing has gotten better over the years."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith is a magnificent novel for teens or adults that keeps you thinking to the very end. It's a book that you absolutely just can't put down. It keeps you interested from cover to cover. The main character, Faith, begins to believe that God is communicating with her. Jodi Picoult's imagery that she has created in this novel is absolutely amazing. It makes feel like you know Faith and her family. Faith trys to convince everyone around her that she really is talking to God. She keeps her composure while dealing with her mom's depression after catching her husband in the act of an affair for the second time. The characters come alive in this marvelous book, and it's almost like you can feel what their feeling and what they're going through. It's truly a fantastic book that can convince anyone that when times get hard, to just &quot;keep faith.&quot;"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"There are those authors that are fine writers and those that are fine storytellers. It's always a pleasure to come across an author that is endowed with both gifts. Keeping Faith is a highly readable, thought provoking look at religious dogma, family secrets and modern relationships. What would you choose to believe if confronted with the unexplainable? Can true religious miracles exist in this age of doubt? Picoult does not try to steer us in any one direction, just poses the questions and provides the fodder for thought and discussion. For that she gets 4.5 stars. My only negative comment pertains to the point of view, which jumps between a third person and first person narrative. I often found it confusing and rather offputting and would have preferred a consistent type of narration."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Stigmata. Issues of beatification. Spirituality. None of these are topics that would lure me to a section of a bookstore, no less to the cash register. Nevertheless, this compelling story of a girl who sees something -- maybe God -- kept me up until 2AM, and then back up at 5AM to finish it before work. At its core, this is a book about a relationship between mothers and daughters. Faith sees God. Faith's mother loves her daughter. Faiths grandmother loves her daughter. These three well-drawn characters cope with the adversity of the judgement of others, the adoration of strangers, and the accusations of the alienated with full human dimension and fine insights. The additional dimension of the catholic church struggling with the vision of God as female, fringe and mainstream rabbis offering talmudic (and eccentric) thoughts, the medical providers dealing with the unexplainable medical events around faith, and an atheistic investigative reporter provide the perfect adversaries to read a moving story of mother love and all of the forms it takes. This book is a great read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is one of my favorite Jodi Picoult books. I have lost my faith over the years and am not a real heavy faithful person. But this book really makes you think and evaluate things in your life. I would recommend this book to anyone... spiritual or not... you need to read this book even if its the only Jodi Picoult book you ever read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It's a pleasure for a reader to follow the development of style and substance of a writer. For me, reading each new work by this immensely talented author, has been a delight. KEEPING FAITH is the story of a seven-year-old girl who, suddenly, seems to see a &quot;guard&quot; (read god) that is invisible to all others. She seems to develop powers of healing that bring scores of people to camp on the lawn of her house (where she lives with her recently divorced, rather emotionally fragile mother). What ensues brings into play the exploitation of this child, the frenzy of the media with a &quot;hot&quot; story, with cameras and microphones at the ready, as well as actions and reactions from Faith's family - her mother (who needs a good shake for her wimpiness with her former husband) and Faith's feisty, gutsy grandmother. An interesting beautifully written book including a riveting court custody hearing and an ending that will keep you discussing the work long after you have completed it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have to agree with a lot of reviewers - this book was predictable and relationships weren't built properly. As I finished the book I felt the author barely had written anything original. So why did I like this book? Even though much of the plot has been done before - I think it's a good book club book. The author puts scenarios together that are great for discussion and reflection. The question of who is God and where is God in our own life is something this book doesn't answer - but seems to point out the need to have thought out answers for ourselves...."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have bought most of her novels. She does great character development; by the end of the stories, you feel as though you know the characters personally. She lets you take a look at the inside of different people's souls. Very spiritual and always enlightening."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"My first book by this author and I found it riviting. It held my attention all the way through. I enjoyed the developement of the relationship between Mariah and Ian. Although there were no real answers to the questions brought up during the story, everyone seemed to come away with their own answers. I didn't quite understand the very end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"...I was intrigued by the story of a little girl who begins seeing God. As a former religion scholar I found the subject interesting. The revelations continue as the reader learns the God being seen by the little girl named Faith is a woman. She gives the girl stigmata and the power to heal just by being near a person.The story is clouded by a lot of subplots however and some confusing narrator switches. Much of the story is told from the mother's point of view, but at times it switches to an omniscient narrator. The mother, Mariah, has some problems, mainly stemming from catching her husband in bed with another woman - again! A lot of attention is paid to Mariah's relationships and the careers of priests who have come to visit Faith. These passages were always dull to me, as I was much more interested in the child visionary.While this book does have a few problems it does have raise some interesting questions about religion. For example, can a 7-year old Jewish girl be seeing a female God and experiencing the pains of Christ on the cross? Does she have the power to heal? Or is all of this just invented by stress and the need for attention? Should she be taken seriously and venerated as a saint or ignored as a heretic? Is it right for this little girl to be exploited by the media and to have hundreds of cult members descend upon her house to worship her?Why 4 stars?: The story was an interesting idea and done well, but it could have used some trimming. This book rates high because of its questions and value in a discussion group setting. I'm glad I read it..."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have nothing new to say about this book that hasn't already been said by the other reviews. It was, in a word, fabulous. I, too, get turned off by books that are overtly preachy and try to shove religious beliefs of one kind or another down the throat of the reader, but this book wasn't like that at all. This book made you think. To me, if a book is highly entertaining, with engaging, believable characters I can root for, and also makes you think, then that book has got something special. THE PACT was the first book of Picoult's that I have read, and I loved it and recommended it to everyone who would listen. I then proceeded to buy, beg, or steal copies of all the other books Picoult has written, and KEEPING FAITH is the last of those that I've read. Along with THE PACT and PLAIN TRUTH, I consider it her best. She is one very talented writer and I hope she'll keep giving us thoughtful books about difficult subjects."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Picoult has done it again! I thought Mercy could not be topped...Mariah and her daughter Faith find their husband/father with another woman, sending both mother and daughter into a retreat of their own sort. Mariah reacted like most women; Faith, however, starts to see a &quot;guard&quot;, later to be called God. And from there, the story unfolds. Faith becomes a religious icon to some, a pawn in her mother's tactics to others, and plain fraud to the rest.As this story unfolds, I had a sure idea of what was to be found. But as chapters were read, I started to second guess myself. What really was happening? I could wait to get to the end, and when I did, I was still a bit surprised and even a little confused!Put this on your list of Picoult must reads."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Great book...lots of action, inspiration, religion, and emotion, especially for parents going through a divorce w/ young children. Hard to put down once you get into it, the imagination and innocence of Faith keeps you spellbound to the end!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just have to say that Jodi Picoult is one of the best authors I have ever read! Her writing style is perfect! I'm afraid I'll buzz through all of her books and won't have anything left to read!! I just found her books a couple of months ago and have already read 4 of them!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read other Jodi Picoult books, so knew this one would be good. I was not disappointed. While there were some techical/ legal errors, that did not distract from the overall book. For me the best aspects of the book are reflecting on how the mother juggles her own values and beliefs with how she believes her child should be raised. She honestly puts her child first in all her decisions. Reading this book was an enjoyable, heartwarming experience."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love Jodi Picoult's work. I really do. I was looking forward to reading this novel, scince I'd heard such great things about it.However, I just could not get into it. The writing was fine, but the characters were just so unlikeable and static throughout much of the novel. Miriah continues to deny that her daughter is hearing God. For some reason, this made me hate Miriah. (I guess this shows what a talant Picoult has- she can make readers feel such strong emotions toward a character.) Then there was Ian Fletcher- the teleatheist who denies the existance of God and is out to prove that Miriah is lying so that his show's ratings will increase. I hated Ian- he was a sneaky, cold, arrogant jerk- and I hated Miriah for falling for his [..]I wouldn't say this book is terrible, but it is not for everyone. There's nothing wrong with the story, but some of the main characters are just too horrible to spend time on."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith, by Jodi Picoult, was a very moving and realistic novel. I enjoyed reading this book very much. It seemed so real and was written so well th at I could actually see this happening. I never wanted to put it down, it just kept pulling me in farther and farther into the plot line. Half of the ending was predictable while the other half surprised me very much. The way the author wrote this novel was just so real and so normal and the Whites were such a normal family, but she wrote it in a compelling way and it truly amazes me that she can write about regular life in a way that you do not see in regular life; this author is gifted. Some parts of the book were utterly predictable, while others had me scratching my head and picking guesses from a hat.Some would argue that this book is for only the religious Christian, Catholic, or Jewish believers, but I would recommend it to all people. This novel really shows all views of all characters in the spectrum, it is not religious, it simply portrays people doing what they want and some are religious yes, but in real life there's always going to be someone who's religious and then those who are not; that's one of the reasons that I think this book is so close to home on so many levels for so many different people. Jodi Picoult is just stepping out her range of views and trying to give equal views. Although this book was somewhat confusing at several parts it would catch you up to speed soon after and I personally loved it, and I think I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith is all about how a little girl can speak to God. This book goes through good and bad times of this little girl's life after her parents get a divorce. That's when she began speaking to God. At first nobody will believe her. Then after she produces stigmata and cures a sick baby the whole world wants to meet little Faith White. Many people believe Faith, but others don't, like Ian Fletcher.Fletcher plays a big role in this book. He was out to destroy the little girl. Saying that her mother pushes her into saying she can speak to God. Maria White, Faith's mother, wants Ian to prove that Faith is lying, but in reality she knows her daughter isn't. Through many unplanned meetings Fletcher and Maria begin to develop feelings for one another. They end up sharing a cottage in Kentucky and then spend the night together at Maria's mother's home.While all of that was happening Colin White, Faith's father, was on his honey moon with his new wife in Vegas. He heard from the media that his daughter was talking to God. He went into an outrage and went home to try to get custody of his daughter. He got the best lawyer money could offer and they dug up a lot of dirt on why Maria should not have Faith. They even put a restraining order on Maria. As you read through the trial you begin to realize who's going to win.This book is your average plot driven story with an added in love story. Some happy ending some not. It's not a real life ending, which it should be. The writing is awesome, though. You can feel the emotions the people are going through and you want to be there to help them. It's a book you just never want to put down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just finished this book by Jodi Picoult. I read two of her books, \\"Mercy\\" and \\"The Pact\\", and although they were both very readable, I felt a little unsettled by the overall topics, and decided that I didn't need to read any of her other books. I'm glad I received \\"Keeping Faith\\" and decided to give it a try.What a great book! Faith is the 7 year old daughter of Mariah White, a 32 year old woman that is in the middle of a painful divorce. As she begins to settle into life as a single mother, her daughter starts to talk about seeing her \\"guard\\". Miraculous things start to happen to others when Faith is around. Of course, then the media and the clergy must investigate these claims, and create an ensuing scandal.The story is told in a very interesting way, through journal-like dated entries and frequent changes of point of view. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it as one of my favorites of the year. I now look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult's book &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; made me think about my own religious beleifs in a new light. It also taught me some things about different faiths that I didn't know. The amount of research that goes into her books is amazing. I highly recommand any book writen by this author."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! This the first novel I've read by Jodi Picoult and I must say, I was very happy with the choice. Keeping Faith is so great the pages practically move themselves. It's definetly a must read novel!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read several others The Pact, Plain Truth, and a few others before reading this one and its the best yet! I've got Mercy waiting for me to read and I cant wait to open the cover to the first page because I know it's going to be an immersing tale with rich characters and plotting...it'll be unputdownable just as Keeping Faith was."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is one of the first books I've read by Jodi Picoult and I loved it!I'm totally going to read it again after I finish the rest of my books and I would definitely suggest it to people to read!!GO BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As with Ms. Picoult's other books, the characters are well-developed and the story is very engaging. As a Christian, I need to add that I found this book very respectful of Christianity overall, despite the rants of the atheist character, and I don't believe most people with either a Catholic or Protestant background would find offense in this book. I have read three Jodi Picoult books now. Some of her endings are a little incomplete, but this one is definitely a page turner and will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I wish I knew how the book ended...I left it at a baseball game when I was beginning the final chapter!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I'll start this review by saying, like many other reviewers, I am a big Jodi Picoult fan. I have read about 7 of her books, and I just finished Keeping Faith. Normally, Picoult writes a captivating story that keeps me enthralled. But with this one, I was turning the pages just to get through it. I found the characters unlikeable, except for little Faith, and the story never really went anywhere. Most of the middle section of the book was unnecessary, as well as the random forays into the stories of a multitude of minor characters, including numerous religious clergy and a guardian ad litem we barely got to know. The story didn't get interesting until the last third, and the ending was a big let down. If you are a Jodi Picoult fan, I suggest skipping this one. She has far better books that will keep you wildly entertained, such as Nineteen Minutes, My Sister's Keeper, Plain Truth, and Second Glance."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am not a religious person at all, but this book is great.You will really connect with Faith and her mother.You can really tell Jodi Picoult did her research on this book.I would add SO much more but I don't want to give anything away!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The real question in this book is all about Faith - the child and who has faith in her and the mother and whether she can have faith in herself again. The grandmother is the real hero in this story, helping the neglected grandchild and always being there for her distraught daughter, who can't handle her husband's infidelities. Jodi Picoult seems to have a thing for weak women who buckle under the tragedies of life who have to find an inner strength and overcome their innate desire to hide from the world. Repetitive, but compelling."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Mariah White comes home unexpectedly with her daughter, Faith, and catches her husband with another woman for the second time. We start to understand that what she describes as a perfect relationship is far from it. It is also around this time that Faith starts seeing and speaking to God and performing miracles. Because of this Faith is taken by her mother, to psychiatrists, Rabbis and priests.Faith also attracts the media, including a famous atheist Ian Fletcher who tries to portray Faith and her mother a frauds. He becomes close to the family and it is in his presence that Faith suffers her first stigmata.A custody battle ensues as Faiths father Colin, believes she is in danger. It is at this point that we see Mariah as a strong character when previously she came across as weak and aloof.Keeping Faith was the first Picoult book I ve read. This was my second time to read this and I have to say I enjoyed it more this time round."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Bought book as a gift. It arrived at the receipent's house in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"One of my favorite picoult books. Everyone should read whether a religious person or not. Has controversial ideals that makes you think and question the world."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Good story, well researched. Compelling drama about a mother and wife who experiences great personal growth while her daughter goes through and increadible experience. Worth the read!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has another winner in KEEPING FAITH. I have read many of Ms. Picoult's books and I appreciate her rich writing style and her willingness to explore difficult issues and how regular people face them.In this novel, she explores the topic of faith - both faith in God and faith in the people we love. It was really ambitious to delve into the religious concepts she addresses here - a young girl starts to speak with God, who appears to her as a woman, and the girl both experiences the elements of religious ecstasy, including stigmata, and becomes a healer. Picoult handles all of these topics with respect, and she encourages the reader to come along on the journey of questioning, doubt, and eventually, faith.Setting these religious questions against the backdrop of a divorce and custody battle, Picoult grounds the story in the real drama and turmoil of a family. Ultimately, it is that love of a family that restores everyone's faith in each other."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is the first novel by Jodi Picoult that I have read. She can spin a tale! Well researched tale of a child going through extreme stress when her parents divorce. Well developed characters and themes. I had to tear myself away from the book! So . . a real page turner. Looking forward to reading her other novels."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I recommend this book not only for fans of Jodi Picoult, a genuinely gifted storyteller, but for anyone who enjoys sinking teeth into a great novel. Extremely well crafted and well written, it's a tough one to put down.It's not everyday that you read about a seven-year old girl who exhibits symptoms of stigmata, talks to (a female) God and has miracles follow in her path. And she's only the most interesting character of many. Picoult rounds out the story and broadens interest by making the little girl, Faith, of Jewish heritage. She brings in the Roman Catholic Church and a television atheist, a couple of high-powered attorneys, a philandering father and Prozac mother, along with a colorful, outspoken grandmom.A great read. Don't miss it.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am a huge fan of Jodi Picoult and have purchased every novel she has written thus far. I am never disappointed when reading one of her books; Jodi has this wonderful storytelling ability that grabs readers from the beginning and does not let go.Keeping Faith is the story of a little girl named Faith. After witnessing a scene between her mother and father that culminates in a divorce, Faith suddenly begins having conversations with an imaginary friend. Not a big deal, until Faith, who was not brought up in a religious household, begins quoting scripture. Could this 'imaginary friend' really be someone more spiritual? Maybe even God? When Faith begins to develop stigmata and heals others around her, people from all over the country flock to the town to get a glimpse of this miraculous healer.There is more to the story that that, of course, most of it dealing with the divorce of Faith's parents, custody arrangements, and how Faith's new-found celebrity plays into it all. I found this book to be one of the best of Jodi's books (right up there with Plain Truth, my favorite), and certainly one that would spark an interesting conversation in book groups.Jodi, you continue to outdo yourself with every book you write. I can't wait for new releases and more opportunities to delve into your world. Kudos on Keeping Faith -- a masterpiece in my opinion."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read all her books as I can. I did not like the story line in this one much. I do beleive in God, and some how this seemd to make fun of His works. altho I can understand where she was coming from with it. I loved her writing tho. she is one of my FAVS"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I normally enjoy reading Piccoult's novels. I have read three previous to this one- Change of heart (my first), House Rules, My sister's Keeper. I enjoyed reading all three so I'm always on the lookout for another one of Piccoult's novels. I picked this one up by accident and had an engaging beginning so I started reading it. The beginning is dramatic but then starts sagging in the middle when it becomes drawn out and boring. It picks up a little before the end and comes crashing down at the end. The ending was atrocious. It does not clearing answer the questions lingering in your head the entire novel and does not create a decent ending. Its as if she got tired and just decided to end it like that. If this is your first Piccoult novel, please don't think this is how all her novels are. There are much better ones!The story is of a little girl that begins seeing an imaginary friend \\"her guard\\" soon after the marriage of her parents disintegrates after the lousy father brings his mistress home (why) and Mariah, his wife finds them together. Mariah is characterized to have a low self-esteem and weak even though it does seem like she is talented and beautiful. Makes no sense, why a women with her beauty and talent would have such a low self-esteem where she cannot stand up for her and was sent to a psychoward against her will by her husband before the birth of Faith. Also seems weird that a family with so little religious beliefs name their child Faith of all names. I can understand why a little girl would suddenly have a imaginary friend. What I dont understand is how suddenly her \\"guard\\" is god and a female god at that. Her god is described to look like Mariah and at the end of the book, she hints that the god was Mariah. I was thoroughly confused by this. What is going on? The ending does a poor job of properly explaining Faith's friend and what exactly happened. By the end of the novel, Mariah does get stronger and stands up for herself in court when Colin, her ex-husband sues for custody of Faith. Colin, is just a horrible husband who ends up marrying his mistress who of course is pregnant with their child soon after they are discovered by Mariah. Then he gives her full custody, but suddenly he wants custody when he didn't seem to care before.Overall the novel had its moments but leaves too many holes in the story and does not develop the characters properly. A disappointment from an author who writes marvelous stories about controversial subjects then creates a twist at the end that I usually enjoy."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have read about half of Jodi Picoult's book to date and this was one of my least favorites. I enjoyed some of the book until about the last third of the book. I did not like the fact that the ending did not explain or wrap up the story in my view. The very last page was confusing to me and did nothing for me. I like the fact that in her other books, with the ending, at least there is some explanation of why the main character actually is doing what they are doing.I wonder where the author was at in her life when she wrote this and I would love to know why she chose to write the ending like she did. It almost doesn't seem like Jodi wrote the ending, at least not in the style she has written the endings in the rest of her books that I have read. While some of her other books may have been a bit predictable at the end, at least there was an explanation in the last couple of chapters that explained the rest of the three or four hundred pages and it felt fulfilling to have gotten so wrapped up in the depth of her characters that you knew exactly why they did what they did.I don't enjoy endings to books that make me come up with a conclusion. I want a cut and dry ending because I am not a creative enough thinker to make one up. If you enjoy books with open endings you may enjoy this book.This book will not spoil reading other books of hers though. I still think she is an excellent author so that is why I am not giving this rating lower than a three."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is interesting enough to keep your attention and keep you reading, but I was really dissappointed in the book, and wished I hadn't wasted my time reading it. It has some okay moments, but it's very sad and depressing. Some of the events that happen in the book, the author just didn't follow thru giving you more information about, just leaves it, and you're left wondering what happened after that. The ending I hated. I read the last two pages 3 or 4 times, and never really figured out what it said. The book was a good idea, but guess the author isn't very good. I do not recommend anyone reading this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Picoult novels never disappoint me. In this book, issues of divorce, affair, and stigmata take center stage on trial. I love how Picoult moves from first person to third person seamlessly, even within chapters. This story kept and held my attention the whole way through."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"So it took me about a month and a half to read this book. Usually that would mean that it was so bad that I just couldn't get through it. To the contrary, I thought it was a good book (not great, but good), just a little too slow for me. There were so many times I wanted to read, but I was bored with it, so I just put it down. I thought the story line was a good one, but there was so much unnecessary story added to it, that it seemed to drag on and on.I thought Ian's press conference at the end was a total cop out. The entire book I spent wondering what he was going to say, what people were going to think when they heard him say it. I am disappointed in the way that played out. I've only read one other Jodi Picoult book (My Sisters' Keeper), but I also thought that story had a cop out in it too - which was the ending. It seems when there is an issue that everyone is thinking about, Jodi decides to play it safe and instead of taking a stand one way or the other, she takes the safe road and doesn't make a decision. That bothers me a lot.I found Metz's cross exam on Mariah unrealistic as he was was badgering her and downright calling her a liar. Yet her attorney just sat there and hardly objected at all. Those questions, while it made for a nice story, never would have played out in a real trial. Mariah's attorney would have objected continuously and the Judge never would have allowed that line of questioning to continue. Also, the continuous adding of witnesses and exhibits at the last minute by Metz were unrealistic. Counsel submit witness and exhibit lists for a reason - exactly so that this \\"surprise\\" doesn't come up in trial. I doubt the Judge would have allowed either. In that regard, I found the Judge to be unrealistic.I actually found myself questioning Mariah throughout the story. When everyone was wondering if she was hurting Faith, I myself was wondering if there was something we didn't know. Even though we, as readers, saw first hand the miracles that Faith performed, and her stigmata, it still seemed so unbelievable to me, that I thought the only thing that made sense was that Mariah indeed was causing Faith to behave in such a way. But perhaps that's just because I don't believe in god and so it didn't seem real to me.I also thought there were sooo many characters. I couldn't keep any of the Preists straight and eventually stopped caring all together.In the end, I will never re-read this book. I'm glad I'm *finally* done. And I guess in hindsite the story added very little value to my life. I'm not going to sit here and think about it anymore and that's usually the sign that the book wasn't that great overall."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"KEEPING FAITH by Jodi PicoultThis was my second book by Jodi Picoult, and I will definitely be reading more by her. As with THE PACT, KEEPING FAITH centered on a controversial topic, something that would be seen in today's headlines. In KEEPING FAITH, there are two themes - one of a family being torn apart by infidelity and divorce, and the other one centering on the child that is caught in the middle. But this is not any ordinary child custody story. What happens here is something that is only seen in Catholic history books and other religious literature: Seven-year-old Faith is discovered to have powers that are akin to miracles performed by Catholic saints.Faith's news brings the media to their home town, everyone wanting to witness and spread the tale of this little girl who can bring back the dead, who is suffering from stigmata (spontaneous bleeding from the hands and feet), and can perform other miracles. Her mother Mariah is trying her best to deal with this plus deal with her broken marriage. With the help of her mother, Mariah tries to make sense of what is happening. When her ex-husband Colin finds out what is happening to Faith, he uses this to point fingers at Mariah, telling the world she is causing her own daughter to suffer and become a media circus. He files for custody, when only a few months ago he had walked out the door, not bothering to look back. Faith is torn between her two parents, and at the same time finds herself in the middle of this mystery about herself, not knowing why she is able to do what she does.KEEPING FAITH is a riveting, complex story that will keep the reader interested till the very end. It is what I definitely call a page-turner. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have now read three books by Jodi Picoult, and this is my favorite. It really raises some interesting questions about God, faith and religon. 7-year old Faith White starts seeing God and healing people after she witnesses her father in bed with another woman,which of course is very hard on both she and her mother. This book had a very interesting plot intersected with some equally as interesting sub-plots. Ms. Picoult does a wonderful job also of creating a cast of rich, unforgettable characters that totally engross the reader. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is that there are times when the point of view changes from that of the mother to an omniscient one, but even that doesn't really detract from the wonderful qualities of this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Plain and simple...Jodi Picoult takes my breath away. With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult just keeps getting better. Like KEEPING FAITH, the story of a little girl who seems to be a religious visionary, Picoult takes controversial topics and weaves incredible stories from them. KEEPING FAITH is not only a story of the love of a mother for her child, but an examination of the issues of religion, and the effects of media oversaturation. Picoult writes with an overwhelming grace, beauty and deep sensitivity, and her novels are always thought provoking. Picoult gives her loyal readers the gift they've always wanted with each new book. To those who have not had the pleasure of reading her books, pick up KEEPING FAITH. And then, do yourself a favor, and pick up the rest of her novels as well."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few \\"novels\\" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. \\"Pop lit\\" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I had several recomendations for this book and was anxious to read it. I was disapointed in the writing and the progression of the story. I found the story compelling in the beginning, but it lagged in the middle and turned too much into a ridiculous romance and less about the relationship between the mother and child. In the beginning, the mother was insecure, unsure of herself in her marriage and in her role of a mother...She was real and I related to her insecurities. However, as the book progressed and the more confident she became the less interesting and the less real she and the book became. I felt the character development was lacking and created an enviornment that I didn't really care about most of the characters, anyway. Finally, the medical information was innacurate, it could have easily come off a TV medical drama. I did find the concept to be interesting and it was a quick read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved everything about this book, from the main characters, to the storyline. It kept my attention and I was sad everytime I had to put it down! The only thing about this book that I was not pleased with was the very last page!! To me, it was sort of anticlimactic."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A friend chose Jodi Picoult's novel for our most recent book club. It honestly took me about 75 pages to get into this book, but once I settled in -- I had a hard time putting it down. I had never read anything like this book -- stigmata, a female God, etc. -- and it instantly intrigued me. I liked the concept of a mother believing in her child, no matter what. That unconditional love and support was what made me finish the book in one night. I would definitely read another book by this author!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"There are those authors that are fine writers and those that are fine storytellers. It's always a pleasure to come across an author that is endowed with both gifts. Keeping Faith is a highly readable, thought provoking look at religious dogma, family secrets and modern relationships. What would you choose to believe if confronted with the unexplainable? Can true religious miracles exist in this age of doubt? Picoult does not try to steer us in any one direction, just poses the questions and provides the fodder for thought and discussion. For that she gets 4.5 stars. My only negative comment pertains to the point of view, which jumps between a third person and first person narrative. I often found it confusing and rather offputting and would have preferred a consistent type of narration."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Stigmata. Issues of beatification. Spirituality. None of these are topics that would lure me to a section of a bookstore, no less to the cash register. Nevertheless, this compelling story of a girl who sees something -- maybe God -- kept me up until 2AM, and then back up at 5AM to finish it before work. At its core, this is a book about a relationship between mothers and daughters. Faith sees God. Faith's mother loves her daughter. Faiths grandmother loves her daughter. These three well-drawn characters cope with the adversity of the judgement of others, the adoration of strangers, and the accusations of the alienated with full human dimension and fine insights. The additional dimension of the catholic church struggling with the vision of God as female, fringe and mainstream rabbis offering talmudic (and eccentric) thoughts, the medical providers dealing with the unexplainable medical events around faith, and an atheistic investigative reporter provide the perfect adversaries to read a moving story of mother love and all of the forms it takes. This book is a great read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is my first book I have read from this author. I loved it, a true winner!!!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Another good read. I love the way Jodi can keep you wanting to read more page after page.

I would have liked a clearer ending, but it fit well with the book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Piccoult is the most amazing author! Her in depth research and portrayal of controversial subjects is astounding. Every one of her books seems as if she's telling her own story.

My rational brain enjoyed the explanations and my emotional the romantic side."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book kept my interest the whole time. I went on an emotional roller coaster and enjoyed the ride.

A good read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"this was just what i order and it came quickly. there were no issues with the timing or the product. just perfectly done."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and I couldn't put it down until the last page.Jodi Picoult manages to bring out 'the other side of the story' in her books. She makes you think about various life events from a different perspective."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Yes, Ms. Picoult is a wonderful, accomplished writer but this book may be my favorite of hers. The story is not just compelling; it's riveting and thought provoking. Her characters are complex and the dialogue rings true. Her subject matter, religion, is a brave choice which could alienate many people. But she is so deft and even handed that one never feels like she is sermonizing or judging. She is telling a fascinating story about a touchy subject, adroitly. I loved reading this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I had read many of her novels in paperback before i got the kindle this August.....this was a another great read from Picoult....I have never been disappointed in any of her novels!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love Jodi Picoult - once again she chose a really interesting subject and wrote compellingly.

Hope you enjoy as much as I did"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I sure was hoping this wasn't going to be over the top preaching at you, but it was not. I loved the grandmother in the book. This pulled at your maternal heart strings to try to think what my be best for Faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Very good story. Kept my interest. I really recommend this book for an intereting read. I like stories with a religion basis."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was one of the best books i have read. i have already recommended it to a friend as a good read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I would recommend this book to read to anyone who is a Jodi Picoult fan.

We don't have control, He does."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"'Keeping Faith' is about a little girl named Faith who has special healing gifts. It is about how her mother keeps her safe and what happens when people find out what she can do. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was fascinating to me because I live in Conyers, Georgia, where the Virgin Mary has appeared for years. Just like the main character, Faith, the woman in our town didn't ask for these apparitions, but accepted them despite great inconvenience from the general public. Can't wait to have my book club discuss this one!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is my second book by Jodi Picoult, The Pact being my first. Although I didn't find it as amazing as The Pact (one of my all time favorites), I couldn't put it down and really felt like the character development was so strong. I couldn't wait to see what happened and I felt like I could really understand what the characters were feeling. As someone else mentioned in a review, I was always questioning different characters throughout...the book kept me guessing. However, I have to say I was a bit confused by the end and was disappointed that I felt like I didn't really know what happened.I feel this book is well worth reading. It was not my first Picoult novel and it definitely won't be my last."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is one of Picoult's best. It is gripping from beginning to end. I found my self captivated by the characters, and by the story of Faith. This book opens so many doors, and leaves the reader to find answers, while drawing in several compelling themes, plots and sub-plots. As always, the characters are addictive, and their ability to become self aware and develop throughout the book is a tribute to Picult's talent. The ending, as always, left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As much as I love to read, it is a rare book that keeps me up reading until 4:00 in the morning; this one did. This is the second of Ms. Picoult's books that I have read. I was very excited to read it since I loved the first one so much. I must admit I was very turned off when I began reading Finding Faith because of the religious overtones. I am not a religious person and usually run in the oppisite direction of things that are. However, this book was so well written that after the first 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. The characters and story are just wonderful. The medical and legal research that had to go into writing this book are amazing. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Picoult's work and encourage everyone to check her out."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Yet again, Jodi Picoult has produced a novel that keeps your eyes glued to the book until it is finished. She is so adept at interweaving these characters in an intriguing love story that questions the tenements that most people take forgranted. My heart went out to Faith and all she was exposed to. I could visualize the hoards of people on her doorstep, all wishing for a part of the miracle child. Ian Fletcher is one of the most interesting characters I have encountered in my readings. He represents a philosophy that is probably a small part of everyone's psyche. In typical Jodi Picoult fashion, she forces you as the reader to draw your own conclusions about Faith and in turn, learn some things about yourself."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was really looking forward to this novel because the storyline really intrigued me. However, I couldn't get past 100 pages and even those were a huge chore. Picoult's writing was unimpressive. Her characters and dialogue were plastic. The situations were overwhelmingly derivative and farcical. I have no problem becoming immersed in another world or believing the unbelievable when directed by a capable author. In other hands, this could have been a great story. But with Picoult, there was no getting past the fact that this was fiction, and poorly written at that. Truly disappointing."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"There is so much to recommend this book -- a unique, unexplored topic, great writing, realistic characters. The story of Faith, a seven-year-old who suddenly seems to be talking with God and working miracles, keeps readers enthralled as we attempt to figure out if she's the real thing or a charlatan. But as with several of Picoult's books, there are glaring holes in the plot that beg to be poked at and prodded. While I'm willing to suspend disbelief in favor of a great tale, I'm only wililng to go so far, especially if the writer wants me to get lost in the story.A few examples: The idea that Ian would risk so much to hide his brother is ludicrous, as is the thought that a judge would bar a mother from her critically ill child. As is the thought that even if she were barred, any mother on this earth would be camped outside the hospital door, or no further than the cafeteria... And I have to say that I didn't particularly even like Mariah for the first half of the book, as she was too self-absorbed and pitiful for me to spend much time or energy on.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this novel had the potential to be a real masterpiece, a la Donna Tartt's The Secret History or The Little Friend, but instead lost much credibility by not paying attention to the details."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was going to buy this book, but after reading the reviews I have lost interest. God people are you really readers? No one wants to know what's in the book before they buy it. You guys review the book by telling most of the story."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It's also practical and resourceful, for beginning and experienced teachers. But unlike Iyengar, the Indian master, Mark Stephens writes as an American yogi steeped in Western culture yet completely absorbed in the wisdom of the East. This is also a work of scholarship, a rarity in a world of yoga long on bold assertions and short on evidence, careful reasoning, and even simple references"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I too was very disappointed by this book. Having read this author previously and enjoyed her books, I thought this one would be an interesting and enlightening read. No way. The story was flat. The romance reeked of romance novels (really, his hair was like a raven wing?). I was truly offended by that stuff. I wondered if we were experiencing a ghost writer and Miss Jodi has just become too successful."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love this book, well written and kept me reading till the very end. Totally recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is at her best in this novel about a mother's love for her child; a love that allows for the stretching of the heart, the mind, and the spirit. Faith is a young character who glimmers off the pages, and who brings new hopes and challenges for her single mother. The novel is also a reflection of the media-filled society we live in today, and offers poignant insights into the lives of so many people who appear on our news channels. A definite must-read for mothers, daughters and those who are looking to stretch their ideas on spirituality."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am a Picoult fan and have read several of her books. This book is great. Jodi always writes from the perspective of a woman with such clarity and imagination, its amazing. This book dives into the doubt of motherhood that we all face but many are too afraid to speak of."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"not my favorite Picoult novel. Got slow for me about halfway through and not a shocker ending which is what i like about her books."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi has quickly become one of my favorite authors. My teenage daughters introduced her books to me last summer and I have been devouring the books as fast as I can get my hands on them ever since. It is generally very hard for me to get into a new book but I have loved every one of them so far and this is one of my favorites. With the exception of the last page of this book, which is rather confusing, this book is full of rich characters and a wonderful story line that will keep you turning the pages wanting to learn more."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it is not as good as the others (Jodi Picoult) books I have read. It did not really keep my attention. I loved the fact that it was about faith, believing, understanding, love and guardian angels. It just seem kind of long and drawn out."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read almost all of Picoult's books, and this one is one of my favorites! The thought-provoking ending still has me wondering to this day!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi does it again. She captures people at their best and worst. Keeping faith is no different. I loved this book and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"\\"Keeping Faith\\" is a quick read that makes you think.The characters are interesting and not especially predictable. For example, Mariah White, mother of Faith, starts out as rather pathetic and annoying but comes into her own as the story progresses.There are themes of religion, custody, divorce and relationships that are developed and researched well and are not treated redundantly. The story forces the reader to think about various \\"what ifs\\" especially religious \\"what ifs.\\"What I liked best about this book is that it is not a rehash of ideas; I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this book! The characters were all well developed and the subject was perfect for a group discussion. My book club chose this book to read and although not everyone in the club liked the book, we all had plenty to say about the subject matter and the style of the author. She knows how to get her readers to really remember the characters, even though she had so many, she went in depth with each one."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith was an awesome and incredible book. I read this book at a very good time. I started reading it during Lent and finished it a few days before Easter, on Good Friday. Everything that Faith experiences in this book comes to life. I absolutely loved this book. The plot was awesome and some of the sudden changes in events were very surprising.This book is about a little girl who's father has once again cheated on her mother and the trials that she experiences throughout the divorce. When everything seems to be going wrong and the world turns its back on Mariah, Faith develops an imaginary friend whom she says is \\"her guard\\". Soon Faith begins to experience stigmata, perform miracles, and recite Bible verses that she has never heard or seen before. Pretty soon everyone thinks that Faith is seeing God and instead of being a normal child, Faith is turned into and international icon. Religious people, show hosts, and news crews are all outside camping in the Whites' front yard. The story goes on to explain about the people that help Mariah and faith get through this hard time when all they want is to be a normal family again. On top of Faith's visions, her father sues her mother for custody of Faith. The story is suddenly turned into a double situation. Mariah does everything she can to keep Faith safe and in her care. In the end everything turns out okay, but I won't spoil the ending for you.Because my family and I are very religious, this book really hit home for me. I could relate and understand what the child was experiencing. Although it is very hard to believe that something like this can happen, I feel as though I was in the book and believed in Faith and her visions. I could almost feel Faith's confusion, frustration, and her pain. This is a wonderful story for people to read. At Sunday Mass my priest was talking about The Passion and the Crucifixion of Jesus. When he started his Homily and began with that I immediately thought of the book that I was reading and I really thought about that book. This was an amazing story that I would sit and ponder about for hours on end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"i had recieved a gift voucher from a friend, and looking through the shelves at my local book store I could find nothing except for this book which caught my eye. I was interested, of course, so i got the book. I wasn't dissapointed. This is a story about a little girl who is seeing her &quot;guard&quot;, who might be god, as in THE GOD, christian god. It then brings up many questions to do with faith, right down to family. I read this before THE PACT, so I think it is better than that book. After reading the pact and this book, I realise that Jodi Picoult books are all the same, so if you read one, you've read them all. It has kind of scared me off reading any more of her work."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Imagine Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, watering down their startlingly conservative theology so as to make even less cogent points than in their best-selling Left Behind series. Then collaborating with the Lifetime Network to crank out 400 pages directed toward the lowest common denominator of American readers. This book hurts."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I can't say enough to sing the praises of Jodi Picoult. Her subject matter is rivetting. No matter your religeous beliefs, this is compelling. WOW!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The Pact is one of the most facinating books I have ever read. Keeping Faith was not even in the same league. The plot was hopelessly underdeveloped and the characters uninspiring. I have purchased Plain Truth and I think after reading it I will know if Jodi simply wrote a fluke with The Pact or she just experienced a weak moment with Keeping Faith. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It took longer than I hoped to receive the book, when it did come it was not in Large print which I ordered. So I have not been able to read the book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just \\"discovered\\" Jodi Picoult and I have not read anything that I found undesirable. She is a great author."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just discovered Jodi Picoult a few weeks ago -- read &quot;The Pact&quot; and then this one. While both were completely enjoyable, &quot;The Pact&quot; was a better, tighter story, I think. But I admire Picoult's willingness to jump into tough, controversial topics. I also enjoy her courtroom scenes a lot. One nit-pick with this story -- she has a 50-ish character recollecting how frightening Orsen Welles' &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; was for her and her husband. This is impossible because that radio broadcast was way back in 1938. It bothers me that an error this large made it by the editors. (Told you it was a nit-pick!)"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"In her book _Everyday Zen_, the author--Charlotte Joko Beck-made an interesting statement. When reality won't fit into the neat little box we've constructed, we must learn to make ABC. Make A Bigger Container. I kept hearing that phrase run through my thoughts as I read this book. After all, isn't that what Jodi Picoult is inviting us to do here? Or maybe it's more like Shel Silverstien's poem for children, &quot;What If?&quot; Here in _Keeping Faith_, it comes together with: What if...God will not be confined to the neat little package that I have made for Him? Can I think outside my box? What if God expects me to meet him on His Own terms? What if...the Almighty Lord of heaven simply showed up?Thanks, Jodi, for reminding us all of something important. Solomon said it well. The heavens, even the highest heavens cannot contain God. How much less my puny opinions about Him.But, actually, you mistreated me, in a sense. You see, I couldn't put your book down-reading one night until 4 AM-and then I had to go to work!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved it, couldn't to pick it up but didn't want it to end"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book made me reflect on my own religious connection. Ms. Picoult has a knack for picking topics for her books that are truly unconventional! I highly recommend this book to everyone - whether Christian or not."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The only Jodi Picoult book I've been unable to finish. It went back and forth and back and forth about the differences between the Catholic and Jewish faiths until I just shut the Kindle off and said \\"enough\\""},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"When I first began reading this book I didn't know if I could finish it.The subject matter pulled at my heart strings. After all the twists and turns and thought provoking subject matter, I couldn't put it down. I find myself wondering what happened to these characters after the book ended. Hint hint Jodi - ever think about writing a sequel :-)"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have recommended Keeping Faith to classes of adult students for its intriguing mix of current family dynamics, spiritual possibilities, and problem solving strategies. Ms. Picoult fascinates me and my students with real life characters who could be neighbors, but who experience life in ways that push the imagination. No problems getting assignments finished - everyone is spellbound and full of questions and opinions."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is a book that reminds us that the age-old question of \\"Does God exist?\\" cannot be determined by scientific method or measureable data. It relies on the faith of an individual, and sometimes faith enters when one realizes the consequences of NOT accepting by faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is one of the few books which I will add to my list of books in which I couldn't put down. I was intrigued from beginning to end. I've read other books by this author, and was somewhat impressed, but this read stands out as a favorite. I will certainly check out more books by Jody Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book does a great job of explicating the varying religious and anti-religious perspectives that are currently alive and well in American society. Beyond that, however, as usual, the author humanizes (and avoids demonizing) the various perspectives so that you feel empathy for the characters whose faith journeys may be different from yours. Kudos to Jodi for another great book!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"An excellently written story mixed with true life person and fiction. I understand this is her genre. Hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult, but just as captivating! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was a great book! It explores the depths of believing in things you can't quite see and the miracles of Faith. It asks you to question your faith in your child and the depths you would go to protect them. This is a heartwarming story of a child who sees God and the controversy caused by her healing! A must read for every book club!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jody Piccault is such an expressive writer. I truly enjoyed this book. I think it will appeal to anyone, no matter your religious persuasion or views. The heroine, Faith, is both realistically childlike and adult at the same time. I rooted for both her and her Mother the entire time and was not disappointed in the outcome of their situation."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am left with questions: Why does Ian need to keep his brother a secret? Why can Faith resurrect the dead but gives Michael just a few moments of lucidity? Why is the ending so obscure? (Ambiguity would be thought-provoking, but this ending backs away as if it is too afraid it might offend someone.) Why didn't the author research Cathloic dogma & doctrine more carefully? (I can only assume her treatments of Judaism, medicine & law are equally slapdash.) And finally - Must Picoult use so many cliches? ('Dog & Pony Show' appears 3 times in this narrative. Once would be too much.)"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked this story. It didn't go too overboard on the miracles but gave enough to help the reader keep his/her own faith. The characters were believable and likable."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Keeping Faith,right up there with Jodi Picoult's previous high standard,this kept me, glued to my Nexus tablet to the final word.This is the first time I've read an eBook, and I'm hooked.Thanks Amazon."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I enjoyed reading Keeping Faith and look forward to reading more books by Jodi Picoult. It was different from other books I've but the story was very interesting and was very well writen. Perfect length to develop characters and your desire to know what would happen next."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read several Jodi Picoult books and consider her one of my favorite authors, but I just didn't enjoy this book like some of the others. It gets bogged down in the middle with religious detail. I understand the need to have it in the story but it just seemed to go on and on. The mother-daughter relationships were very good, as was the relationship between Mariah and the atheist. I was drawn back in before the end, but I did a lot of &#34;skipping ahead&#34; through the middle."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"wonderful writing, intriguing characters, and a unique story line that is pleasantly unpredictable. this was another stellar book by picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Keeping Faith. As a person who was raised Jewish but has married into the Christian faith, I found the book to be thought provoking and appropriate for people of any religion."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Books written by this author are always entertaining and thought provoking. Thisbook wasn't any different and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was fantastic. Really makes you think. I like all her books, this one is at the top of the list. I tooBelieve we should listen to our kids. No one should judge. Enjoy the reading."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this story! Although Faith's mother and father are going through a divorce she is somehow seeing visions of God and reciting bible versus. Most puzzling of all she goes through Stigmata like symptoms. This book had me hooked from begining to end and I highly recommend it. I didn't think the religion aspect was too much for modern fiction. Picoult intertwined it beautifully. GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is such is sweet story.It is an intense story and slightly controversal topic like Picolt's other books, but has a lighter tone.I highly recommend it. It is one of the best and is also a good one for readers interesting in Picoult and wanting a feel of her writing style and story lines.Check it out, give it a read. Perfect any time and a great gift for Picoult and read lovers!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read The Pact last summer in one day, this took me a little longer but I also wasn't on vacation this time. Loved this book!!! Faith is an amazing child who bring her mother, grandmother and even her father closer together, despite the fathers infidelity. I felt anger towards the father, love for the mother and wanted to talk to Faith. I actually felt like Colin cheated on me - the hurt and stomach pains. Jodi Picoult did it again, I thought I was following a story on my local news. I just ordered another book of hers - can't wait for it to arrive."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"In the mist of my collection of serial killers, crime, suspense and political thrillers, I manage to pick up one of those wonderful, beautiful books, that leave you breathless and begging for more when it finishes.I absolutely loved this book by Jodi Picoult. Faith is a 7 yo girl that is having a very tough time going through her parents divorce. She calls upon her imaginery friend 'Guard' to help her through it. She is actually calling God and seeing her - yes, her! Through a number of miracles and other examples of Faith and her God, the media comes to town, bringing with it, believers, those who want to be healed, TV athiests and of course, reps from Rome.This is not just a book about Faith and whether God actually exists or not, it is cleverly entwined with Mariah &amp; Colin (Faith's parents) and they deal with the fact that their 7yo daughter might or might not be a visionary plus the fact they are divorcing and who gets custody of their little miraculous daughter.This book is so much more than what I can describe in a review, it is beautifully and cleverly written, the characters are wonderful and you want to keep reading just to see what happens next to Faith and her 'family'. This has definately got to be one of the best books that I have read for a very long time (that isn't a thriller) and I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"In a nutshell, &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; is about a woman, Mariah, coping with her failed marriage and her low self-esteem, while her daughter, Faith, begins having conversations with her &quot;guard&quot; (GOD). The adults (doctors, Rabbis and Priests) try to determine if Faith is having real visions or whether Mariah is inculcating some sort of sickness on her daughter for attention. Meanwhile, Ian Fletcher, the national charismatic t.v. Atheist intervenes in Mariah and Faith's lives (along with other news media) springboarding Faith into national scrutiny. This is a very interesting book to read. &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; probes our deeply held beliefs and our societal values (with a court room drama). It also has romantic twists and turns. Plus, it captures daily struggles we all have and what it would be like to be an instant celebrity. I would recommend this book to my friends, as friends recommended it to me."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Just great. If I just loved THE PACT, KEEPING FAITH has surprised me for its wonderful story and style. Jodi Picoult has done its best here, and I expect her to keep like that! A book I strongly recommend to everybody, I couldn't stop reading until I finished it! Religion and family ties are difficult subjects, but the book is just great and YOU MUST READ IT!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was one of those books that I just couldn't put down. I found myself thinking about it while I was at work, wondering what would really happen...and what the truth really was. This is the first book by Picoult I've read, and I plan on reading the rest of her work after this. My only disappointment was that we never really found out what happened with Ian's brother...or why Faith's friend left her in the end. Perhaps I'll just have to re-read this one right away to find all the parts I missed. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Thoroughly engrossing read that also provides food for thought. You find yourself rooting for a troubled, difficult character who finds herself in the midst of a media circus. It's just a wonderful book with some unexpected comic twists--the hunky tele-atheist, the smart-alecky Jewish mom, the squabbling Catholics....I loved it!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"What I liked best about Jodi Picoult's latest novel, KEEPING FAITH, was that I couldn't guess what was going to happen next. I read a lot and in general, novels tend to be fairly predictable. This one isn't - in part because the subject matter is so unusual; there exists no frame of reference for what might happen to a seven-year-old Jewish girl who is being visited by God (who happens to be female as well.)This is the second (and certainly not the last) of Picoult's novels I've read and I note a strong talent for concocting intriguing plot lines, interesting and real (if not always likeable) characters, culminating in rivetting courtroom scenes."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I didn't like the ending, I felt it left me hanging. I was ready to turn the page to read the next chapter when I realized it was over!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The plot moved slowly and in circle at times. It was lacking in real suspense and character development. I would like to have seen more variety in the setting."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I usually like Jodi Picoult novels although they tend to be predictable/similar to one another. This one actually wasn't because the ending made no sense. I've never written an amazon review before of a product but decided to review this book because it pissed me off so much. The ending is absolutely terrible. The book was pretty boring throughout and way longer than it needed to be but I kept waiting to get to the end so I'd finally understand why all this was happening. She explains nothing. It was so stupid. Waste of money."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Piccoult is one of my new favorite authors, and this books is not disappoint. I was looking for a book that kept my attention an this one definitely did."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again Jodi Picoult draws you into the story within the first few pages. The characters grab you and her story line once again is intriguing. A really good read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I haven't as yet found a Jodi Picoult book that disappointed me. She writes well and the stories are engrossing."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Picoult is always a heavy hitter, going right to the heart of often controversial subjects. This is a a good read,"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I can't get enough of Jodi Picoult!!! You think you know where it's going but then she changes it up. Highly recommend this one!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Gave up half way through this book after trying very hard to finish. I thought the mom was a whiner and the wanted more insight from the daughter and father. It fell flat too early for me to get to the end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Big fan of Jodi Picoult's work, especially The Pact. Keeping Faith was a great story which captured my attention from the start all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is my favourite author. I love this book a lot. I find the subjects she covers very interesting and I love how she ties her medical and legal knowledge into the story"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is such a wonderful inspiring story of love and faith. I had a hard time putting it down once I began reading. I highly recommend it to anyone. It restores your belief in goodness and unconditional love."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again Jodi brings in for discussion social issues usually left swept under the rug. Her writing is elegantly descriptive whilst keeping a tight rein on fantasy and is able to create believable characters to complete a plot of familial anguish together with legal parameters."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Storyline not to my liking. Might not recommend to others to readMy second Jodi Picoult book - not really a fan of her writing"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Easy read and kept me interested until the last page. My first book by Jodi Picoult but it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This whole book had me waiting to get off work or skip a meal so that I could read just one more page. The one thing I question about it though is; why did the priests and fathers never have a huge role in the end? They didn't come up in the case, or do anything really for me. Besides that, another book to keep me waiting for more"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I enjoy Jodi Picoult's books. This one was hard to put down. I would recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am a real Piccoult fan, and when this book was on sale I picked it up via my Kindle app. I had a tough time following the story line and it didn't seem as believable as some of her other stories. Jodi Piccoult's printed books usually have different fonts to distinguish which character is speaking. That did not translate thru the Kindle app, and it made it difficult to follow.I have read almost every book by Jodi and this is the first one that didn't wow me."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I did enjoy this book. I did rate it a 3 star as I did think some parts of the book dragged on. It is however not a bad read...it took me longer then most books to complete."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has penned yet another great read based on a controversial topic. Her books keep you in thought process of such controversial topics from all angles and give you even more insight to absorb and think about."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I do enjoy reading books by Jodi Picoult. She always finds a hot button issue and tackles it with just enough fictional, interpersonal story lines to make it an entertaining read. She always leave me thinking about the bigger issue at hand and usually very provacative topics. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is one of Picoult's best. It is gripping from beginning to end. I found my self captivated by the characters, and by the story of Faith. This book opens so many doors, and leaves the reader to find answers, while drawing in several compelling themes, plots and sub-plots. As always, the characters are addictive, and their ability to become self aware and develop throughout the book is a tribute to Picult's talent. The ending, as always, left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Despite being an atheist, I have always had a more-than-casual interest in people's beliefs. So, I picked up this book, interested to see how Ms. Picoult would approach the subject. I had read The Pact and really enjoyed it.This book was even better. I stayed up until 2am to finish it.I found a book that, although touches briefly on religion, is really about motherhood. Picoult describes motherhood as a religion. And from what I have read in this book and from my own experiences as a mother, with my own doubts, I have to agree. The title is perfect for this book. Because, at first you think that it is a play on words, relating back to religion. But mostly, I think it means exactly what it says...Keeping Faith...her daughter, at all costs. Mariah White explains it so well at the end when describing her feelings of motherhood. I was so moved. Picoult hits on so many real issues that a mother faces. I think that this is a great book for any mother, regardless of theistic beliefs."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"At first, I found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story.As with all Picoult books, this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn't easily breezed through, but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I loved it! Picoult did a wonderful job of making sure you felt like you HAD to know what happened next.This book really makes you think about God and peoples relationships with God. Something that is rarely done in modern literature.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ending leaves you second guessing as to what you just read and how you precieved the book up until that point. Which, depending on the person, could make it a better read or leave you confused."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I recently finished the book \\"Keeping Faith\\". I found the book fascinating to read, I had no idea where Ms. Picoult was going with the story, so I kept reading to find out. Although the book does not match my own personal beliefs, I enjoyed reading a story which challenged my pre-conceived notions, and made me think a little."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Fortunately I began Jodi Picoult's \\"Keeping Faith\\" on a weekend, because I couldn't put it down. Thanks to my daughter, who provided me with nutritional sustenance while I turned the pages, I was able to read the book straight through at one sitting. I have read all Ms. Picoult's novels, and this is her best so far.Mariah White, and her seven year-old daughter Faith, come home unexpectedly one afternoon, and surprise Colin White, husband and father, with his lover. Divorce proceedings ensue. Faith, understandably, is traumatized by what she saw and doesn't understand, and by the sudden separation of her parents. She finds comfort in an invisible friend, her \\"guard,\\" a seemingly benign female figure who calms her, and answers her painful questions.When Faith's beloved grandmother has a fatal heart attack, Faith brings her back to life by breathing into her mouth. Then she cures a baby dying of AIDS. It seems that her \\"guard\\" is God, and a female to boot. Faith has been brought up in a home where no religion is practiced. Her mother is a nonobservant Jewess, and her father, a non-practicing Episcopalian. She has never read the Bible or been taught to pray. Doctors convey that the resurrection of Faith's grandmother, and the healed infant, appear to be almost miraculous recoveries. There is no logical, medical explanation for their sudden improvement. A child psychiatrist, who examines Faith, is certain that the little girl is not psychotic, or making believe. Then Faith manifests stigmata.Out of nowhere, crazies rain down upon the house of Faith White, seeking to be cured, seeking to cure their curiosity, looking for a Big story, hoping to reach God by praying there, etc.. And Faith's and Mariah's lives are forever changed.Colin, alarmed for his daughter's welfare, blames Faith's visitation on his wife's past emotional instability, and seeks to gain sole custody of his daughter. A big name talk show host, Ian Fletcher, famous for his outspoken atheism, targets Faith and Mariah, bent on proving them fakes...with surprising results.The story builds in complexity and suspense. The characters grow and change, as do their relationships. The issues here are more about ethics than about God and religion. Jodi Picoult has proven to be a talented writer. She is at her best in this unique novel."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again, Jodi Picoult has written a masterpiece. One that not only keeps the reader enthralled but gets you thinking as well.Mariah White and her daugheter Faith have been through a lot but it is when they return home early one afternoon to find Mariah's husband in the bedroom with another woman that things really start to happen.This is not the first time that Mariah has gone through this with her husband but it is the first time that Faith has had to witness it. Mariah once again goes into a depression and Faith finds an imaginary friend to help her through the tough times. While imaginary friends are not unique, Mariah's Guard seems to be something entirely different. Shortly after the Guard comes to visit, Faith begins quoting the bible and is able to spontaneously heal people.This turn of events brings proclaimed aethist and anti-televangalist Ian Fletcher to the scene determined to discredit Faith and her supposed conversations with God.Along the way, Mariah, Ian and Faith must learn to trust one another, love one another and learn from one another as not only is Faith's health in question but Mariah's right to keep her child is questioned as her ex-husband takes her to court.All in all, there is more than one story written into Keeping Faith and how wonderful they all are. Jodi Picoult can write like very authors can - she keeps you on the edge of your seat while you fall in love with the characters and she makes then jump off the page as if you have known them for years.Her titles are always creative and have a double meaning which I simply love. If you enjoy Keeping Faith you should try The Pact and Harvesting the Heart - two of her other excellent offereings.Jodi is one of the most talented writers to hit the scene in ages - make sure to savor every last word!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is definately not the author's best work. I felt that the characters could have been more developed, and I would have liked to know more about Ian's twin brother, how his life changed after meeting Faith, and how it changed his and Ian's relationship. The ending was a major disappointment, but the worst thing about the book was the medical inaccuracies. I wasn't aware that you could give Tylenol and Advil intravenously, nor have I ever sent my intubated patients down to radiology in a wheelchair. I felt that my intelligence was insulted."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A mother's dream of a stable family is shattered when her husband cheats on her, he moves out, they get divorced. Their daughter FAITH develops an imaginary friend. Then there is a custody battle. That's the short version of the book.The book definitely keeps your attention & makes you want to keep reading. Does Mariah, who is shown as weak, become stronger? Who wins custody? You just don't know where the author is going : The only way to know is to KEEP READING. The most frustrating part was the ending. I've read the last page a few times and I'm still not sure how it ends. I think there were too many questions left unanswered."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"...But, there was something about this novel that left me scratching my head. From the very beginning of this story straight through to the not-so-shocking conclusion, I felt like I was hit with one \\"extraordinary\\" coincidence after another. This wouldn't have been a bad thing if they'd all manage to tie into one another by the end of the novel. Instead, it felt more like each piece was separate from the underlying message Picoult was trying to get across (whatever that was).It never felt like anything was fully fleshed out. I don't want to list too many examples because I don't want to fill this review with spoilers. But, the obvious religious angle, the miracles, the mother's history of depression and her later love affair with the teleatheist all played out for me in a giant muddle.I feel like there was a lot of potential here and I don't 100% regret reading it. However, it certainly left me wishing it packed more of the typical punch of a Jodi Picoult novel."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thought this book was wonderful! I wouldn't give it 5 stars because it's not the best written book I've read by Jodi Picoult, but it was definitely worth the 4 stars. It was a book that pulled at your heart strings!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Insightful! Keeps you always wondering and hoping for what is yet to come! Bodies Picoult is so thorough with her research."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Loved it,hard to put down,easy read. would recommend it to anyone who likes to read...give it a try.When you want to sit down and enjoy what you read this is it..."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I truly love reading Jodi Picoult, another wonderful read!! I am always looking for good books to read and I am always happy to buy one of her books because I know I will never be let down!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is a master story teller! She weaves characters together to hold your attention and you are never quite sure how it will turn out in any of her books. Keeping Faith is a wonderful story,and thought provoking for those who do not believe in a higher power. A must read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult's books are formulaic , but still manage to be interesting. I wanted an inexpensive book to read on my Kindle and this fit the bill."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have enjoyed Picoult's writing in the past and liked this one in general, but felt at times it was too descriptive. There were long sections that described things that didn't add to the story. I felt sometimes the story went sideways and not forward - just my thought. I like books to move a long once I am hooked. I will still read her again."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have read other books by Jodi Picoult which, even though beeing novels, give a much better picture of how much like real life their stories are"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Like always, Jodi Picoult has written a book that is fast paced, moving and makes you think. I couldn't put it down. She makes you feel for the characters."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"What a fabulous book, I enjoyed reading each and every page. It's stories like this that change the way you think forever. Great charactors, great writing, great story, GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago and it is one of my all time favorites. I didn't want it to end and after I finished it I couldn't start another novel because I didn't want to confuse the memory. Jodi Piccoult is definately one of my favorite authors and I think that this is her best book to date."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book has such an addictive plot. It's true that Picoult pulls you into a story and won't let you go until the end. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was truly amazing. I couldn't put it down. It really makes you think about things beyond your control. This was my second book by Jodi and I am in search of others. She may now be my favorite author."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This remains my favourite of Jodi Picoult's books. In fact, I've recommended it to many people and gave it as a gift to two friends for Christmas. It's a typical Jodi Picoult book - rich characters and a fascinating story that has many layers and implications. If anyone is looking for a good book to generate discussion at a book club, Keeping Faith would be a great choice."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Keeping Faith&quot;. I think the author truly enjoys keeping the reader in suspense. I found myself taking sneak reads at work because I was desperate to see what happened next. I always felt I had an idea of what was happening and only once I jumped ahead several pages to see if I was right. At the end Faith pulls a stunt that left me with questions.....did she or didn't she?"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is the 3rd or 4th book that I've read by Picoult and I think that this one is her best (all others do come in a close second though). Her characters are so real that you soon forget that you are reading fiction. I couldn't go to sleep last night because I kept wondering how the book would end (I ended up staying up and finishing it). I highly recommend this thought provoking book. It examines all of the main religions as well as the anti-religion movements. I plan to recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again, Jodi has taken a subject most would shy away from and created an amazing story of faith and redemption. A child torn between her parents. Her only solace is a friend, she of course is the only one who can see her guard. How many times have we talked to our guard (GOD)? Thank you Jodi for writing a story that makes us think."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I purchased this book for a friend who needs large print. She says the print is large enough for her to read and she is really enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thought this was an interesting book that provided some deep thought about religion today in our society. It is worth reading. Not the best book that I ever read, but definitely better than most of the other lighter books that I have read this summer."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Incredible book. This was one of my first Jodi Picoult books and it's still one that sticks with me. Fascinating subject as well as intimate looks at the characters. Picoult makes the characters real with fitting dialogue. I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this book. Very well written and I just couldn't put it down. Her books always keep you guessing as this one did also. I even had to Google and see how others interpreted the ending."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"She is an amazing author and her topics are meaningful. She is an amazing author and her topics are meaningful."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I tend to purchase ebooks that are on special, aren't expensive and they mount up and by the time I finally read them I forget why I got them in the first place.I liked this book. It took a while to get into it, but once I did I was very interested in what was going to happen next. It has a marriage collapsing, a woman who practically worshipped a husband who didn't deserve it. And a little girl who seems to have an imaginary friend....but ends up being much more."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I really enjoyed this book so much. It was a page turner. I don't think I quite understood the ending though. still pondering the last page."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is Jodi Picoult at her best! The dialogue and character development so drew me into the story, that I feel as if I knew the main character, Mariah White, and was agonizing right along with her as she overcame her fears and uncertainties in her battle to keep her 7-year-old daughter in the wake of a sudden divorce that rocked her world as well as her daughter's. I was gripped by the story as it twisted and turned. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, though it did allow the reader to draw some conclusions. I simply couldn't put the book down, yet I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is an awsome story by a great Author. I would recommend it to any one who likes Jodi Picoult books."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Not one of my favorite Jodi Piccoult books. A little depressing and strange. I would not recommend this book to Jodi Piccoult fans."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi's books are predictable (drama + court case) but I always enjoy her writing and find I always learn something new."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is an amazing writer. So talented and incredibly descriptive. Her novels will envelop you and make you keep turning pages into the dead of the night.."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. To believe I would have to be in Mariah's shoes, but in my shoes I can suspend belief and accept that things happen, whether we want them to or not and it is how we respond to those things that define us. I also like that while things can seem quite desperate in the short run, the long run always brings us beauty, wonder, and love that we may not have ever anticipated."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love her books. This was great! If you haven't started to read her books start now. They just get better."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi's writing is easy to follow, clear and concise. The story line is interesting and I just couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Very good read. I would reccomend to anyone wanting to read. It kept me interested from the start. A must read for all Jodi Picoult readers."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Love this book. Happy endings are the best. Such a good author. Read this. Good stigmata story. I liked it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Five stars because I couldn't put it down. Appreciated the character's religious beliefs thrown into the plot. Also appreciated the character's flaws and the way these flaws were woven into the plot. Good questions about faith and organized religion."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was riveted by this book. I imagine it will do the same for many people especially if they are more religious than I. I think the best part was the end, I actually kind of sat there a few minutes to really absorb it. I loved her other books but this is my favorite so far."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read just about all of Jodi Picoult's books, and while this one was pretty good, it was far from her best. I won't summarize the plot--many others have--but it bordered on being a romance, a genre I'm not crazy about. The courtroom testimonies went on and on and on and were too repetitive. Generally, I find Picoult's books absorbing from one page to the next, but wound up skimming a lot of the pages to get the plot moving along. I still give the book 4 stars for an intriguing story, but I expected more from this author."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked this book very much and have already recommended to friends who like to read Jodi Picoult...We have even discussed the ending and came to two different conclusions."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Love Jodi Picoult's books and her talent to write from each character's perspective! Found the book to be good but was disappointed by the ending! I was expecting a profound and thought provoking conclusion, but didn't get it!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Interesting religious story, it can make you wonder and believe. But the ending confused me, did it truly happen or not?"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Another tender novel by a talented writer. She has become one of my favorites. As usual, the ending surprised me. I like Jodi's style of writing, and find her novels easy and enjoyable to read. I've read almost every one of her books, and always look forward to a new book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is my first Jodi Picoult book (my library is always out so I had to buy it) and I loved it. I really enjoy books where religion or spirituality is part of the characters lives even though I am not currently affiliated with any religion. I was raised as a Catholic, so many of the ideas were familiar to me, and I appreciated the insights into the Jewish faith. But there was so much more to make this an interesting story: child custody issues and trial lawyers, TV and media aspects, family relations, love and infidelity. I can't wait for my next Picoult book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult fearlessly chooses the most difficult topics for her marvelously moving fiction. This time it's miracles, visions, mental illness, broken families, and charlatans of several stripes. Seven-year-old Faith talks with God and casually, even unwittingly, heals the sick. Her fragile mother, intensely loyal grandmother, and puzzled, wandering, but loving father all try to make sense of Faith's experiences and of the media frenzy that follows her, even as they tiptoe through the legal minefield of custody hearings. Picoult deals with the clergy, the TV hosts, and the egocentric lawyers with a deft hand as she gently unwinds the truth that is the foundation of this family's love. One of the best,in a field of excellent novels taking on tough subjects."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was my first introduction to this author, but not my last.From the momen that I opened this book, I opened my mind. i found myself imagining as a parent what I would do if my 7yo daughter told me that GOD was talking to her. I would like to think that I would beleive her and do whatever i could to protect her.This Mother did just that in the process learned some things from her daughter. It is a must read"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have been reading Jodi's books wayyyyy before she became so mainstream. I never bought this book though because the topic seemed really iffy to me. I just didn't see how she could pull off this topic and make it into a good book. After getting her newsletter though and seeing one of the characters would be in her new book, Change of Heart, I decided it was time to read it. I must say I'm so happy I did. As a Catholic I found it especially interesting. Don't let the topic fool you though like it did me. There is a lot of religion but underneath that is a great plot and story line. Really enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The second half of this book was really interesting reading... however, the beginning was very slow. I am novice to the beliefs/practices of Catholicism and Judaism, so maybe that is why I couldn't get into those parts. I am a true fan though of Picoult, and cannot wait to read the next!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It really makes you think about what could possibly be happening to this girl... and challenges what your belief is in Faith as a religion, or Faith wrapped up in this little girl."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Great book - hard to put down. Brings up interesting questions about spirituality and God"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A very, very good book and one that makes you really think about your own beliefs, those that are truly your own and those that you've simply accepted from someone else all of your life. It makes you think about the difference between the two. And it's a beautiful love story between a mother and her child...and that kind of love doesn't have an expiration date on it like most of the other types of love. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Although I tolerated this Picoult title better than THE TENTH CIRCLE, it was another one that I could have lived without. I just never connected to the characters, and couldn't get involved in the story like I did with MY SISTER'S KEEPER and NINETEEN MINUTES.I know others have read this book and loved it, and I totally appreciate their opinions! For me, though, this one just wasn't a winner."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked this book. I thought it was different to write a book about a child who sees and talks to God, especially since God is a woman. It was very predictable, but I didn't care for the very end, it just didn't make sense to me."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love this story. Couldn't wait for the evening to lay in bed and read the next chapter of the book!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book has everything a good Picoult book does - mystery, drama, courtroom, etc.The title is definitely a double entendre, but what I found most striking was the idea of faith itself. I read Change of Heart before this one, and now I see why everyone discussed the parallels of the two novels; however, I found this one to be quite different for one important reason - the ultimate question was never answered. I am guessing that Picoult wanted readers to decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is probably my fav. Piccoult book, it runs a tie with My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes. Piccoult definitely covers all her angles in this novel....I love the fact that Faith is\\"technically\\"Jewish, and has stigmata. It's beautifully written! Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was my first Jodi Picoult novel. After reading a while, I decided I would rather listen to this story. As an audible book, it's FANTASTIC! I couldn't stop listening, and ended up wasting an entire day just listening. I think it would have dragged on a bit if I had read it instead. I'm a very slow reader.What I loved about this book is that it's about \\"motherhood\\" and \\"religious beliefs\\" - two subjects that fascinate me. Picoult really gets one thinking about their own belief systems, and she validates everyone who believes in something. Even though this story is fiction, it asks, in a very realistic way, \\"What might happen if God came to visit a little girl?\\", and it answers it very well. The ending was quite satisfying. Although, I'd love to read a sequel to this book. I can't imagine that Picoult's other books could be as good, but, of course, I can't wait to read another one of her books. In the meantime, I feel proud to be a mom, especially when we consider that \\"God just might be a mom herself\\"."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"While I consider Jodi Picoult one of my favorite authors, this was not one of my favorite books by her. I feel like there were too many points she was trying to make, too many theories readers could make, that it just left me completely confused. I wish she would've just picked a scenario and gone with it, rather than leaving leaving it so open-ended! Usually, her books have ambiguous endings, but most of the loose ends are tied up in the last few pages, leaving readers with a surprising conclusion. In this book, I found myself reading, and re-reading, but still not sure of exactly what was going on.Spoiler alert:Did anyone else pick up on her saying her mom smelled like oranges, and so did God? I thought, surely Picoult was using that as a door-way into the MSP being the real explaination, but it was never brought up again. And the fact that her \\"God\\" was a woman seemed like it pointed to Mariah and the MSP, as well....especially when she said that she came at night. I was really expecting the ending to prove that the mother was doing something to her daughter, coupled with the healings and other events that were actually happening. THe self-inflicted diagnosis was believable, as well, but the ending left no clear determination of that, either.Also, I think I would've been more impressed by continued interactions with the autistic brother than the grandmother being resurrected, or random strangers being cured. It was such a secretive thing throughout the story; I would've really liked to see that story line played out more.Thought the steady stream of priests and such were just redundant and pointless. Did any of them actually even take the witness stand in the trial? Didn't make sense at all as to why those characters were so important.All in all, it was very dissatisfying, and I would only recommend it with caution to others. Maybe since it's one of her first books, she was still working on fine-tuning her skills as an author. I've read all but maybe 4 of her other ones, and have never been disappointed (no matter their similar plots, themes, etc). I'm glad I didn't read them in the order written, or I might've been turned off by this author all-together!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read this when it first came out and it will always be a favorite. Many times a book is read and then later donated, never to be read again, but I will never part with this one. Years have passed and I still remember Faith. Made me a Jodi Fan forever."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I honestly stumbled across this book and thought I would give it a read just to find my way around my new Kindle. to my absolute surprise I couldnt stop turning the pages. Keeping Faith is an excellent read and well researched at the same time."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again Jodi Picoult brings us a messy moral dilemma backed up with meticulous research that will keep you glued to your seat, tense one minute and feeling tear jerker tender the next.The story revolves around Faith, Mariah White's daughter, who begins to confide in an imaginary friend and to perform miracles. She says she can see a beautiful woman who is protecting her and who is full of light and makes her feel safe. Is she speaking with God?The situation spirals beyond Mariah's control, having the media stationed in front of her house and fighting over Faith's custody with her unfaithful and selfish ex husband.One begins to question if Faith is truly a case of a girl with Stigmata or just a troubled little girl seeking refuge from her parents'divorce?When it comes to matters of faith and religion, it's hard to know who to believe and this book will have you hooked until it's final pages."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A great book, easy to read. Kept me reading all the way to the end. Ciuldnt put it down with just wondering what was gonna happen."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved the mystery of this book. Every few chapters or so, I had it figured out until I read on and then I would figure it out all over again, only to be convinced that something else was happening. I still don't know what the answer is, maybe that's the point -- there are just some things that we can't figure out and religion is one of them."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"really an interesting book, if a little flat at times. the ending is a bit unsatisfying, i thought."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A very intriguing and thought provoking story. Try otherstories from this author such as The Pact and Harvesting the Heart...Ihave enjoyed all of this authors novels, however, the older titles are out of print and hard to find... END"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult continues to be my favorite novelist. Her latest novel, Keeping Faith, is a brilliant piece. I couldn't put it down! A must read for anyone who enjoys terrific literature. You might also want to try The Pact which is also by J. Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This story swept me away from the beginning. I was charmed by the premise. The delightful little girl with the \\"imaginary friend\\" or could she be talking to God? Very well written, very insightful. I found the mother to be quite unusual in her open-mindedness. I loved the quest she took talking to priests, rabbis, psychiatrists, etc. The ending....A-1."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Good book but i didn't really like the way it ended. I have read everyone of Ms Picoult's books, but this wasn&#8216;t my favorite!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It was not as good as some of her other books. Had a hard time getting into the plot but it ended okay"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Synopsis: When seven-year-old Faith finds herself caught in the middle of her parents' troubled marriage, she retreats to a silenced world where she finds herself her own \\"imaginary friend.\\" Faith's mother, Mariah, has little concern for this friend and thinks it's a normal thing for a child to go through this stage... until her daughter begiins reciting Bible passages, performing miracles, and experiencing stigmata.Review: First off, there is no doubt that Jodi Picoult is a great, accomplished writer. I've read almost all of her works. But I don't know if it's just me that don't seem to find any of her books that good. The writing is always good, yes. The plot is also usually very interesting and intriguing. But the delivery always seem to fall apart and fail. Of course, that is only my own opinion.With this one, I actually found myself quite bored towards the middle part of the book. Also, I felt like the characters needed much more development. There was a lot of potential, but it just fell flat for me.Don't get me wrong, I did not hate it. I'm just not raving about it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read this one after taking a small break from Jodi Picoult. Her books, no matter what order I read them in, just seemed to get progressively worse. But still, I began this one with a smile.I wasn't exactly impressed. It was just a book. Not tremendously horrible enough for me to rant about, and not incredibly fantastic enough for me to rave about.I just found the whole thing kind of anticlimatic. I get waiting for Jodi's trademark twist....but nothing. Did I miss it? Was it not even big enough for me to qualify a twist or was it simply not there?I just think that she honestly didn't know how to explain Faith, so she just left it hanging. No conclusive endings here. Just unanswered questions. The more righteous among you might say \\"well, life has unanswered questions, so I suppose she was just being realistic.\\" Well BOO. This is fiction, damnit! Make up some new fancy I-See-God disease if you have to!It would have been something different if I liked the characters more. Mariah was a twit and Colin was a tool. The grandma was spunky, but a little stereoptypical. Even though Faith was supposedly the entire reason for the novel, I felt distant from her. One thing I can't understand is why Mariah was chosen as first person POV, and nobody else was. It would just make more sense to me if Faith was in first person if anyone was. Oh,and the relationshop between Ian and Mariah...Can you say sappy? I can. Sap sap SAPPYBut the writing was good like always. Picoult sure knows how to make a sentence. Even though there was less \\"OMG. This quote is so good! So true! So powerful!\\" this time around.I shall conclude this review by saying I did not particularly enjoy this book, but it did provide distraction and allowed me to procrastinate my studying further."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Book arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. I would definitely purchase from again."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Hi...Received product in perfect condition in a timely manner. Excellent service as always. Thank you. Keeps me coming back."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this book. It is written like a typical Jodi Picoult book but it is definitely worth the read!!! I also received this book in a very timely manner. I got it very quickly and was very happy with the product when it arrived."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read four of Jodi Picoult's books and I definitely found this one to be the slowest. Parts were really interesting and other parts just dragged. I could definitely picture the setting, the characters, etc., but sometimes the details bogged down the plot."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult delivers - again. This book is fabulous and is a true page turner. While it is not as good as My Sister's Keeper or Nineteen Minutes - or her latest, Handle With Care, it is (in my opinion), a fantastic read. I continued to ponder some of the trademark questions that reading Picoult's books always create in me. Her books force readers to consider both sides of events, no matter how certain we are of our initial opinions and views."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Easy, entertaining book about a little girl's religious visions. It was interesting to read how the different religions interpreted her visions and how the general public became obsessed with her."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Too LongI don't like to judge an author by one book, so when I was disappointed with My Sister's Keeper, I decided to still try another one of Jodi Piccoult's novels and see what happens.Judging from her positive reviews and her success as a writer, I need to accept that maybe I'm just not a fan of Jodi's Piccoult's writing. Reading the summary of the novel certainly got my attention because the idea of a child healer was fantastic, but the novel was just too long. At about page 286, I found myself forcing myself to finish it. I skipped large sections, then couldn't take it anymore when, towards the end, the author repeated the whole novel through the court scene! For no apparent reason, people kept changing their minds with their beliefs in whether the little girl was a true healer or not. That was distracting and mentally exhausting.Then there was the inconsistent way that the child healed people. Sometimes she did it through touch, other times she healed by just being in the same room with people. I also feel that after Faith saw Ian's brother at the hospital, there should have been a little more development with that storyline, especially since Ian was one of the main characters.The mother struck me as an odd character. Protecting her child from the press didn't make her seem like a good mother, it made her appear selfish. I can understand her initial reaction towards the press, but it seemed to me that eventually, the mother would overlook the bothersome press and allow the greater purpose of the child's healing to work through people's lives. If the child could heal, it was obvious that is why God put her on this earth. It also bothered me that the mother would act so impulsively when putting her child on medication because Faith was seeing God. She didn't even hesitate to do so, which struck me as an unrealistic reaction. Since Faith didn't have behavioral problems and she wasn't hurting anyone, I would think that a mother would weigh more thought into placing her child on medication.I believe I would have enjoyed this novel much more if it was condensed into a shorter version."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read.It is very thought provoking.It's a wonderful book, and the characters all seemed very real.I ended up rooting for Ian and Mariah ^-^I recomend ALL of her books.

I could relate to the mothers protectiveness."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"While it was entertaining, some of it was kind of ridiculous... she was trying to play with issues of faith and doubt and miracles, but much of it really made no sense. I have read other books by Jodi Picoult that were far superior."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Could not put this book down, absolutely amazing story...one of her best.

But this one was not a subject matter I could get into."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thought it was very well written, however it started extremely slow and I didnt care for the ending.Keeping Faith: A Novel"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult once again left me unable to put this book down. Very well written about such a controversial subject - which of course is her specialty. She made you feel as if you were living within the family. Making you dislike some of the characters immediately and then turning it around so that you could see the \\"other side\\". Loved it!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith is a very poignant and well written book. While it does speak to the issue of God, and what each of us believes that to be or not to be, I think this is mostly a book about the relationship between mothers and daughters, and to a minor extent, between fathers and daughters. To what extent would you go to protect your daughter or to let her know you believe her and have faith in her? Would you be willing to go as far as to have others question your sanity and not just that of your daughters? Good side issues in this book include the workings of the hierarchies in the Catholic and Jewish faiths, the workings of the mental health system and the workings of the judicial and legal systems. This book makes you think on many levels. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I usually enjoy reading Jodi Picault. I read to the end and was disappointed.

Her books always lure you in and then you don't want to put them down."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just finished \\"Keeping Faith\\" by Jodi Picoult and as always hated to see the novel end. I've read all of her books and this was one of the best. A great read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Great book held my interest and did want to put the book down. Will read more of Jodie Picoult books."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As a Christian, I wasn't sure how this book was going to treat this issue. I don't want to give anything away for a new reader, but I was glad that the title is accurate - we are still \\"keeping faith\\". The characters of the story were fascinating to follow - the weak, yet surprisingly strong mother protecting her child, the child in the middle of a media frenzy, a father consumed with guilt, the anti-evangelist with an achilles heel - and all the other catalysts to the action. However, my heart went out to the mother of Faith, for her vulnerability seemed very real. I thought the author did a better job of creating her character, and the other characters were more wooden players created to cause her to react and reveal more of her inner strength. However, the story was very fascinating and kept me engaged to the end. It had a few surprises, so that I wasn't certain how it was going to be resolved. And the author allowed me to continue to believe that miracle do indeed still happen."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"\\"Keeping Faith\\" is an interesting book that includes multiple dynamics of a mother-daughter relationship when tinged with the reality of the unknown.

This book was hard to put down; kept my interest; and had me searching for time to continue reading. She kept me wondering how this story was going to end!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Really great, well-written book. This author has a genuine gift for taking a controversial story line and making the reader understand all sides of the issue. This particular book deals with the existence of God from the perspective of a child unfamiliar with the typical religious understanding - she's unbiased, not affiliated with any particular doctrine, and yet, she is the conduit of numerous miracles. As a result, her life becomes filled with controversy and this book is primarily centered around how she and her mother are impacted. The message to me was loud and clear - it brings home the idea that love prevails in all things. It will make even the doubting Thomas (that's me...) reconsider their perspective regarding the existence of a higher power in this crazy world.The author is one of the best storytellers I have had the pleasure of enjoying in many, many years. I would very highly recommend."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"An easy read with a good story line...keeps you guess til the end!

But I couldn't resist.It turned out to be very good mystery. And the emotions were so real-life. The characters were so real-life. However, the abilities of Faith is only something we could wish for. I bought the book because it was on sale and got a wonderful surprise."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I usually love Ms. Pocoult's books but though well written, the storyline was weak, the ending a big yawn. I hope she was just experimenting with this subject matter and it doesn't happen again."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keepying Faith is one of the best books I've read recently. The characters were well developed, and the mother's doubts and fears about her ability as a parent echoed many women's feelings about raising a child. It was a fast-paced story that i found hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good, positive story with some depth."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Well written. Kept me interested what was going to happen next. A little disappointed with the ending. Learned a lot about stigmatas that I didn't know before. Liked the idea of the story a Jewish girl who never had religion getting to know God."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Just finished Keeping Faith. I cried and cheered all the way through. Definitely a novel for every person who's ever loved a child. I valued the questions of faith and the innocence of a child. A 5 Star plus!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read this book in three days while on vacation. Though it is quite long, it is a good read that kept me riveted. A small child witnesses an act of betrayal on her father's part that sends her mother into a downward spiral. The child creates an imaginary friend whom she calls \\"The Guard\\". Someone realizes that the daughter is saying \\"God\\", not \\"Guard\\". Is the child really seeing God? You should read this book and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As always, Jodi Picoult's novel was a great read. Not the most enticing subject but Jodi has managed to make it an excellent read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"A marriage dissolves and suddenly the young daughter is talking with what appears to be an imaginary friend she refers to as \\"my guard.\\" As inexplicable things happen, print and TV journalists camp out on the edge of the property where the daughter lives with her mother. As things begin to run out of control, followers of the story and readers of the book are challenged to decide just what is really happening and what to believe. I enjoyed reading the story and assessing my beliefs as I read."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I enjoyed this book but thought the ending needed something more. It didn't seem quite finished...yet, Jodi Picoult always leaves the reader wanting for more. Can't wait to read her latest, \\"Lone Wolf.\\""},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I have read and I really enjoyed it. It is nice to see things from various points of view."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am enjoying this book. Make you think about the after life. The little girl talks to God(who is a female). She got that wrong. He definitly is a male."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"For those who wrongly dismiss any book printed in mass-market format, for those who look away when they approach the paperback section at their local grocery store, Jodi Picoult is one of those rare authors that seems to crop up in the libraries of both summer readers and literati.Sometimes writers try to write at a level that they feel mirrors the content. Dramatic plot leads dramatic writing, metaphor, pace, etc., but Picoult manages to let things speak for themselves, which doesn't take you out of the story. You do not observe the action, but connect to the characters and the relationships they share. It is also great that, despite her interest in controversial topics, she does not cast her vote, or make her opinion known. She is not interested in grandstanding, but uses the potential for drama to instead tell stories, real human stories that can stem from the issue.I won't get into the big religion debate here (and Picoult is respectful and truthful in the portrayal of everyone's beliefs), but to me, the crux of the novel is more about how far you take care of and accept the ones you love before you decide that you cannot deal with the situation anymore. In this novel, I am referring to Faith's \\"diagnosis\\". What is the breaking point for a parent? Also, depending on your faith, one could be a saint, or be locked up in the loony bin. Picoult explores both, not from a moral ground, but from the eyes of a parent.I also really resonated with her portrayal of those meaningless occurrences that pop out at you, during a time of sadness, and how they can become so memorable, bowl you over. There are so many perfectly telling moments that convey these things in Faith's story. Also great was the spectrum of beliefs demonstrated in the novel. Those \\"with religion\\" immediately accept Faith, others reject her simply because of gender issues, some reject her because she is Jewish, some embrace her because her vision is Christian.All in all, a great read, and an underlying current of suspense that more than turns the pages. It makes you hope for Faith and her family, and that they will be able to find happiness in whatever they, or anyone believes."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Still, I couldn't put it down but I was never quite comfortable reading it. I almost read it so I would be done with it and able to read another book. The ending...wasn't an ending, as far as I understood it. After reading many Picoult books, this wasn't my favorite and I hope she doesn't attempt this kind of subject matter again."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once I started reading I couldn't stop, along with Jodi Piccolts other books she is simply amazing. It opens your heart and you feel like you know the characters that your reading about. Love it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Outstanding!!!She writes with the understanding and sensitivity that few have. All teenagers should read this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It was a fun and unusual story. It was inspirational for any religion. Yes you can laugh at religion too. I loved it and passed it on to friends and family. Unexpected romance too."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"My first book by Jodi Picoult, will definitely not be my last! An intelligently written, beautiful story which I could not put down! Read this book! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Once again she's done it. I was very sorry when it ended!!! She dealt with a very difficult subject and made it very understandable. Awesome!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love Jodi Picoult's work.

I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Another winner from Jodi Picoult! Just great! Read it and \\"get it\\". Made me THINK...outside the box..."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I just finished the book. Not as good as \\"The Pact,\\" but interesting nonetheless. A bit unrealistic but though provoking...I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Mariah White thought her and her Colin's marriage was perfect, that is until she catches Colin with another woman for the second time. This time, Colin and Mariah get divorced, and their daughter, Faith, is stuck in the middle. Colin agrees to give custody of Faith to Mariah, but soon changes his mind when faith starts talking to God. Colin thinks that Mariah is hurting Faith, so he decides to take it to court.This book is about Mariah's struggle to keep her daughter, and cope with her divorce, and her ex-husband's sudden remarriage. Mariah knows Faith is seeing God, but she can't get Colin to believe her. So she has no choice but to fight for custody of Faith.This is great book that will not let you put it down until you finish. It is suspenseful right down to the final verdict. I would recommend this book to more advanced readers, 16-up. This book is similar to Jodi Picoult's other books like Plain Truth, My Sister's Keeper, Salem Falls, and The Pact, because it has a law case in each. This book is heart-warming, and will teach you how to love, and keep faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Annotation: For the second time in her marriage, Mariah White catches her husband with another woman, and Faith, their seven-year-old daughter, witnesses every painful minute. In the aftermath of a sudden divorce, Mariah struggles with depression and Faith begins to confide in an imaginary friend, which leads to reciting passages from the Bible, developing stigmata, and beginning to perform miraculous healings, Mariah wonders if her daughter-a girl with no religious background-might actually be seeing God. As word spreads and controversy flares, Mariah and Faith are besieged by believers and disbelievers alike, caught in a media circus that threatens what little stability they have left.Author Bio: Jodi Picoult grew up in Nesconset, New York. Her previous novels include \\"Plain Truth,\\" \\"Mercy,\\" \\"Keeping Faith,\\" and \\"The Pact.\\" Jodi Picoult received an A.B. in creative writing from Princeton and a master's degree in education from Harvard. The recipient of the 2003 New England Book Award for her entire body of work, she is the author of ten previous novels, including \\"Second Glance\\", \\"Perfect Match\\", and \\"Salem Falls.\\" Jodi Picoult's novels center on family, relationships, and the balance of love. Riveting plots bring to light questions and issues that remain with a reader long after the last page is turned. Eleven of her published books have been critically acclaimed.Evaluation: Many people have their own opinions of Mariah and Faith. When it came to the custody battle between Mariah and Colin, Mr. Metz took advantage of the fact that Mariah was institutionalized. He made her out to be a mentally unbalanced person, as well as an unfit parent. Many people as well as the media felt that Mariah was the one who made Faith pretend she was seeing God. Towards the end of the novel, Mariah won custody of Faith. Everything worked out for the better. Also, the curious people still didn't know if Faith was really seeing God or not, because everyone had their own opinions and beliefs about it.Overall, \\"Keeping Faith\\" is an extremely well written novel. Jodi Picoult kept me reading until the end. I just couldn't seem to put this novel down. It deals with love, heartbreak, judgments, battles, and religion. There are so many elements that keep the reader wanting to know what happens next. I love the fact that at the end, the people are left not knowing whether or not Faith was really seeing God. It just depends on your opinion or belief. I definitely recommend that everyone should read \\"Keeping Faith,\\" by Jodi Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Book was as advertised.

I know it was made up but it was a thinker."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I particularly liked the subject matter of the daughter's unusual circumstances and tying it in the way Picoult did.

Actually, I have found most of them to be very hard to put down. This one was different. The Mariah described in the beginning becomes a completely different person as the book goes on. There is way too much religious information in here that I found boring and unnecessary. Last but not least, I truly do not get the ending at all. I have read the last couple of pages over and over and I can't figure it out. Maybe it's subject to interpretation? Even so, I am lost.

I would highly recommend this novel to fans of Jodi Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith was a story that at times brought tears to my eyes and at others showed the good in all involved. As the story developed, I was drawn to keep reading. Faith, a young girl, is in the middle of a divorce when she seems to be hearing and talking to an imaginary friend. This develops into much more as Faith is involved in situations where people are healed if only for a while. It is how all adults around her deal with Faith that makes this such an interesting read.

I still like my lead characters to be strong. This character was week...always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She consistently made bad choices. However, her mother was feisty and I liked that character. Faith went through a lot to finally catch a glimpse of the type of mother she wanted and needed. The author gives a decent view of a woman finding herself and a daughter finally getting a mom."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Realy one of Jodi's best! Gripping from start to finish! You almost feel sorry for the villain at times, and doubt the hero! Good read! :-)"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I loved this book, couldn't stop reading it.

I have read several books by this author and have always enjoyed each one."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"the book hd its usual Jodi Piccoult twists and turns with the characters, overall a good book, and I liked the ending"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have just started reading this writer and I found this book to be an excellent story. Very well written and sensitive to all the nuances of different faiths."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has written a masterpiece. One that not only keeps the reader enthralled but gets you thinking as well.Mariah White and her daughter Faith have been through a lot. However, it is when they return home early one afternoon and find Mariah's husband in the bedroom with another woman that things start to fall apart.Mariah has had the aforementioned gruesome experience with her husband before, but Faith hadn't witnessed it until now. As her mother experiences another bout of depression, Faith finds an imaginary friend to help her through the tough times. While imaginary friends are not unique, Mariah's Guard seems to be someone rather unique. Shortly after the Guard comes to visit, Faith begins quoting the bible and is able to spontaneously heal people.Things take a spin toward disaster when Faith falls ill. There are various twists throughout the novel.Keeping the Faith is a beautiful and enthralling novel that will keep you turning the pages. I've been told that Ms. Picoult's novels are creative, engrossing and thought-provoking. Well, I loved this novel and I look forward to reading her other offerings."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It has been quite a while since a story has so captivated me as Keeping Faith has this past week. It is not a perfect book, there are some mistakes in terminology, however, the characterization and the plot more than make up for it. This is also a book with so many different levels, and it will not leave you after you read it. I have found myself contemplating the symbolism during the past couple of days, though I have already finished it.Jodi Picoult is a new author for me. Amazon's recommendations kept suggesting that I read one of her books. I do not regret picking up this one. I definitely plan on reading the other ones.If you are looking for a book that is plot-driven, but with depth of character and thought, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I get so happy when I make a selection for my Reading Group that really meets the needed criteria for a wonderful group discussion! &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; certainly fits the bill. The subject of this book first intrigued me, as did my interest in reading one of Jodi's books. I jumpd into reading the book thinking, I hope the storyline is not too contrite, too predictable and most of all not too &quot;science fiction&quot;. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the characters well developed and almost to the point that if I saw them walking down my street, I would recognize them. This book, in my humble opinion, involves three life changing factors: Faith, Trust and Healing. Having Faith leads you to achieving the trust in your relationships and that is which allows healing to occur. In this book, through the fast paced drama and constantly weaving plot structure, we are positioned in the lives of people who have lost their Faith, rejoin them when they are questioning and reclaiming it, and finally at its conclusion, observe them move forward in their lives acompanied by the healing which all were in search of. Our discussion is scheduled for September and I can hardly wait to discuss the characters, and the components of this novel. One question I will be asking is, What was the greatest miracle Faith performed? I am sure to get many differing responses!I cannot wait to read another of her books..I hope they are equally as entertaining and mind challenging."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"For Jodi Picoult fans this one is a must! Story keeps you involved and trying to guess the outcome until the last page. A great read!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The plot of this book immediately caught my attention. It's intriguing, controversial, supernatural; something to make people think. With a better writer, this could have been an extraordinary book! Unfortuately, it was painful to read.Rather than consistently following one character's perspective, the author switched points-of-view frequently and with little warning. For the most part, it was written in first person, present tense, but even that was inconsistent. Sometimes it was first person for Faith (the young girl) and sometimes first person for her mother or her psychologist. Sprinkled throughout were flashbacks that added very little to the plot. I rolled my eyes more than once at the trite dialog. Worst of all, I suffered through the book only to reach an inconclusive end. The final pages sparked more confusion than resolve.I didn't expect accurate or even consistent theology. I did, however, expect the author to be consistent with her story. I didn't want her characters to match my personal doctrine, but I think did expect the author to understand her characters' beliefs and explain them thoroughly. The end of the book simply highlighted how little the author knew about the world she had created.Final Thoughts: Painful and disappointing. The plot was fascinating, but the delivery was awful. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult writes Oprah-esque books, but while I stopped reading Oprah's choices because they got too depressing, I've kept reading Picoult. She explores interesting topics, and covers lots of perspectives. This is one of my favorites, dealing with the nature of God, the impact of the media, and the meaning of family. If you like Keeping Faith, check out Second Glance."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith is the first novel by Jodi Picoult I have read but it will not be the last. I already have an order in for two more novels of hers. This book kept me turning papges longer after my eyes were burning for sleep. It combined many elements of good story telling that will attact most women. Mariah's rat of a husband has cheated on her,twice,and had her committed to a mental institution. While she is keeping a tenuous hold on her sanity her daughter, Faith, develops an invisible friend who turns out to be God in a female form. Mariah's house is besieged by those who want to know more about Faith including Ian, a ferocious non-believer. Faith and her mother are subjected to investigations by the Catholic Church, the court system and the medical community. Mariah is a brave but flawed woman, as are most of us are. This story certainly has some improbable situations but the basic story is one that every woman can relate to. The extra ordinary situations add to the suspense. Ms. Picoult is a sensitive writer with a flair for twists and turns."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith is primarily a story about a young girl who suddenly starts seeing God and performing miracles. My impression was that readers would be allowed to come to our own conclusions about this (whether it was real, invented by Faith, invented by her mother for attention, etc.), but it doesn't work out that way: clearly, within the context of the story, Faith is healing people, experiencing stigmata and so forth. The story of how her mother Mariah, the local churches and the media react to this phenomenon is somewhat interesting, but hardly requires a book of this length.And the romantic side-story involving Mariah and the television atheist, Ian, is terrible. Can you say \\"wish-fulfillment fantasy\\"? I'm sure every middle class, newly-divorced woman fighting for custody of her child would love the ego boost of a rich, handsome single man falling madly in love with her for no apparent reason, but.... yeah right. It's unclear why he's even interested.I've read two Picoult novels now, to give her a fair chance, but don't kid yourself: the unique-sounding plotlines are really just a cover for poorly written melodrama and even more poorly written romance. Unless this is your taste in guilty-pleasure reading, I'd recommend moving on to books of real quality."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Such a unique premise... with wonderfully written characters.

I would remend it to everyone to read.I like to read stories about people."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I'm a big fan of this author. I believe this is one of her first books. I had a hard time putting it down just like all the others."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"For Faith White, being a firsthand witness to her father cheating on her mother, and then experiencing the ensuing divorce is just about the worst chain of events imaginable. Unsurprisingly, this seven-year-old's method of coping is to develop an imaginary friend, her \\"Guard.\\" However, when Faith begins to perform what appear to be miracles, such as bringing her grandmother back to life, Faith's mother Mariah and the other adults around her begin to wonder: could Faith's \\"Guard\\" really be God? Meanwhile, Mariah and her now ex-husband Colin fight for custody over Faith, and media attention for Faith's miracles grows like wildfire.Being a non-religious person, I was pleasantly surprised by the religious content of this novel. Stories about miracles can sometimes be pushy and persuasive in regard to a specific religion. Faith, however, is supported by both a Jewish rabbi and Catholic priest; her miracle is more universal. In the end, the story is really about hope, trust, and faith, as opposed to Christianity. Picoult's work is definitely not overly-preachy.However, I found the book to be slightly predictable. Unlike the surprising and interesting endings in some of Picoult's other novels, Keeping Faith pretty much ended exactly how one would expect; entirely happy and dull. I found some of the character's actions to be unrealistic and unsupported as well. All in all, Keeping Faith is a somewhat entertaining and fun read, although it is very light and a bit dull."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love this author's work and read her often. But often I notice her endings are weak and vague. This story drew me in form the first few pages. I couldn't wait to get the chance to read again. I got to the end and went \\"what?\\". I wont revel any spoilers but just don't expect any big shock or twist at the end. Just enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am glad that this was not the first Jody Picoult book that I have read - not sure I would have continued with her others...I have loved most of her other books that I have read. However, I felt that Keeping Faith left too many unanswered questions which made the events in the book unbelievable. The ending was very disappointing - it did not bring anything to closure, nor did it lead you to make any of your own conclusions.Sorry to say that this book was a let-down for me."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has truly mastered the art of writing addictive, thought-provoking, interesting fiction. \\"Keeping Faith\\" proves that she's getting even better at it. The book centers around a young girl who, after going through a traumatic experience and her parents' separation, starts having visions....or does she? Religious fanatics come from all over the world to camp on her doorstep in the hopes of being \\"cured\\" and her mother must deal with protecting her daughter, whether or not to doubt or believe her, and dealing with various characters, many of whom do not have their best interests in mind.Regardless of your religious beliefs, this book is fascinating and extremely thought-provoking. One could perhaps teach an entire human studies or religion course around this book. It touches upon some very interesting and important themes, and ultimately will leave an impact on the reader.I HIGHLY recommend this book and think it would also be ideal for a book club. Its one of those books you'll really want to discuss and hear others' thoughts/opinions! I also highly recommend \\"Nineteen Minutes,\\" \\"The Pact,\\" \\"My Sisters Keeper\\" and \\"Plain Truth,\\" all by Jodi Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"If you haven't read a book by Jodi Picoult, you really can't go wrong by picking one up- perhaps this, or \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", or \\"The Pact\\"- and giving it a chance. At worst, you will have your thoughts stirred, your perspective prodded, and come away with questions to mull over; at best, you will have found a new favorite author and can indulge in that terrific trek through all her other stories. She is wonderfully skilled at weaving multiple threads of a tale into a rich, emotional tapestry and I defy anyone not to notice the flecks of gold in the fabric of her words- those little snatches of insight into human emotions that leave you thinking \\"THAT is so true\\".This is the fifth of her novels that I have read and I have come to rely on her books for their addictive readability and emotional depth- the kind of stories where you are drawn in by the situation, fall for the characters and are provoked by the concepts that are proposed as you sweep, spellbound, through the pages. \\"Keeping Faith\\" did not disappoint.The story of a mother, and her child who, in the aftermath of her parents' broken marriage, believes she is seeing and talking to God is compelling from the outset. The religious, medical, legal and romantic furore that stems from it carries the novel along at a brisk, electric pace while the characters, painted in vivid, flawed and compassionate color, anchor it with humanity- fallible and all- and, not least, humor. It is a story that deals with God, religion, beliefs, the legal system, medical mysteries and the media, but ultimately it is about relationships and caring about these characters is crucial to the book's power. That is a job which I believe was very well done.The great thing about the novel is that the writing is not obtrusive or \\"showy\\". It does not flaunt itself and snarl up the story. Rather, it is somehow everyday yet elegant and strikes right to the heart of the matter. The author manages to craft calm, crisp prose about the fictional storm of emotion she has set in motion without sacrificing warmth. Simply put, it is a novel you can sink your teeth into, that goes down like a treat. In addition, if you enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, this P.S. edition has a good author's insight section at the end.All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a novel that they can immerse themselves in and finish with that smack of satisfaction at having read something great."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is a great story teller, but this book is not as good as My Sister's Keeper. It's a fun vacation read....you can't put it down.Mariah White and her ex-husband Colin have a custody battle over their child, because Colin believes that Faith, their child, is in danger. Faith has started seeing and communicating with God. She seems to have miraculously healed several people and has developed stigmata, wounds that correspond to those of Christ crucified. All of this brings a circus of media attention which in turn introduces other interesting characters and events.There are a few things about Picoult's writing that do drive me crazy. She overuses the phrase, \\"She/he stared at him/her, willing him/her to look at him/her.\\" Also, she includes unnecessary information that lengthens the book and adds nothing to the story. In this particular novel, the sections about the priests and rabbis interviewing Faith White are too lengthy and occur too much. However, Picoult is great at making the reader detest lawyers and the media.Although I gave it only 3 stars, I do recommend this book"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"If Oprah wanted an interesting book about a divorced woman, this should have been the one. For every predictable ploy in Open House, we have mesmerizing and unthinkable events unfolding in Keeping Faith. At the same time , the pain Mariah feels upon discovering yet another betrayal by the man she had built her life upon, is palpable to the reader. Jodi Picoult has incredibly managed to inject a plethora of issues in our present-day society :media manipulation, faith healing, the health profession, dirty tricks and otherwise of the legal profession, religious manipulations, our spirituality and concepts of divinity [to name only a few]. Throughout it all, a woman struggles to keep afloat, and ultimately defines what truly matters in her life. It is a fascinating journey, impossible to put down, and will definitely be a selection in my book club. An imaginative writer with fascinating topics!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I read this as part of an online book group. I thought it had some good motherhood themes, like the relationships between Millie and Mariah and then Mariah and Faith. I liked the relationship between Mariah and Ian. I didn't like the stigmata stuff and all of the uncertainity revolving around if it was true or not. I do look forward to reading more of Picoult's other works and have just decided that maybe this subject matter and I did not mix."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not up to the level of Jodi Piccoult's other novels. The storyline lacked believablity, the writing was poor, some of the characters were either cardboard cutouts or unrealistic (and one in particular was lifted from The Rainman), and the book needed serious editing. After the first 100 pages, I skipped large chunks in a valiant effort to reach the end. If I hadn't already read many of Jodi Picoult's other novels before this one, I would have thought she was a bad author. She didn't do herself justice with this one. She is capable of a lot more."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I wasn't sure that I would like this book when I first picked it up. I am not a very religious person, and religion is a big part of this book. But then I started reading it. I like all of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone, and have already to a few people!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Seven-year-old Faith is caught in the middle of her parents crumbling marriage and in much need of a friend to confide in. That is when her imaginary friend &quot;Guard&quot; steps in. Not long after, miracles start to occur around Faith, and this small town in New Hampshire starts to realize that Faith is not only speaking to &quot;God&quot;, but that her God is a woman.The faithful start to arrive on Faiths' doorstep in search of miracles; along with the media led by a card carrying atheist whose TV show thrives on disproving such hype. They are all found camping out, waiting to have a moment, or a word with Faith. In the mean time the custody battle between Faiths' parents flares up leaving her torn between them as well as more confused with each passing day. The complications heighten when this innocent child exhibits the bleeding hands of the stigmata, leaving the doctors completely baffled.Jodi Picoult is an author that will keep you coming back for more and will easily make a fan out of you. She takes a story and makes you question it every turn of the page. Something that may appear to be blatantly true is transformed into the totally unexpected, you will find yourself doubting just about everyone in the book at one point or another.I suggest another of this authors books if you haven't had enough, &quot;THE PACT, A LOVE STORY&quot; which is about a teen suicide, another great read. The end of every chapter leaves you wondering about the veracity of each characters statement. Sometimes she does it with just one word, turning your idea of things &quot;head over heels&quot; when you thought you had it all figured out. Picoult is a truly talented author and worth watching and reading, you will certainly be entertained."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As usual Jodi Picoult creates memorable characters and situations in this book. She explores the relationship between a mother, Mariah, and her daughter Faith, under extreme circumstances. At the beginning of the book, Mariah is very much in love with her husband Colin, despite the fact that he has been unfaithful to her and, at one point, has committed her to a mental hospital as the result of depression caused by his unfaithfulness. When she again discovers him with a woman, she goes into a tailspin and they divorce. About this time her daughter begins to spout scripture and relates coversations with God, who is a woman. When the girl begins working miracles, people flock to her in order to be healed. This unlikely scenario becomes even more complicated, as the girls' hands begin to bleed and the doctors cannot stop them. A custody battle ensues, and complications mount. Picoult's characters are believable, but the situations she puts them into are not, and this is what made the book less interesting to me. Hopefully, she will return to more realistic plots and will leave out the mystical aspects in future novels."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"In 380-ish pages that seem to turn themselves, Jodi Picoult makes readers stop and think about several issues as simple as mother-daughter relationships and as complex as God. Mariah White, for the second time in their marriage, catches her husband with another woman. The first time, she was pregnant with their daughter, Faith. The second time, Faith was with Mariah when Colin was caught in the act. The first time, Mariah tries to kill herself. The second time, Colin leaves and Faith's &quot;Guard&quot; shows up. The seven year old starts performing miracles, attracting media attention, develops stigmata and quotes the Bible, although she's never been subjected to it. Mariah tries to shield her daughter from the attention while trying to find out for sure what is wrong with her. The reader switches back and forth several times, wondering if Faith is seeing God or if her mother is seeking attention. The book ends with a custody battle between Colin and Mariah and the reader wondering how much &quot;Faith&quot; they really have and would have if in a similar circumstance. The book is filled with colorful characters, perhaps the best Mariah's hold-no-punches mother, Millie. A GREAT book that you won't put down, and won't forget after you do."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Mariah White catches her husband with another woman (the second time during their marriage), her 7 year old daughter, Faith, witnesses the whole ugly scene. Mariah goes into depression and Faith retreats to a world of silence until she begins talking to her &quot;imaginary friend&quot;. Mariah has little concern about the &quot;friend&quot; until her daughter begins reciting passages from the Bible, performing miracles and experiencing stigmata.Once the media hears of the little girl, they endlessly try to find out more, turning Mariah and her daughter's life upside-down.Mariah tries to find out what is happening to her daughter as well as shelter her from the frenzy caused by the media.Ian Fletcher is the newsman who broke the story about Faith and started out to expose her as a fraud. As he becomes involved with the White's, he begins believing that Faith may actually be God's messenger.The novel has several different themes...religion, media, and child custody.I have only read one other novel by Jodi Picoult, The Pact (excellent novel as well), but she is an auther whose talent is endless. She writes novels that are suspenseful, controversial, and powerful.Everything about this book works, the characters, the pacing and the plot."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As an avid Jodi Picoult fan, I was sorely disappointed by this novel. Normally, I can't put down her books while reading them, but by the middle of this one, I was only reading it so that I could finally finish it and move on to something else. It was unengaging at best, and just plain boring at worst. KEEPING FAITH tells the story of a young girl who has a special relationship with God. Page after page, Faith talks to God, Faith performs a miracle, Faith talks to God some more, Faith performs some more miracles, and ooh wow Faith knows things that she couldn't possibly know so it must be real! Not much else happened, save a custody battle toward the end, which was the only aspect of the book I actually found to be engaging. One of the frustrating things was that there wasn't much of a plot to this book. Essentially, after the first twenty pages or so, the plot is pretty stagnant up until the denouement, but the characters are all unsatisfied with things, and then post-exciting climactic stuff, things essentially return to exactly they were before, and that's the end.One of Jodi Picoult's trademarks are her twist endings, which are oftenaren't unexpected, but there was not one single thing about this novel that wasn't completely and utterly predictable. Insecure, self-loathing mother Mariah ends up falling for the \\"bad boy\\" atheist Ian. Shock. The worst thing about their relationship was that despite the fact that it was inevitable from before the two characters even laid eyes on one another, Picoult didn't bother to actually develop it. I'm normally a big fan of the bad boy type, and of relationships in which the bad boy falls for someone and finally opens up, but this didn't really happen here. Ian's a jerk one day, then sees Mariah and thinks she looks like an angel and suddenly he's a saint! His insomnia is also instantly cured by her radiant beauty! They're in love and want to live happily ever after, and of course along the way they manage to completely change each other's personalities for the better as well. This takes place over the course of a week or so, naturally.Nothing is more annoying to me in literature than relationships that aren't developed properly, and while we're on the topic of things that are annoying about this book, let's look at a few other things that just don't quite add up. It seems just a tad unfeasible to me how everyone immediately jumps on the bandwagon and thinks Faith is telling the truth and how much of a celebrity she becomes. If this happened in reality, the only media source covering it would be The National Enquirer. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" would not be covering the story unless Faith decided to sacrifice Paris Hilton to her God, and they certainly wouldn't be camped out on her family's lawn for months at a time. A final note of frustration was the fact that for no apparent reason, the point of view keeps inexplicably switching from first person to third person, which is just jarring enough to throw the reader back out of the story and confusing because it really doesn't seem to serve any purpose. By the end of this novel I was just left wondering what the point of it was."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult takes religion in her novel \\"Keeping Faith.\\" Mariah White and her 7-year-old daughter Faith return home unexpectedly one afternoon and find Colin White, Mariah's husband and Faith's father, with another woman. Colin announces he is leaving Mariah for the other woman, and shortly thereafter, they divorce. Faith is particularly impacted by the divorce and she begins to speak to an imaginary friend that she calls her \\"Guard.\\" Mariah doesn't think too much of it at first, but becomes worried and takes Faith to a psychologist. Over time, they come to realize that Faith's \\"Guard\\" is God. And God appears to Faith in a female form. The media swoops in on the story as soon as Faith performs her first miracle. She raises the dead. Then, she cures a baby who had AIDS. But Faith's visionary status takes a turn for the dramatic when the little girl begins to experience stigmata. Colin, thinking Mariah is somehow inflicting the stigmatic wounds upon Faith and that Faith is in danger, sues Mariah for custody of Faith.This novel was tremendously intriguing and I would have been more than happy to give it a 5 star rating, if it had not been for the ending. Usually, Picoult answers any questions and ties up all the loose ends by the time the reader reaches the last page. I don't felt she did that in this book. I still had many questions that were left unanswered at the end of the novel, making me feel disappointed by it.Overall, it was a great book and I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason. For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages. The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character. The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith. If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as \\"here is a story about faith\\" (p. 275) followed by \\"he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith,\\" (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I was very anxious to read this book, having heard over and over again what a great writer Jodi Picoult was. I must say, if this was not a book club read, I would have abandoned it. However, I plugged through it, hopeful that the characters would somehow become more likeable and the strange story lines would be tied up. Instead it just got worse. Does Picoult really think that her audience is so stupid? How predictable was it that Ian \\"the bad boy\\" would end up with poor victimized Mariah, whose child was inexplicably touched by God? How was it that all these brilliant attorneys and such never heard of the child abuse where the mother harms the child as an attention getting device? Haven't they ever watched 20/20 or read People magazine? The Catholic Church's involvement with this case was laughable; I definitely don't think Picoult is a Catholic. And what of all those people gathering around outside Faith's house, and coverage by \\"Hollywood Tonight\\". Unless Lindsay Lohan develops stigmata, this would never happen. I never could figure out why Ian was hiding his brother; was there something to be ashamed of there? The custody battle just lengthened an already tiring story. Did Picoult really think she was delivering some kind of thought provoking spiritual message? To me, everything was so obvious, it was really kind of stupid."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"1. I read the book during a VERY stressful period on my life so I did not give Keeping Faith the level of attention and focus I usually do with the books I read. My feelings about the story are very half-a**ed.2. I read the book back-to-back with another Jodi Picoult book, Perfect Match, and the repetitive themes in her writing pattern became so evident (the story is set around some controversial issue, the complexities of motherhood are the primary undercurrent to the story, there is a completely unforeseen twist within the last 50 pages of the book, and the ending involves a court room drama) that it took away from this book's entertainment value. Had I spaced the books out a bit, this would likely not have been the case.Anyway, this is the 4th Jodi Picoult book I've read and like I said before, this author has a formula and Keeping Faith follows it to a tee. In this case, the controversy is a little Jewish girl popping out Christian miracles like a Pez dispenser. Said miracles begin in the midst of a messy divorce between her cheating father and mentally unstable mother, and result in a media hailstorm right outside her front door. Throw a dollop of court room drama, a pinch of inevitable romance and a smidgen of plot twist, and you got a perfect Picoult prose! Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me this time.Rating: 3 out of 5 starsSuggested With: A long break from Picoult."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I am not one to rail against novels; if I don't like something, that's well and good, but I'd rather let others form their own opinions on things. I so disliked this book, though, I have been driven to say something to counter all the positive reviews. The novel is entirely trite and predictable. I could anticipate the events, the actions, what the characters would say (no shock when the Jewish grandmother would exclaim &quot;oye!&quot;) - even the last page of the book. Every hot topic was pulled out to drag in the reader: an affair, a divorce, an attempted suicide, a possible god-sighting, miracles, stigmata, love, good vs. evil, Christian vs. Judaism, exploitation, mental illness, gender empowerment, and a court room climax. Eye-rolling plot aside, it did not read well, either. The speaker would often shift from first person to third with a pattern that I couldn't pick out. Chapters would begin with feeble assertions (&quot;The Priest had never seen a crowd so large.&quot; or &quot;The Private Investigator had learned never to trust anyone.&quot; etc.) that sounded as if a high schooler was composing his first creative writing paper. The book screams for a Lifetime adaptation for movie of the week, and begs to be chosen for Oprah's book club (though it is not of that caliber). Spiritual novels about love and family can be a joy to read, but everything rang so false in this book that I'm still kicking myself for wasting time on it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"One of her best books. My sisters Keeper compares. The novel keeps you in suspense from the very begining. Highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Story was captivating. Story of a mother's fight for her child. A little unrealistic that a father who made no attempt to take child during divorce decides less than a month later to sue for custody without ramifications from new wife. Question never answered about whether it was an imaginary friend or God seemed to be a combination of a cry for attention and a real miracle. but a well written story."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Piccoult is my guilty pleasure! This book did not disappoint! I was up late, with a my original Kindle and a FLASH LIGHT reading reading-couldn't put it down. The characters were rich, and easy to identify with. A TRUE BLUE PAGE TURNER!!!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"It's one of the best, I simply cannot stop reading. Touching and thought provoking as we'll. I love the book."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book was amazing. It was well written as usual by this author. The details were spot on. I loved how even with such a tender topic she was able to make the characters just like any other person. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I really enjoyed this book , but the ending was anti-climatic and puzzliing. I have read most of Picoult's books. So. I am surprised at how the book just dropped off. Oh, well. Bit disappointing."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is the first Picoult book I've read, although I've seen two of the films based on her words: My Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth, and enjoyed both films. Keeping Faith is the first of her works I've read.I was totally caught up in the book. The POV -- shifting from 1st person to 3rd person -- took a bit to become accustomed to, but other than that, the book held my attention. As the trial got started, I literally could not put the book down.That said, I was disappointed in the ending. Maybe because I liked things to \\"wrao up\\" neatly. This surely did not wrap and nothing about it was neat. I have read 50-60 reviews from other readers, hoping to learn something from them about the ending. Without giving anything away, can anyone help me?What did YOU think about the ending?Thanks and happy reading."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I regret buying this book for my E -reader. I have read Jodi Picoult books before and enjoyed them, but this book was a lot of drivel. A most unlikely story with touches of Mills and Boon. A boring and unlikely plot which may be attractive to people believing in psychics, angels and the like, but I found it almost impossible to finish."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Doesn't try to answer any theological questions. Just a good story about a mother learning to trust her own instincts to protect her child."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult books make many of my friends stop & think about the subject matter. Had not read this author in many years. This one, as others, piqued my curiosity. I found a good balance of cynicism and blind faith."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Good fiction has a way of making you htink about issues in the context of the story and this novel succeeds in doing it.It is a rather basically simple stroy, husband cheats, wifes has reaction, a child is born, husband cheats agin.But it is not that simple. Mariah is the one who wound out that Colin is having an affair, and a child is also born, who just happens to be named Faith (maybe one thing that is a little too much, meaning the name in the context of the story?) And Faith sees things and exhibits ...well Faith. Sitgmata and other things that defy rather simple explaination to some degree.It is all interwoven to make a very compelling story that is a very good readin experience. She is able to avoid the cliches and other easy outs in a novel that could have been not good if poorly executed, but instead does a great job.Loved it."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"For a few years now, everywhere I go i see Jodi Picoult's books on the shelves, but never picked one up. Now that I did, I'm going to read them all!i absolutely couldn't put this book down. Faith is a seven year old girl who parents are going through a messy divorce and suddenly she starts talking to God or her \\"Guard\\". I don't want to say too much more about the plot since I don't want to give anything away, but read this book!I think that what I love the most about it is that your own perceptions of religion can influence what you think the truth in the book about Faith's experiences is (is she faking it or actually talking to God?) so two people could read this book and come away with very different conclusions. I was not raised in a religious background so found it very easy to relate to the characters, who are finding this all strange and unfamiliar and questioning their feelings on it throughout the novel. I still don't know what I think actually happened in the book!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"As a huge Jodi Piccoult fan, I was a little disappointed in this book. There was not the suspense that most of her novels involve and there was no surprise ending. It was well written, as usual, but it just wasn't my favorite."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"\\"Keeping Faith\\" by Jodi Picoult is the fourth book of hers I've read, and I have yet to be disappointed by any of her work. Her books are so brilliantly written engrossing pieces of fiction.Most of her stories intertwine family life with circumstances that aren't always the best of. In \\"Keeping Faith\\", a wife/mother, Mariah White, finds out her husband is once again cheating, and soon after he leaves, her 7 year old daughter, Faith, starts seeing \\"Guard\\" soon to be realized as God, and they are jewish.Enter Ian Fletcher, a tv evanglist type, that finds out about the case, and enters into their lives to tangle it upside down, back up again, and well, you need to read it to find out how it all ends up as I don't do spoilers.Some parts of the book got a little bit into the whole religion aspect, and I am usually not into reading about anything like that, but I nipped it in the bud due to the very gripping tale, and the wonderful writing, and I loved the book!Just another great selection for my book club that I highly recommend to anyone who likes her writing, and also, to anyone looking for something inspirational."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is simply fantastic.This was my first Jodi Picoult and I con honestly say it won't be my last.During the course of the book I was struggling with my own faith anf wheter or not I believed in God. This book made me realize that it can be a touchy subject for alot of people. Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Atheist, doesn't matter, this book will touch.Now, as for the story. WoW. It's so well written and constructed and following along is very simple and easy to do even with all the characters and plot points. Watching a mother's love being taken to the extreme, a world in need of something to believe in, and people all fighting so hard to save and protect a 7-year old girl.I was positively blown away by this book and would suggest it to anyone. If this book doesn't keep you wanting to read the next page, I don't know what will.Hope You Read It!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is a great read. If you enjoy Elizabeth Berg or Anita Shreve's books, you will LOVE this author.I felt that this book was very well written, it was insightful, funny, and painful at times. It held my interest for the entire book - no dull chapters or lapses.The storyline is about a little girl who is able to talk to God and it's told from her mother's perspective. The story is about so much more - how it affects her family, the media circus that ensues, and the power of love. It's really a complex plot but it's so well written, it just flows."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Little girl talks to God and gets stigmata. Interesting child custody issues and trial. Talented author. Would have been 5 stars, but some questions unanswered. For one, why'd the girl get so sick?"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I started reading this book at 11PM last night and did not put it down till 3:30 AM when I was finished. This is one of the best books I ever read, and I suggest starting this book earlier, so you are not up all night like I was. But it was worth it!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"When I first picked this book up, I was skeptical. From the back it sounded like one of those &quot;God is my savoir&quot; type books and frankly, I'm not a Christian so I almost didn't read it. I'm glad I did. Though it was a spiritual book, it kept me intrested and involved with the story the whole time. Definatly worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I've read four Jodi Picoult novels now and they keep getting better every time. Her writing is an extraordinary gift. Immensely readable, FAITH will keep you reading well into the night."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I'm not going to go into summarizing the entire plot, I think most reviewers have already done that for me.I have read several of Picoult's books in no particular order. I think the reason that I keep going back to her novels is that I read her 3 most riveting books first: The Pact, My Sister's Keeper, and Nineteen Minutes. I couldn't put those three down and I think I am still expecting the same from the rest of her books.Had Keeping Faith been the first Picoult book I read, I don't think I would have been in a hurry to pick up another of her books. As always, this one is needlessly over 400 pages long. I found myself reading the first 200 pages just to get through them. It does pick up halfway through and it's difficult to put down.Which leaves me on the fence...the first half drags, the second half is more of what I originally liked about her books."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book is well-written and a page-turner. It is also about a controversial subject as are most of the Jodi Picoult books I have read.Faith is a little girl who has been recently traumatized by her parents' divorce. She begins to talk to her 'guard', has visible stigmata and can bring the dead back to life. Even those who are disbelievers, believe that Faith is the real thing. The characterizations of Faith, her father, her mother, her grandmother, etc. are all very well done.The plot is interesting and tantalizing. This book has several sub-plots. The one I enjoyed most was the one about the mother's love interest. The book offers a lot of food for thought and is not one you'll soon forget.I highly recommend this book. However, don't start reading it right before you go to bed because it is a real page-turner and you're likely to be up all night!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I forgot how much I enjoyed this one. It's definitely one of my favorites - it still makes me tear up... especially the part with Ian & Michael. Of course, I am predisposed to crying over that sort of thing, but I really like the miracles that happen in it. It's a very great book and many things that occur in it foreshadow another one of my favorites of hers... which I will be reading fairly soon!The book also follows the court-case-ending formula that she so loves. And the drama of it all certainly works."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"The book was very good...I love the way that Picoult writes; however, the story could have been about 50 pages shorter and still had the same affect. I got really bored through the court case when everything was repeated from earlier in the story for the case. It just didn't move fast enough from about page 200 on. It drug a little bit for me.Don't get me wrong, I love the books of hers that I have read, but this one left a little to be desired."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This was a very good book. Very thought provoking and the character development was excellent."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"While I enjoy (greatly) Picoult's ability to make the reader see \\"the other side\\" of situations, I can't say that I'm a huge fan of her writing. I feel that she takes the easy way out when it comes to developing her central characters here. For example, I had a really difficult time getting through the beginning of the book -- Mariah had me wanting to put the book down and never pick it back up. The only word that kept going through my mind was \\"pathetic\\". It's as if the author wanted to draw her in the most extreme light possible so that her transformation throughout the novel would seem all the more amazing. If anything it had me wanting to shake the woman, were she real. I was literally uncomfortable while reading about her because I disliked her so much, to the point of disappointment that the author couldn't take the time to make her character a bit more believable and less over-the-top. I mean, going to far as to have her rubbing the dent in the carpet out with her sneaker at her mother's house? Okay, I get it Jodi, she's high-strung and afraid of anything being less than perfect. You don't have to beat me over the head..."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Picoult is an excellent writer and develops her characters better than anyone I've ever read. The story moves quickly, and is fiercely entertaining. This book makes you think, and wonder, and question. Picoult has a gift for picking these types of topics. Her books are long, but she researches her subjects well to give you a full taste of the topic, but she lets you make your own mind up. The book is redeming and you fall in love with Faith, and all the main characters. The ending builds quickly and then at the end you are left with questions. I am not fan of that, I like to know what the author is trying to tell me, especially when I am that commited to a book (long). I still think her book My Sisters Keeper is better, but it's a masterpiece.Read that one first if you have not. Keeping Faith is definitely worth while if not just for the beautiful writing of Picoult, but also for the journey she takes you on."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This book had SO much potential. It wasn't bad but it really wasn't about you thought it was going to be about. You thought it was going to be about if Faith could see God or not and go into detail about it. It wasn't about that much at all, it was about a custody case and the cathloc church. And even in the end, I had to read it 3 times to make sense of what she was trying to say. And it still wasn't clear. It was good, it had it's moments, but I'm still waiting for something."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},O={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",P,[(e(!0),t(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),y(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",O,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const E=d(F,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-1e92c9d4"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/23.md","filePath":"library/23.md"}'),W={name:"library/23.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(E)]))}});export{R as __pageData,j as default};
